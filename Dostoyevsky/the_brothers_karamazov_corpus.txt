alexey
fyodorovitch
karamazov
was
the
third
son
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
karamazov
a
land
owner
well
known
in
our
district
in
his
own
day
and
still
remembered
among
us
owing
to
his
gloomy
and
tragic
death
which
happened
thirteen
years
ago
and
which
i
shall
describe
in
its
proper
place
for
the
present
i
will
only
say
that
this
landownerfor
so
we
used
to
call
him
although
he
hardly
spent
a
day
of
his
life
on
his
own
estatewas
a
strange
type
yet
one
pretty
frequently
to
be
met
with
a
type
abject
and
vicious
and
at
the
same
time
senseless
but
he
was
one
of
those
senseless
persons
who
are
very
well
capable
of
looking
after
their
worldly
affairs
and
apparently
after
nothing
else
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
instance
began
with
next
to
nothing
his
estate
was
of
the
smallest
he
ran
to
dine
at
other
mens
tables
and
fastened
on
them
as
a
toady
yet
at
his
death
it
appeared
that
he
had
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
in
hard
cash
at
the
same
time
he
was
all
his
life
one
of
the
most
senseless
fantastical
fellows
in
the
whole
district
i
repeat
it
was
not
stupiditythe
majority
of
these
fantastical
fellows
are
shrewd
and
intelligent
enoughbut
just
senselessness
and
a
peculiar
national
form
of
it
he
was
married
twice
and
had
three
sons
the
eldest
dmitri
by
his
first
wife
and
two
ivan
and
alexey
by
his
second
fyodor
pavlovitchs
first
wife
adelada
ivanovna
belonged
to
a
fairly
rich
and
distinguished
noble
family
also
landowners
in
our
district
the
misovs
how
it
came
to
pass
that
an
heiress
who
was
also
a
beauty
and
moreover
one
of
those
vigorous
intelligent
girls
so
common
in
this
generation
but
sometimes
also
to
be
found
in
the
last
could
have
married
such
a
worthless
puny
weakling
as
we
all
called
him
i
wont
attempt
to
explain
i
knew
a
young
lady
of
the
last
romantic
generation
who
after
some
years
of
an
enigmatic
passion
for
a
gentleman
whom
she
might
quite
easily
have
married
at
any
moment
invented
insuperable
obstacles
to
their
union
and
ended
by
throwing
herself
one
stormy
night
into
a
rather
deep
and
rapid
river
from
a
high
bank
almost
a
precipice
and
so
perished
entirely
to
satisfy
her
own
caprice
and
to
be
like
shakespeares
ophelia
indeed
if
this
precipice
a
chosen
and
favorite
spot
of
hers
had
been
less
picturesque
if
there
had
been
a
prosaic
flat
bank
in
its
place
most
likely
the
suicide
would
never
have
taken
place
this
is
a
fact
and
probably
there
have
been
not
a
few
similar
instances
in
the
last
two
or
three
generations
adelada
ivanovna
misovs
action
was
similarly
no
doubt
an
echo
of
other
peoples
ideas
and
was
due
to
the
irritation
caused
by
lack
of
mental
freedom
she
wanted
perhaps
to
show
her
feminine
independence
to
override
class
distinctions
and
the
despotism
of
her
family
and
a
pliable
imagination
persuaded
her
we
must
suppose
for
a
brief
moment
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
spite
of
his
parasitic
position
was
one
of
the
bold
and
ironical
spirits
of
that
progressive
epoch
though
he
was
in
fact
an
illnatured
buffoon
and
nothing
more
what
gave
the
marriage
piquancy
was
that
it
was
preceded
by
an
elopement
and
this
greatly
captivated
adelada
ivanovnas
fancy
fyodor
pavlovitchs
position
at
the
time
made
him
specially
eager
for
any
such
enterprise
for
he
was
passionately
anxious
to
make
a
career
in
one
way
or
another
to
attach
himself
to
a
good
family
and
obtain
a
dowry
was
an
alluring
prospect
as
for
mutual
love
it
did
not
exist
apparently
either
in
the
bride
or
in
him
in
spite
of
adelada
ivanovnas
beauty
this
was
perhaps
a
unique
case
of
the
kind
in
the
life
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
was
always
of
a
voluptuous
temper
and
ready
to
run
after
any
petticoat
on
the
slightest
encouragement
she
seems
to
have
been
the
only
woman
who
made
no
particular
appeal
to
his
senses
immediately
after
the
elopement
adelada
ivanovna
discerned
in
a
flash
that
she
had
no
feeling
for
her
husband
but
contempt
the
marriage
accordingly
showed
itself
in
its
true
colors
with
extraordinary
rapidity
although
the
family
accepted
the
event
pretty
quickly
and
apportioned
the
runaway
bride
her
dowry
the
husband
and
wife
began
to
lead
a
most
disorderly
life
and
there
were
everlasting
scenes
between
them
it
was
said
that
the
young
wife
showed
incomparably
more
generosity
and
dignity
than
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
as
is
now
known
got
hold
of
all
her
money
up
to
twentyfive
thousand
roubles
as
soon
as
she
received
it
so
that
those
thousands
were
lost
to
her
for
ever
the
little
village
and
the
rather
fine
town
house
which
formed
part
of
her
dowry
he
did
his
utmost
for
a
long
time
to
transfer
to
his
name
by
means
of
some
deed
of
conveyance
he
would
probably
have
succeeded
merely
from
her
moral
fatigue
and
desire
to
get
rid
of
him
and
from
the
contempt
and
loathing
he
aroused
by
his
persistent
and
shameless
importunity
but
fortunately
adelada
ivanovnas
family
intervened
and
circumvented
his
greediness
it
is
known
for
a
fact
that
frequent
fights
took
place
between
the
husband
and
wife
but
rumor
had
it
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
beat
his
wife
but
was
beaten
by
her
for
she
was
a
hottempered
bold
darkbrowed
impatient
woman
possessed
of
remarkable
physical
strength
finally
she
left
the
house
and
ran
away
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
with
a
destitute
divinity
student
leaving
mitya
a
child
of
three
years
old
in
her
husbands
hands
immediately
fyodor
pavlovitch
introduced
a
regular
harem
into
the
house
and
abandoned
himself
to
orgies
of
drunkenness
in
the
intervals
he
used
to
drive
all
over
the
province
complaining
tearfully
to
each
and
all
of
adelada
ivanovnas
having
left
him
going
into
details
too
disgraceful
for
a
husband
to
mention
in
regard
to
his
own
married
life
what
seemed
to
gratify
him
and
flatter
his
selflove
most
was
to
play
the
ridiculous
part
of
the
injured
husband
and
to
parade
his
woes
with
embellishments
one
would
think
that
youd
got
a
promotion
fyodor
pavlovitch
you
seem
so
pleased
in
spite
of
your
sorrow
scoffers
said
to
him
many
even
added
that
he
was
glad
of
a
new
comic
part
in
which
to
play
the
buffoon
and
that
it
was
simply
to
make
it
funnier
that
he
pretended
to
be
unaware
of
his
ludicrous
position
but
who
knows
it
may
have
been
simplicity
at
last
he
succeeded
in
getting
on
the
track
of
his
runaway
wife
the
poor
woman
turned
out
to
be
in
petersburg
where
she
had
gone
with
her
divinity
student
and
where
she
had
thrown
herself
into
a
life
of
complete
emancipation
fyodor
pavlovitch
at
once
began
bustling
about
making
preparations
to
go
to
petersburg
with
what
object
he
could
not
himself
have
said
he
would
perhaps
have
really
gone
but
having
determined
to
do
so
he
felt
at
once
entitled
to
fortify
himself
for
the
journey
by
another
bout
of
reckless
drinking
and
just
at
that
time
his
wifes
family
received
the
news
of
her
death
in
petersburg
she
had
died
quite
suddenly
in
a
garret
according
to
one
story
of
typhus
or
as
another
version
had
it
of
starvation
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
drunk
when
he
heard
of
his
wifes
death
and
the
story
is
that
he
ran
out
into
the
street
and
began
shouting
with
joy
raising
his
hands
to
heaven
lord
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
but
others
say
he
wept
without
restraint
like
a
little
child
so
much
so
that
people
were
sorry
for
him
in
spite
of
the
repulsion
he
inspired
it
is
quite
possible
that
both
versions
were
true
that
he
rejoiced
at
his
release
and
at
the
same
time
wept
for
her
who
released
him
as

chapter
ii
he
gets
rid
of
his
eldest
son
you
can
easily
imagine
what
a
father
such
a
man
could
be
and
how
he
would
bring
up
his
children
his
behavior
as
a
father
was
exactly
what
might
be
expected
he
completely
abandoned
the
child
of
his
marriage
with
adelada
ivanovna
not
from
malice
nor
because
of
his
matrimonial
grievances
but
simply
because
he
forgot
him
while
he
was
wearying
every
one
with
his
tears
and
complaints
and
turning
his
house
into
a
sink
of
debauchery
a
faithful
servant
of
the
family
grigory
took
the
threeyearold
mitya
into
his
care
if
he
hadnt
looked
after
him
there
would
have
been
no
one
even
to
change
the
babys
little
shirt
it
happened
moreover
that
the
childs
relations
on
his
mothers
side
forgot
him
too
at
first
his
grandfather
was
no
longer
living
his
widow
mityas
grandmother
had
moved
to
moscow
and
was
seriously
ill
while
his
daughters
were
married
so
that
mitya
remained
for
almost
a
whole
year
in
old
grigorys
charge
and
lived
with
him
in
the
servants
cottage
but
if
his
father
had
remembered
him
he
could
not
indeed
have
been
altogether
unaware
of
his
existence
he
would
have
sent
him
back
to
the
cottage
as
the
child
would
only
have
been
in
the
way
of
his
debaucheries
but
a
cousin
of
mityas
mother
pyotr
alexandrovitch
misov
happened
to
return
from
paris
he
lived
for
many
years
afterwards
abroad
but
was
at
that
time
quite
a
young
man
and
distinguished
among
the
misovs
as
a
man
of
enlightened
ideas
and
of
european
culture
who
had
been
in
the
capitals
and
abroad
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
became
a
liberal
of
the
type
common
in
the
forties
and
fifties
in
the
course
of
his
career
he
had
come
into
contact
with
many
of
the
most
liberal
men
of
his
epoch
both
in
russia
and
abroad
he
had
known
proudhon
and
bakunin
personally
and
in
his
declining
years
was
very
fond
of
describing
the
three
days
of
the
paris
revolution
of
february
1848
hinting
that
he
himself
had
almost
taken
part
in
the
fighting
on
the
barricades
this
was
one
of
the
most
grateful
recollections
of
his
youth
he
had
an
independent
property
of
about
a
thousand
souls
to
reckon
in
the
old
style
his
splendid
estate
lay
on
the
outskirts
of
our
little
town
and
bordered
on
the
lands
of
our
famous
monastery
with
which
pyotr
alexandrovitch
began
an
endless
lawsuit
almost
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
estate
concerning
the
rights
of
fishing
in
the
river
or
woodcutting
in
the
forest
i
dont
know
exactly
which
he
regarded
it
as
his
duty
as
a
citizen
and
a
man
of
culture
to
open
an
attack
upon
the
clericals
hearing
all
about
adelada
ivanovna
whom
he
of
course
remembered
and
in
whom
he
had
at
one
time
been
interested
and
learning
of
the
existence
of
mitya
he
intervened
in
spite
of
all
his
youthful
indignation
and
contempt
for
fyodor
pavlovitch
he
made
the
latters
acquaintance
for
the
first
time
and
told
him
directly
that
he
wished
to
undertake
the
childs
education
he
used
long
afterwards
to
tell
as
a
characteristic
touch
that
when
he
began
to
speak
of
mitya
fyodor
pavlovitch
looked
for
some
time
as
though
he
did
not
understand
what
child
he
was
talking
about
and
even
as
though
he
was
surprised
to
hear
that
he
had
a
little
son
in
the
house
the
story
may
have
been
exaggerated
yet
it
must
have
been
something
like
the
truth
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
all
his
life
fond
of
acting
of
suddenly
playing
an
unexpected
part
sometimes
without
any
motive
for
doing
so
and
even
to
his
own
direct
disadvantage
as
for
instance
in
the
present
case
this
habit
however
is
characteristic
of
a
very
great
number
of
people
some
of
them
very
clever
ones
not
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
pyotr
alexandrovitch
carried
the
business
through
vigorously
and
was
appointed
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
joint
guardian
of
the
child
who
had
a
small
property
a
house
and
land
left
him
by
his
mother
mitya
did
in
fact
pass
into
this
cousins
keeping
but
as
the
latter
had
no
family
of
his
own
and
after
securing
the
revenues
of
his
estates
was
in
haste
to
return
at
once
to
paris
he
left
the
boy
in
charge
of
one
of
his
cousins
a
lady
living
in
moscow
it
came
to
pass
that
settling
permanently
in
paris
he
too
forgot
the
child
especially
when
the
revolution
of
february
broke
out
making
an
impression
on
his
mind
that
he
remembered
all
the
rest
of
his
life
the
moscow
lady
died
and
mitya
passed
into
the
care
of
one
of
her
married
daughters
i
believe
he
changed
his
home
a
fourth
time
later
on
i
wont
enlarge
upon
that
now
as
i
shall
have
much
to
tell
later
of
fyodor
pavlovitchs
firstborn
and
must
confine
myself
now
to
the
most
essential
facts
about
him
without
which
i
could
not
begin
my
story
in
the
first
place
this
mitya
or
rather
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
the
only
one
of
fyodor
pavlovitchs
three
sons
who
grew
up
in
the
belief
that
he
had
property
and
that
he
would
be
independent
on
coming
of
age
he
spent
an
irregular
boyhood
and
youth
he
did
not
finish
his
studies
at
the
gymnasium
he
got
into
a
military
school
then
went
to
the
caucasus
was
promoted
fought
a
duel
and
was
degraded
to
the
ranks
earned
promotion
again
led
a
wild
life
and
spent
a
good
deal
of
money
he
did
not
begin
to
receive
any
income
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
until
he
came
of
age
and
until
then
got
into
debt
he
saw
and
knew
his
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
the
first
time
on
coming
of
age
when
he
visited
our
neighborhood
on
purpose
to
settle
with
him
about
his
property
he
seems
not
to
have
liked
his
father
he
did
not
stay
long
with
him
and
made
haste
to
get
away
having
only
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
sum
of
money
and
entering
into
an
agreement
for
future
payments
from
the
estate
of
the
revenues
and
value
of
which
he
was
unable
a
fact
worthy
of
note
upon
this
occasion
to
get
a
statement
from
his
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
remarked
for
the
first
time
then
this
too
should
be
noted
that
mitya
had
a
vague
and
exaggerated
idea
of
his
property
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
very
well
satisfied
with
this
as
it
fell
in
with
his
own
designs
he
gathered
only
that
the
young
man
was
frivolous
unruly
of
violent
passions
impatient
and
dissipated
and
that
if
he
could
only
obtain
ready
money
he
would
be
satisfied
although
only
of
course
for
a
short
time
so
fyodor
pavlovitch
began
to
take
advantage
of
this
fact
sending
him
from
time
to
time
small
doles
installments
in
the
end
when
four
years
later
mitya
losing
patience
came
a
second
time
to
our
little
town
to
settle
up
once
for
all
with
his
father
it
turned
out
to
his
amazement
that
he
had
nothing
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
an
account
even
that
he
had
received
the
whole
value
of
his
property
in
sums
of
money
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
was
perhaps
even
in
debt
to
him
that
by
various
agreements
into
which
he
had
of
his
own
desire
entered
at
various
previous
dates
he
had
no
right
to
expect
anything
more
and
so
on
and
so
on
the
young
man
was
overwhelmed
suspected
deceit
and
cheating
and
was
almost
beside
himself
and
indeed
this
circumstance
led
to
the
catastrophe
the
account
of
which
forms
the
subject
of
my
first
introductory
story
or
rather
the
external
side
of
it
but
before
i
pass
to
that
story
i
must
say
a
little
of
fyodor
pavlovitchs
other
two
sons
and
of
their
origin
chapter
iii
the
second
marriage
and
the
second
family
very
shortly
after
getting
his
fouryearold
mitya
off
his
hands
fyodor
pavlovitch
married
a
second
time
his
second
marriage
lasted
eight
years
he
took
this
second
wife
sofya
ivanovna
also
a
very
young
girl
from
another
province
where
he
had
gone
upon
some
small
piece
of
business
in
company
with
a
jew
though
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
a
drunkard
and
a
vicious
debauchee
he
never
neglected
investing
his
capital
and
managed
his
business
affairs
very
successfully
though
no
doubt
not
over
scrupulously
sofya
ivanovna
was
the
daughter
of
an
obscure
deacon
and
was
left
from
childhood
an
orphan
without
relations
she
grew
up
in
the
house
of
a
generals
widow
a
wealthy
old
lady
of
good
position
who
was
at
once
her
benefactress
and
tormentor
i
do
not
know
the
details
but
i
have
only
heard
that
the
orphan
girl
a
meek
and
gentle
creature
was
once
cut
down
from
a
halter
in
which
she
was
hanging
from
a
nail
in
the
loft
so
terrible
were
her
sufferings
from
the
caprice
and
everlasting
nagging
of
this
old
woman
who
was
apparently
not
badhearted
but
had
become
an
insufferable
tyrant
through
idleness
fyodor
pavlovitch
made
her
an
offer
inquiries
were
made
about
him
and
he
was
refused
but
again
as
in
his
first
marriage
he
proposed
an
elopement
to
the
orphan
girl
there
is
very
little
doubt
that
she
would
not
on
any
account
have
married
him
if
she
had
known
a
little
more
about
him
in
time
but
she
lived
in
another
province
besides
what
could
a
little
girl
of
sixteen
know
about
it
except
that
she
would
be
better
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
than
remaining
with
her
benefactress
so
the
poor
child
exchanged
a
benefactress
for
a
benefactor
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
get
a
penny
this
time
for
the
generals
widow
was
furious
she
gave
them
nothing
and
cursed
them
both
but
he
had
not
reckoned
on
a
dowry
what
allured
him
was
the
remarkable
beauty
of
the
innocent
girl
above
all
her
innocent
appearance
which
had
a
peculiar
attraction
for
a
vicious
profligate
who
had
hitherto
admired
only
the
coarser
types
of
feminine
beauty
those
innocent
eyes
slit
my
soul
up
like
a
razor
he
used
to
say
afterwards
with
his
loathsome
snigger
in
a
man
so
depraved
this
might
of
course
mean
no
more
than
sensual
attraction
as
he
had
received
no
dowry
with
his
wife
and
had
so
to
speak
taken
her
from
the
halter
he
did
not
stand
on
ceremony
with
her
making
her
feel
that
she
had
wronged
him
he
took
advantage
of
her
phenomenal
meekness
and
submissiveness
to
trample
on
the
elementary
decencies
of
marriage
he
gathered
loose
women
into
his
house
and
carried
on
orgies
of
debauchery
in
his
wifes
presence
to
show
what
a
pass
things
had
come
to
i
may
mention
that
grigory
the
gloomy
stupid
obstinate
argumentative
servant
who
had
always
hated
his
first
mistress
adelada
ivanovna
took
the
side
of
his
new
mistress
he
championed
her
cause
abusing
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
a
manner
little
befitting
a
servant
and
on
one
occasion
broke
up
the
revels
and
drove
all
the
disorderly
women
out
of
the
house
in
the
end
this
unhappy
young
woman
kept
in
terror
from
her
childhood
fell
into
that
kind
of
nervous
disease
which
is
most
frequently
found
in
peasant
women
who
are
said
to
be
possessed
by
devils
at
times
after
terrible
fits
of
hysterics
she
even
lost
her
reason
yet
she
bore
fyodor
pavlovitch
two
sons
ivan
and
alexey
the
eldest
in
the
first
year
of
marriage
and
the
second
three
years
later
when
she
died
little
alexey
was
in
his
fourth
year
and
strange
as
it
seems
i
know
that
he
remembered
his
mother
all
his
life
like
a
dream
of
course
at
her
death
almost
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
to
the
two
little
boys
as
to
their
elder
brother
mitya
they
were
completely
forgotten
and
abandoned
by
their
father
they
were
looked
after
by
the
same
grigory
and
lived
in
his
cottage
where
they
were
found
by
the
tyrannical
old
lady
who
had
brought
up
their
mother
she
was
still
alive
and
had
not
all
those
eight
years
forgotten
the
insult
done
her
all
that
time
she
was
obtaining
exact
information
as
to
her
sofyas
manner
of
life
and
hearing
of
her
illness
and
hideous
surroundings
she
declared
aloud
two
or
three
times
to
her
retainers
it
serves
her
right
god
has
punished
her
for
her
ingratitude
exactly
three
months
after
sofya
ivanovnas
death
the
generals
widow
suddenly
appeared
in
our
town
and
went
straight
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
house
she
spent
only
half
an
hour
in
the
town
but
she
did
a
great
deal
it
was
evening
fyodor
pavlovitch
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
those
eight
years
came
in
to
her
drunk
the
story
is
that
instantly
upon
seeing
him
without
any
sort
of
explanation
she
gave
him
two
good
resounding
slaps
on
the
face
seized
him
by
a
tuft
of
hair
and
shook
him
three
times
up
and
down
then
without
a
word
she
went
straight
to
the
cottage
to
the
two
boys
seeing
at
the
first
glance
that
they
were
unwashed
and
in
dirty
linen
she
promptly
gave
grigory
too
a
box
on
the
ear
and
announcing
that
she
would
carry
off
both
the
children
she
wrapped
them
just
as
they
were
in
a
rug
put
them
in
the
carriage
and
drove
off
to
her
own
town
grigory
accepted
the
blow
like
a
devoted
slave
without
a
word
and
when
he
escorted
the
old
lady
to
her
carriage
he
made
her
a
low
bow
and
pronounced
impressively
that
god
would
repay
her
for
the
orphans
you
are
a
blockhead
all
the
same
the
old
lady
shouted
to
him
as
she
drove
away
fyodor
pavlovitch
thinking
it
over
decided
that
it
was
a
good
thing
and
did
not
refuse
the
generals
widow
his
formal
consent
to
any
proposition
in
regard
to
his
childrens
education
as
for
the
slaps
she
had
given
him
he
drove
all
over
the
town
telling
the
story
it
happened
that
the
old
lady
died
soon
after
this
but
she
left
the
boys
in
her
will
a
thousand
roubles
each
for
their
instruction
and
so
that
all
be
spent
on
them
exclusively
with
the
condition
that
it
be
so
portioned
out
as
to
last
till
they
are
twentyone
for
it
is
more
than
adequate
provision
for
such
children
if
other
people
think
fit
to
throw
away
their
money
let
them
i
have
not
read
the
will
myself
but
i
heard
there
was
something
queer
of
the
sort
very
whimsically
expressed
the
principal
heir
yefim
petrovitch
polenov
the
marshal
of
nobility
of
the
province
turned
out
however
to
be
an
honest
man
writing
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
discerning
at
once
that
he
could
extract
nothing
from
him
for
his
childrens
education
though
the
latter
never
directly
refused
but
only
procrastinated
as
he
always
did
in
such
cases
and
was
indeed
at
times
effusively
sentimental
yefim
petrovitch
took
a
personal
interest
in
the
orphans
he
became
especially
fond
of
the
younger
alexey
who
lived
for
a
long
while
as
one
of
his
family
i
beg
the
reader
to
note
this
from
the
beginning
and
to
yefim
petrovitch
a
man
of
a
generosity
and
humanity
rarely
to
be
met
with
the
young
people
were
more
indebted
for
their
education
and
bringing
up
than
to
any
one
he
kept
the
two
thousand
roubles
left
to
them
by
the
generals
widow
intact
so
that
by
the
time
they
came
of
age
their
portions
had
been
doubled
by
the
accumulation
of
interest
he
educated
them
both
at
his
own
expense
and
certainly
spent
far
more
than
a
thousand
roubles
upon
each
of
them
i
wont
enter
into
a
detailed
account
of
their
boyhood
and
youth
but
will
only
mention
a
few
of
the
most
important
events
of
the
elder
ivan
i
will
only
say
that
he
grew
into
a
somewhat
morose
and
reserved
though
far
from
timid
boy
at
ten
years
old
he
had
realized
that
they
were
living
not
in
their
own
home
but
on
other
peoples
charity
and
that
their
father
was
a
man
of
whom
it
was
disgraceful
to
speak
this
boy
began
very
early
almost
in
his
infancy
so
they
say
at
least
to
show
a
brilliant
and
unusual
aptitude
for
learning
i
dont
know
precisely
why
but
he
left
the
family
of
yefim
petrovitch
when
he
was
hardly
thirteen
entering
a
moscow
gymnasium
and
boarding
with
an
experienced
and
celebrated
teacher
an
old
friend
of
yefim
petrovitch
ivan
used
to
declare
afterwards
that
this
was
all
due
to
the
ardor
for
good
works
of
yefim
petrovitch
who
was
captivated
by
the
idea
that
the
boys
genius
should
be
trained
by
a
teacher
of
genius
but
neither
yefim
petrovitch
nor
this
teacher
was
living
when
the
young
man
finished
at
the
gymnasium
and
entered
the
university
as
yefim
petrovitch
had
made
no
provision
for
the
payment
of
the
tyrannical
old
ladys
legacy
which
had
grown
from
one
thousand
to
two
it
was
delayed
owing
to
formalities
inevitable
in
russia
and
the
young
man
was
in
great
straits
for
the
first
two
years
at
the
university
as
he
was
forced
to
keep
himself
all
the
time
he
was
studying
it
must
be
noted
that
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
communicate
with
his
father
perhaps
from
pride
from
contempt
for
him
or
perhaps
from
his
cool
common
sense
which
told
him
that
from
such
a
father
he
would
get
no
real
assistance
however
that
may
have
been
the
young
man
was
by
no
means
despondent
and
succeeded
in
getting
work
at
first
giving
sixpenny
lessons
and
afterwards
getting
paragraphs
on
street
incidents
into
the
newspapers
under
the
signature
of
eyewitness
these
paragraphs
it
was
said
were
so
interesting
and
piquant
that
they
were
soon
taken
this
alone
showed
the
young
mans
practical
and
intellectual
superiority
over
the
masses
of
needy
and
unfortunate
students
of
both
sexes
who
hang
about
the
offices
of
the
newspapers
and
journals
unable
to
think
of
anything
better
than
everlasting
entreaties
for
copying
and
translations
from
the
french
having
once
got
into
touch
with
the
editors
ivan
fyodorovitch
always
kept
up
his
connection
with
them
and
in
his
latter
years
at
the
university
he
published
brilliant
reviews
of
books
upon
various
special
subjects
so
that
he
became
well
known
in
literary
circles
but
only
in
his
last
year
he
suddenly
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
a
far
wider
circle
of
readers
so
that
a
great
many
people
noticed
and
remembered
him
it
was
rather
a
curious
incident
when
he
had
just
left
the
university
and
was
preparing
to
go
abroad
upon
his
two
thousand
roubles
ivan
fyodorovitch
published
in
one
of
the
more
important
journals
a
strange
article
which
attracted
general
notice
on
a
subject
of
which
he
might
have
been
supposed
to
know
nothing
as
he
was
a
student
of
natural
science
the
article
dealt
with
a
subject
which
was
being
debated
everywhere
at
the
timethe
position
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
after
discussing
several
opinions
on
the
subject
he
went
on
to
explain
his
own
view
what
was
most
striking
about
the
article
was
its
tone
and
its
unexpected
conclusion
many
of
the
church
party
regarded
him
unquestioningly
as
on
their
side
and
yet
not
only
the
secularists
but
even
atheists
joined
them
in
their
applause
finally
some
sagacious
persons
opined
that
the
article
was
nothing
but
an
impudent
satirical
burlesque
i
mention
this
incident
particularly
because
this
article
penetrated
into
the
famous
monastery
in
our
neighborhood
where
the
inmates
being
particularly
interested
in
the
question
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts
were
completely
bewildered
by
it
learning
the
authors
name
they
were
interested
in
his
being
a
native
of
the
town
and
the
son
of
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
just
then
it
was
that
the
author
himself
made
his
appearance
among
us
why
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
come
amongst
us
i
remember
asking
myself
at
the
time
with
a
certain
uneasiness
this
fateful
visit
which
was
the
first
step
leading
to
so
many
consequences
i
never
fully
explained
to
myself
it
seemed
strange
on
the
face
of
it
that
a
young
man
so
learned
so
proud
and
apparently
so
cautious
should
suddenly
visit
such
an
infamous
house
and
a
father
who
had
ignored
him
all
his
life
hardly
knew
him
never
thought
of
him
and
would
not
under
any
circumstances
have
given
him
money
though
he
was
always
afraid
that
his
sons
ivan
and
alexey
would
also
come
to
ask
him
for
it
and
here
the
young
man
was
staying
in
the
house
of
such
a
father
had
been
living
with
him
for
two
months
and
they
were
on
the
best
possible
terms
this
last
fact
was
a
special
cause
of
wonder
to
many
others
as
well
as
to
me
pyotr
alexandrovitch
misov
of
whom
we
have
spoken
already
the
cousin
of
fyodor
pavlovitchs
first
wife
happened
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
again
on
a
visit
to
his
estate
he
had
come
from
paris
which
was
his
permanent
home
i
remember
that
he
was
more
surprised
than
any
one
when
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
man
who
interested
him
extremely
and
with
whom
he
sometimes
argued
and
not
without
an
inner
pang
compared
himself
in
acquirements
he
is
proud
he
used
to
say
he
will
never
be
in
want
of
pence
he
has
got
money
enough
to
go
abroad
now
what
does
he
want
here
every
one
can
see
that
he
hasnt
come
for
money
for
his
father
would
never
give
him
any
he
has
no
taste
for
drink
and
dissipation
and
yet
his
father
cant
do
without
him
they
get
on
so
well
together
that
was
the
truth
the
young
man
had
an
unmistakable
influence
over
his
father
who
positively
appeared
to
be
behaving
more
decently
and
even
seemed
at
times
ready
to
obey
his
son
though
often
extremely
and
even
spitefully
perverse
it
was
only
later
that
we
learned
that
ivan
had
come
partly
at
the
request
of
and
in
the
interests
of
his
elder
brother
dmitri
whom
he
saw
for
the
first
time
on
this
very
visit
though
he
had
before
leaving
moscow
been
in
correspondence
with
him
about
an
important
matter
of
more
concern
to
dmitri
than
himself
what
that
business
was
the
reader
will
learn
fully
in
due
time
yet
even
when
i
did
know
of
this
special
circumstance
i
still
felt
ivan
fyodorovitch
to
be
an
enigmatic
figure
and
thought
his
visit
rather
mysterious
i
may
add
that
ivan
appeared
at
the
time
in
the
light
of
a
mediator
between
his
father
and
his
elder
brother
dmitri
who
was
in
open
quarrel
with
his
father
and
even
planning
to
bring
an
action
against
him
the
family
i
repeat
was
now
united
for
the
first
time
and
some
of
its
members
met
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
the
younger
brother
alexey
had
been
a
year
already
among
us
having
been
the
first
of
the
three
to
arrive
it
is
of
that
brother
alexey
i
find
it
most
difficult
to
speak
in
this
introduction
yet
i
must
give
some
preliminary
account
of
him
if
only
to
explain
one
queer
fact
which
is
that
i
have
to
introduce
my
hero
to
the
reader
wearing
the
cassock
of
a
novice
yes
he
had
been
for
the
last
year
in
our
monastery
and
seemed
willing
to
be
cloistered
there
for
the
rest
of
his
life
chapter
iv
the
third
son
alyosha
he
was
only
twenty
his
brother
ivan
was
in
his
twentyfourth
year
at
the
time
while
their
elder
brother
dmitri
was
twentyseven
first
of
all
i
must
explain
that
this
young
man
alyosha
was
not
a
fanatic
and
in
my
opinion
at
least
was
not
even
a
mystic
i
may
as
well
give
my
full
opinion
from
the
beginning
he
was
simply
an
early
lover
of
humanity
and
that
he
adopted
the
monastic
life
was
simply
because
at
that
time
it
struck
him
so
to
say
as
the
ideal
escape
for
his
soul
struggling
from
the
darkness
of
worldly
wickedness
to
the
light
of
love
and
the
reason
this
life
struck
him
in
this
way
was
that
he
found
in
it
at
that
time
as
he
thought
an
extraordinary
being
our
celebrated
elder
zossima
to
whom
he
became
attached
with
all
the
warm
first
love
of
his
ardent
heart
but
i
do
not
dispute
that
he
was
very
strange
even
at
that
time
and
had
been
so
indeed
from
his
cradle
i
have
mentioned
already
by
the
way
that
though
he
lost
his
mother
in
his
fourth
year
he
remembered
her
all
his
lifeher
face
her
caresses
as
though
she
stood
living
before
me
such
memories
may
persist
as
every
one
knows
from
an
even
earlier
age
even
from
two
years
old
but
scarcely
standing
out
through
a
whole
lifetime
like
spots
of
light
out
of
darkness
like
a
corner
torn
out
of
a
huge
picture
which
has
all
faded
and
disappeared
except
that
fragment
that
is
how
it
was
with
him
he
remembered
one
still
summer
evening
an
open
window
the
slanting
rays
of
the
setting
sun
that
he
recalled
most
vividly
of
all
in
a
corner
of
the
room
the
holy
image
before
it
a
lighted
lamp
and
on
her
knees
before
the
image
his
mother
sobbing
hysterically
with
cries
and
moans
snatching
him
up
in
both
arms
squeezing
him
close
till
it
hurt
and
praying
for
him
to
the
mother
of
god
holding
him
out
in
both
arms
to
the
image
as
though
to
put
him
under
the
mothers
protection

and
suddenly
a
nurse
runs
in
and
snatches
him
from
her
in
terror
that
was
the
picture
and
alyosha
remembered
his
mothers
face
at
that
minute
he
used
to
say
that
it
was
frenzied
but
beautiful
as
he
remembered
but
he
rarely
cared
to
speak
of
this
memory
to
any
one
in
his
childhood
and
youth
he
was
by
no
means
expansive
and
talked
little
indeed
but
not
from
shyness
or
a
sullen
unsociability
quite
the
contrary
from
something
different
from
a
sort
of
inner
preoccupation
entirely
personal
and
unconcerned
with
other
people
but
so
important
to
him
that
he
seemed
as
it
were
to
forget
others
on
account
of
it
but
he
was
fond
of
people
he
seemed
throughout
his
life
to
put
implicit
trust
in
people
yet
no
one
ever
looked
on
him
as
a
simpleton
or
nave
person
there
was
something
about
him
which
made
one
feel
at
once
and
it
was
so
all
his
life
afterwards
that
he
did
not
care
to
be
a
judge
of
othersthat
he
would
never
take
it
upon
himself
to
criticize
and
would
never
condemn
any
one
for
anything
he
seemed
indeed
to
accept
everything
without
the
least
condemnation
though
often
grieving
bitterly
and
this
was
so
much
so
that
no
one
could
surprise
or
frighten
him
even
in
his
earliest
youth
coming
at
twenty
to
his
fathers
house
which
was
a
very
sink
of
filthy
debauchery
he
chaste
and
pure
as
he
was
simply
withdrew
in
silence
when
to
look
on
was
unbearable
but
without
the
slightest
sign
of
contempt
or
condemnation
his
father
who
had
once
been
in
a
dependent
position
and
so
was
sensitive
and
ready
to
take
offense
met
him
at
first
with
distrust
and
sullenness
he
does
not
say
much
he
used
to
say
and
thinks
the
more
but
soon
within
a
fortnight
indeed
he
took
to
embracing
him
and
kissing
him
terribly
often
with
drunken
tears
with
sottish
sentimentality
yet
he
evidently
felt
a
real
and
deep
affection
for
him
such
as
he
had
never
been
capable
of
feeling
for
any
one
before
every
one
indeed
loved
this
young
man
wherever
he
went
and
it
was
so
from
his
earliest
childhood
when
he
entered
the
household
of
his
patron
and
benefactor
yefim
petrovitch
polenov
he
gained
the
hearts
of
all
the
family
so
that
they
looked
on
him
quite
as
their
own
child
yet
he
entered
the
house
at
such
a
tender
age
that
he
could
not
have
acted
from
design
nor
artfulness
in
winning
affection
so
that
the
gift
of
making
himself
loved
directly
and
unconsciously
was
inherent
in
him
in
his
very
nature
so
to
speak
it
was
the
same
at
school
though
he
seemed
to
be
just
one
of
those
children
who
are
distrusted
sometimes
ridiculed
and
even
disliked
by
their
schoolfellows
he
was
dreamy
for
instance
and
rather
solitary
from
his
earliest
childhood
he
was
fond
of
creeping
into
a
corner
to
read
and
yet
he
was
a
general
favorite
all
the
while
he
was
at
school
he
was
rarely
playful
or
merry
but
any
one
could
see
at
the
first
glance
that
this
was
not
from
any
sullenness
on
the
contrary
he
was
bright
and
goodtempered
he
never
tried
to
show
off
among
his
schoolfellows
perhaps
because
of
this
he
was
never
afraid
of
any
one
yet
the
boys
immediately
understood
that
he
was
not
proud
of
his
fearlessness
and
seemed
to
be
unaware
that
he
was
bold
and
courageous
he
never
resented
an
insult
it
would
happen
that
an
hour
after
the
offense
he
would
address
the
offender
or
answer
some
question
with
as
trustful
and
candid
an
expression
as
though
nothing
had
happened
between
them
and
it
was
not
that
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
or
intentionally
forgiven
the
affront
but
simply
that
he
did
not
regard
it
as
an
affront
and
this
completely
conquered
and
captivated
the
boys
he
had
one
characteristic
which
made
all
his
schoolfellows
from
the
bottom
class
to
the
top
want
to
mock
at
him
not
from
malice
but
because
it
amused
them
this
characteristic
was
a
wild
fanatical
modesty
and
chastity
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
certain
words
and
certain
conversations
about
women
there
are
certain
words
and
conversations
unhappily
impossible
to
eradicate
in
schools
boys
pure
in
mind
and
heart
almost
children
are
fond
of
talking
in
school
among
themselves
and
even
aloud
of
things
pictures
and
images
of
which
even
soldiers
would
sometimes
hesitate
to
speak
more
than
that
much
that
soldiers
have
no
knowledge
or
conception
of
is
familiar
to
quite
young
children
of
our
intellectual
and
higher
classes
there
is
no
moral
depravity
no
real
corrupt
inner
cynicism
in
it
but
there
is
the
appearance
of
it
and
it
is
often
looked
upon
among
them
as
something
refined
subtle
daring
and
worthy
of
imitation
seeing
that
alyosha
karamazov
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
when
they
talked
of
that
they
used
sometimes
to
crowd
round
him
pull
his
hands
away
and
shout
nastiness
into
both
ears
while
he
struggled
slipped
to
the
floor
tried
to
hide
himself
without
uttering
one
word
of
abuse
enduring
their
insults
in
silence
but
at
last
they
left
him
alone
and
gave
up
taunting
him
with
being
a
regular
girl
and
whats
more
they
looked
upon
it
with
compassion
as
a
weakness
he
was
always
one
of
the
best
in
the
class
but
was
never
first
at
the
time
of
yefim
petrovitchs
death
alyosha
had
two
more
years
to
complete
at
the
provincial
gymnasium
the
inconsolable
widow
went
almost
immediately
after
his
death
for
a
long
visit
to
italy
with
her
whole
family
which
consisted
only
of
women
and
girls
alyosha
went
to
live
in
the
house
of
two
distant
relations
of
yefim
petrovitch
ladies
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
on
what
terms
he
lived
with
them
he
did
not
know
himself
it
was
very
characteristic
of
him
indeed
that
he
never
cared
at
whose
expense
he
was
living
in
that
respect
he
was
a
striking
contrast
to
his
elder
brother
ivan
who
struggled
with
poverty
for
his
first
two
years
in
the
university
maintained
himself
by
his
own
efforts
and
had
from
childhood
been
bitterly
conscious
of
living
at
the
expense
of
his
benefactor
but
this
strange
trait
in
alyoshas
character
must
not
i
think
be
criticized
too
severely
for
at
the
slightest
acquaintance
with
him
any
one
would
have
perceived
that
alyosha
was
one
of
those
youths
almost
of
the
type
of
religious
enthusiast
who
if
they
were
suddenly
to
come
into
possession
of
a
large
fortune
would
not
hesitate
to
give
it
away
for
the
asking
either
for
good
works
or
perhaps
to
a
clever
rogue
in
general
he
seemed
scarcely
to
know
the
value
of
money
not
of
course
in
a
literal
sense
when
he
was
given
pocketmoney
which
he
never
asked
for
he
was
either
terribly
careless
of
it
so
that
it
was
gone
in
a
moment
or
he
kept
it
for
weeks
together
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
in
later
years
pyotr
alexandrovitch
misov
a
man
very
sensitive
on
the
score
of
money
and
bourgeois
honesty
pronounced
the
following
judgment
after
getting
to
know
alyosha
here
is
perhaps
the
one
man
in
the
world
whom
you
might
leave
alone
without
a
penny
in
the
center
of
an
unknown
town
of
a
million
inhabitants
and
he
would
not
come
to
harm
he
would
not
die
of
cold
and
hunger
for
he
would
be
fed
and
sheltered
at
once
and
if
he
were
not
he
would
find
a
shelter
for
himself
and
it
would
cost
him
no
effort
or
humiliation
and
to
shelter
him
would
be
no
burden
but
on
the
contrary
would
probably
be
looked
on
as
a
pleasure
he
did
not
finish
his
studies
at
the
gymnasium
a
year
before
the
end
of
the
course
he
suddenly
announced
to
the
ladies
that
he
was
going
to
see
his
father
about
a
plan
which
had
occurred
to
him
they
were
sorry
and
unwilling
to
let
him
go
the
journey
was
not
an
expensive
one
and
the
ladies
would
not
let
him
pawn
his
watch
a
parting
present
from
his
benefactors
family
they
provided
him
liberally
with
money
and
even
fitted
him
out
with
new
clothes
and
linen
but
he
returned
half
the
money
they
gave
him
saying
that
he
intended
to
go
third
class
on
his
arrival
in
the
town
he
made
no
answer
to
his
fathers
first
inquiry
why
he
had
come
before
completing
his
studies
and
seemed
so
they
say
unusually
thoughtful
it
soon
became
apparent
that
he
was
looking
for
his
mothers
tomb
he
practically
acknowledged
at
the
time
that
that
was
the
only
object
of
his
visit
but
it
can
hardly
have
been
the
whole
reason
of
it
it
is
more
probable
that
he
himself
did
not
understand
and
could
not
explain
what
had
suddenly
arisen
in
his
soul
and
drawn
him
irresistibly
into
a
new
unknown
but
inevitable
path
fyodor
pavlovitch
could
not
show
him
where
his
second
wife
was
buried
for
he
had
never
visited
her
grave
since
he
had
thrown
earth
upon
her
coffin
and
in
the
course
of
years
had
entirely
forgotten
where
she
was
buried
fyodor
pavlovitch
by
the
way
had
for
some
time
previously
not
been
living
in
our
town
three
or
four
years
after
his
wifes
death
he
had
gone
to
the
south
of
russia
and
finally
turned
up
in
odessa
where
he
spent
several
years
he
made
the
acquaintance
at
first
in
his
own
words
of
a
lot
of
low
jews
jewesses
and
jewkins
and
ended
by
being
received
by
jews
high
and
low
alike
it
may
be
presumed
that
at
this
period
he
developed
a
peculiar
faculty
for
making
and
hoarding
money
he
finally
returned
to
our
town
only
three
years
before
alyoshas
arrival
his
former
acquaintances
found
him
looking
terribly
aged
although
he
was
by
no
means
an
old
man
he
behaved
not
exactly
with
more
dignity
but
with
more
effrontery
the
former
buffoon
showed
an
insolent
propensity
for
making
buffoons
of
others
his
depravity
with
women
was
not
simply
what
it
used
to
be
but
even
more
revolting
in
a
short
time
he
opened
a
great
number
of
new
taverns
in
the
district
it
was
evident
that
he
had
perhaps
a
hundred
thousand
roubles
or
not
much
less
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
and
district
were
soon
in
his
debt
and
of
course
had
given
good
security
of
late
too
he
looked
somehow
bloated
and
seemed
more
irresponsible
more
uneven
had
sunk
into
a
sort
of
incoherence
used
to
begin
one
thing
and
go
on
with
another
as
though
he
were
letting
himself
go
altogether
he
was
more
and
more
frequently
drunk
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
same
servant
grigory
who
by
that
time
had
aged
considerably
too
and
used
to
look
after
him
sometimes
almost
like
a
tutor
fyodor
pavlovitch
might
have
got
into
terrible
scrapes
alyoshas
arrival
seemed
to
affect
even
his
moral
side
as
though
something
had
awakened
in
this
prematurely
old
man
which
had
long
been
dead
in
his
soul
do
you
know
he
used
often
to
say
looking
at
alyosha
that
you
are
like
her
the
crazy
woman
that
was
what
he
used
to
call
his
dead
wife
alyoshas
mother
grigory
it
was
who
pointed
out
the
crazy
womans
grave
to
alyosha
he
took
him
to
our
town
cemetery
and
showed
him
in
a
remote
corner
a
castiron
tombstone
cheap
but
decently
kept
on
which
were
inscribed
the
name
and
age
of
the
deceased
and
the
date
of
her
death
and
below
a
fourlined
verse
such
as
are
commonly
used
on
oldfashioned
middleclass
tombs
to
alyoshas
amazement
this
tomb
turned
out
to
be
grigorys
doing
he
had
put
it
up
on
the
poor
crazy
womans
grave
at
his
own
expense
after
fyodor
pavlovitch
whom
he
had
often
pestered
about
the
grave
had
gone
to
odessa
abandoning
the
grave
and
all
his
memories
alyosha
showed
no
particular
emotion
at
the
sight
of
his
mothers
grave
he
only
listened
to
grigorys
minute
and
solemn
account
of
the
erection
of
the
tomb
he
stood
with
bowed
head
and
walked
away
without
uttering
a
word
it
was
perhaps
a
year
before
he
visited
the
cemetery
again
but
this
little
episode
was
not
without
an
influence
upon
fyodor
pavlovitchand
a
very
original
one
he
suddenly
took
a
thousand
roubles
to
our
monastery
to
pay
for
requiems
for
the
soul
of
his
wife
but
not
for
the
second
alyoshas
mother
the
crazy
woman
but
for
the
first
adelada
ivanovna
who
used
to
thrash
him
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
got
drunk
and
abused
the
monks
to
alyosha
he
himself
was
far
from
being
religious
he
had
probably
never
put
a
penny
candle
before
the
image
of
a
saint
strange
impulses
of
sudden
feeling
and
sudden
thought
are
common
in
such
types
i
have
mentioned
already
that
he
looked
bloated
his
countenance
at
this
time
bore
traces
of
something
that
testified
unmistakably
to
the
life
he
had
led
besides
the
long
fleshy
bags
under
his
little
always
insolent
suspicious
and
ironical
eyes
besides
the
multitude
of
deep
wrinkles
in
his
little
fat
face
the
adams
apple
hung
below
his
sharp
chin
like
a
great
fleshy
goiter
which
gave
him
a
peculiar
repulsive
sensual
appearance
add
to
that
a
long
rapacious
mouth
with
full
lips
between
which
could
be
seen
little
stumps
of
black
decayed
teeth
he
slobbered
every
time
he
began
to
speak
he
was
fond
indeed
of
making
fun
of
his
own
face
though
i
believe
he
was
well
satisfied
with
it
he
used
particularly
to
point
to
his
nose
which
was
not
very
large
but
very
delicate
and
conspicuously
aquiline
a
regular
roman
nose
he
used
to
say
with
my
goiter
ive
quite
the
countenance
of
an
ancient
roman
patrician
of
the
decadent
period
he
seemed
proud
of
it
not
long
after
visiting
his
mothers
grave
alyosha
suddenly
announced
that
he
wanted
to
enter
the
monastery
and
that
the
monks
were
willing
to
receive
him
as
a
novice
he
explained
that
this
was
his
strong
desire
and
that
he
was
solemnly
asking
his
consent
as
his
father
the
old
man
knew
that
the
elder
zossima
who
was
living
in
the
monastery
hermitage
had
made
a
special
impression
upon
his
gentle
boy
that
is
the
most
honest
monk
among
them
of
course
he
observed
after
listening
in
thoughtful
silence
to
alyosha
and
seeming
scarcely
surprised
at
his
request
hm
so
thats
where
you
want
to
be
my
gentle
boy
he
was
half
drunk
and
suddenly
he
grinned
his
slow
halfdrunken
grin
which
was
not
without
a
certain
cunning
and
tipsy
slyness
hm
i
had
a
presentiment
that
you
would
end
in
something
like
this
would
you
believe
it
you
were
making
straight
for
it
well
to
be
sure
you
have
your
own
two
thousand
thats
a
dowry
for
you
and
ill
never
desert
you
my
angel
and
ill
pay
whats
wanted
for
you
there
if
they
ask
for
it
but
of
course
if
they
dont
ask
why
should
we
worry
them
what
do
you
say
you
know
you
spend
money
like
a
canary
two
grains
a
week
hm
do
you
know
that
near
one
monastery
theres
a
place
outside
the
town
where
every
baby
knows
there
are
none
but
the
monks
wives
living
as
they
are
called
thirty
women
i
believe
i
have
been
there
myself
you
know
its
interesting
in
its
own
way
of
course
as
a
variety
the
worst
of
it
is
its
awfully
russian
there
are
no
french
women
there
of
course
they
could
get
them
fast
enough
they
have
plenty
of
money
if
they
get
to
hear
of
it
theyll
come
along
well
theres
nothing
of
that
sort
here
no
monks
wives
and
two
hundred
monks
theyre
honest
they
keep
the
fasts
i
admit
it
hm
so
you
want
to
be
a
monk
and
do
you
know
im
sorry
to
lose
you
alyosha
would
you
believe
it
ive
really
grown
fond
of
you
well
its
a
good
opportunity
youll
pray
for
us
sinners
we
have
sinned
too
much
here
ive
always
been
thinking
who
would
pray
for
me
and
whether
theres
any
one
in
the
world
to
do
it
my
dear
boy
im
awfully
stupid
about
that
you
wouldnt
believe
it
awfully
you
see
however
stupid
i
am
about
it
i
keep
thinking
i
keep
thinkingfrom
time
to
time
of
course
not
all
the
while
its
impossible
i
think
for
the
devils
to
forget
to
drag
me
down
to
hell
with
their
hooks
when
i
die
then
i
wonderhooks
where
would
they
get
them
what
of
iron
hooks
where
do
they
forge
them
have
they
a
foundry
there
of
some
sort
the
monks
in
the
monastery
probably
believe
that
theres
a
ceiling
in
hell
for
instance
now
im
ready
to
believe
in
hell
but
without
a
ceiling
it
makes
it
more
refined
more
enlightened
more
lutheran
that
is
and
after
all
what
does
it
matter
whether
it
has
a
ceiling
or
hasnt
but
do
you
know
theres
a
damnable
question
involved
in
it
if
theres
no
ceiling
there
can
be
no
hooks
and
if
there
are
no
hooks
it
all
breaks
down
which
is
unlikely
again
for
then
there
would
be
none
to
drag
me
down
to
hell
and
if
they
dont
drag
me
down
what
justice
is
there
in
the
world
il
faudrait
les
inventer
those
hooks
on
purpose
for
me
alone
for
if
you
only
knew
alyosha
what
a
blackguard
i
am
but
there
are
no
hooks
there
said
alyosha
looking
gently
and
seriously
at
his
father
yes
yes
only
the
shadows
of
hooks
i
know
i
know
thats
how
a
frenchman
described
hell
jai
vu
lombre
dun
cocher
qui
avec
lombre
dune
brosse
frottait
lombre
dune
carrosse
how
do
you
know
there
are
no
hooks
darling
when
youve
lived
with
the
monks
youll
sing
a
different
tune
but
go
and
get
at
the
truth
there
and
then
come
and
tell
me
anyway
its
easier
going
to
the
other
world
if
one
knows
what
there
is
there
besides
it
will
be
more
seemly
for
you
with
the
monks
than
here
with
me
with
a
drunken
old
man
and
young
harlots

though
youre
like
an
angel
nothing
touches
you
and
i
dare
say
nothing
will
touch
you
there
thats
why
i
let
you
go
because
i
hope
for
that
youve
got
all
your
wits
about
you
you
will
burn
and
you
will
burn
out
you
will
be
healed
and
come
back
again
and
i
will
wait
for
you
i
feel
that
youre
the
only
creature
in
the
world
who
has
not
condemned
me
my
dear
boy
i
feel
it
you
know
i
cant
help
feeling
it
and
he
even
began
blubbering
he
was
sentimental
he
was
wicked
and
sentimental
chapter
v
elders
some
of
my
readers
may
imagine
that
my
young
man
was
a
sickly
ecstatic
poorly
developed
creature
a
pale
consumptive
dreamer
on
the
contrary
alyosha
was
at
this
time
a
wellgrown
redcheeked
cleareyed
lad
of
nineteen
radiant
with
health
he
was
very
handsome
too
graceful
moderately
tall
with
hair
of
a
dark
brown
with
a
regular
rather
long
ovalshaped
face
and
wideset
dark
gray
shining
eyes
he
was
very
thoughtful
and
apparently
very
serene
i
shall
be
told
perhaps
that
red
cheeks
are
not
incompatible
with
fanaticism
and
mysticism
but
i
fancy
that
alyosha
was
more
of
a
realist
than
any
one
oh
no
doubt
in
the
monastery
he
fully
believed
in
miracles
but
to
my
thinking
miracles
are
never
a
stumblingblock
to
the
realist
it
is
not
miracles
that
dispose
realists
to
belief
the
genuine
realist
if
he
is
an
unbeliever
will
always
find
strength
and
ability
to
disbelieve
in
the
miraculous
and
if
he
is
confronted
with
a
miracle
as
an
irrefutable
fact
he
would
rather
disbelieve
his
own
senses
than
admit
the
fact
even
if
he
admits
it
he
admits
it
as
a
fact
of
nature
till
then
unrecognized
by
him
faith
does
not
in
the
realist
spring
from
the
miracle
but
the
miracle
from
faith
if
the
realist
once
believes
then
he
is
bound
by
his
very
realism
to
admit
the
miraculous
also
the
apostle
thomas
said
that
he
would
not
believe
till
he
saw
but
when
he
did
see
he
said
my
lord
and
my
god
was
it
the
miracle
forced
him
to
believe
most
likely
not
but
he
believed
solely
because
he
desired
to
believe
and
possibly
he
fully
believed
in
his
secret
heart
even
when
he
said
i
do
not
believe
till
i
see
i
shall
be
told
perhaps
that
alyosha
was
stupid
undeveloped
had
not
finished
his
studies
and
so
on
that
he
did
not
finish
his
studies
is
true
but
to
say
that
he
was
stupid
or
dull
would
be
a
great
injustice
ill
simply
repeat
what
i
have
said
above
he
entered
upon
this
path
only
because
at
that
time
it
alone
struck
his
imagination
and
presented
itself
to
him
as
offering
an
ideal
means
of
escape
for
his
soul
from
darkness
to
light
add
to
that
that
he
was
to
some
extent
a
youth
of
our
last
epochthat
is
honest
in
nature
desiring
the
truth
seeking
for
it
and
believing
in
it
and
seeking
to
serve
it
at
once
with
all
the
strength
of
his
soul
seeking
for
immediate
action
and
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
life
itself
for
it
though
these
young
men
unhappily
fail
to
understand
that
the
sacrifice
of
life
is
in
many
cases
the
easiest
of
all
sacrifices
and
that
to
sacrifice
for
instance
five
or
six
years
of
their
seething
youth
to
hard
and
tedious
study
if
only
to
multiply
tenfold
their
powers
of
serving
the
truth
and
the
cause
they
have
set
before
them
as
their
goalsuch
a
sacrifice
is
utterly
beyond
the
strength
of
many
of
them
the
path
alyosha
chose
was
a
path
going
in
the
opposite
direction
but
he
chose
it
with
the
same
thirst
for
swift
achievement
as
soon
as
he
reflected
seriously
he
was
convinced
of
the
existence
of
god
and
immortality
and
at
once
he
instinctively
said
to
himself
i
want
to
live
for
immortality
and
i
will
accept
no
compromise
in
the
same
way
if
he
had
decided
that
god
and
immortality
did
not
exist
he
would
at
once
have
become
an
atheist
and
a
socialist
for
socialism
is
not
merely
the
labor
question
it
is
before
all
things
the
atheistic
question
the
question
of
the
form
taken
by
atheism
today
the
question
of
the
tower
of
babel
built
without
god
not
to
mount
to
heaven
from
earth
but
to
set
up
heaven
on
earth
alyosha
would
have
found
it
strange
and
impossible
to
go
on
living
as
before
it
is
written
give
all
that
thou
hast
to
the
poor
and
follow
me
if
thou
wouldst
be
perfect
alyosha
said
to
himself
i
cant
give
two
roubles
instead
of
all
and
only
go
to
mass
instead
of
following
him

perhaps
his
memories
of
childhood
brought
back
our
monastery
to
which
his
mother
may
have
taken
him
to
mass
perhaps
the
slanting
sunlight
and
the
holy
image
to
which
his
poor
crazy
mother
had
held
him
up
still
acted
upon
his
imagination
brooding
on
these
things
he
may
have
come
to
us
perhaps
only
to
see
whether
here
he
could
sacrifice
all
or
only
two
roubles
and
in
the
monastery
he
met
this
elder
i
must
digress
to
explain
what
an
elder
is
in
russian
monasteries
and
i
am
sorry
that
i
do
not
feel
very
competent
to
do
so
i
will
try
however
to
give
a
superficial
account
of
it
in
a
few
words
authorities
on
the
subject
assert
that
the
institution
of
elders
is
of
recent
date
not
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
in
our
monasteries
though
in
the
orthodox
east
especially
in
sinai
and
athos
it
has
existed
over
a
thousand
years
it
is
maintained
that
it
existed
in
ancient
times
in
russia
also
but
through
the
calamities
which
overtook
russiathe
tartars
civil
war
the
interruption
of
relations
with
the
east
after
the
destruction
of
constantinoplethis
institution
fell
into
oblivion
it
was
revived
among
us
towards
the
end
of
last
century
by
one
of
the
great
ascetics
as
they
called
him
passy
velitchkovsky
and
his
disciples
but
to
this
day
it
exists
in
few
monasteries
only
and
has
sometimes
been
almost
persecuted
as
an
innovation
in
russia
it
flourished
especially
in
the
celebrated
kozelski
optin
monastery
when
and
how
it
was
introduced
into
our
monastery
i
cannot
say
there
had
already
been
three
such
elders
and
zossima
was
the
last
of
them
but
he
was
almost
dying
of
weakness
and
disease
and
they
had
no
one
to
take
his
place
the
question
for
our
monastery
was
an
important
one
for
it
had
not
been
distinguished
by
anything
in
particular
till
then
they
had
neither
relics
of
saints
nor
wonderworking
ikons
nor
glorious
traditions
nor
historical
exploits
it
had
flourished
and
been
glorious
all
over
russia
through
its
elders
to
see
and
hear
whom
pilgrims
had
flocked
for
thousands
of
miles
from
all
parts
what
was
such
an
elder
an
elder
was
one
who
took
your
soul
your
will
into
his
soul
and
his
will
when
you
choose
an
elder
you
renounce
your
own
will
and
yield
it
to
him
in
complete
submission
complete
self
abnegation
this
novitiate
this
terrible
school
of
abnegation
is
undertaken
voluntarily
in
the
hope
of
selfconquest
of
selfmastery
in
order
after
a
life
of
obedience
to
attain
perfect
freedom
that
is
from
self
to
escape
the
lot
of
those
who
have
lived
their
whole
life
without
finding
their
true
selves
in
themselves
this
institution
of
elders
is
not
founded
on
theory
but
was
established
in
the
east
from
the
practice
of
a
thousand
years
the
obligations
due
to
an
elder
are
not
the
ordinary
obedience
which
has
always
existed
in
our
russian
monasteries
the
obligation
involves
confession
to
the
elder
by
all
who
have
submitted
themselves
to
him
and
to
the
indissoluble
bond
between
him
and
them
the
story
is
told
for
instance
that
in
the
early
days
of
christianity
one
such
novice
failing
to
fulfill
some
command
laid
upon
him
by
his
elder
left
his
monastery
in
syria
and
went
to
egypt
there
after
great
exploits
he
was
found
worthy
at
last
to
suffer
torture
and
a
martyrs
death
for
the
faith
when
the
church
regarding
him
as
a
saint
was
burying
him
suddenly
at
the
deacons
exhortation
depart
all
ye
unbaptized
the
coffin
containing
the
martyrs
body
left
its
place
and
was
cast
forth
from
the
church
and
this
took
place
three
times
and
only
at
last
they
learnt
that
this
holy
man
had
broken
his
vow
of
obedience
and
left
his
elder
and
therefore
could
not
be
forgiven
without
the
elders
absolution
in
spite
of
his
great
deeds
only
after
this
could
the
funeral
take
place
this
of
course
is
only
an
old
legend
but
here
is
a
recent
instance
a
monk
was
suddenly
commanded
by
his
elder
to
quit
athos
which
he
loved
as
a
sacred
place
and
a
haven
of
refuge
and
to
go
first
to
jerusalem
to
do
homage
to
the
holy
places
and
then
to
go
to
the
north
to
siberia
there
is
the
place
for
thee
and
not
here
the
monk
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
went
to
the
cumenical
patriarch
at
constantinople
and
besought
him
to
release
him
from
his
obedience
but
the
patriarch
replied
that
not
only
was
he
unable
to
release
him
but
there
was
not
and
could
not
be
on
earth
a
power
which
could
release
him
except
the
elder
who
had
himself
laid
that
duty
upon
him
in
this
way
the
elders
are
endowed
in
certain
cases
with
unbounded
and
inexplicable
authority
that
is
why
in
many
of
our
monasteries
the
institution
was
at
first
resisted
almost
to
persecution
meantime
the
elders
immediately
began
to
be
highly
esteemed
among
the
people
masses
of
the
ignorant
people
as
well
as
men
of
distinction
flocked
for
instance
to
the
elders
of
our
monastery
to
confess
their
doubts
their
sins
and
their
sufferings
and
ask
for
counsel
and
admonition
seeing
this
the
opponents
of
the
elders
declared
that
the
sacrament
of
confession
was
being
arbitrarily
and
frivolously
degraded
though
the
continual
opening
of
the
heart
to
the
elder
by
the
monk
or
the
layman
had
nothing
of
the
character
of
the
sacrament
in
the
end
however
the
institution
of
elders
has
been
retained
and
is
becoming
established
in
russian
monasteries
it
is
true
perhaps
that
this
instrument
which
had
stood
the
test
of
a
thousand
years
for
the
moral
regeneration
of
a
man
from
slavery
to
freedom
and
to
moral
perfectibility
may
be
a
twoedged
weapon
and
it
may
lead
some
not
to
humility
and
complete
selfcontrol
but
to
the
most
satanic
pride
that
is
to
bondage
and
not
to
freedom
the
elder
zossima
was
sixtyfive
he
came
of
a
family
of
landowners
had
been
in
the
army
in
early
youth
and
served
in
the
caucasus
as
an
officer
he
had
no
doubt
impressed
alyosha
by
some
peculiar
quality
of
his
soul
alyosha
lived
in
the
cell
of
the
elder
who
was
very
fond
of
him
and
let
him
wait
upon
him
it
must
be
noted
that
alyosha
was
bound
by
no
obligation
and
could
go
where
he
pleased
and
be
absent
for
whole
days
though
he
wore
the
monastic
dress
it
was
voluntarily
not
to
be
different
from
others
no
doubt
he
liked
to
do
so
possibly
his
youthful
imagination
was
deeply
stirred
by
the
power
and
fame
of
his
elder
it
was
said
that
so
many
people
had
for
years
past
come
to
confess
their
sins
to
father
zossima
and
to
entreat
him
for
words
of
advice
and
healing
that
he
had
acquired
the
keenest
intuition
and
could
tell
from
an
unknown
face
what
a
newcomer
wanted
and
what
was
the
suffering
on
his
conscience
he
sometimes
astounded
and
almost
alarmed
his
visitors
by
his
knowledge
of
their
secrets
before
they
had
spoken
a
word
alyosha
noticed
that
many
almost
all
went
in
to
the
elder
for
the
first
time
with
apprehension
and
uneasiness
but
came
out
with
bright
and
happy
faces
alyosha
was
particularly
struck
by
the
fact
that
father
zossima
was
not
at
all
stern
on
the
contrary
he
was
always
almost
gay
the
monks
used
to
say
that
he
was
more
drawn
to
those
who
were
more
sinful
and
the
greater
the
sinner
the
more
he
loved
him
there
were
no
doubt
up
to
the
end
of
his
life
among
the
monks
some
who
hated
and
envied
him
but
they
were
few
in
number
and
they
were
silent
though
among
them
were
some
of
great
dignity
in
the
monastery
one
for
instance
of
the
older
monks
distinguished
for
his
strict
keeping
of
fasts
and
vows
of
silence
but
the
majority
were
on
father
zossimas
side
and
very
many
of
them
loved
him
with
all
their
hearts
warmly
and
sincerely
some
were
almost
fanatically
devoted
to
him
and
declared
though
not
quite
aloud
that
he
was
a
saint
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
and
seeing
that
his
end
was
near
they
anticipated
miracles
and
great
glory
to
the
monastery
in
the
immediate
future
from
his
relics
alyosha
had
unquestioning
faith
in
the
miraculous
power
of
the
elder
just
as
he
had
unquestioning
faith
in
the
story
of
the
coffin
that
flew
out
of
the
church
he
saw
many
who
came
with
sick
children
or
relatives
and
besought
the
elder
to
lay
hands
on
them
and
to
pray
over
them
return
shortly
aftersome
the
next
dayand
falling
in
tears
at
the
elders
feet
thank
him
for
healing
their
sick
whether
they
had
really
been
healed
or
were
simply
better
in
the
natural
course
of
the
disease
was
a
question
which
did
not
exist
for
alyosha
for
he
fully
believed
in
the
spiritual
power
of
his
teacher
and
rejoiced
in
his
fame
in
his
glory
as
though
it
were
his
own
triumph
his
heart
throbbed
and
he
beamed
as
it
were
all
over
when
the
elder
came
out
to
the
gates
of
the
hermitage
into
the
waiting
crowd
of
pilgrims
of
the
humbler
class
who
had
flocked
from
all
parts
of
russia
on
purpose
to
see
the
elder
and
obtain
his
blessing
they
fell
down
before
him
wept
kissed
his
feet
kissed
the
earth
on
which
he
stood
and
wailed
while
the
women
held
up
their
children
to
him
and
brought
him
the
sick
possessed
with
devils
the
elder
spoke
to
them
read
a
brief
prayer
over
them
blessed
them
and
dismissed
them
of
late
he
had
become
so
weak
through
attacks
of
illness
that
he
was
sometimes
unable
to
leave
his
cell
and
the
pilgrims
waited
for
him
to
come
out
for
several
days
alyosha
did
not
wonder
why
they
loved
him
so
why
they
fell
down
before
him
and
wept
with
emotion
merely
at
seeing
his
face
oh
he
understood
that
for
the
humble
soul
of
the
russian
peasant
worn
out
by
grief
and
toil
and
still
more
by
the
everlasting
injustice
and
everlasting
sin
his
own
and
the
worlds
it
was
the
greatest
need
and
comfort
to
find
some
one
or
something
holy
to
fall
down
before
and
worship
among
us
there
is
sin
injustice
and
temptation
but
yet
somewhere
on
earth
there
is
some
one
holy
and
exalted
he
has
the
truth
he
knows
the
truth
so
it
is
not
dead
upon
the
earth
so
it
will
come
one
day
to
us
too
and
rule
over
all
the
earth
according
to
the
promise
alyosha
knew
that
this
was
just
how
the
people
felt
and
even
reasoned
he
understood
it
but
that
the
elder
zossima
was
this
saint
and
custodian
of
gods
truthof
that
he
had
no
more
doubt
than
the
weeping
peasants
and
the
sick
women
who
held
out
their
children
to
the
elder
the
conviction
that
after
his
death
the
elder
would
bring
extraordinary
glory
to
the
monastery
was
even
stronger
in
alyosha
than
in
any
one
there
and
of
late
a
kind
of
deep
flame
of
inner
ecstasy
burnt
more
and
more
strongly
in
his
heart
he
was
not
at
all
troubled
at
this
elders
standing
as
a
solitary
example
before
him
no
matter
he
is
holy
he
carries
in
his
heart
the
secret
of
renewal
for
all
that
power
which
will
at
last
establish
truth
on
the
earth
and
all
men
will
be
holy
and
love
one
another
and
there
will
be
no
more
rich
nor
poor
no
exalted
nor
humbled
but
all
will
be
as
the
children
of
god
and
the
true
kingdom
of
christ
will
come
that
was
the
dream
in
alyoshas
heart
the
arrival
of
his
two
brothers
whom
he
had
not
known
till
then
seemed
to
make
a
great
impression
on
alyosha
he
more
quickly
made
friends
with
his
halfbrother
dmitri
though
he
arrived
later
than
with
his
own
brother
ivan
he
was
extremely
interested
in
his
brother
ivan
but
when
the
latter
had
been
two
months
in
the
town
though
they
had
met
fairly
often
they
were
still
not
intimate
alyosha
was
naturally
silent
and
he
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
ashamed
about
something
while
his
brother
ivan
though
alyosha
noticed
at
first
that
he
looked
long
and
curiously
at
him
seemed
soon
to
have
left
off
thinking
of
him
alyosha
noticed
it
with
some
embarrassment
he
ascribed
his
brothers
indifference
at
first
to
the
disparity
of
their
age
and
education
but
he
also
wondered
whether
the
absence
of
curiosity
and
sympathy
in
ivan
might
be
due
to
some
other
cause
entirely
unknown
to
him
he
kept
fancying
that
ivan
was
absorbed
in
somethingsomething
inward
and
importantthat
he
was
striving
towards
some
goal
perhaps
very
hard
to
attain
and
that
that
was
why
he
had
no
thought
for
him
alyosha
wondered
too
whether
there
was
not
some
contempt
on
the
part
of
the
learned
atheist
for
hima
foolish
novice
he
knew
for
certain
that
his
brother
was
an
atheist
he
could
not
take
offense
at
this
contempt
if
it
existed
yet
with
an
uneasy
embarrassment
which
he
did
not
himself
understand
he
waited
for
his
brother
to
come
nearer
to
him
dmitri
used
to
speak
of
ivan
with
the
deepest
respect
and
with
a
peculiar
earnestness
from
him
alyosha
learnt
all
the
details
of
the
important
affair
which
had
of
late
formed
such
a
close
and
remarkable
bond
between
the
two
elder
brothers
dmitris
enthusiastic
references
to
ivan
were
the
more
striking
in
alyoshas
eyes
since
dmitri
was
compared
with
ivan
almost
uneducated
and
the
two
brothers
were
such
a
contrast
in
personality
and
character
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
two
men
more
unlike
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
meeting
or
rather
gathering
of
the
members
of
this
inharmonious
family
took
place
in
the
cell
of
the
elder
who
had
such
an
extraordinary
influence
on
alyosha
the
pretext
for
this
gathering
was
a
false
one
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
discord
between
dmitri
and
his
father
seemed
at
its
acutest
stage
and
their
relations
had
become
insufferably
strained
fyodor
pavlovitch
seems
to
have
been
the
first
to
suggest
apparently
in
joke
that
they
should
all
meet
in
father
zossimas
cell
and
that
without
appealing
to
his
direct
intervention
they
might
more
decently
come
to
an
understanding
under
the
conciliating
influence
of
the
elders
presence
dmitri
who
had
never
seen
the
elder
naturally
supposed
that
his
father
was
trying
to
intimidate
him
but
as
he
secretly
blamed
himself
for
his
outbursts
of
temper
with
his
father
on
several
recent
occasions
he
accepted
the
challenge
it
must
be
noted
that
he
was
not
like
ivan
staying
with
his
father
but
living
apart
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
it
happened
that
pyotr
alexandrovitch
misov
who
was
staying
in
the
district
at
the
time
caught
eagerly
at
the
idea
a
liberal
of
the
forties
and
fifties
a
freethinker
and
atheist
he
may
have
been
led
on
by
boredom
or
the
hope
of
frivolous
diversion
he
was
suddenly
seized
with
the
desire
to
see
the
monastery
and
the
holy
man
as
his
lawsuit
with
the
monastery
still
dragged
on
he
made
it
the
pretext
for
seeing
the
superior
in
order
to
attempt
to
settle
it
amicably
a
visitor
coming
with
such
laudable
intentions
might
be
received
with
more
attention
and
consideration
than
if
he
came
from
simple
curiosity
influences
from
within
the
monastery
were
brought
to
bear
on
the
elder
who
of
late
had
scarcely
left
his
cell
and
had
been
forced
by
illness
to
deny
even
his
ordinary
visitors
in
the
end
he
consented
to
see
them
and
the
day
was
fixed
who
has
made
me
a
judge
over
them
was
all
he
said
smilingly
to
alyosha
alyosha
was
much
perturbed
when
he
heard
of
the
proposed
visit
of
all
the
wrangling
quarrelsome
party
dmitri
was
the
only
one
who
could
regard
the
interview
seriously
all
the
others
would
come
from
frivolous
motives
perhaps
insulting
to
the
elder
alyosha
was
well
aware
of
that
ivan
and
misov
would
come
from
curiosity
perhaps
of
the
coarsest
kind
while
his
father
might
be
contemplating
some
piece
of
buffoonery
though
he
said
nothing
alyosha
thoroughly
understood
his
father
the
boy
i
repeat
was
far
from
being
so
simple
as
every
one
thought
him
he
awaited
the
day
with
a
heavy
heart
no
doubt
he
was
always
pondering
in
his
mind
how
the
family
discord
could
be
ended
but
his
chief
anxiety
concerned
the
elder
he
trembled
for
him
for
his
glory
and
dreaded
any
affront
to
him
especially
the
refined
courteous
irony
of
misov
and
the
supercilious
halfutterances
of
the
highly
educated
ivan
he
even
wanted
to
venture
on
warning
the
elder
telling
him
something
about
them
but
on
second
thoughts
said
nothing
he
only
sent
word
the
day
before
through
a
friend
to
his
brother
dmitri
that
he
loved
him
and
expected
him
to
keep
his
promise
dmitri
wondered
for
he
could
not
remember
what
he
had
promised
but
he
answered
by
letter
that
he
would
do
his
utmost
not
to
let
himself
be
provoked
by
vileness
but
that
although
he
had
a
deep
respect
for
the
elder
and
for
his
brother
ivan
he
was
convinced
that
the
meeting
was
either
a
trap
for
him
or
an
unworthy
farce
nevertheless
i
would
rather
bite
out
my
tongue
than
be
lacking
in
respect
to
the
sainted
man
whom
you
reverence
so
highly
he
wrote
in
conclusion
alyosha
was
not
greatly
cheered
by
the

they
arrive
at
the
monastery
it
was
a
warm
bright
day
at
the
end
of
august
the
interview
with
the
elder
had
been
fixed
for
halfpast
eleven
immediately
after
late
mass
our
visitors
did
not
take
part
in
the
service
but
arrived
just
as
it
was
over
first
an
elegant
open
carriage
drawn
by
two
valuable
horses
drove
up
with
misov
and
a
distant
relative
of
his
a
young
man
of
twenty
called
pyotr
fomitch
kalganov
this
young
man
was
preparing
to
enter
the
university
misov
with
whom
he
was
staying
for
the
time
was
trying
to
persuade
him
to
go
abroad
to
the
university
of
zurich
or
jena
the
young
man
was
still
undecided
he
was
thoughtful
and
absentminded
he
was
nice
looking
strongly
built
and
rather
tall
there
was
a
strange
fixity
in
his
gaze
at
times
like
all
very
absentminded
people
he
would
sometimes
stare
at
a
person
without
seeing
him
he
was
silent
and
rather
awkward
but
sometimes
when
he
was
alone
with
any
one
he
became
talkative
and
effusive
and
would
laugh
at
anything
or
nothing
but
his
animation
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
appeared
he
was
always
well
and
even
elaborately
dressed
he
had
already
some
independent
fortune
and
expectations
of
much
more
he
was
a
friend
of
alyoshas
in
an
ancient
jolting
but
roomy
hired
carriage
with
a
pair
of
old
pinkishgray
horses
a
long
way
behind
misovs
carriage
came
fyodor
pavlovitch
with
his
son
ivan
dmitri
was
late
though
he
had
been
informed
of
the
time
the
evening
before
the
visitors
left
their
carriage
at
the
hotel
outside
the
precincts
and
went
to
the
gates
of
the
monastery
on
foot
except
fyodor
pavlovitch
none
of
the
party
had
ever
seen
the
monastery
and
misov
had
probably
not
even
been
to
church
for
thirty
years
he
looked
about
him
with
curiosity
together
with
assumed
ease
but
except
the
church
and
the
domestic
buildings
though
these
too
were
ordinary
enough
he
found
nothing
of
interest
in
the
interior
of
the
monastery
the
last
of
the
worshippers
were
coming
out
of
the
church
bareheaded
and
crossing
themselves
among
the
humbler
people
were
a
few
of
higher
ranktwo
or
three
ladies
and
a
very
old
general
they
were
all
staying
at
the
hotel
our
visitors
were
at
once
surrounded
by
beggars
but
none
of
them
gave
them
anything
except
young
kalganov
who
took
a
ten
copeck
piece
out
of
his
purse
and
nervous
and
embarrassedgod
knows
whyhurriedly
gave
it
to
an
old
woman
saying
divide
it
equally
none
of
his
companions
made
any
remark
upon
it
so
that
he
had
no
reason
to
be
embarrassed
but
perceiving
this
he
was
even
more
overcome
it
was
strange
that
their
arrival
did
not
seem
expected
and
that
they
were
not
received
with
special
honor
though
one
of
them
had
recently
made
a
donation
of
a
thousand
roubles
while
another
was
a
very
wealthy
and
highly
cultured
landowner
upon
whom
all
in
the
monastery
were
in
a
sense
dependent
as
a
decision
of
the
lawsuit
might
at
any
moment
put
their
fishing
rights
in
his
hands
yet
no
official
personage
met
them
misov
looked
absentmindedly
at
the
tombstones
round
the
church
and
was
on
the
point
of
saying
that
the
dead
buried
here
must
have
paid
a
pretty
penny
for
the
right
of
lying
in
this
holy
place
but
refrained
his
liberal
irony
was
rapidly
changing
almost
into
anger
who
the
devil
is
there
to
ask
in
this
imbecile
place
we
must
find
out
for
time
is
passing
he
observed
suddenly
as
though
speaking
to
himself
all
at
once
there
came
up
a
baldheaded
elderly
man
with
ingratiating
little
eyes
wearing
a
full
summer
overcoat
lifting
his
hat
he
introduced
himself
with
a
honeyed
lisp
as
maximov
a
landowner
of
tula
he
at
once
entered
into

visitors

i
know
its
the
other
side
of
the
copse
observed
fyodor
pavlovitch
but
we
dont
remember
the
way
it
is
a
long
time
since
weve
been
here
this
way
by
this

and
straight
across
the

this

this
way
they
came
out
of
the
gate
and
turned
towards
the
copse
maximov
a
man
of
sixty
ran
rather
than
walked
turning
sideways
to
stare
at
them
all
with
an
incredible
degree
of
nervous
curiosity
his
eyes
looked
starting
out
of
his
head
you
see
we
have
come
to
the
elder
upon
business
of
our
own
observed
misov
severely
that
personage
has
granted
us
an
audience
so
to
speak
and
so
though
we
thank
you
for
showing
us
the
way
we
cannot
ask
you
to
accompany
us
ive
been
there
ive
been
already
un
chevalier
parfait
and
maximov
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
air
who
is
a
chevalier
asked
misov
the
elder
the
splendid
elder
the
elder
the
honor
and
glory
of
the
monastery
zossima
such
an
elder
but
his
incoherent
talk
was
cut
short
by
a
very
pale
wanlooking
monk
of
medium
height
wearing
a
monks
cap
who
overtook
them
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
misov
stopped
the
monk
with
an
extremely
courteous
profound
bow
announced
the
father
superior
invites
all
of
you
gentlemen
to
dine
with
him
after
your
visit
to
the
hermitage
at
one
oclock
not
later
and
you
also
he
added
addressing
maximov
that
i
certainly
will
without
fail
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
hugely
delighted
at
the
invitation
and
believe
me
weve
all
given
our
word
to
behave
properly
here
and
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
will
you
go
too
yes
of
course
what
have
i
come
for
but
to
study
all
the
customs
here
the
only
obstacle
to
me
is
your
company
yes
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
nonexistent
as
yet
it
would
be
a
capital
thing
if
he
didnt
turn
up
do
you
suppose
i
like
all
this
business
and
in
your
company
too
so
we
will
come
to
dinner
thank
the
father
superior
he
said
to
the
monk
no
it
is
my
duty
now
to
conduct
you
to
the
elder
answered
the
monk
if
so
ill
go
straight
to
the
father
superiorto
the
father
superior
babbled
maximov
the
father
superior
is
engaged
just
now
but
as
you
please
the
monk
hesitated
impertinent
old
man
misov
observed
aloud
while
maximov
ran
back
to
the
monastery
hes
like
von
sohn
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
suddenly
is
that
all
you
can
think
of
in
what
way
is
he
like
von
sohn
have
you
ever
seen
von
sohn
ive
seen
his
portrait
its
not
the
features
but
something
indefinable
hes
a
second
von
sohn
i
can
always
tell
from
the
physiognomy
ah
i
dare
say
you
are
a
connoisseur
in
that
but
look
here
fyodor
pavlovitch
you
said
just
now
that
we
had
given
our
word
to
behave
properly
remember
it
i
advise
you
to
control
yourself
but
if
you
begin
to
play
the
fool
i
dont
intend
to
be
associated
with
you
here
you
see
what
a
man
he
ishe
turned
to
the
monkim
afraid
to
go
among
decent
people
with
him
a
fine
smile
not
without
a
certain
slyness
came
on
to
the
pale
bloodless
lips
of
the
monk
but
he
made
no
reply
and
was
evidently
silent
from
a
sense
of
his
own
dignity
misov
frowned
more
than
ever
oh
devil
take
them
all
an
outer
show
elaborated
through
centuries
and
nothing
but
charlatanism
and
nonsense
underneath
flashed
through
misovs
mind
heres
the
hermitage
weve
arrived
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
the
gates
are
shut
and
he
repeatedly
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
to
the
saints
painted
above
and
on
the
sides
of
the
gates
when
you
go
to
rome
you
must
do
as
the
romans
do
here
in
this
hermitage
there
are
twentyfive
saints
being
saved
they
look
at
one
another
and
eat
cabbages
and
not
one
woman
goes
in
at
this
gate
thats
what
is
remarkable
and
that
really
is
so
but
i
did
hear
that
the
elder
receives
ladies
he
remarked
suddenly
to
the
monk
women
of
the
people
are
here
too
now
lying
in
the
portico
there
waiting
but
for
ladies
of
higher
rank
two
rooms
have
been
built
adjoining
the
portico
but
outside
the
precinctsyou
can
see
the
windowsand
the
elder
goes
out
to
them
by
an
inner
passage
when
he
is
well
enough
they
are
always
outside
the
precincts
there
is
a
harkov
lady
madame
hohlakov
waiting
there
now
with
her
sick
daughter
probably
he
has
promised
to
come
out
to
her
though
of
late
he
has
been
so
weak
that
he
has
hardly
shown
himself
even
to
the
people
so
then
there
are
loopholes
after
all
to
creep
out
of
the
hermitage
to
the
ladies
dont
suppose
holy
father
that
i
mean
any
harm
but
do
you
know
that
at
athos
not
only
the
visits
of
women
are
not
allowed
but
no
creature
of
the
female
sexno
hens
nor
turkeyhens
nor
cows
fyodor
pavlovitch
i
warn
you
i
shall
go
back
and
leave
you
here
theyll
turn
you
out
when
im
gone
but
im
not
interfering
with
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
look
he
cried
suddenly
stepping
within
the
precincts
what
a
vale
of
roses
they
live
in
though
there
were
no
roses
now
there
were
numbers
of
rare
and
beautiful
autumn
flowers
growing
wherever
there
was
space
for
them
and
evidently
tended
by
a
skillful
hand
there
were
flowerbeds
round
the
church
and
between
the
tombs
and
the
onestoried
wooden
house
where
the
elder
lived
was
also
surrounded
with
flowers
and
was
it
like
this
in
the
time
of
the
last
elder
varsonofy
he
didnt
care
for
such
elegance
they
say
he
used
to
jump
up
and
thrash
even
ladies
with
a
stick
observed
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
he
went
up
the
steps
the
elder
varsonofy
did
sometimes
seem
rather
strange
but
a
great
deal
thats
told
is
foolishness
he
never
thrashed
any
one
answered
the
monk
now
gentlemen
if
you
will
wait
a
minute
i
will
announce
you
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
the
last
time
your
compact
do
you
hear
behave
properly
or
i
will
pay
you
out
misov
had
time
to
mutter
again
i
cant
think
why
you
are
so
agitated
fyodor
pavlovitch
observed
sarcastically
are
you
uneasy
about
your
sins
they
say
he
can
tell
by
ones
eyes
what
one
has
come
about
and
what
a
lot
you
think
of
their
opinion
you
a
parisian
and
so
advanced
im
surprised
at
you
but
misov
had
no
time
to
reply
to
this
sarcasm
they
were
asked
to
come
in
he
walked
in
somewhat
irritated
now
i
know
myself
i
am
annoyed
i
shall
lose
my
temper
and
begin
to
quarreland
lower
myself
and
my
ideas
he
reflected
chapter
ii
the
old
buffoon
they
entered
the
room
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
the
elder
came
in
from
his
bedroom
there
were
already
in
the
cell
awaiting
the
elder
two
monks
of
the
hermitage
one
the
father
librarian
and
the
other
father
passy
a
very
learned
man
so
they
said
in
delicate
health
though
not
old
there
was
also
a
tall
young
man
who
looked
about
two
and
twenty
standing
in
the
corner
throughout
the
interview
he
had
a
broad
fresh
face
and
clever
observant
narrow
brown
eyes
and
was
wearing
ordinary
dress
he
was
a
divinity
student
living
under
the
protection
of
the
monastery
his
expression
was
one
of
unquestioning
but
selfrespecting
reverence
being
in
a
subordinate
and
dependent
position
and
so
not
on
an
equality
with
the
guests
he
did
not
greet
them
with
a
bow
father
zossima
was
accompanied
by
a
novice
and
by
alyosha
the
two
monks
rose
and
greeted
him
with
a
very
deep
bow
touching
the
ground
with
their
fingers
then
kissed
his
hand
blessing
them
the
elder
replied
with
as
deep
a
reverence
to
them
and
asked
their
blessing
the
whole
ceremony
was
performed
very
seriously
and
with
an
appearance
of
feeling
not
like
an
everyday
rite
but
misov
fancied
that
it
was
all
done
with
intentional
impressiveness
he
stood
in
front
of
the
other
visitors
he
oughthe
had
reflected
upon
it
the
evening
beforefrom
simple
politeness
since
it
was
the
custom
here
to
have
gone
up
to
receive
the
elders
blessing
even
if
he
did
not
kiss
his
hand
but
when
he
saw
all
this
bowing
and
kissing
on
the
part
of
the
monks
he
instantly
changed
his
mind
with
dignified
gravity
he
made
a
rather
deep
conventional
bow
and
moved
away
to
a
chair
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
the
same
mimicking
misov
like
an
ape
ivan
bowed
with
great
dignity
and
courtesy
but
he
too
kept
his
hands
at
his
sides
while
kalganov
was
so
confused
that
he
did
not
bow
at
all
the
elder
let
fall
the
hand
raised
to
bless
them
and
bowing
to
them
again
asked
them
all
to
sit
down
the
blood
rushed
to
alyoshas
cheeks
he
was
ashamed
his
forebodings
were
coming
true
father
zossima
sat
down
on
a
very
oldfashioned
mahogany
sofa
covered
with
leather
and
made
his
visitors
sit
down
in
a
row
along
the
opposite
wall
on
four
mahogany
chairs
covered
with
shabby
black
leather
the
monks
sat
one
at
the
door
and
the
other
at
the
window
the
divinity
student
the
novice
and
alyosha
remained
standing
the
cell
was
not
very
large
and
had
a
faded
look
it
contained
nothing
but
the
most
necessary
furniture
of
coarse
and
poor
quality
there
were
two
pots
of
flowers
in
the
window
and
a
number
of
holy
pictures
in
the
corner
before
one
huge
ancient
ikon
of
the
virgin
a
lamp
was
burning
near
it
were
two
other
holy
pictures
in
shining
settings
and
next
them
carved
cherubims
china
eggs
a
catholic
cross
of
ivory
with
a
mater
dolorosa
embracing
it
and
several
foreign
engravings
from
the
great
italian
artists
of
past
centuries
next
to
these
costly
and
artistic
engravings
were
several
of
the
roughest
russian
prints
of
saints
and
martyrs
such
as
are
sold
for
a
few
farthings
at
all
the
fairs
on
the
other
walls
were
portraits
of
russian
bishops
past
and
present
misov
took
a
cursory
glance
at
all
these
conventional
surroundings
and
bent
an
intent
look
upon
the
elder
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
his
own
insight
a
weakness
excusable
in
him
as
he
was
fifty
an
age
at
which
a
clever
man
of
the
world
of
established
position
can
hardly
help
taking
himself
rather
seriously
at
the
first
moment
he
did
not
like
zossima
there
was
indeed
something
in
the
elders
face
which
many
people
besides
misov
might
not
have
liked
he
was
a
short
bent
little
man
with
very
weak
legs
and
though
he
was
only
sixtyfive
he
looked
at
least
ten
years
older
his
face
was
very
thin
and
covered
with
a
network
of
fine
wrinkles
particularly
numerous
about
his
eyes
which
were
small
lightcolored
quick
and
shining
like
two
bright
points
he
had
a
sprinkling
of
gray
hair
about
his
temples
his
pointed
beard
was
small
and
scanty
and
his
lips
which
smiled
frequently
were
as
thin
as
two
threads
his
nose
was
not
long
but
sharp
like
a
birds
beak
to
all
appearances
a
malicious
soul
full
of
petty
pride
thought
misov
he
felt
altogether
dissatisfied
with
his
position
a
cheap
little
clock
on
the
wall
struck
twelve
hurriedly
and
served
to
begin
the
conversation
precisely
to
our
time
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
but
no
sign
of
my
son
dmitri
i
apologize
for
him
sacred
elder
alyosha
shuddered
all
over
at
sacred
elder
i
am
always
punctual
myself
minute
for
minute
remembering
that
punctuality
is
the
courtesy
of
kings
but
you
are
not
a
king
anyway
misov
muttered
losing
his
self
restraint
at
once
yes
thats
true
im
not
a
king
and
would
you
believe
it
pyotr
alexandrovitch
i
was
aware
of
that
myself
but
there
i
always
say
the
wrong
thing
your
reverence
he
cried
with
sudden
pathos
you
behold
before
you
a
buffoon
in
earnest
i
introduce
myself
as
such
its
an
old
habit
alas
and
if
i
sometimes
talk
nonsense
out
of
place
its
with
an
object
with
the
object
of
amusing
people
and
making
myself
agreeable
one
must
be
agreeable
mustnt
one
i
was
seven
years
ago
in
a
little
town
where
i
had
business
and
i
made
friends
with
some
merchants
there
we
went
to
the
captain
of
police
because
we
had
to
see
him
about
something
and
to
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
he
was
a
tall
fat
fair
sulky
man
the
most
dangerous
type
in
such
cases
its
their
liver
i
went
straight
up
to
him
and
with
the
ease
of
a
man
of
the
world
you
know
mr
ispravnik
said
i
be
our
napravnik
what
do
you
mean
by
napravnik
said
he
i
saw
at
the
first
halfsecond
that
it
had
missed
fire
he
stood
there
so
glum
i
wanted
to
make
a
joke
said
i
for
the
general
diversion
as
mr
napravnik
is
our
wellknown
russian
orchestra
conductor
and
what
we
need
for
the
harmony
of
our
undertaking
is
some
one
of
that
sort
and
i
explained
my
comparison
very
reasonably
didnt
i
excuse
me
said
he
i
am
an
ispravnik
and
i
do
not
allow
puns
to
be
made
on
my
calling
he
turned
and
walked
away
i
followed
him
shouting
yes
yes
you
are
an
ispravnik
not
a
napravnik
no
he
said
since
you
called
me
a
napravnik
i
am
one
and
would
you
believe
it
it
ruined
our
business
and
im
always
like
that
always
like
that
always
injuring
myself
with
my
politeness
once
many
years
ago
i
said
to
an
influential
person
your
wife
is
a
ticklish
lady
in
an
honorable
sense
of
the
moral
qualities
so
to
speak
but
he
asked
me
why
have
you
tickled
her
i
thought
id
be
polite
so
i
couldnt
help
saying
yes
and
he
gave
me
a
fine
tickling
on
the
spot
only
that
happened
long
ago
so
im
not
ashamed
to
tell
the
story
im
always
injuring
myself
like
that
youre
doing
it
now
muttered
misov
with
disgust
father
zossima
scrutinized
them
both
in
silence
am
i
would
you
believe
it
i
was
aware
of
that
too
pyotr
alexandrovitch
and
let
me
tell
you
indeed
i
foresaw
i
should
as
soon
as
i
began
to
speak
and
do
you
know
i
foresaw
too
that
youd
be
the
first
to
remark
on
it
the
minute
i
see
my
joke
isnt
coming
off
your
reverence
both
my
cheeks
feel
as
though
they
were
drawn
down
to
the
lower
jaw
and
there
is
almost
a
spasm
in
them
thats
been
so
since
i
was
young
when
i
had
to
make
jokes
for
my
living
in
noblemens
families
i
am
an
inveterate
buffoon
and
have
been
from
birth
up
your
reverence
its
as
though
it
were
a
craze
in
me
i
dare
say
its
a
devil
within
me
but
only
a
little
one
a
more
serious
one
would
have
chosen
another
lodging
but
not
your
soul
pyotr
alexandrovitch
youre
not
a
lodging
worth
having
either
but
i
do
believei
believe
in
god
though
i
have
had
doubts
of
late
but
now
i
sit
and
await
words
of
wisdom
im
like
the
philosopher
diderot
your
reverence
did
you
ever
hear
most
holy
father
how
diderot
went
to
see
the
metropolitan
platon
in
the
time
of
the
empress
catherine
he
went
in
and
said
straight
out
there
is
no
god
to
which
the
great
bishop
lifted
up
his
finger
and
answered
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
and
he
fell
down
at
his
feet
on
the
spot
i
believe
he
cried
and
will
be
christened
and
so
he
was
princess
dashkov
was
his
godmother
and
potyomkin
his
godfather
fyodor
pavlovitch
this
is
unbearable
you
know
youre
telling
lies
and
that
that
stupid
anecdote
isnt
true
why
are
you
playing
the
fool
cried
misov
in
a
shaking
voice
i
suspected
all
my
life
that
it
wasnt
true
fyodor
pavlovitch
cried
with
conviction
but
ill
tell
you
the
whole
truth
gentlemen
great
elder
forgive
me
the
last
thing
about
diderots
christening
i
made
up
just
now
i
never
thought
of
it
before
i
made
it
up
to
add
piquancy
i
play
the
fool
pyotr
alexandrovitch
to
make
myself
agreeable
though
i
really
dont
know
myself
sometimes
what
i
do
it
for
and
as
for
diderot
i
heard
as
far
as
the
fool
hath
said
in
his
heart
twenty
times
from
the
gentry
about
here
when
i
was
young
i
heard
your
aunt
pyotr
alexandrovitch
tell
the
story
they
all
believe
to
this
day
that
the
infidel
diderot
came
to
dispute
about
god
with
the
metropolitan
platon
misov
got
up
forgetting
himself
in
his
impatience
he
was
furious
and
conscious
of
being
ridiculous
what
was
taking
place
in
the
cell
was
really
incredible
for
forty
or
fifty
years
past
from
the
times
of
former
elders
no
visitors
had
entered
that
cell
without
feelings
of
the
profoundest
veneration
almost
every
one
admitted
to
the
cell
felt
that
a
great
favor
was
being
shown
him
many
remained
kneeling
during
the
whole
visit
of
those
visitors
many
had
been
men
of
high
rank
and
learning
some
even
freethinkers
attracted
by
curiosity
but
all
without
exception
had
shown
the
profoundest
reverence
and
delicacy
for
here
there
was
no
question
of
money
but
only
on
the
one
side
love
and
kindness
and
on
the
other
penitence
and
eager
desire
to
decide
some
spiritual
problem
or
crisis
so
that
such
buffoonery
amazed
and
bewildered
the
spectators
or
at
least
some
of
them
the
monks
with
unchanged
countenances
waited
with
earnest
attention
to
hear
what
the
elder
would
say
but
seemed
on
the
point
of
standing
up
like
misov
alyosha
stood
with
hanging
head
on
the
verge
of
tears
what
seemed
to
him
strangest
of
all
was
that
his
brother
ivan
on
whom
alone
he
had
rested
his
hopes
and
who
alone
had
such
influence
on
his
father
that
he
could
have
stopped
him
sat
now
quite
unmoved
with
downcast
eyes
apparently
waiting
with
interest
to
see
how
it
would
end
as
though
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
alyosha
did
not
dare
to
look
at
rakitin
the
divinity
student
whom
he
knew
almost
intimately
he
alone
in
the
monastery
knew
rakitins
thoughts
forgive
me
began
misov
addressing
father
zossima
for
perhaps
i
seem
to
be
taking
part
in
this
shameful
foolery
i
made
a
mistake
in
believing
that
even
a
man
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
would
understand
what
was
due
on
a
visit
to
so
honored
a
personage
i
did
not
suppose
i
should
have
to
apologize
simply
for
having
come
with
him
pyotr
alexandrovitch
could
say
no
more
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
overwhelmed
with
confusion
dont
distress
yourself
i
beg
the
elder
got
on
to
his
feeble
legs
and
taking
pyotr
alexandrovitch
by
both
hands
made
him
sit
down
again
i
beg
you
not
to
disturb
yourself
i
particularly
beg
you
to
be
my
guest
and
with
a
bow
he
went
back
and
sat
down
again
on
his
little
sofa
great
elder
speak
do
i
annoy
you
by
my
vivacity
fyodor
pavlovitch
cried
suddenly
clutching
the
arms
of
his
chair
in
both
hands
as
though
ready
to
leap
up
from
it
if
the
answer
were
unfavorable
i
earnestly
beg
you
too
not
to
disturb
yourself
and
not
to
be
uneasy
the
elder
said
impressively
do
not
trouble
make
yourself
quite
at
home
and
above
all
do
not
be
so
ashamed
of
yourself
for
that
is
at
the
root
of
it
all
quite
at
home
to
be
my
natural
self
oh
that
is
much
too
much
but
i
accept
it
with
grateful
joy
do
you
know
blessed
father
youd
better
not
invite
me
to
be
my
natural
self
dont
risk
it
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
that
myself
i
warn
you
for
your
own
sake
well
the
rest
is
still
plunged
in
the
mists
of
uncertainty
though
there
are
people
whod
be
pleased
to
describe
me
for
you
i
mean
that
for
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
but
as
for
you
holy
being
let
me
tell
you
i
am
brimming
over
with
ecstasy
he
got
up
and
throwing
up
his
hands
declaimed
blessed
be
the
womb
that
bare
thee
and
the
paps
that
gave
thee
suckthe
paps
especially
when
you
said
just
now
dont
be
so
ashamed
of
yourself
for
that
is
at
the
root
of
it
all
you
pierced
right
through
me
by
that
remark
and
read
me
to
the
core
indeed
i
always
feel
when
i
meet
people
that
i
am
lower
than
all
and
that
they
all
take
me
for
a
buffoon
so
i
say
let
me
really
play
the
buffoon
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
opinion
for
you
are
every
one
of
you
worse
than
i
am
that
is
why
i
am
a
buffoon
it
is
from
shame
great
elder
from
shame
its
simply
oversensitiveness
that
makes
me
rowdy
if
i
had
only
been
sure
that
every
one
would
accept
me
as
the
kindest
and
wisest
of
men
oh
lord
what
a
good
man
i
should
have
been
then
teacher
he
fell
suddenly
on
his
knees
what
must
i
do
to
gain
eternal
life
it
was
difficult
even
now
to
decide
whether
he
was
joking
or
really
moved
father
zossima
lifting
his
eyes
looked
at
him
and
said
with
a
smile
you
have
known
for
a
long
time
what
you
must
do
you
have
sense
enough
dont
give
way
to
drunkenness
and
incontinence
of
speech
dont
give
way
to
sensual
lust
and
above
all
to
the
love
of
money
and
close
your
taverns
if
you
cant
close
all
at
least
two
or
three
and
above
alldont
lie
you
mean
about
diderot
no
not
about
diderot
above
all
dont
lie
to
yourself
the
man
who
lies
to
himself
and
listens
to
his
own
lie
comes
to
such
a
pass
that
he
cannot
distinguish
the
truth
within
him
or
around
him
and
so
loses
all
respect
for
himself
and
for
others
and
having
no
respect
he
ceases
to
love
and
in
order
to
occupy
and
distract
himself
without
love
he
gives
way
to
passions
and
coarse
pleasures
and
sinks
to
bestiality
in
his
vices
all
from
continual
lying
to
other
men
and
to
himself
the
man
who
lies
to
himself
can
be
more
easily
offended
than
any
one
you
know
it
is
sometimes
very
pleasant
to
take
offense
isnt
it
a
man
may
know
that
nobody
has
insulted
him
but
that
he
has
invented
the
insult
for
himself
has
lied
and
exaggerated
to
make
it
picturesque
has
caught
at
a
word
and
made
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehillhe
knows
that
himself
yet
he
will
be
the
first
to
take
offense
and
will
revel
in
his
resentment
till
he
feels
great
pleasure
in
it
and
so
pass
to
genuine
vindictiveness
but
get
up
sit
down
i
beg
you
all
this
too
is
deceitful
posturing
blessed
man
give
me
your
hand
to
kiss
fyodor
pavlovitch
skipped
up
and
imprinted
a
rapid
kiss
on
the
elders
thin
hand
it
is
it
is
pleasant
to
take
offense
you
said
that
so
well
as
i
never
heard
it
before
yes
i
have
been
all
my
life
taking
offense
to
please
myself
taking
offense
on
esthetic
grounds
for
it
is
not
so
much
pleasant
as
distinguished
sometimes
to
be
insultedthat
you
had
forgotten
great
elder
it
is
distinguished
i
shall
make
a
note
of
that
but
i
have
been
lying
lying
positively
my
whole
life
long
every
day
and
hour
of
it
of
a
truth
i
am
a
lie
and
the
father
of
lies
though
i
believe
i
am
not
the
father
of
lies
i
am
getting
mixed
in
my
texts
say
the
son
of
lies
and
that
will
be
enough
only

my
angel

i
may
sometimes
talk
about
diderot
diderot
will
do
no
harm
though
sometimes
a
word
will
do
harm
great
elder
by
the
way
i
was
forgetting
though
i
had
been
meaning
for
the
last
two
years
to
come
here
on
purpose
to
ask
and
to
find
out
something
only
do
tell
pyotr
alexandrovitch
not
to
interrupt
me
here
is
my
question
is
it
true
great
father
that
the
story
is
told
somewhere
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
of
a
holy
saint
martyred
for
his
faith
who
when
his
head
was
cut
off
at
last
stood
up
picked
up
his
head
and
courteously
kissing
it
walked
a
long
way
carrying
it
in
his
hands
is
that
true
or
not
honored
father
no
it
is
untrue
said
the
elder
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
in
all
the
lives
of
the
saints
what
saint
do
you
say
the
story
is
told
of
asked
the
father
librarian
i
do
not
know
what
saint
i
do
not
know
and
cant
tell
i
was
deceived
i
was
told
the
story
i
had
heard
it
and
do
you
know
who
told
it
pyotr
alexandrovitch
misov
here
who
was
so
angry
just
now
about
diderot
he
it
was
who
told
the
story
i
have
never
told
it
you
i
never
speak
to
you
at
all
it
is
true
you
did
not
tell
me
but
you
told
it
when
i
was
present
it
was
three
years
ago
i
mentioned
it
because
by
that
ridiculous
story
you
shook
my
faith
pyotr
alexandrovitch
you
knew
nothing
of
it
but
i
went
home
with
my
faith
shaken
and
i
have
been
getting
more
and
more
shaken
ever
since
yes
pyotr
alexandrovitch
you
were
the
cause
of
a
great
fall
that
was
not
a
diderot
fyodor
pavlovitch
got
excited
and
pathetic
though
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
every
one
by
now
that
he
was
playing
a
part
again
yet
misov
was
stung
by
his
words
what
nonsense
and
it
is
all
nonsense
he
muttered
i
may
really
have
told
it
some
time
or
other

but
not
to
you
i
was
told
it
myself
i
heard
it
in

saints

he
was
a
very
learned
man
who
had
made
a
special
study
of
russian
statistics
and
had
lived
a
long
time
in
russia

misov
was
on
the
point
of
shouting
but
he
suddenly
checked
himself
and
said
with
contempt
you
defile
everything
you
touch
the
elder
suddenly
rose
from
his
seat
excuse
me
gentlemen
for
leaving
you
a
few
minutes
he
said
addressing

a
goodhumored

the
novice
flew
to
escort
him
down
the
steps
alyosha
was
breathless
he
was
glad
to
get
away
but
he
was
glad
too
that
the
elder
was
goodhumored
and
not
offended
father
zossima
was
going
towards
the
portico
to
bless
the
people

fyodor

persisted
in
stopping
him
at

door
of

cried

iii
peasant
women
who
have
faith
near
the
wooden
portico
below
built
on
to
the
outer
wall
of
the
precinct
there
was
a
crowd
of
about
twenty
peasant
women
they
had
been
told
that
the
elder
was
at
last
coming
out
and
they
had
gathered
together
in
anticipation
two
ladies
madame
hohlakov
and
her
daughter
had
also
come
out
into
the
portico
to
wait
for
the
elder
but
in
a
separate
part
of
it
set
aside
for
women
of
rank
madame
hohlakov
was
a
wealthy
lady
still
young
and
attractive
and
always
dressed
with
taste
she
was
rather
pale
and
had
lively
black
eyes
she
was
not
more
than
thirtythree
and
had
been
five
years
a
widow
her
daughter
a
girl
of
fourteen
was
partially
paralyzed
the
poor
child
had
not
been
able
to
walk
for
the
last
six
months
and
was
wheeled
about
in
a
long
reclining
chair
she
had
a
charming
little
face
rather
thin
from
illness
but
full
of
gayety
there
was
a
gleam
of
mischief
in
her
big
dark
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
her
mother
had
been
intending
to
take
her
abroad
ever
since
the
spring
but
they
had
been
detained
all
the
summer
by
business
connected
with
their
estate
they
had
been
staying
a
week
in
our
town
where
they
had
come
more
for
purposes
of
business
than
devotion
but
had
visited
father
zossima
once
already
three
days
before
though
they
knew
that
the
elder
scarcely
saw
any
one
they
had
now
suddenly
turned
up
again
and
urgently
entreated
the
happiness
of
looking
once
again
on
the
great
healer
the
mother
was
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
side
of
her
daughters
invalid
carriage
and
two
paces
from
her
stood
an
old
monk
not
one
of
our
monastery
but
a
visitor
from
an
obscure
religious
house
in
the
far
north
he
too
sought
the
elders
blessing
but
father
zossima
on
entering
the
portico
went
first
straight
to
the
peasants
who
were
crowded
at
the
foot
of
the
three
steps
that
led
up
into
the
portico
father
zossima
stood
on
the
top
step
put
on
his
stole
and
began
blessing
the
women
who
thronged
about
him
one
crazy
woman
was
led
up
to
him
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
elder
she
began
shrieking
and
writhing
as
though
in
the
pains
of
childbirth
laying
the
stole
on
her
forehead
he
read
a
short
prayer
over
her
and
she
was
at
once
soothed
and
quieted
i
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
now
but
in
my
childhood
i
often
happened
to
see
and
hear
these
possessed
women
in
the
villages
and
monasteries
they
used
to
be
brought
to
mass
they
would
squeal
and
bark
like
a
dog
so
that
they
were
heard
all
over
the
church
but
when
the
sacrament
was
carried
in
and
they
were
led
up
to
it
at
once
the
possession
ceased
and
the
sick
women
were
always
soothed
for
a
time
i
was
greatly
impressed
and
amazed
at
this
as
a
child
but
then
i
heard
from
country
neighbors
and
from
my
town
teachers
that
the
whole
illness
was
simulated
to
avoid
work
and
that
it
could
always
be
cured
by
suitable
severity
various
anecdotes
were
told
to
confirm
this
but
later
on
i
learnt
with
astonishment
from
medical
specialists
that
there
is
no
pretense
about
it
that
it
is
a
terrible
illness
to
which
women
are
subject
specially
prevalent
among
us
in
russia
and
that
it
is
due
to
the
hard
lot
of
the
peasant
women
it
is
a
disease
i
was
told
arising
from
exhausting
toil
too
soon
after
hard
abnormal
and
unassisted
labor
in
childbirth
and
from
the
hopeless
misery
from
beatings
and
so
on
which
some
women
were
not
able
to
endure
like
others
the
strange
and
instant
healing
of
the
frantic
and
struggling
woman
as
soon
as
she
was
led
up
to
the
holy
sacrament
which
had
been
explained
to
me
as
due
to
malingering
and
the
trickery
of
the
clericals
arose
probably
in
the
most
natural
manner
both
the
women
who
supported
her
and
the
invalid
herself
fully
believed
as
a
truth
beyond
question
that
the
evil
spirit
in
possession
of
her
could
not
hold
out
if
the
sick
woman
were
brought
to
the
sacrament
and
made
to
bow
down
before
it
and
so
with
a
nervous
and
psychically
deranged
woman
a
sort
of
convulsion
of
the
whole
organism
always
took
place
and
was
bound
to
take
place
at
the
moment
of
bowing
down
to
the
sacrament
aroused
by
the
expectation
of
the
miracle
of
healing
and
the
implicit
belief
that
it
would
come
to
pass
and
it
did
come
to
pass
though
only
for
a
moment
it
was
exactly
the
same
now
as
soon
as
the
elder
touched
the
sick
woman
with
the
stole
many
of
the
women
in
the
crowd
were
moved
to
tears
of
ecstasy
by
the
effect
of
the
moment
some
strove
to
kiss
the
hem
of
his
garment
others
cried
out
in
singsong
voices
he
blessed
them
all
and
talked
with
some
of
them
the
possessed
woman
he
knew
already
she
came
from
a
village
only
six
versts
from
the
monastery
and
had
been
brought
to
him
before
but
here
is
one
from
afar
he
pointed
to
a
woman
by
no
means
old
but
very
thin
and
wasted
with
a
face
not
merely
sunburnt
but
almost
blackened
by
exposure
she
was
kneeling
and
gazing
with
a
fixed
stare
at
the
elder
there
was
something
almost
frenzied
in
her
eyes
from
afar
off
father
from
afar
off
from
two
hundred
miles
from
here
from
afar
off
father
from
afar
off
the
woman
began
in
a
singsong
voice
as
though
she
were
chanting
a
dirge
swaying
her
head
from
side
to
side
with
her
cheek
resting
in
her
hand
there
is
silent
and
longsuffering
sorrow
to
be
met
with
among
the
peasantry
it
withdraws
into
itself
and
is
still
but
there
is
a
grief
that
breaks
out
and
from
that
minute
it
bursts
into
tears
and
finds
vent
in
wailing
this
is
particularly
common
with
women
but
it
is
no
lighter
a
grief
than
the
silent
lamentations
comfort
only
by
lacerating
the
heart
still
more
such
grief
does
not
desire
consolation
it
feeds
on
the
sense
of
its
hopelessness
lamentations
spring
only
from
the
constant
craving
to
reopen
the
wound
you
are

the
tradesman
class

mother
said
the
elder
once
in
olden
times
a
holy
saint
saw
in
the
temple
a
mother
like
you
weeping
for
her
little
one
her
only
one
whom
god
had
taken
knowest
thou
not
said
the
saint
to
her
how
bold
these
little
ones
are
before
the
throne
of
god
verily
there
are
none
bolder
than
they
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
thou
didst
give
us
life
o
lord
they
say
and
scarcely
had
we
looked
upon
it
when
thou
didst
take
it
back
again
and
so
boldly
they
ask
and
ask
again
that
god
gives
them
at
once
the
rank
of
angels
therefore
said
the
saint
thou
too
o
mother
rejoice
and
weep
not
for
thy
little
son
is
with
the
lord
in
the
fellowship
of
the
angels
thats
what
the
saint
said
to
the
weeping
mother
of
old
he
was
a
great
saint
and
he
could
not
have
spoken
falsely
therefore
you
too
mother
know
that
your
little
one
is
surely
before
the
throne
of
god
is
rejoicing
and
happy
and
praying
to
god
for
you
and
therefore
weep
not
but
rejoice
the
woman
listened
to
him
looking
down
with
her
cheek
in
her
hand
she
sighed
deeply
my
nikita
tried
to
comfort
me
with
the
same
words
as
you
foolish
one
he
said
why
weep
our
son
is
no
doubt
singing
with
the
angels
before
god
he
says
that
to
me
but
he
weeps
himself
i

like

nikita
said
i
where
could
he
be
if
not
with
the
lord
god
only
here
with
us
now
he
is
not
as
he
used
to
sit
beside
us
before
and
if
only
i
could
look
upon
him
one
little
time
if
only
i
could
peep
at
him
one
little
time
without
going
up
to
him
without
speaking
if
i
could
be
hidden
in
a
corner
and
only
see
him
for
one
little
minute
hear
him
playing
in
the
yard
calling
in
his
little
voice
mammy
where
are
you
if
only
i
could
hear
him
pattering
with
his
little
feet
about
the
room
just
once
only
once
for
so
often
so
often
i
remember
how
he
used
to
run
to
me
and
shout
and
laugh
if
only
i
could
hear
his
little
feet
i
should
know
him
but
hes
gone
father
hes
gone
and
i
shall
never
hear
him
again
heres
his
little
sash
but
him
i
shall
never
see
or
hear
now
she
drew
out
of
her
bosom
her
boys
little
embroidered
sash
and
as
soon
as
she
looked
at
it
she
began
shaking
with
sobs
hiding
her
eyes
with
her
fingers
through
which
the
tears
flowed
in
a
sudden
stream
it
is
rachel
of
old
said
the
elder
weeping
for
her
children
and
will
not
be
comforted
because
they
are
not
such
is
the
lot
set
on
earth
for
you
mothers
be
not
comforted
consolation
is
not
what
you
need
weep
and
be
not
consoled
but
weep
only
every
time
that
you
weep
be
sure
to
remember
that
your
little
son
is
one
of
the
angels
of
god
that
he
looks
down
from
there
at
you
and
sees
you
and
rejoices
at
your
tears
and
points
at
them
to
the
lord
god
and
a
long
while
yet
will
you
keep
that
great
mothers
grief
but
it
will
turn
in
the
end
into
quiet
joy
and
your
bitter
tears
will
be
only
tears
of
tender
sorrow
that
purifies
the
heart
and
delivers
it
from
sin
and
i
shall
pray
for
the
peace
of
your
childs
soul
what
was
his
name
alexey
father
a
sweet
name
after
alexey
the
man
of
god
yes
father
what
a
saint
he
was
i
will
remember
him
mother
and
your
grief
in
my
prayers
and
i
will
pray
for
your
husbands
health
it
is
a
sin
for
you
to
leave
him
your
little
one
will
see
from
heaven
that
you
have
forsaken
his
father
and
will
weep
over
you
why
do
you
trouble
his
happiness
he
is
living
for
the
soul
lives
for
ever
and
though
he
is
not
in
the
house
he
is
near
you
unseen
how
can
he
go
into
the
house
when
you
say
that
the
house
is
hateful
to
you
to
whom
is
he
to
go
if
he
find
you
not
together
his
father
and
mother
he
comes
to
you
in
dreams
now
and
you
grieve
but
then
he
will
send
you
gentle
dreams
go
to
your
husband
mother
go
this
very
day
i
will
go
father
at
your
word

will
go

gone
straight
to
my
heart
my
nikita
my
nikita
you
are
waiting
for
me
the
woman
began
in
a
singsong
voice
but
the
elder
had
already
turned
away
to
a
very
old
woman
dressed
like
a
dweller
in
the
town
not
like
a
pilgrim
her
eyes
showed
that
she
had
come
with
an
object
and
in
order
to
say
something
she
said
she
was
the
widow
of
a
noncommissioned
officer
and
lived
close
by
in
the
town
her
son
vasenka
was
in
the
commissariat
service
and
had
gone
to
irkutsk
in
siberia
he
had
written
twice
from
there
but
now
a
year
had
passed
since
he
had
written
she
did
inquire
about
him
but
she
did
not
know
the
proper
place
to
inquire
only
the
other
day
stepanida
ilyinishnashes
a
rich

wifesaid
to
me
you
go
prohorovna
and
put
your
sons
name
down
for
prayer
in
the
church
and
pray
for
the
peace
of
his
soul
as
though
he
were
dead
his
soul
will
be
troubled
she
said
and
he
will
write
you
a
letter
and
stepanida
ilyinishna
told
me
it
was
a
certain
thing
which
had
been
many
times
tried
only
i
am
in
doubt
oh
you
light
of
ours
is
it
true
or
false
and
would
it
be
right
dont
think
of
it
its
shameful
to
ask
the
question
how
is
it
possible
to
pray
for
the
peace
of
a
living
soul
and
his
own
mother
too
its
a
great
sin
akin
to
sorcery
only
for
your
ignorance
it
is
forgiven
you
better
pray
to
the
queen
of
heaven
our
swift
defense
and
help
for
his
good
health
and
that
she
may
forgive
you
for
your
error
and
another
thing
i
will
tell
you
prohorovna
either
he
will
soon
come
back
to
you
your
son
or
he
will
be
sure
to
send
a
letter
go
and
henceforward
be
in
peace
your
son
is
alive
i
tell
you
dear
father
god
reward
you
our
benefactor
who
prays
for
all
of
us
and
for
our
sins
but
the
elder
had
already
noticed
in
the
crowd
two
glowing
eyes
fixed
upon
him
an
exhausted
consumptivelooking
though
young
peasant
woman
was
gazing
at
him
in
silence
her
eyes
besought
him
but
she
seemed
afraid
to
approach
what
is
it
my
child
absolve
my
soul
father
she
articulated
softly
and
slowly
sank
on
her
knees
and
bowed
down
at
his
feet
i
have
sinned
father
i
am
afraid
of
my
sin
the
elder
sat
down
on
the
lower
step
the
woman
crept
closer
to
him
still
on
her
knees
i
am
a
widow
these
three
years
she
began
in
a
halfwhisper
with
a
sort
of
shudder
i
had
a
hard
life
with
my
husband
he
was
an
old
man
he
used
to
beat
me
cruelly
he
lay
ill
i
thought
looking
at
him
if
he
were
to
get
well
if
he
were
to
get
up
again
what
then
and
then
the
thought
came
to
me
stay
said
the
elder
and
he
put
his
ear
close
to
her
lips
the
woman
went
on
in
a
low
whisper
so
that
it
was
almost
impossible
to
catch
anything
she
had
soon
done
three
years
ago
asked
the
elder
three
years
at
first
i
didnt
think
about
it
but
now
ive
begun
to
be
ill
and
the
thought
never
leaves
me
have
you
come
from
far
over
three
hundred
miles
away
have
you
told
it
in
confession
i
have
confessed
it
twice
i
have
confessed
it
have
you
been
admitted
to
communion
yes
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
to
die
fear
nothing
and
never
be
afraid
and
dont
fret
if
only
your
penitence
fail
not
god
will
forgive
all
there
is
no
sin
and
there
can
be
no
sin
on
all
the
earth
which
the
lord
will
not
forgive
to
the
truly
repentant
man
cannot
commit
a
sin
so
great
as
to
exhaust
the
infinite
love
of
god
can
there
be
a
sin
which
could
exceed
the
love
of
god
think
only
of
repentance
continual
repentance
but
dismiss
fear
altogether
believe
that
god
loves
you
as
you
cannot
conceive
that
he
loves
you
with
your
sin
in
your
sin
it
has
been
said
of
old
that
over
one
repentant
sinner
there
is
more
joy
in
heaven
than
over
ten
righteous
men
go
and
fear
not
be
not
bitter
against
men
be
not
angry
if
you
are
wronged
forgive
the
dead
man
in
your
heart
what
wrong
he
did
you
be
reconciled
with
him
in
truth
if
you
are
penitent
you
love
and
if
you
love
you
are
of
god
all
things
are
atoned
for
all
things
are
saved
by
love
if
i
a
sinner
even
as
you
are
am
tender
with
you
and
have
pity
on
you
how
much
more
will
god
love
is
such
a
priceless
treasure
that
you
can
redeem
the
whole
world
by
it
and
expiate
not
only
your
own
sins
but
the
sins
of
others

of
little
faith
a
visitor
looking
on
the
scene
of
his
conversation
with
the
peasants
and
his
blessing
them
shed
silent
tears
and
wiped
them
away
with
her
handkerchief
she
was
a
sentimental
society
lady
of
genuinely
good
disposition
in
many
respects
when
the
elder
went
up
to
her
at
last
she
met
him
enthusiastically
ah
what
i
have
been
feeling
looking
on
at
this
touching
scene
she
could
not
go
on
for
emotion
oh
i
understand
the
peoples

for
you
i
love
the
people

simple
in
their
greatness

to

to
me
again
oh
i
have
been
urgently
begging
for
it
i
have
prayed
for
it
i
was
ready
to
fall
on
my
knees
and
kneel
for
three
days
at
your
windows
until
you
let
me
in
we
have
come
great
healer
to
express
our
ardent
gratitude
you
have
healed
my
lise
healed
her
completely
merely
by
praying
over
her
last
thursday
and
laying
your
hands
upon
her
we
have
hastened
here
to
kiss
those
hands
to
pour
out
our
feelings
and
our
homage
what
do
you

by

but
she
is
still
lying
down
in
her
chair
but
her
night
fevers
have
entirely
ceased
ever
since
thursday
said
the
lady
with
nervous
haste
and
thats
not
all
her
legs
are
stronger
this
morning
she
got
up
well
she
had
slept
all
night
look
at
her
rosy
cheeks
her
bright
eyes
she
used
to
be
always
crying
but
now
she
laughs
and
is
gay
and
happy
this
morning
she
insisted
on
my
letting
her
stand
up
and
she
stood
up
for
a
whole
minute
without
any
support

in
a
fortnight

his
shoulders
and
said
i

amazed

make
nothing
of
it
and
would

serious
she
rose
in
her
chair
as
far
as
she
could
and
looking
at
the
elder
clasped
her
hands
before
him
but
could
not
restrain
herself
and
broke
into
laughter
its
at
him
she
said
pointing
to
alyosha
with
childish
vexation
at
herself
for
not
being
able
to
repress
her
mirth
if
any
one
had
looked
at
alyosha
standing
a
step
behind
the
elder
he
would
have
caught
a
quick
flush
crimsoning
his
cheeks
in
an
instant
his
eyes
shone
and
he
looked
down
she
has
a
message
for
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
are
you
the
mother
went
on
holding
out
her
exquisitely
gloved
hand
to
alyosha
the
elder
turned
round
and
all
at
once
looked
attentively
at
alyosha
the
latter
went
nearer
to
lise
and
smiling
in
a
strangely
awkward
way
held
out
his
hand
to
her
too
lise
assumed
an
important
air
katerina
ivanovna
has
sent
you
this
through
me
she
handed
him
a
little
note
she
particularly
begs
you
to
go
and
see
her
as
soon
as
possible
that
you
will
not
fail
her
but
will
be
sure
to
come
she
asks
me
to
go
and
see
her
me
what
for
alyosha
muttered
in
great
astonishment
his
face
at
once
looked
anxious
oh
its
all
to
do
with
dmitri
fyodorovitch
andwhat
has
happened
lately
the
mother
explained
hurriedly
katerina
ivanovna
has
made
up
her
mind
but
she
must
see
you
about
it
why
of
course
i
cant
say
but
she
wants
to
see
you
at
once
and
you
will
go
to
her
of
course
it
is
a
christian
duty
i
have
only
seen
her
once
alyosha
protested
with
the
same
perplexity
oh
she
is
such
a
lofty
incomparable
creature
if
only
for
her
suffering
think
what
she
has
gone
through
what
she
is
enduring
now
think
what
awaits
her
its
all
terrible
terrible
very
well
i
will
come
alyosha
decided
after
rapidly
scanning
the
brief
enigmatic
note
which
consisted
of
an
urgent
entreaty
that
he
would
come
without
any
sort
of
explanation
oh
how
sweet
and
generous
that
would
be
of
you
cried
lise
with
sudden
animation
i
told
mamma
youd
be
sure
not
to
go
i
said
you
were
saving
your
soul
how
splendid
you
are
ive
always
thought
you
were
splendid
how
glad
i
am
to
tell
you
so
lise
said
her
mother
impressively
though
she
smiled
after
she
had
said
it
you
have
quite
forgotten
us
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
said
you
never
come
to
see
us
yet
lise
has
told
me
twice
that
she
is
never
happy
except
with
you
alyosha
raised
his
downcast
eyes
and
again
flushed
and
again
smiled
without
knowing
why
but
the
elder
was
no
longer
watching
him
he
had
begun
talking
to
a
monk
who
as
mentioned
before
had
been
awaiting
his
entrance
by
lises
chair
he
was
evidently
a
monk
of
the
humblest
that
is
of
the
peasant
class
of
a
narrow
outlook
but
a
true
believer
and
in
his
own
way
a
stubborn
one
he
announced
that
he
had
come
from
the
far
north
from
obdorsk
from
saint
sylvester
and
was
a
member
of
a
poor
monastery
consisting
of
only
ten
monks
the
elder
gave
him
his
blessing
and
invited
him
to
come
to
his
cell
whenever
he
liked
how
can
you
presume
to
do
such
deeds
the
monk
asked
suddenly
pointing
solemnly
and
significantly
at
lise
he
was
referring
to
her
healing
its
too
early
of
course
to
speak
of
that
relief
is
not
complete
cure
and
may
proceed
from
different
causes
but
if
there
has
been
any
healing
it
is
by
no
power
but
gods
will
its
all
from
god
visit
me
father
he
added
to
the
monk
its
not
often
i
can
see
visitors
i
am
ill
and
i
know
that
my
days
are
numbered
oh
no
no
god
will
not
take
you
from
us
you
will
live
a
long
long
time
yet
cried
the
lady
and
in
what
way
are
you
ill
you
look
so
well
so
gay
and
happy
i
am
extraordinarily
better
today
but
i
know
that
its
only
for
a
moment
i
understand
my
disease
now
thoroughly
if
i
seem
so
happy
to
you
you
could
never
say
anything
that
would
please
me
so
much
for
men
are
made
for
happiness
and
any
one
who
is
completely
happy
has
a
right
to
say
to
himself
i
am
doing
gods
will
on
earth
all
the
righteous
all
the
saints
all
the
holy
martyrs
were
happy
oh
how
you
speak
what
bold
and
lofty
words
cried
the
lady
you
seem
to
pierce
with
your
words
and
yethappiness
happinesswhere
is
it
who
can
say
of
himself
that
he
is
happy
oh
since
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
let
us
see
you
once
more
today
let
me
tell
you
what
i
could
not
utter
last
time
what
i
dared
not
say
all
i
am
suffering
and
have
been
for
so
long
i
am
suffering
forgive
me
i
am
suffering
and
in
a
rush
of
fervent
feeling
she
clasped
her
hands
before
him
from
what
specially
i
suffer

from
lack
of
faith
lack
of
faith
in
god
oh
no
no
i
dare
not
even
think
of
that
but
the
future
lifeit
is
such
an
enigma
and
no
one
no
one
can
solve
it
listen
you
are
a
healer
you
are
deeply
versed
in
the
human
soul
and
of
course
i
dare
not
expect
you
to
believe
me
entirely
but
i
assure
you
on
my
word
of
honor
that
i
am
not
speaking
lightly
now
the
thought
of
the
life
beyond
the
grave
distracts
me
to
anguish
to
terror
and
i
dont
know
to
whom
to
appeal
and
have
not
dared
to
all
my
life
and
now
i
am
so
bold
as
to
ask
you
oh
god
what
will
you
think
of
me
now
she
clasped
her
hands
dont
distress
yourself
about
my
opinion
of
you
said
the
elder
i
quite
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
your
suffering
oh
how
thankful
i
am
to
you
you
see
i
shut
my
eyes
and
ask
myself
if
every
one
has
faith
where
did
it
come
from
and
then
they
do
say
that
it
all
comes
from
terror
at
the
menacing
phenomena
of
nature
and
that
none
of
its
real
and
i
say
to
myself
what
if
ive
been
believing
all
my
life
and
when
i
come
to
die
theres
nothing
but
the
burdocks
growing
on
my
grave
as
i
read
in
some
author
its
awful
howhow
can
i
get
back
my
faith
but
i
only
believed
when
i
was
a
little
child
mechanically
without
thinking
of
anything
how
how
is
one
to
prove
it
i
have
come
now
to
lay
my
soul
before
you
and
to
ask
you
about
it
if
i
let
this
chance
slip
no
one
all
my
life
will
answer
me
how
can
i
prove
it
how
can
i
convince
myself
oh
how
unhappy
i
am
i
stand
and
look
about
me
and
see
that
scarcely
any
one
else
cares
no
one
troubles
his
head
about
it
and
im
the
only
one
who
cant
stand
it
its
deadlydeadly
no
doubt
but
theres
no
proving
it
though
you
can
be
convinced
of
it
how
by
the
experience
of
active
love
strive
to
love
your
neighbor
actively
and
indefatigably
in
as
far
as
you
advance
in
love
you
will
grow
surer
of
the
reality
of
god
and
of
the
immortality
of
your
soul
if
you
attain
to
perfect
selfforgetfulness
in
the
love
of
your
neighbor
then
you
will
believe
without
doubt
and
no
doubt
can
possibly
enter
your
soul
this
has
been
tried
this
is
certain
in
active
love
theres
another
questionand
such
a
question
you
see
i
so
love
humanity
thatwould
you
believe
iti
often
dream
of
forsaking
all
that
i
have
leaving
lise
and
becoming
a
sister
of
mercy
i
close
my
eyes
and
think
and
dream
and
at
that
moment
i
feel
full
of
strength
to
overcome
all
obstacles
no
wounds
no
festering
sores
could
at
that
moment
frighten
me
i
would
bind
them
up
and
wash
them
with
my
own
hands
i
would
nurse
the
afflicted
i
would
be
ready
to
kiss
such
wounds
it
is
much
and
well
that
your
mind
is
full
of
such
dreams
and
not
others
sometime
unawares
you
may
do
a
good
deed
in
reality
yes
but
could
i
endure
such
a
life
for
long
the
lady
went
on
fervently
almost
frantically
thats
the
chief
questionthats
my
most
agonizing
question
i
shut
my
eyes
and
ask
myself
would
you
persevere
long
on
that
path
and
if
the
patient
whose
wounds
you
are
washing
did
not
meet
you
with
gratitude
but
worried
you
with
his
whims
without
valuing
or
remarking
your
charitable
services
began
abusing
you
and
rudely
commanding
you
and
complaining
to
the
superior
authorities
of
you
which
often
happens
when
people
are
in
great
sufferingwhat
then
would
you
persevere
in
your
love
or
not
and
do
you
know
i
came
with
horror
to
the
conclusion
that
if
anything
could
dissipate
my
love
to
humanity
it
would
be
ingratitude
in
short
i
am
a
hired
servant
i
expect
my
payment
at
oncethat
is
praise
and
the
repayment
of
love
with
love
otherwise
i
am
incapable
of
loving
any
one
she
was
in
a
very
paroxysm
of
selfcastigation
and
concluding
she
looked
with
defiant
resolution
at
the
elder
its
just
the
same
story
as
a
doctor
once
told
me
observed
the
elder
he
was
a
man
getting
on
in
years
and
undoubtedly
clever
he
spoke
as
frankly
as
you
though
in
jest
in
bitter
jest
i
love
humanity
he
said
but
i
wonder
at
myself
the
more
i
love
humanity
in
general
the
less
i
love
man
in
particular
in
my
dreams
he
said
i
have
often
come
to
making
enthusiastic
schemes
for
the
service
of
humanity
and
perhaps
i
might
actually
have
faced
crucifixion
if
it
had
been
suddenly
necessary
and
yet
i
am
incapable
of
living
in
the
same
room
with
any
one
for
two
days
together
as
i
know
by
experience
as
soon
as
any
one
is
near
me
his
personality
disturbs
my
selfcomplacency
and
restricts
my
freedom
in
twentyfour
hours
i
begin
to
hate
the
best
of
men
one
because
hes
too
long
over
his
dinner
another
because
he
has
a
cold
and
keeps
on
blowing
his
nose
i
become
hostile
to
people
the
moment
they
come
close
to
me
but
it
has
always
happened
that
the
more
i
detest
men
individually
the
more
ardent
becomes
my
love
for
humanity

but
whats
to
be
done
what
can
one
do
in
such
a
case
must
one
despair
no
it
is
enough
that
you
are
distressed
at
it
do
what
you
can
and
it
will
be
reckoned
unto
you
much
is
done
already
in
you
since
you
can
so
deeply
and
sincerely
know
yourself
if
you
have
been
talking
to
me
so
sincerely
simply
to
gain
approbation
for
your
frankness
as
you
did
from
me
just
now
then
of
course
you
will
not
attain
to
anything
in
the
achievement
of
real
love
it
will
all
get
no
further
than
dreams
and
your
whole
life
will
slip
away
like
a
phantom
in
that
case
you
will
naturally
cease
to
think
of
the
future
life
too
and
will
of
yourself
grow
calmer
after
a
fashion
in
the
end
you
have
crushed
me
only
now
as
you
speak
i
understand
that
i
was
really
only
seeking
your
approbation
for
my
sincerity
when
i
told
you
i
could
not
endure
ingratitude
you
have
revealed
me
to
myself
you
have
seen
through
me
and
explained
me
to
myself
are
you
speaking
the
truth
well
now
after
such
a
confession
i
believe
that
you
are
sincere
and
good
at
heart
if
you
do
not
attain
happiness
always
remember
that
you
are
on
the
right
road
and
try
not
to
leave
it
above
all
avoid
falsehood
every
kind
of
falsehood
especially
falseness
to
yourself
watch
over
your
own
deceitfulness
and
look
into
it
every
hour
every
minute
avoid
being
scornful
both
to
others
and
to
yourself
what
seems
to
you
bad
within
you
will
grow
purer
from
the
very
fact
of
your
observing
it
in
yourself
avoid
fear
too
though
fear
is
only
the
consequence
of
every
sort
of
falsehood
never
be
frightened
at
your
own
faintheartedness
in
attaining
love
dont
be
frightened
overmuch
even
at
your
evil
actions
i
am
sorry
i
can
say
nothing
more
consoling
to
you
for
love
in
action
is
a
harsh
and
dreadful
thing
compared
with
love
in
dreams
love
in
dreams
is
greedy
for
immediate
action
rapidly
performed
and
in
the
sight
of
all
men
will
even
give
their
lives
if
only
the
ordeal
does
not
last
long
but
is
soon
over
with
all
looking
on
and
applauding
as
though
on
the
stage
but
active
love
is
labor
and
fortitude
and
for
some
people
too
perhaps
a
complete
science
but
i
predict
that
just
when
you
see
with
horror
that
in
spite
of
all
your
efforts
you
are
getting
farther
from
your
goal
instead
of
nearer
to
itat
that
very
moment
i
predict
that
you
will
reach
it
and
behold
clearly
the
miraculous
power
of
the
lord
who
has
been
all
the
time
loving
and
mysteriously
guiding
you
forgive
me
for
not
being
able
to
stay
longer
with
you
they
are
waiting
for
me
goodby
the
lady
was
weeping
lise
lise
bless
herbless
her
she
cried
starting
up
suddenly
she
does
not
deserve
to
be
loved
i
have
seen
her
naughtiness
all
along
the
elder
said
jestingly
why
have
you
been
laughing
at
alexey
lise
had
in
fact
been
occupied
in
mocking
at
him
all
the
time
she
had
noticed
before
that
alyosha
was
shy
and
tried
not
to
look
at
her
and
she
found
this
extremely
amusing
she
waited
intently
to
catch
his
eye
alyosha
unable
to
endure
her
persistent
stare
was
irresistibly
and
suddenly
drawn
to
glance
at
her
and
at
once
she
smiled
triumphantly
in
his
face
alyosha
was
even
more
disconcerted
and
vexed
at
last
he
turned
away
from
her
altogether
and
hid
behind
the
elders
back
after
a
few
minutes
drawn
by
the
same
irresistible
force
he
turned
again
to
see
whether
he
was
being
looked
at
or
not
and
found
lise
almost
hanging
out
of
her
chair
to
peep
sideways
at
him
eagerly
waiting
for
him
to
look
catching
his
eye
she
laughed
so
that
the
elder
could
not
help
saying
why
do
you
make
fun
of
him
like
that
naughty
girl
lise
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
blushed
her
eyes
flashed
and
her
face
became
quite
serious
she
began
speaking
quickly
and
nervously
in
a
warm
and
resentful
voice
why
has
he
forgotten
everything
then
he
used
to
carry
me
about
when
i
was
little
we
used
to
play
together
he
used
to
come
to
teach
me
to
read
do
you
know
two
years
ago
when
he
went
away
he
said
that
he
would
never
forget
me
that
we
were
friends
for
ever
for
ever
for
ever
and
now
hes
afraid
of
me
all
at
once
am
i
going
to
eat
him
why
doesnt
he
want
to
come
near
me
why
doesnt
he
talk
why
wont
he
come
and
see
us
its
not
that
you
wont
let
him
we
know
that
he
goes
everywhere
its
not
good
manners
for
me
to
invite
him
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
first
if
he
hasnt
forgotten
me
no
now
hes
saving
his
soul
why
have
you
put
that
long
gown
on
him
if
he
runs
hell
fall
and
suddenly
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hand
and
went
off
into
irresistible
prolonged
nervous
inaudible
laughter
the
elder
listened
to
her
with
a
smile
and
blessed
her
tenderly
as
she
kissed
his
hand
she
suddenly
pressed
it
to
her
eyes
and
began
crying
dont
be
angry
with
me
im
silly
and
good
for
nothing

and
perhaps
alyoshas
right
quite
right
in
not
wanting
to
come
and
see
such
a
ridiculous
girl
i
will
certainly
send
him
said
the
elder
chapter
v
so
be
it
so
be
it
the
elders
absence
from
his
cell
had
lasted
for
about
twentyfive
minutes
it
was
more
than
halfpast
twelve
but
dmitri
on
whose
account
they
had
all
met
there
had
still
not
appeared
but
he
seemed
almost
to
be
forgotten
and
when
the
elder
entered
the
cell
again
he
found
his
guests
engaged
in
eager
conversation
ivan
and
the
two
monks
took
the
leading
share
in
it
misov
too
was
trying
to
take
a
part
and
apparently
very
eagerly
in
the
conversation
but
he
was
unsuccessful
in
this
also
he
was
evidently
in
the
background
and
his
remarks
were
treated
with
neglect
which
increased
his
irritability
he
had
had
intellectual
encounters
with
ivan
before
and
he
could
not
endure
a
certain
carelessness
ivan
showed
him
hitherto
at
least
i
have
stood
in
the
front
ranks
of
all
that
is
progressive
in
europe
and
here
the
new
generation
positively
ignores
us
he
thought
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
had
given
his
word
to
sit
still
and
be
quiet
had
actually
been
quiet
for
some
time
but
he
watched
his
neighbor
misov
with
an
ironical
little
smile
obviously
enjoying
his
discomfiture
he
had
been
waiting
for
some
time
to
pay
off
old
scores
and
now
he
could
not
let
the
opportunity
slip
bending
over
his
shoulder
he
began
teasing
him
again
in
a
whisper
why
didnt
you
go
away
just
now
after
the
courteously
kissing
why
did
you
consent
to
remain
in
such
unseemly
company
it
was
because
you
felt
insulted
and
aggrieved
and
you
remained
to
vindicate
yourself
by
showing
off
your
intelligence
now
you
wont
go
till
youve
displayed
your
intellect
to
them
you
again
on
the
contrary
im
just
going
youll
be
the
last
the
last
of
all
to
go
fyodor
pavlovitch
delivered
him
another
thrust
almost
at
the
moment
of
father
zossimas
return
the
discussion
died
down
for
a
moment
but
the
elder
seating
himself
in
his
former
place
looked
at
them
all
as
though
cordially
inviting
them
to
go
on
alyosha
who
knew
every
expression
of
his
face
saw
that
he
was
fearfully
exhausted
and
making
a
great
effort
of
late
he
had
been
liable
to
fainting
fits
from
exhaustion
his
face
had
the
pallor
that
was
common
before
such
attacks
and
his
lips
were
white
but
he
evidently
did
not
want
to
break
up
the
party
he
seemed
to
have
some
special
object
of
his
own
in
keeping
them
what
object
alyosha
watched
him
intently
we
are
discussing
this
gentlemans
most
interesting
article
said
father
iosif
the
librarian
addressing
the
elder
and
indicating
ivan
he
brings
forward
much
that
is
new
but
i
think
the
argument
cuts
both
ways
it
is
an
article
written
in
answer
to
a
book
by
an
ecclesiastical
authority
on
the
question
of
the
ecclesiastical
court
and
the
scope
of
its
jurisdiction
im
sorry
i
have
not
read
your
article
but
ive
heard
of
it
said
the
elder
looking
keenly
and
intently
at
ivan
he
takes
up
a
most
interesting
position
continued
the
father
librarian
as
far
as
church
jurisdiction
is
concerned
he
is
apparently
quite
opposed
to
the
separation
of
church
from
state
thats
interesting
but
in
what
sense
father
zossima
asked
ivan
the
latter
at
last
answered
him
not
condescendingly
as
alyosha
had
feared
but
with
modesty
and
reserve
with
evident
goodwill
and
apparently
without
the
slightest
arrirepense
i
start
from
the
position
that
this
confusion
of
elements
that
is
of
the
essential
principles
of
church
and
state
will
of
course
go
on
for
ever
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
mingle
and
that
the
confusion
of
these
elements
cannot
lead
to
any
consistent
or
even
normal
results
for
there
is
falsity
at
the
very
foundation
of
it
compromise
between
the
church
and
state
in
such
questions
as
for
instance
jurisdiction
is
to
my
thinking
impossible
in
any
real
sense
my
clerical
opponent
maintains
that
the
church
holds
a
precise
and
defined
position
in
the
state
i
maintain
on
the
contrary
that
the
church
ought
to
include
the
whole
state
and
not
simply
to
occupy
a
corner
in
it
and
if
this
is
for
some
reason
impossible
at
present
then
it
ought
in
reality
to
be
set
up
as
the
direct
and
chief
aim
of
the
future
development
of
christian
society
perfectly
true
father
passy
the
silent
and
learned
monk
assented
with
fervor
and
decision
the
purest
ultramontanism
cried
misov
impatiently
crossing
and
recrossing
his
legs
oh
well
we
have
no
mountains
cried
father
iosif
and
turning
to
the
elder
he
continued
observe
the
answer
he
makes
to
the
following
fundamental
and
essential
propositions
of
his
opponent
who
is
you
must
note
an
ecclesiastic
first
that
no
social
organization
can
or
ought
to
arrogate
to
itself
power
to
dispose
of
the
civic
and
political
rights
of
its
members
secondly
that
criminal
and
civil
jurisdiction
ought
not
to
belong
to
the
church
and
is
inconsistent
with
its
nature
both
as
a
divine
institution
and
as
an
organization
of
men
for
religious
objects
and
finally
in
the
third
place
the
church
is
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world

a
most
unworthy
play
upon
words
for
an
ecclesiastic
father
passy
could
not
refrain
from
breaking
in
again
i
have
read
the
book
which
you
have
answered
he
added
addressing
ivan
and
was
astounded
at
the
words
the
church
is
a
kingdom
not
of
this
world
if
it
is
not
of
this
world
then
it
cannot
exist
on
earth
at
all
in
the
gospel
the
words
not
of
this
world
are
not
used
in
that
sense
to
play
with
such
words
is
indefensible
our
lord
jesus
christ
came
to
set
up
the
church
upon
earth
the
kingdom
of
heaven
of
course
is
not
of
this
world
but
in
heaven
but
it
is
only
entered
through
the
church
which
has
been
founded
and
established
upon
earth
and
so
a
frivolous
play
upon
words
in
such
a
connection
is
unpardonable
and
improper
the
church
is
in
truth
a
kingdom
and
ordained
to
rule
and
in
the
end
must
undoubtedly
become
the
kingdom
ruling
over
all
the
earth
for
that
we
have
the
divine
promise
he
ceased
speaking
suddenly
as
though
checking
himself
after
listening
attentively
and
respectfully
ivan
went
on
addressing
the
elder
with
perfect
composure
and
as
before
with
ready
cordiality
the
whole
point
of
my
article
lies
in
the
fact
that
during
the
first
three
centuries
christianity
only
existed
on
earth
in
the
church
and
was
nothing
but
the
church
when
the
pagan
roman
empire
desired
to
become
christian
it
inevitably
happened
that
by
becoming
christian
it
included
the
church
but
remained
a
pagan
state
in
very
many
of
its
departments
in
reality
this
was
bound
to
happen
but
rome
as
a
state
retained
too
much
of
the
pagan
civilization
and
culture
as
for
example
in
the
very
objects
and
fundamental
principles
of
the
state
the
christian
church
entering
into
the
state
could
of
course
surrender
no
part
of
its
fundamental
principlesthe
rock
on
which
it
standsand
could
pursue
no
other
aims
than
those
which
have
been
ordained
and
revealed
by
god
himself
and
among
them
that
of
drawing
the
whole
world
and
therefore
the
ancient
pagan
state
itself
into
the
church
in
that
way
that
is
with
a
view
to
the
future
it
is
not
the
church
that
should
seek
a
definite
position
in
the
state
like
every
social
organization
or
as
an
organization
of
men
for
religious
purposes
as
my
opponent
calls
the
church
but
on
the
contrary
every
earthly
state
should
be
in
the
end
completely
transformed
into
the
church
and
should
become
nothing
else
but
a
church
rejecting
every
purpose
incongruous
with
the
aims
of
the
church
all
this
will
not
degrade
it
in
any
way
or
take
from
its
honor
and
glory
as
a
great
state
nor
from
the
glory
of
its
rulers
but
only
turns
it
from
a
false
still
pagan
and
mistaken
path
to
the
true
and
rightful
path
which
alone
leads
to
the
eternal
goal
this
is
why
the
author
of
the
book
on
the
foundations
of
church
jurisdiction
would
have
judged
correctly
if
in
seeking
and
laying
down
those
foundations
he
had
looked
upon
them
as
a
temporary
compromise
inevitable
in
our
sinful
and
imperfect
days
but
as
soon
as
the
author
ventures
to
declare
that
the
foundations
which
he
predicates
now
part
of
which
father
iosif
just
enumerated
are
the
permanent
essential
and
eternal
foundations
he
is
going
directly
against
the
church
and
its
sacred
and
eternal
vocation
that
is
the
gist
of
my
article
that
is
in
brief
father
passy
began
again
laying
stress
on
each
word
according
to
certain
theories
only
too
clearly
formulated
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
church
ought
to
be
transformed
into
the
state
as
though
this
would
be
an
advance
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
form
so
as
to
disappear
into
it
making
way
for
science
for
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
civilization
and
if
the
church
resists
and
is
unwilling
some
corner
will
be
set
apart
for
her
in
the
state
and
even
that
under
controland
this
will
be
so
everywhere
in
all
modern
european
countries
but
russian
hopes
and
conceptions
demand
not
that
the
church
should
pass
as
from
a
lower
into
a
higher
type
into
the
state
but
on
the
contrary
that
the
state
should
end
by
being
worthy
to
become
only
the
church
and
nothing
else
so
be
it
so
be
it
well
i
confess
youve
reassured
me
somewhat
misov
said
smiling
again
crossing
his
legs
so
far
as
i
understand
then
the
realization
of
such
an
ideal
is
infinitely
remote
at
the
second
coming
of
christ
thats
as
you
please
its
a
beautiful
utopian
dream
of
the
abolition
of
war
diplomacy
banks
and
so
onsomething
after
the
fashion
of
socialism
indeed
but
i
imagined
that
it
was
all
meant
seriously
and
that
the
church
might
be
now
going
to
try
criminals
and
sentence
them
to
beating
prison
and
even
death
but
if
there
were
none
but
the
ecclesiastical
court
the
church
would
not
even
now
sentence
a
criminal
to
prison
or
to
death
crime
and
the
way
of
regarding
it
would
inevitably
change
not
all
at
once
of
course
but
fairly
soon
ivan
replied
calmly
without
flinching
are
you
serious
misov
glanced
keenly
at
him
if
everything
became
the
church
the
church
would
exclude
all
the
criminal
and
disobedient
and
would
not
cut
off
their
heads
ivan
went
on
i
ask
you
what
would
become
of
the
excluded
he
would
be
cut
off
then
not
only
from
men
as
now
but
from
christ
by
his
crime
he
would
have
transgressed
not
only
against
men
but
against
the
church
of
christ
this
is
so
even
now
of
course
strictly
speaking
but
it
is
not
clearly
enunciated
and
very
very
often
the
criminal
of
today
compromises
with
his
conscience
i
steal
he
says
but
i
dont
go
against
the
church
im
not
an
enemy
of
christ
thats
what
the
criminal
of
today
is
continually
saying
to
himself
but
when
the
church
takes
the
place
of
the
state
it
will
be
difficult
for
him
in
opposition
to
the
church
all
over
the
world
to
say
all
men
are
mistaken
all
in
error
all
mankind
are
the
false
church
i
a
thief
and
murderer
am
the
only
true
christian
church
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
say
this
to
himself
it
requires
a
rare
combination
of
unusual
circumstances
now
on
the
other
side
take
the
churchs
own
view
of
crime
is
it
not
bound
to
renounce
the
present
almost
pagan
attitude
and
to
change
from
a
mechanical
cutting
off
of
its
tainted
member
for
the
preservation
of
society
as
at
present
into
completely
and
honestly
adopting
the
idea
of
the
regeneration
of
the
man
of
his
reformation
and
salvation
what
do
you
mean
i
fail
to
understand
again
misov
interrupted
some
sort
of
dream
again
something
shapeless
and
even
incomprehensible
what
is
excommunication
what
sort
of
exclusion
i
suspect
you
are
simply
amusing
yourself
ivan
fyodorovitch
yes
but
you
know
in
reality
it
is
so
now
said
the
elder
suddenly
and
all
turned
to
him
at
once
if
it
were
not
for
the
church
of
christ
there
would
be
nothing
to
restrain
the
criminal
from
evildoing
no
real
chastisement
for
it
afterwards
none
that
is
but
the
mechanical
punishment
spoken
of
just
now
which
in
the
majority
of
cases
only
embitters
the
heart
and
not
the
real
punishment
the
only
effectual
one
the
only
deterrent
and
softening
one
which
lies
in
the
recognition
of
sin
by
conscience
how
is
that
may
one
inquire
asked
misov
with
lively
curiosity
why
began
the
elder
all
these
sentences
to
exile
with
hard
labor
and
formerly
with
flogging
also
reform
no
one
and
whats
more
deter
hardly
a
single
criminal
and
the
number
of
crimes
does
not
diminish
but
is
continually
on
the
increase
you
must
admit
that
consequently
the
security
of
society
is
not
preserved
for
although
the
obnoxious
member
is
mechanically
cut
off
and
sent
far
away
out
of
sight
another
criminal
always
comes
to
take
his
place
at
once
and
often
two
of
them
if
anything
does
preserve
society
even
in
our
time
and
does
regenerate
and
transform
the
criminal
it
is
only
the
law
of
christ
speaking
in
his
conscience
it
is
only
by
recognizing
his
wrongdoing
as
a
son
of
a
christian
societythat
is
of
the
churchthat
he
recognizes
his
sin
against
societythat
is
against
the
church
so
that
it
is
only
against
the
church
and
not
against
the
state
that
the
criminal
of
today
can
recognize
that
he
has
sinned
if
society
as
a
church
had
jurisdiction
then
it
would
know
when
to
bring
back
from
exclusion
and
to
reunite
to
itself
now
the
church
having
no
real
jurisdiction
but
only
the
power
of
moral
condemnation
withdraws
of
her
own
accord
from
punishing
the
criminal
actively
she
does
not
excommunicate
him
but
simply
persists
in
motherly
exhortation
of
him
what
is
more
the
church
even
tries
to
preserve
all
christian
communion
with
the
criminal
she
admits
him
to
church
services
to
the
holy
sacrament
gives
him
alms
and
treats
him
more
as
a
captive
than
as
a
convict
and
what
would
become
of
the
criminal
o
lord
if
even
the
christian
societythat
is
the
churchwere
to
reject
him
even
as
the
civil
law
rejects
him
and
cuts
him
off
what
would
become
of
him
if
the
church
punished
him
with
her
excommunication
as
the
direct
consequence
of
the
secular
law
there
could
be
no
more
terrible
despair
at
least
for
a
russian
criminal
for
russian
criminals
still
have
faith
though
who
knows
perhaps
then
a
fearful
thing
would
happen
perhaps
the
despairing
heart
of
the
criminal
would
lose
its
faith
and
then
what
would
become
of
him
but
the
church
like
a
tender
loving
mother
holds
aloof
from
active
punishment
herself
as
the
sinner
is
too
severely
punished
already
by
the
civil
law
and
there
must
be
at
least
some
one
to
have
pity
on
him
the
church
holds
aloof
above
all
because
its
judgment
is
the
only
one
that
contains
the
truth
and
therefore
cannot
practically
and
morally
be
united
to
any
other
judgment
even
as
a
temporary
compromise
she
can
enter
into
no
compact
about
that
the
foreign
criminal
they
say
rarely
repents
for
the
very
doctrines
of
today
confirm
him
in
the
idea
that
his
crime
is
not
a
crime
but
only
a
reaction
against
an
unjustly
oppressive
force
society
cuts
him
off
completely
by
a
force
that
triumphs
over
him
mechanically
and
so
at
least
they
say
of
themselves
in
europe
accompanies
this
exclusion
with
hatred
forgetfulness
and
the
most
profound
indifference
as
to
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
erring
brother
in
this
way
it
all
takes
place
without
the
compassionate
intervention
of
the
church
for
in
many
cases
there
are
no
churches
there
at
all
for
though
ecclesiastics
and
splendid
church
buildings
remain
the
churches
themselves
have
long
ago
striven
to
pass
from
church
into
state
and
to
disappear
in
it
completely
so
it
seems
at
least
in
lutheran
countries
as
for
rome
it
was
proclaimed
a
state
instead
of
a
church
a
thousand
years
ago
and
so
the
criminal
is
no
longer
conscious
of
being
a
member
of
the
church
and
sinks
into
despair
if
he
returns
to
society
often
it
is
with
such
hatred
that
society
itself
instinctively
cuts
him
off
you
can
judge
for
yourself
how
it
must
end
in
many
cases
it
would
seem
to
be
the
same
with
us
but
the
difference
is
that
besides
the
established
law
courts
we
have
the
church
too
which
always
keeps
up
relations
with
the
criminal
as
a
dear
and
still
precious
son
and
besides
that
there
is
still
preserved
though
only
in
thought
the
judgment
of
the
church
which
though
no
longer
existing
in
practice
is
still
living
as
a
dream
for
the
future
and
is
no
doubt
instinctively
recognized
by
the
criminal
in
his
soul
what
was
said
here
just
now
is
true
too
that
is
that
if
the
jurisdiction
of
the
church
were
introduced
in
practice
in
its
full
force
that
is
if
the
whole
of
the
society
were
changed
into
the
church
not
only
the
judgment
of
the
church
would
have
influence
on
the
reformation
of
the
criminal
such
as
it
never
has
now
but
possibly
also
the
crimes
themselves
would
be
incredibly
diminished
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
church
would
look
upon
the
criminal
and
the
crime
of
the
future
in
many
cases
quite
differently
and
would
succeed
in
restoring
the
excluded
in
restraining
those
who
plan
evil
and
in
regenerating
the
fallen
it
is
true
said
father
zossima
with
a
smile
the
christian
society
now
is
not
ready
and
is
only
resting
on
some
seven
righteous
men
but
as
they
are
never
lacking
it
will
continue
still
unshaken
in
expectation
of
its
complete
transformation
from
a
society
almost
heathen
in
character
into
a
single
universal
and
allpowerful
church
so
be
it
so
be
it
even
though
at
the
end
of
the
ages
for
it
is
ordained
to
come
to
pass
and
there
is
no
need
to
be
troubled
about
times
and
seasons
for
the
secret
of
the
times
and
seasons
is
in
the
wisdom
of
god
in
his
foresight
and
his
love
and
what
in
human
reckoning
seems
still
afar
off
may
by
the
divine
ordinance
be
close
at
hand
on
the
eve
of
its
appearance
and
so
be
it
so
be
it
so
be
it
so
be
it
father

austerely

reverently

extremely
strange
misov

so
much
with
heat
as
with
latent
indignation
what

you

so
strange
father

inquired
cautiously
why
its
beyond
anything

misov
suddenly
breaking
out
the

the

the

not
to
be
transformed
into
the

the

is

misov
was
significantly
silent
his
whole
figure
expressed
extraordinary
personal
dignity
a
supercilious
and
condescending
smile
played
on
his
lips
alyosha
watched
it
all
with
a
throbbing
heart
the
whole
conversation
stirred
him
profoundly
he
glanced
casually
at

was
standing
immovable
in
his
place
by
the
door
listening
and
watching
intently

with
downcast

but
from
the
color
in
his
cheeks
alyosha

was

no

excited
and
he
knew
what
caused
his
excitement
allow
me
to
tell
you
one
little
anecdote
gentlemen
misov
said
impressively
with
a
peculiarly
majestic
air
some
years
ago
soon
after
the
coup
dtat
of
december
i
happened
to
be
calling
in
paris
on
an
extremely
influential
personage
in
the
government
and
i
met
a
very
interesting
man
in
his
house
this
individual
was
not
precisely
a
detective
but
was
a
sort
of
superintendent
of
a
whole
regiment
of
political
detectivesa
rather
powerful
position
in
its
own
way
i
was
prompted
by
curiosity
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
conversation
with
him
and
as
he
had
not
come
as
a
visitor
but
as
a
subordinate
official
bringing
a
special
report
and
as
he
saw
the
reception
given
me
by
his
chief
he
deigned
to
speak
with
some
openness
to
a
certain
extent
only
of
course
he
was
rather
courteous
than
open
as
frenchmen
know
how
to
be
courteous
especially
to
a
foreigner
but
i
thoroughly
understood
him
the
subject
was
the
socialist
revolutionaries
who
were
at
that
time
persecuted
i
will
quote
only
one
most
curious
remark
dropped
by
this
person
we
are
not
particularly
afraid
said
he
of
all
these
socialists
anarchists
infidels
and
revolutionists
we
keep
watch
on
them
and
know
all
their
goings
on
but
there
are
a
few
peculiar
men
among
them
who
believe
in
god
and
are
christians
but
at
the
same
time
are
socialists
these
are
the
people
we
are
most
afraid
of
they
are
dreadful
people
the
socialist
who
is
a
christian
is
more
to
be
dreaded
than
a
socialist
who
is
an
atheist
the
words
struck
me
at
the
time
and
now
they
have
suddenly
come
back
to
me
here
gentlemen
you
apply
them
to
us
and
look
upon
us
as
socialists
father
passy
asked
directly
without
beating
about
the
bush
but
before
pyotr
alexandrovitch
could
think
what
to
answer
the
door
opened
and
the
guest
so
long
expected
dmitri
fyodorovitch
came
in
they
had
in
fact
given
up
expecting
him
and
his
sudden
appearance
caused
some
surprise
for
a
moment
chapter
vi
why
is
such
a
man
alive
dmitri
fyodorovitch
a
young
man
of
eight
and
twenty
of
medium
height
and
agreeable
countenance
looked
older
than
his
years
he
was
muscular
and
showed
signs
of
considerable
physical
strength
yet
there
was
something
not
healthy
in
his
face
it
was
rather
thin
his
cheeks
were
hollow
and
there
was
an
unhealthy
sallowness
in
their
color
his
rather
large
prominent
dark
eyes
had
an
expression
of
firm
determination
and
yet
there
was
a
vague
look
in
them
too
even
when
he
was
excited
and
talking
irritably
his
eyes
somehow
did
not
follow
his
mood
but
betrayed
something
else
sometimes
quite
incongruous
with
what
was
passing
its
hard
to
tell
what
hes
thinking
those
who
talked
to
him
sometimes
declared
people
who
saw
something
pensive
and
sullen
in
his
eyes
were
startled
by
his
sudden
laugh
which
bore
witness
to
mirthful
and
light
hearted
thoughts
at
the
very
time
when
his
eyes
were
so
gloomy
a
certain
strained
look
in
his
face
was
easy
to
understand
at
this
moment
every
one
knew
or
had
heard
of
the
extremely
restless
and
dissipated
life
which
he
had
been
leading
of
late
as
well
as
of
the
violent
anger
to
which
he
had
been
roused
in
his
quarrels
with
his
father
there
were
several
stories
current
in
the
town
about
it
it
is
true
that
he
was
irascible
by
nature
of
an
unstable
and
unbalanced
mind
as
our
justice
of
the
peace
katchalnikov
happily
described
him
he
was
stylishly
and
irreproachably
dressed
in
a
carefully
buttoned
frock
coat
he
wore
black
gloves
and
carried
a
tophat
having
only
lately
left
the
army
he
still
had
mustaches
and
no
beard
his
dark
brown
hair
was
cropped
short
and
combed
forward
on
his
temples
he
had
the
long
determined
stride
of
a
military
man
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
and
glancing
at
the
whole
party
went
straight
up
to
the
elder
guessing
him
to
be
their
host
he
made
him
a
low
bow
and
asked
his
blessing
father
zossima
rising
in
his
chair
blessed
him
dmitri
kissed
his
hand
respectfully
and
with
intense
feeling
almost
anger
he
said
be
so
generous
as
to
forgive
me
for
having
kept
you
waiting
so
long
but
smerdyakov
the
valet
sent
me
by
my
father
in
reply
to
my
inquiries
told
me
twice
over
that
the
appointment
was
for
one
now
i
suddenly
learn
dont
disturb
yourself
interposed
the
elder
no
matter
you
are
a
little
late
its
of
no
consequence
im
extremely
obliged
to
you
and
expected
no
less
from
your
goodness
saying
this
dmitri
bowed
once
more
then
turning
suddenly
towards
his
father
made
him
too
a
similarly
low
and
respectful
bow
he
had
evidently
considered
it
beforehand
and
made
this
bow
in
all
seriousness
thinking
it
his
duty
to
show
his
respect
and
good
intentions
although
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
taken
unawares
he
was
equal
to
the
occasion
in
response
to
dmitris
bow
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
made
his
son
a
bow
as
low
in
return
his
face
was
suddenly
solemn
and
impressive
which
gave
him
a
positively
malignant
look
dmitri
bowed
generally
to
all
present
and
without
a
word
walked
to
the
window
with
his
long
resolute
stride
sat
down
on
the
only
empty
chair
near
father
passy
and
bending
forward
prepared
to
listen
to
the
conversation
he
had
interrupted
dmitris
entrance
had
taken
no
more
than
two
minutes
and
the
conversation
was
resumed
but
this
time
misov
thought
it
unnecessary
to
reply
to
father
passys
persistent
and
almost
irritable
question
allow
me
to
withdraw
from
this
discussion
he
observed
with
a
certain
wellbred
nonchalance
its
a
subtle
question
too
here
ivan
fyodorovitch
is
smiling
at
us
he
must
have
something
interesting
to
say
about
that
also
ask
him
nothing
special
except
one
little
remark
ivan
replied
at
once
european
liberals
in
general
and
even
our
liberal
dilettanti
often
mix
up
the
final
results
of
socialism
with
those
of
christianity
this
wild
notion
is
of
course
a
characteristic
feature
but
its
not
only
liberals
and
dilettanti
who
mix
up
socialism
and
christianity
but
in
many
cases
it
appears
the
policethe
foreign
police
of
coursedo
the
same
your
paris
anecdote
is
rather
to
the
point
pyotr
alexandrovitch
i
ask
your
permission
to
drop
this
subject
altogether
misov
repeated
i
will
tell
you
instead
gentlemen
another
interesting
and
rather
characteristic
anecdote
of
ivan
fyodorovitch
himself
only
five
days
ago
in
a
gathering
here
principally
of
ladies
he
solemnly
declared
in
argument
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
whole
world
to
make
men
love
their
neighbors
that
there
was
no
law
of
nature
that
man
should
love
mankind
and
that
if
there
had
been
any
love
on
earth
hitherto
it
was
not
owing
to
a
natural
law
but
simply
because
men
have
believed
in
immortality
ivan
fyodorovitch
added
in
parenthesis
that
the
whole
natural
law
lies
in
that
faith
and
that
if
you
were
to
destroy
in
mankind
the
belief
in
immortality
not
only
love
but
every
living
force
maintaining
the
life
of
the
world
would
at
once
be
dried
up
moreover
nothing
then
would
be
immoral
everything
would
be
lawful
even
cannibalism
thats
not
all
he
ended
by
asserting
that
for
every
individual
like
ourselves
who
does
not
believe
in
god
or
immortality
the
moral
law
of
nature
must
immediately
be
changed
into
the
exact
contrary
of
the
former
religious
law
and
that
egoism
even
to
crime
must
become
not
only
lawful
but
even
recognized
as
the
inevitable
the
most
rational
even
honorable
outcome
of
his
position
from
this
paradox
gentlemen
you
can
judge
of
the
rest
of
our
eccentric
and
paradoxical
friend
ivan
fyodorovitchs
theories
excuse
me
dmitri
cried
suddenly
if
ive
heard
aright
crime
must
not
only
be
permitted
but
even
recognized
as
the
inevitable
and
the
most
rational
outcome
of
his
position
for
every
infidel
is
that
so
or
not
quite
so
said
father
passy
ill
remember
it
having
uttered
these
words
dmitri
ceased
speaking
as
suddenly
as
he
had
begun
every
one
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
is
that
really
your
conviction
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
disappearance
of
the
faith
in
immortality
the
elder
asked
ivan
suddenly
yes
that
was
my
contention
there
is
no
virtue
if
there
is
no
immortality
you
are
blessed
in
believing
that
or
else
most
unhappy
why
unhappy
ivan
asked
smiling
because
in
all
probability
you
dont
believe
yourself
in
the
immortality
of
your
soul
nor
in
what
you
have
written
yourself
in
your
article
on
church
jurisdiction
perhaps
you
are
right

but
i
wasnt
altogether
joking
ivan
suddenly
and
strangely
confessed
flushing
quickly
you
were
not
altogether
joking
thats
true
the
question
is
still
fretting
your
heart
and
not
answered
but
the
martyr
likes
sometimes
to
divert
himself
with
his
despair
as
it
were
driven
to
it
by
despair
itself
meanwhile
in
your
despair
you
too
divert
yourself
with
magazine
articles
and
discussions
in
society
though
you
dont
believe
your
own
arguments
and
with
an
aching
heart
mock
at
them
inwardly
that
question
you
have
not
answered
and
it
is
your
great
grief
for
it
clamors
for
an
answer
but
can
it
be
answered
by
me
answered
in
the
affirmative
ivan
went
on
asking
strangely
still
looking
at
the
elder
with
the
same
inexplicable
smile
if
it
cant
be
decided
in
the
affirmative
it
will
never
be
decided
in
the
negative
you
know
that
that
is
the
peculiarity
of
your
heart
and
all
its
suffering
is
due
to
it
but
thank
the
creator
who
has
given
you
a
lofty
heart
capable
of
such
suffering
of
thinking
and
seeking
higher
things
for
our
dwelling
is
in
the
heavens
god
grant
that
your
heart
will
attain
the
answer
on
earth
and
may
god
bless
your
path
the
elder
raised
his
hand
and
would
have
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
ivan
from
where
he
stood
but
the
latter
rose
from
his
seat
went
up
to
him
received
his
blessing
and
kissing
his
hand
went
back
to
his
place
in
silence
his
face
looked
firm
and
earnest
this
action
and
all
the
preceding
conversation
which
was
so
surprising
from
ivan
impressed
every
one
by
its
strangeness
and
a
certain
solemnity
so
that
all
were
silent
for
a
moment
and
there
was
a
look
almost
of
apprehension
in
alyoshas
face
but
misov
suddenly
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
at
the
same
moment
fyodor
pavlovitch
jumped
up
from
his
seat
most
pious
and
holy
elder
he
cried
pointing
to
ivan
that
is
my
son
flesh
of
my
flesh
the
dearest
of
my
flesh
he
is
my
most
dutiful
karl
moor
so
to
speak
while
this
son
who
has
just
come
in
dmitri
against
whom
i
am
seeking
justice
from
you
is
the
undutiful
franz
moorthey
are
both
out
of
schillers
robbers
and
so
i
am
the
reigning
count
von
moor
judge
and
save
us
we
need
not
only
your
prayers
but
your
prophecies
speak
without
buffoonery
and
dont
begin
by
insulting
the
members
of
your
family
answered
the
elder
in
a
faint
exhausted
voice
he
was
obviously
getting
more
and
more
fatigued
and
his
strength
was
failing
an
unseemly
farce
which
i
foresaw
when
i
came
here
cried
dmitri
indignantly
he
too
leapt
up
forgive
it
reverend
father
he
added
addressing
the
elder
i
am
not
a
cultivated
man
and
i
dont
even
know
how
to
address
you
properly
but
you
have
been
deceived
and
you
have
been
too
goodnatured
in
letting
us
meet
here
all
my
father
wants
is
a
scandal
why
he
wants
it
only
he
can
tell
he
always
has
some
motive
but
i
believe
i
know
why
they
all
blame
me
all
of
them
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
his
turn
pyotr
alexandrovitch
here
blames
me
too
you
have
been
blaming
me
pyotr
alexandrovitch
you
have
he
turned
suddenly
to
misov
although
the
latter
was
not
dreaming
of
interrupting
him
they
all
accuse
me
of
having
hidden
the
childrens
money
in
my
boots
and
cheated
them
but
isnt
there
a
court
of
law
there
they
will
reckon
out
for
you
dmitri
fyodorovitch
from
your
notes
your
letters
and
your
agreements
how
much
money
you
had
how
much
you
have
spent
and
how
much
you
have
left
why
does
pyotr
alexandrovitch
refuse
to
pass
judgment
dmitri
is
not
a
stranger
to
him
because
they
are
all
against
me
while
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
in
debt
to
me
and
not
a
little
but
some
thousands
of
which
i
have
documentary
proof
the
whole
town
is
echoing
with
his
debaucheries
and
where
he
was
stationed
before
he
several
times
spent
a
thousand
or
two
for
the
seduction
of
some
respectable
girl
we
know
all
about
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
in
its
most
secret
details
ill
prove
it
would
you
believe
it
holy
father
he
has
captivated
the
heart
of
the
most
honorable
of
young
ladies
of
good
family
and
fortune
daughter
of
a
gallant
colonel
formerly
his
superior
officer
who
had
received
many
honors
and
had
the
anna
order
on
his
breast
he
compromised
the
girl
by
his
promise
of
marriage
now
she
is
an
orphan
and
here
she
is
betrothed
to
him
yet
before
her
very
eyes
he
is
dancing
attendance
on
a
certain
enchantress
and
although
this
enchantress
has
lived
in
so
to
speak
civil
marriage
with
a
respectable
man
yet
she
is
of
an
independent
character
an
unapproachable
fortress
for
everybody
just
like
a
legal
wifefor
she
is
virtuous
yes
holy
fathers
she
is
virtuous
dmitri
fyodorovitch
wants
to
open
this
fortress
with
a
golden
key
and
thats
why
he
is
insolent
to
me
now
trying
to
get
money
from
me
though
he
has
wasted
thousands
on
this
enchantress
already
hes
continually
borrowing
money
for
the
purpose
from
whom
do
you
think
shall
i
say
mitya
be
silent
cried
dmitri
wait
till
im
gone
dont
dare
in
my
presence
to
asperse
the
good
name
of
an
honorable
girl
that
you
should
utter
a
word
about
her
is
an
outrage
and
i
wont
permit
it
he
was
breathless
mitya
mitya
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
hysterically
squeezing
out
a
tear
and
is
your
fathers
blessing
nothing
to
you
if
i
curse
you
what
then
shameless
hypocrite
exclaimed
dmitri
furiously
he
says
that
to
his
father
his
father
what
would
he
be
with
others
gentlemen
only
fancy
theres
a
poor
but
honorable
man
living
here
burdened
with
a
numerous
family
a
captain
who
got
into
trouble
and
was
discharged
from
the
army
but
not
publicly
not
by
courtmartial
with
no
slur
on
his
honor
and
three
weeks
ago
dmitri
seized
him
by
the
beard
in
a
tavern
dragged
him
out
into
the
street
and
beat
him
publicly
and
all
because
he
is
an
agent
in
a
little
business
of
mine
its
all
a
lie
outwardly
its
the
truth
but
inwardly
a
lie
dmitri
was
trembling
with
rage
father
i
dont
justify
my
action
yes
i
confess
it
publicly
i
behaved
like
a
brute
to
that
captain
and
i
regret
it
now
and
im
disgusted
with
myself
for
my
brutal
rage
but
this
captain
this
agent
of
yours
went
to
that
lady
whom
you
call
an
enchantress
and
suggested
to
her
from
you
that
she
should
take
ious
of
mine
which
were
in
your
possession
and
should
sue
me
for
the
money
so
as
to
get
me
into
prison
by
means
of
them
if
i
persisted
in
claiming
an
account
from
you
of
my
property
now
you
reproach
me
for
having
a
weakness
for
that
lady
when
you
yourself
incited
her
to
captivate
me
she
told
me
so
to
my
face
she
told
me
the
story
and
laughed
at
you
you
wanted
to
put
me
in
prison
because
you
are
jealous
of
me
with
her
because
youd
begun
to
force
your
attentions
upon
her
and
i
know
all
about
that
too
she
laughed
at
you
for
that
as
wellyou
hearshe
laughed
at
you
as
she
described
it
so
here
you
have
this
man
this
father
who
reproaches
his
profligate
son
gentlemen
forgive
my
anger
but
i
foresaw
that
this
crafty
old
man
would
only
bring
you
together
to
create
a
scandal
i
had
come
to
forgive
him
if
he
held
out
his
hand
to
forgive
him
and
ask
forgiveness
but
as
he
has
just
this
minute
insulted
not
only
me
but
an
honorable
young
lady
for
whom
i
feel
such
reverence
that
i
dare
not
take
her
name
in
vain
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
show
up
his
game
though
he
is
my
father
he
could
not
go
on
his
eyes
were
glittering
and
he
breathed
with
difficulty
but
every
one
in
the
cell
was
stirred
all
except
father
zossima
got
up
from
their
seats
uneasily
the
monks
looked
austere
but
waited
for
guidance
from
the
elder
he
sat
still
pale
not
from
excitement
but
from
the
weakness
of
disease
an
imploring
smile
lighted
up
his
face
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
hand
as
though
to
check
the
storm
and
of
course
a
gesture
from
him
would
have
been
enough
to
end
the
scene
but
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
and
watched
them
intently
as
though
trying
to
make
out
something
which
was
not
perfectly
clear
to
him
at
last
misov
felt
completely
humiliated
and
disgraced
we
are
all
to
blame
for
this
scandalous
scene
he
said
hotly
but
i
did
not
foresee
it
when
i
came
though
i
knew
with
whom
i
had
to
deal
this
must
be
stopped
at
once
believe
me
your
reverence
i
had
no
precise
knowledge
of
the
details
that
have
just
come
to
light
i
was
unwilling
to
believe
them
and
i
learn
for
the
first
time
a
father
is
jealous
of
his
sons
relations
with
a
woman
of
loose
behavior
and
intrigues
with
the
creature
to
get
his
son
into
prison
this
is
the
company
in
which
i
have
been
forced
to
be
present
i
was
deceived
i
declare
to
you
all
that
i
was
as
much
deceived
as
any
one
dmitri
fyodorovitch
yelled
fyodor
pavlovitch
suddenly
in
an
unnatural
voice
if
you
were
not
my
son
i
would
challenge
you
this
instant
to
a
duel

with
pistols
at
three
paces

across
a
handkerchief
he
ended
stamping
with
both
feet
with
old
liars
who
have
been
acting
all
their
lives
there
are
moments
when
they
enter
so
completely
into
their
part
that
they
tremble
or
shed
tears
of
emotion
in
earnest
although
at
that
very
moment
or
a
second
later
they
are
able
to
whisper
to
themselves
you
know
you
are
lying
you
shameless
old
sinner
youre
acting
now
in
spite
of
your
holy
wrath
dmitri
frowned
painfully
and
looked
with
unutterable
contempt
at
his
father
i
thought

i
thought
he
said
in
a
soft
and
as
it
were
controlled
voice
that
i
was
coming
to
my
native
place
with
the
angel
of
my
heart
my
betrothed
to
cherish
his
old
age
and
i
find
nothing
but
a
depraved
profligate
a
despicable
clown
a
duel
yelled
the
old
wretch
again
breathless
and
spluttering
at
each
syllable
and
you
pyotr
alexandrovitch
misov
let
me
tell
you
that
there
has
never
been
in
all
your
family
a
loftier
and
more
honestyou
hearmore
honest
woman
than
this
creature
as
you
have
dared
to
call
her
and
you
dmitri
fyodorovitch
have
abandoned
your
betrothed
for
that
creature
so
you
must
yourself
have
thought
that
your
betrothed
couldnt
hold
a
candle
to
her
thats
the
woman
called
a
creature
shameful
broke
from
father
iosif
shameful
and
disgraceful
kalganov
flushing
crimson
cried
in
a
boyish
voice
trembling
with
emotion
he
had
been
silent
till
that
moment
why
is
such
a
man
alive
dmitri
beside
himself
with
rage
growled
in
a
hollow
voice
hunching
up
his
shoulders
till
he
looked
almost
deformed
tell
me
can
he
be
allowed
to
go
on
defiling
the
earth
he
looked
round
at
every
one
and
pointed
at
the
old
man
he
spoke
evenly
and
deliberately
listen
listen
monks
to
the
parricide
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
rushing
up
to
father
iosif
thats
the
answer
to
your
shameful
what
is
shameful
that
creature
that
woman
of
loose
behavior
is
perhaps
holier
than
you
are
yourselves
you
monks
who
are
seeking
salvation
she
fell
perhaps
in
her
youth
ruined
by
her
environment
but
she
loved
much
and
christ
himself
forgave
the
woman
who
loved
much

it
was
not
for
such
love
christ
forgave
her
broke
impatiently
from
the
gentle
father
iosif
yes
it
was
for
such
monks
it
was
you
save
your
souls
here
eating
cabbage
and
think
you
are
the
righteous
you
eat
a
gudgeon
a
day
and
you
think
you
bribe
god
with
gudgeon
this
is
unendurable
was
heard
on
all
sides
in
the
cell
but
this
unseemly
scene
was
cut
short
in
a
most
unexpected
way
father
zossima
rose
suddenly
from
his
seat
almost
distracted
with
anxiety
for
the
elder
and
every
one
else
alyosha
succeeded
however
in
supporting
him
by
the
arm
father
zossima
moved
towards
dmitri
and
reaching
him
sank
on
his
knees
before
him
alyosha
thought
that
he
had
fallen
from
weakness
but
this
was
not
so
the
elder
distinctly
and
deliberately
bowed
down
at
dmitris
feet
till
his
forehead
touched
the
floor
alyosha
was
so
astounded
that
he
failed
to
assist
him
when
he
got
up
again
there
was
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips
goodby
forgive
me
all
of
you
he
said
bowing
on
all
sides
to
his
guests
dmitri
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
amazement
bowing
down
to
himwhat
did
it
mean
suddenly
he
cried
aloud
oh
god
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
all
the
guests
flocked
out
after
him
in
their
confusion
not
saying
goodby
or
bowing
to
their
host
only
the
monks
went
up
to
him
again
for
a
blessing
what
did
it
mean
falling
at
his
feet
like
that
was
it
symbolic
or
what
said
fyodor
pavlovitch
suddenly
quieted
and
trying
to
reopen
conversation
without
venturing
to
address
anybody
in
particular
they
were
all
passing
out
of
the
precincts
of
the
hermitage
at
the
moment
i
cant
answer
for
a
madhouse
and
for
madmen
misov
answered
at
once
illhumoredly
but
i
will
spare
myself
your
company
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
trust
me
for
ever
wheres

monk

monk
who
had
invited
them
to
dine
with
the
superior
did
not
keep
them
waiting
he
met
them
as
soon
as
they
came
down
the
steps
from
the
elders
cell
as
though
he
had
been
waiting
for
them
all
the
time

table
greatly
as
i
should
desire
to
do

misov
said
irritably
to
the
monk
and
that
unforeseen
circumstance
of
course
is
myself
fyodor
pavlovitch
cut
in

thought
misov
still
hesitating
and
watching
the
retreating
buffoon
with
distrustful
eyes
the
latter
turned
round
and
noticing
that
misov
was
watching
him
waved
him
a
kiss
well
are
you
coming
to
the
superior
misov
asked
ivan
abruptly
why

was
especially
invited
yesterday
unfortunately
i
feel
myself
compelled
to
go
to
this
confounded
dinner
said
misov
with
the
same
irritability
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
monk
was
listening
we
ought
at
least
to
apologize
for
the
disturbance
and
explain
that
it
was
not
our
doing
what
do
you
think
yes
we
must
explain
that
it
wasnt
our
doing
besides
father
wont
be
there
observed
ivan
well
i
should
hope
not
confound
this
dinner
they
all
walked
on
however
the
monk
listened
in
silence
on
the
road
through
the
copse
he
made
one
observation
howeverthat
the
father
superior
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
and
that
they
were
more
than
half
an
hour
late
he
received
no
answer
misov
looked
with
hatred
at
ivan
here
he
is
going
to
the
dinner
as
though
nothing
had
happened
he
thought
a
brazen
face
and
the
conscience
of

chapter
vii
a
young
man
bent
on
a
career
alyosha
helped
father
zossima
to
his
bedroom
and
seated
him
on
his
bed
it
was
a
little
room
furnished
with
the
bare
necessities
there
was
a
narrow
iron
bedstead
with
a
strip
of
felt
for
a
mattress
in
the
corner
under
the
ikons
was
a
readingdesk
with
a
cross
and
the
gospel
lying
on
it
the
elder
sank
exhausted
on
the
bed
his
eyes
glittered
and
he
breathed
hard
he
looked
intently
at
alyosha
as
though
considering
something
go
my
dear
boy
go
porfiry
is
enough
for
me
make
haste
you
are
needed

and
wait

the
father
superiors
table

me
stay
here
alyosha
entreated

are
more
needed
there

no
peace
there
you
will
wait
and
be
of
service
if
evil
spirits
rise
up
repeat
a
prayer
and
remember
my
sonthe
elder
liked
to
call
him
thatthis
is
not
the
place
for
you
in
the
future
when
it
is
gods
will
to
call
me
leave
the
monastery
go
away
for
good
alyosha
started
what
is
it
this
is
not
your
place
for
the
time
i
bless
you
for
great
service
in
the
world
yours
will
be
a
long
pilgrimage
and
you
will
have
to
take
a
wife
too
you
will
have
to
bear
all
before
you
come
back
there
will
be
much
to
do
but
i
dont

of
you
and
so
i
send

and
he
will

sorrow
and
in
that
sorrow

will
be
happy

is
my
last
message
to

my
words
for
although
i
shall
talk
with
you
again
not
only
my
days
but
my
hours
are
numbered
alyoshas
face
again
betrayed
strong
emotion
the
corners
of
his
mouth
quivered
what
is
it
again
father
zossima
asked
smiling
gently
the
worldly
may
follow
the
dead
with
tears
but
here
we
rejoice
over
the
father
who
is
departing
we
rejoice
and
pray
for
him
leave
me
i
must
pray
go
and
make
haste
be
near
your
brothers
and
not
near
one
only
but
near
both
father
zossima
raised
his
hand
to
bless
him
alyosha
could
make
no
protest
though
he
had
a
great
longing
to
remain
he
longed
moreover
to
ask
the
significance
of
his
bowing
to
dmitri
the
question
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
but
he
dared
not
ask
it
he
knew
that
the
elder
would
have
explained
it
unasked
if
he
had
thought
fit
but
evidently
it
was
not
his
will
that
action
had
made
a
terrible
impression
on
alyosha
he
believed
blindly
in
its
mysterious
significance
mysterious
and
perhaps
awful
as
he
hastened
out
of
the
hermitage
precincts
to
reach
the
monastery
in
time
to
serve
at
the
father
superiors
dinner
he
felt
a
sudden
pang
at
his
heart
and
stopped
short
he
seemed
to
hear
again
father
zossimas
words
foretelling
his
approaching
end
what
he
had
foretold
so
exactly
must
infallibly
come
to
pass
alyosha
believed
that
implicitly
but
how
could
he
be
left
without
him
how
could
he
live
without
seeing
and
hearing
him
where
should
he
go
he
had
told
him
not
to
weep
and
to
leave
the
monastery
good
god
it
was
long
since
alyosha
had
known
such
anguish
he
hurried
through
the
copse
that
divided
the
monastery
from
the
hermitage
and
unable
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
thoughts
he
gazed
at
the
ancient
pines
beside
the
path
he
had
not
far
to
goabout
five
hundred
paces
he
expected
to
meet
no
one
at
that
hour
but
at
the
first
turn
of
the
path
he
noticed
rakitin
he
was
waiting
for
some
one
are
you
waiting
for
me
asked
alyosha
overtaking
him
yes
grinned
rakitin
you
are
hurrying
to
the
father
superior
i
know
he
has
a
banquet
theres
not
been
such
a
banquet
since
the
superior
entertained
the
bishop
and
general
pahatov
do
you
remember
i
shant
be
there
but
you
go
and
hand
the
sauces
tell
me
one
thing
alexey
what
does
that
vision
mean
thats
what
i
want
to
ask
you
what
vision
that
bowing
to
your
brother
dmitri
and
didnt
he
tap
the
ground
with
his
forehead
too
you
speak
of
father
zossima
yes
of
father
zossima
tapped
the
ground
ah
an
irreverent
expression
well
what
of
it
anyway
what
does
that
vision
mean
i
dont
know
what
it
means
misha
i
knew
he
wouldnt
explain
it
to
you
theres
nothing
wonderful
about
it
of
course
only
the
usual
holy
mummery
but
there
was
an
object
in
the
performance
all
the
pious
people
in
the
town
will
talk
about
it
and
spread
the
story
through
the
province
wondering
what
it
meant
to
my
thinking
the
old
man
really
has
a
keen
nose
he
sniffed
a
crime
your
house
stinks
of
it
what
crime
rakitin
evidently
had
something
he
was
eager
to
speak
of
itll
be
in
your
family
this
crime
between
your
brothers
and
your
rich
old
father
so
father
zossima
flopped
down
to
be
ready
for
what
may
turn
up
if
something
happens
later
on
itll
be
ah
the
holy
man
foresaw
it
prophesied
it
though
its
a
poor
sort
of
prophecy
flopping
like
that
ah
but
it
was
symbolic
theyll
say
an
allegory
and
the
devil
knows
what
all
itll
be
remembered
to
his
glory
he
predicted
the
crime
and
marked
the
criminal
thats
always
the
way
with
these
crazy
fanatics
they
cross
themselves
at
the
tavern
and
throw
stones
at
the
temple
like
your
elder
he
takes
a
stick
to
a
just
man
and
falls
at
the
feet
of
a
murderer
what
crime
what
murderer
what
do
you
mean
alyosha
stopped
dead
rakitin
stopped
too
what
murderer
as
though
you
didnt
know
ill
bet
youve
thought
of
it
before
thats
interesting
too
by
the
way
listen
alyosha
you
always
speak
the
truth
though
youre
always
between
two
stools
have
you
thought
of
it
or
not
answer
i
have
answered
alyosha
in
a
low
voice
even
rakitin
was
taken
aback
what
have
you
really
he
cried
i

ive
not
exactly
thought
it
muttered
alyosha
but
directly
you
began
speaking
so
strangely
i
fancied
i
had
thought
of
it
myself
you
see
and
how
well
you
expressed
it
looking
at
your
father
and
your
brother
mitya
today
you
thought
of
a
crime
then
im
not
mistaken
but
wait
wait
a
minute
alyosha
broke
in
uneasily
what
has
led
you
to
see
all
this
why
does
it
interest
you
thats
the
first
question
two
questions
disconnected
but
natural
ill
deal
with
them
separately
what
led
me
to
see
it
i
shouldnt
have
seen
it
if
i
hadnt
suddenly
understood
your
brother
dmitri
seen
right
into
the
very
heart
of
him
all
at
once
i
caught
the
whole
man
from
one
trait
these
very
honest
but
passionate
people
have
a
line
which
mustnt
be
crossed
if
it
were
hed
run
at
your
father
with
a
knife
but
your
fathers
a
drunken
and
abandoned
old
sinner
who
can
never
draw
the
lineif
they
both
let
themselves
go
theyll
both
come
to
grief
no
misha
no
if
thats
all
youve
reassured
me
it
wont
come
to
that
but
why
are
you
trembling
let
me
tell
you
he
may
be
honest
our
mitya
he
is
stupid
but
honest
but
hesa
sensualist
thats
the
very
definition
and
inner
essence
of
him
its
your
father
has
handed
him
on
his
low
sensuality
do
you
know
i
simply
wonder
at
you
alyosha
how
you
can
have
kept
your
purity
youre
a
karamazov
too
you
know
in
your
family
sensuality
is
carried
to
a
disease
but
now
these
three
sensualists
are
watching
one
another
with
their
knives
in
their
belts
the
three
of
them
are
knocking
their
heads
together
and
you
may
be
the
fourth
you
are
mistaken
about
that
woman
dmitridespises
her
said
alyosha
with
a
sort
of
shudder
grushenka
no
brother
he
doesnt
despise
her
since
he
has
openly
abandoned
his
betrothed
for
her
he
doesnt
despise
her
theres
something
here
my
dear
boy
that
you
dont
understand
yet
a
man
will
fall
in
love
with
some
beauty
with
a
womans
body
or
even
with
a
part
of
a
womans
body
a
sensualist
can
understand
that
and
hell
abandon
his
own
children
for
her
sell
his
father
and
mother
and
his
country
russia
too
if
hes
honest
hell
steal
if
hes
humane
hell
murder
if
hes
faithful
hell
deceive
pushkin
the
poet
of
womens
feet
sung
of
their
feet
in
his
verse
others
dont
sing
their
praises
but
they
cant
look
at
their
feet
without
a
thrilland
its
not
only
their
feet
contempts
no
help
here
brother
even
if
he
did
despise
grushenka
he
does
but
he
cant
tear
himself
away
i
understand
that
alyosha
jerked
out
suddenly
really
well
i
dare
say
you
do
understand
since
you
blurt
it
out
at
the
first
word
said
rakitin
malignantly
that
escaped
you
unawares
and
the
confessions
the
more
precious
so
its
a
familiar
subject
youve
thought
about
it
already
about
sensuality
i
mean
oh
you
virgin
soul
youre
a
quiet
one
alyosha
youre
a
saint
i
know
but
the
devil
only
knows
what
youve
thought
about
and
what
you
know
already
you
are
pure
but
youve
been
down
into
the
depths
ive
been
watching
you
a
long
time
youre
a
karamazov
yourself
youre
a
thorough
karamazovno
doubt
birth
and
selection
have
something
to
answer
for
youre
a
sensualist
from
your
father
a
crazy
saint
from
your
mother
why
do
you
tremble
is
it
true
then
do
you
know
grushenka
has
been
begging
me
to
bring
you
along
ill
pull
off
his
cassock
she
says
you
cant
think
how
she
keeps
begging
me
to
bring
you
i
wondered
why
she
took
such
an
interest
in
you
do
you
know
shes
an
extraordinary
woman
too
thank
her
and
say
im
not
coming
said
alyosha
with
a
strained
smile
finish
what
you
were
saying
misha
ill
tell
you
my
idea
after
theres
nothing
to
finish
its
all
clear
its
the
same
old
tune
brother
if
even
you
are
a
sensualist
at
heart
what
of
your
brother
ivan
hes
a
karamazov
too
what
is
at
the
root
of
all
you
karamazovs
is
that
youre
all
sensual
grasping
and
crazy
your
brother
ivan
writes
theological
articles
in
joke
for
some
idiotic
unknown
motive
of
his
own
though
hes
an
atheist
and
he
admits
its
a
fraud
himselfthats
your
brother
ivan
hes
trying
to
get
mityas
betrothed
for
himself
and
i
fancy
hell
succeed
too
and
whats
more
its
with
mityas
consent
for
mitya
will
surrender
his
betrothed
to
him
to
be
rid
of
her
and
escape
to
grushenka
and
hes
ready
to
do
that
in
spite
of
all
his
nobility
and
disinterestedness
observe
that
those
are
the
most
fatal
people
who
the
devil
can
make
you
out
he
recognizes
his
vileness
and
goes
on
with
it
let
me
tell
you
too
the
old
man
your
father
is
standing
in
mityas
way
now
he
has
suddenly
gone
crazy
over
grushenka
his
mouth
waters
at
the
sight
of
her
its
simply
on
her
account
he
made
that
scene
in
the
cell
just
now
simply
because
misov
called
her
an
abandoned
creature
hes
worse
than
a
tomcat
in
love
at
first
she
was
only
employed
by
him
in
connection
with
his
taverns
and
in
some
other
shady
business
but
now
he
has
suddenly
realized
all
she
is
and
has
gone
wild
about
her
he
keeps
pestering
her
with
his
offers
not
honorable
ones
of
course
and
theyll
come
into
collision
the
precious
father
and
son
on
that
path
but
grushenka
favors
neither
of
them
shes
still
playing
with
them
and
teasing
them
both
considering
which
she
can
get
most
out
of
for
though
she
could
filch
a
lot
of
money
from
the
papa
he
wouldnt
marry
her
and
maybe
hell
turn
stingy
in
the
end
and
keep
his
purse
shut
thats
where
mityas
value
comes
in
he
has
no
money
but
hes
ready
to
marry
her
yes
ready
to
marry
her
to
abandon
his
betrothed
a
rare
beauty
katerina
ivanovna
whos
rich
and
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
and
to
marry
grushenka
who
has
been
the
mistress
of
a
dissolute
old
merchant
samsonov
a
coarse
uneducated
provincial
mayor
some
murderous
conflict
may
well
come
to
pass
from
all
this
and
thats
what
your
brother
ivan
is
waiting
for
it
would
suit
him
down
to
the
ground
hell
carry
off
katerina
ivanovna
for
whom
he
is
languishing
and
pocket
her
dowry
of
sixty
thousand
thats
very
alluring
to
start
with
for
a
man
of
no
consequence
and
a
beggar
and
take
note
he
wont
be
wronging
mitya
but
doing
him
the
greatest
service
for
i
know
as
a
fact
that
mitya
only
last
week
when
he
was
with
some
gypsy
girls
drunk
in
a
tavern
cried
out
aloud
that
he
was
unworthy
of
his
betrothed
katya
but
that
his
brother
ivan
he
was
the
man
who
deserved
her
and
katerina
ivanovna
will
not
in
the
end
refuse
such
a
fascinating
man
as
ivan
shes
hesitating
between
the
two
of
them
already
and
how
has
that
ivan
won
you
all
so
that
you
all
worship
him
he
is
laughing
at
you
and
enjoying
himself
at
your
expense
how
do
you
know
how
can
you
speak
so
confidently
alyosha
asked
sharply
frowning
why
do
you
ask
and
are
frightened
at
my
answer
it
shows
that
you
know
im
speaking
the
truth
you
dont
like
ivan
ivan
wouldnt
be
tempted
by
money
really
and
the
beauty
of
katerina
ivanovna
its
not
only
the
money
though
a
fortune
of
sixty
thousand
is
an
attraction
ivan
is
above
that
he
wouldnt
make
up
to
any
one
for
thousands
it
is
not
money
its
not
comfort
ivan
is
seeking
perhaps
its
suffering
he
is
seeking
what
wild
dream
now
oh
youaristocrats
ah
misha
he
has
a
stormy
spirit
his
mind
is
in
bondage
he
is
haunted
by
a
great
unsolved
doubt
he
is
one
of
those
who
dont
want
millions
but
an
answer
to
their
questions
thats
plagiarism
alyosha
youre
quoting
your
elders
phrases
ah
ivan
has
set
you
a
problem
cried
rakitin
with
undisguised
malice
his
face
changed
and
his
lips
twitched
and
the
problems
a
stupid
one
it
is
no
good
guessing
it
rack
your
brainsyoull
understand
it
his
article
is
absurd
and
ridiculous
and
did
you
hear
his
stupid
theory
just
now
if
theres
no
immortality
of
the
soul
then
theres
no
virtue
and
everything
is
lawful
and
by
the
way
do
you
remember
how
your
brother
mitya
cried
out
i
will
remember
an
attractive
theory
for
scoundrelsim
being
abusive
thats
stupid
not
for
scoundrels
but
for
pedantic
poseurs
haunted
by
profound
unsolved
doubts
hes
showing
off
and
what
it
all
comes
to
is
on
the
one
hand
we
cannot
but
admit
and
on
the
other
it
must
be
confessed
his
whole
theory
is
a
fraud
humanity
will
find
in
itself
the
power
to
live
for
virtue
even
without
believing
in
immortality
it
will
find
it
in
love
for
freedom
for
equality
for
fraternity
rakitin
could
hardly
restrain
himself
in
his
heat
but
suddenly
as
though
remembering
something
he
stopped
short
well
thats
enough
he
said
with
a
still
more
crooked
smile
why
are
you
laughing
do
you
think
im
a
vulgar
fool
no
i
never
dreamed
of
thinking
you
a
vulgar
fool
you
are
clever
but

never
mind
i
was
silly
to
smile
i
understand
your
getting
hot
about
it
misha
i
guess
from
your
warmth
that
you
are
not
indifferent
to
katerina
ivanovna
yourself
ive
suspected
that
for
a
long
time
brother
thats
why
you
dont
like
my
brother
ivan
are
you
jealous
of
him
and
jealous
of
her
money
too
wont
you
add
that
ill
say
nothing
about
money
i
am
not
going
to
insult
you
i
believe
it
since
you
say
so
but
confound
you
and
your
brother
ivan
with
you
dont
you
understand
that
one
might
very
well
dislike
him
apart
from
katerina
ivanovna
and
why
the
devil
should
i
like
him
he
condescends
to
abuse
me
you
know
why
havent
i
a
right
to
abuse
him
i
never
heard
of
his
saying
anything
about
you
good
or
bad
he
doesnt
speak
of
you
at
all
but
i
heard
that
the
day
before
yesterday
at
katerina
ivanovnas
he
was
abusing
me
for
all
he
was
worthyou
see
what
an
interest
he
takes
in
your
humble
servant
and
which
is
the
jealous
one
after
that
brother
i
cant
say
he
was
so
good
as
to
express
the
opinion
that
if
i
dont
go
in
for
the
career
of
an
archimandrite
in
the
immediate
future
and
dont
become
a
monk
i
shall
be
sure
to
go
to
petersburg
and
get
on
to
some
solid
magazine
as
a
reviewer
that
i
shall
write
for
the
next
ten
years
and
in
the
end
become
the
owner
of
the
magazine
and
bring
it
out
on
the
liberal
and
atheistic
side
with
a
socialistic
tinge
with
a
tiny
gloss
of
socialism
but
keeping
a
sharp
look
out
all
the
time
that
is
keeping
in
with
both
sides
and
hoodwinking
the
fools
according
to
your
brothers
account
the
tinge
of
socialism
wont
hinder
me
from
laying
by
the
proceeds
and
investing
them
under
the
guidance
of
some
jew
till
at
the
end
of
my
career
i
build
a
great
house
in
petersburg
and
move
my
publishing
offices
to
it
and
let
out
the
upper
stories
to
lodgers
he
has
even
chosen
the
place
for
it
near
the
new
stone
bridge
across
the
neva
which
they
say
is
to
be
built
in
petersburg
ah
misha
thats
just
what
will
really
happen
every
word
of
it
cried
alyosha
unable
to
restrain
a
goodhumored
smile
you
are
pleased
to
be
sarcastic
too
alexey
fyodorovitch
no
no
im
joking
forgive
me
ive
something
quite
different
in
my
mind
but
excuse
me
who
can
have
told
you
all
this
you
cant
have
been
at
katerina
ivanovnas
yourself
when
he
was
talking
about
you
i
wasnt
there
but
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
and
i
heard
him
tell
it
with
my
own
ears
if
you
want
to
know
he
didnt
tell
me
but
i
overheard
him
unintentionally
of
course
for
i
was
sitting
in
grushenkas
bedroom
and
i
couldnt
go
away
because
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
in
the
next
room
oh
yes
id
forgotten
she
was
a
relation
of
yours
a
relation
that
grushenka
a
relation
of
mine
cried
rakitin
turning
crimson
are
you
mad
youre
out
of
your
mind
why
isnt
she
a
relation
of
yours
i
heard
so
where
can
you
have
heard
it
you
karamazovs
brag
of
being
an
ancient
noble
family
though
your
father
used
to
run
about
playing
the
buffoon
at
other
mens
tables
and
was
only
admitted
to
the
kitchen
as
a
favor
i
may
be
only
a
priests
son
and
dirt
in
the
eyes
of
noblemen
like
you
but
dont
insult
me
so
lightly
and
wantonly
i
have
a
sense
of
honor
too
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
couldnt
be
a
relation
of
grushenka
a
common
harlot
i
beg
you
to
understand
that
rakitin
was
intensely
irritated
forgive
me
for
goodness
sake
i
had
no
idea

besides

how
can
you
call
her
a
harlot
is
she

that
sort
of
woman
alyosha
flushed
suddenly
i
tell
you
again
i
heard
that
she
was
a
relation
of
yours
you
often
go
to
see
her
and
you
told
me
yourself
youre
not
her
lover
i
never
dreamed
that
you
of
all
people
had
such
contempt
for
her
does
she
really
deserve
it
i
may
have
reasons
of
my
own
for
visiting
her
thats
not
your
business
but
as
for
relationship
your
brother
or
even
your
father
is
more
likely
to
make
her
yours
than
mine
well
here
we
are
youd
better
go
to
the
kitchen
hullo
whats
wrong
what
is
it
are
we
late
they
cant
have
finished
dinner
so
soon
have
the
karamazovs
been
making
trouble
again
no
doubt
they
have
heres
your
father
and
your
brother
ivan
after
him
theyve
broken
out
from
the
father
superiors
and
look
father
isidors
shouting
out
something
after
them
from
the
steps
and
your
fathers
shouting
and
waving
his
arms
i
expect
hes
swearing
bah
and
there
goes
misov
driving
away
in
his
carriage
you
see
hes
going
and
theres
old
maximov
runningthere
must
have
been
a
row
there
cant
have
been
any
dinner
surely
theyve
not
been
beating
the
father
superior
or
have
they
perhaps
been
beaten
it
would
serve
them
right
there
was
reason
for
rakitins
exclamations
there
had
been
a
scandalous
an
unprecedented
scene
it
had
all
come
from
the
impulse
of
a
moment
chapter
viii
the
scandalous
scene
misov
as
a
man
of
breeding
and
delicacy
could
not
but
feel
some
inward
qualms
when
he
reached
the
father
superiors
with
ivan
he
felt
ashamed
of
having
lost
his
temper
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
disdained
that
despicable
wretch
fyodor
pavlovitch
too
much
to
have
been
upset
by
him
in
father
zossimas
cell
and
so
to
have
forgotten
himself
the
monks
were
not
to
blame
in
any
case
he
reflected
on
the
steps
and
if
theyre
decent
people
here
and
the
father
superior
i
understand
is
a
nobleman
why
not
be
friendly
and
courteous
with
them
i
wont
argue
ill
fall
in
with
everything
ill
win
them
by
politeness
and

and

show
them
that
ive
nothing
to
do
with
that
sop
that
buffoon
that
pierrot
and
have
merely
been
taken
in
over
this
affair
just
as
they
have
he
determined
to
drop
his
litigation
with
the
monastery
and
relinquish
his
claims
to
the
woodcutting
and
fishery
rights
at
once
he
was
the
more
ready
to
do
this
because
the
rights
had
become
much
less
valuable
and
he
had
indeed
the
vaguest
idea
where
the
wood
and
river
in
question
were
these
excellent
intentions
were
strengthened
when
he
entered
the
father
superiors
diningroom
though
strictly
speaking
it
was
not
a
dining
room
for
the
father
superior
had
only
two
rooms
altogether
they
were
however
much
larger
and
more
comfortable
than
father
zossimas
but
there
was
no
great
luxury
about
the
furnishing
of
these
rooms
either
the
furniture
was
of
mahogany
covered
with
leather
in
the
oldfashioned
style
of
1820
the
floor
was
not
even
stained
but
everything
was
shining
with
cleanliness
and
there
were
many
choice
flowers
in
the
windows
the
most
sumptuous
thing
in
the
room
at
the
moment
was
of
course
the
beautifully
decorated
table
the
cloth
was
clean
the
service
shone
there
were
three
kinds
of
wellbaked
bread
two
bottles
of
wine
two
of
excellent
mead
and
a
large
glass
jug
of
kvasboth
the
latter
made
in
the
monastery
and
famous
in
the
neighborhood
there
was
no
vodka
rakitin
related
afterwards
that
there
were
five
dishes
fishsoup
made
of
sterlets
served
with
little
fish
patties
then
boiled
fish
served
in
a
special
way
then
salmon
cutlets
ice
pudding
and
compote
and
finally
blancmange
rakitin
found
out
about
all
these
good
things
for
he
could
not
resist
peeping
into
the
kitchen
where
he
already
had
a
footing
he
had
a
footing
everywhere
and
got
information
about
everything
he
was
of
an
uneasy
and
envious
temper
he
was
well
aware
of
his
own
considerable
abilities
and
nervously
exaggerated
them
in
his
selfconceit
he
knew
he
would
play
a
prominent
part
of
some
sort
but
alyosha
who
was
attached
to
him
was
distressed
to
see
that
his
friend
rakitin
was
dishonorable
and
quite
unconscious
of
being
so
himself
considering
on
the
contrary
that
because
he
would
not
steal
money
left
on
the
table
he
was
a
man
of
the
highest
integrity
neither
alyosha
nor
any
one
else
could
have
influenced
him
in
that
rakitin
of
course
was
a
person
of
too
little
consequence
to
be
invited
to
the
dinner
to
which
father
iosif
father
passy
and
one
other
monk
were
the
only
inmates
of
the
monastery
invited
they
were
already
waiting
when
misov
kalganov
and
ivan
arrived
the
other
guest
maximov
stood
a
little
aside
waiting
also
the
father
superior
stepped
into
the
middle
of
the
room
to
receive
his
guests
he
was
a
tall
thin
but
still
vigorous
old
man
with
black
hair
streaked
with
gray
and
a
long
grave
ascetic
face
he
bowed
to
his
guests
in
silence
but
this
time
they
approached
to
receive
his
blessing
misov
even
tried
to
kiss
his
hand
but
the
father
superior
drew
it
back
in
time
to
avoid
the
salute
but
ivan
and
kalganov
went
through
the
ceremony
in
the
most
simplehearted
and
complete
manner
kissing
his
hand
as
peasants
do
we
must
apologize
most
humbly
your
reverence
began
misov
simpering
affably
and
speaking
in
a
dignified
and
respectful
tone
pardon
us
for
having
come
alone
without
the
gentleman
you
invited
fyodor
pavlovitch
he
felt
obliged
to
decline
the
honor
of
your
hospitality
and
not
without
reason
in
the
reverend
father
zossimas
cell
he
was
carried
away
by
the
unhappy
dissension
with
his
son
and
let
fall
words
which
were
quite
out
of
keeping

in
fact
quite
unseemly

ashe
glanced
at
the
monksyour
reverence
is
no
doubt
already
aware
and
therefore
recognizing
that
he
had
been
to
blame
he
felt
sincere
regret
and
shame
and
begged
me
and
his
son
ivan
fyodorovitch
to
convey
to
you
his
apologies
and
regrets
in
brief
he
hopes
and
desires
to
make
amends
later
he
asks
your
blessing
and
begs
you
to
forget
what
has
taken
place
as
he
uttered
the
last
word
of
his
tirade
misov
completely
recovered
his
selfcomplacency
and
all
traces
of
his
former
irritation
disappeared
he
fully
and
sincerely
loved
humanity
again
the
father
superior
listened
to
him
with
dignity
and
with
a
slight
bend
of
the
head
replied
i
sincerely
deplore
his
absence
perhaps
at
our
table
he
might
have
learnt
to
like
us
and
we
him
pray
be
seated
gentlemen
he
stood
before
the
holy
image
and
began
to
say
grace
aloud
all
bent
their
heads
reverently
and
maximov
clasped
his
hands
before
him
with
peculiar
fervor
it
was
at
this
moment
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
played
his
last
prank
it
must
be
noted
that
he
really
had
meant
to
go
home
and
really
had
felt
the
impossibility
of
going
to
dine
with
the
father
superior
as
though
nothing
had
happened
after
his
disgraceful
behavior
in
the
elders
cell
not
that
he
was
so
very
much
ashamed
of
himselfquite
the
contrary
perhaps
but
still
he
felt
it
would
be
unseemly
to
go
to
dinner
yet
his
creaking
carriage
had
hardly
been
brought
to
the
steps
of
the
hotel
and
he
had
hardly
got
into
it
when
he
suddenly
stopped
short
he
remembered
his
own
words
at
the
elders
i
always
feel
when
i
meet
people
that
i
am
lower
than
all
and
that
they
all
take
me
for
a
buffoon
so
i
say
let
me
play
the
buffoon
for
you
are
every
one
of
you
stupider
and
lower
than
i
he
longed
to
revenge
himself
on
every
one
for
his
own
unseemliness
he
suddenly
recalled
how
he
had
once
in
the
past
been
asked
why
do
you
hate
so
and
so
so
much
and
he
had
answered
them
with
his
shameless
impudence
ill
tell
you
he
has
done
me
no
harm
but
i
played
him
a
dirty
trick
and
ever
since
i
have
hated
him
remembering
that
now
he
smiled
quietly
and
malignantly
hesitating
for
a
moment
his
eyes
gleamed
and
his
lips
positively
quivered
well
since
i
have
begun
i
may
as
well
go
on
he
decided
his
predominant
sensation
at
that
moment
might
be
expressed
in
the
following
words
well
there
is
no
rehabilitating
myself
now
so
let
me
shame
them
for
all
i
am
worth
i
will
show
them
i
dont
care
what
they
thinkthats
all
he
told
the
coachman
to
wait
while
with
rapid
steps
he
returned
to
the
monastery
and
straight
to
the
father
superiors
he
had
no
clear
idea
what
he
would
do
but
he
knew
that
he
could
not
control
himself
and
that
a
touch
might
drive
him
to
the
utmost
limits
of
obscenity
but
only
to
obscenity
to
nothing
criminal
nothing
for
which
he
could
be
legally
punished
in
the
last
resort
he
could
always
restrain
himself
and
had
marveled
indeed
at
himself
on
that
score
sometimes
he
appeared
in
the
father
superiors
diningroom
at
the
moment
when
the
prayer
was
over
and
all
were
moving
to
the
table
standing
in
the
doorway
he
scanned
the
company
and
laughing
his
prolonged
impudent
malicious
chuckle
looked
them
all
boldly
in
the
face
they
thought
i
had
gone
and
here
i
am
again
he
cried
to
the
whole
room
for
one
moment
every
one
stared
at
him
without
a
word
and
at
once
every
one
felt
that
something
revolting
grotesque
positively
scandalous
was
about
to
happen
misov
passed
immediately
from
the
most
benevolent
frame
of
mind
to
the
most
savage
all
the
feelings
that
had
subsided
and
died
down
in
his
heart
revived
instantly
no
this
i
cannot
endure
he
cried
i
absolutely
cannot
and

i
certainly
cannot
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
he
positively
stammered
but
he
was
beyond
thinking
of
style
and
he
seized
his
hat
what
is
it
he
cannot
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
that
he
absolutely
cannot
and
certainly
cannot
your
reverence
am
i
to
come
in
or
not
will
you
receive
me
as
your
guest
you
are
welcome
with
all
my
heart
answered
the
superior
gentlemen
he
added
i
venture
to
beg
you
most
earnestly
to
lay
aside
your
dissensions
and
to
be
united
in
love
and
family
harmonywith
prayer
to
the
lord
at
our
humble
table
no
no
it
is
impossible
cried
misov
beside
himself
well
if
it
is
impossible
for
pyotr
alexandrovitch
it
is
impossible
for
me
and
i
wont
stop
that
is
why
i
came
i
will
keep
with
pyotr
alexandrovitch
everywhere

you
will

pyotr
alexandrovitch
i
will

him
by
what
you
said
about

maximov
puzzled
of

cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
else

father

and
in
spite
of
his
venerable
age
he
was
nailed
up
in
a
box
and
sent
from
petersburg
to
moscow
in
the
luggage
van
and
while
they
were
nailing
him
up
the
harlots
sang
songs
and
played
the
harp
that
is
to
say
the
piano

in

taking
another
step
into
the
room

to
finish
there
in
the

honor
and
i
want
to
speak
my
mind
yes
i
am
the
soul
of
honor
while
in
pyotr
alexandrovitch
there
is
wounded
vanity
and
nothing
else
i
came
here
perhaps
to
have
a
look
and
speak
my

my
son

here
being
saved
i

been
playing

fool
i
have
been
listening
and
having
a
look
on
the
sly
and
now
i
want
to
give
you
the
last
act
of
the
performance
you
know
how
things
are
with
us
as
a
thing
falls
so
it
lies
as
a
thing
once
has
fallen
so
it
must
lie
for
ever
not
a
bit
of
it
i
want
to
get
up
again
holy
father
i
am
indignant
with
you
confession
is
a
great
sacrament
before
which
i
am
ready
to
bow
down
reverently
but
there
in
the
cell
they
all
kneel
down
and
confess
aloud
can
it
be
right
to
confess
aloud
it
was
ordained
by
the
holy
fathers
to
confess
in
secret
then
only
your
confession
will
be
a
mystery
and
so
it
was
of
old
but
how
can
i
explain
to
him
before
every
one
that
i
did
this
and
that

well
you
understand
whatsometimes
it
would
not
be
proper
to
talk
about
itso
it
is
really
a
scandal
no
fathers
one
might
be
carried
along
with
you
to
the
flagellants
i
dare
say

at
the
first
opportunity
i
shall
write
to
the
synod
and
i
shall
take
my
son
alexey
home
we
must
note
here
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
knew
where
to
look
for
the
weak
spot
there
had
been
at
one
time
malicious
rumors
which
had
even
reached
the
archbishop
not
only
regarding
our
monastery
but
in
others
where
the
institution
of
elders
existed
that
too
much
respect
was
paid
to
the
elders
even
to
the
detriment
of
the
authority
of
the
superior
that
the
elders
abused
the
sacrament
of
confession
and
so
on
and
so
onabsurd
charges
which
had
died
away
of
themselves
everywhere
but
the
spirit
of
folly
which
had
caught
up
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
was
bearing
him
on
the
current
of
his
own
nerves
into
lower
and
lower
depths
of
ignominy
prompted
him
with
this
old
slander
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
understand
a
word
of
it
and
he
could
not
even
put
it
sensibly
for
on
this
occasion
no
one
had
been
kneeling
and
confessing
aloud
in
the
elders
cell
so
that
he
could
not
have
seen
anything
of
the
kind
he
was
only
speaking
from
confused
memory
of
old
slanders
but
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
his
foolish
tirade
he
felt
he
had
been
talking
absurd
nonsense
and
at
once
longed
to
prove
to
his
audience
and
above
all
to
himself
that
he
had
not
been
talking
nonsense
and
though
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
with
each
word
he
would
be
adding
more
and
more
absurdity
he
could
not
restrain
himself
and
plunged
forward
blindly
how
disgraceful
cried
pyotr
alexandrovitch
pardon
me
said
the
father
superior
it
was
said
of
old
many
have
begun
to
speak
against
me
and
have
uttered
evil
sayings
about
me
and
hearing
it
i
have
said
to
myself
it
is
the
correction
of
the
lord
and
he
has
sent
it
to
heal
my
vain
soul
and
so
we
humbly
thank
you
honored
guest
and
he
made
fyodor
pavlovitch
a
low
bow
tuttuttutsanctimoniousness
and
stock
phrases

he
thumped
the
table
with
his
fist
in
a
paroxysm
of
simulated
feeling
this
monastery
has
played
a
great
part
in
my
life
it
has
cost
me
many
bitter
tears
you
used
to
set
my
wife
the
crazy
one
against

you
cursed

with

spread

get
out
of
me
it
must
be
noted
again
that
our
monastery
never
had
played
any
great
part
in
his
life
and
he
never
had
shed
a
bitter
tear
owing
to
it
but
he
was
so
carried
away
by
his
simulated
emotion
that
he
was
for
one
moment
almost
believing
it
himself
he
was
so
touched
he
was
almost
weeping
but
at
that
very
instant
he
felt
that
it
was
time
to
draw
back
the
father
superior
bowed
his
head
at
his
malicious
lie

gladly

alyosha
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
watching
the
scene
in
silence
meanwhile
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
got
into
the
carriage
and
ivan
was
about
to
follow
him
in
grim
silence
without
even
turning
to
say
goodby
to
alyosha
but
at
this
point
another
almost
incredible
scene
of
grotesque
buffoonery
gave
the
finishing
touch
to
the
episode
maximov
suddenly
appeared
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
he
ran
up
panting
afraid
of
being
too
late
rakitin
and
alyosha
saw
him
running
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
in
his
impatience
he
put
his
foot
on
the
step
on
which
ivans
left
foot
was
still
resting
and
clutching
the
carriage
he
kept
trying
to
jump
in
i
am
going
with
you
he
kept
shouting
laughing
a
thin
mirthful
laugh
with
a
look
of
reckless
glee
in
his
face
take
me
too
there
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
delighted
did
i
not
say
he
was

why
how
did
you
tear
yourself
away
what
did
you
vonsohn
there
and
how
could
you
get
away
from
the
dinner
you
must
be
a
brazenfaced
fellow
i
am
that
myself
but
i
am
surprised
at
you

jump
in
jump
in
let
him
pass
ivan
it
will
be
fun
he
can

at
our
feet
will
you
lie
at

or
perch
on
the
box
with
the
coachman

on
to

box
von
sohn
but
ivan
who
had
by
now
taken
his
seat
without
a
word
gave
maximov
a
violent
punch
in
the
breast
and
sent
him
flying
it
was
quite
by
chance
he
did
not
fall
drive
on
ivan
shouted
angrily
to
the
coachman
why
what
are
you
doing
what
are
you
about
why
did
you
do
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
protested
but
the
carriage
had
already
driven
away
ivan
made
no
reply
well
you
are
a
fellow
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
again
after
a
pause
of
two
minutes
looking
askance
at
his
son
why
it
was
you
got
up
all
this
monastery
business
you
urged
it
you
approved
of
it
why
are
you
angry
now
youve
talked
rot
enough
you
might
rest
a
bit
now
ivan
snapped
sullenly
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
silent
again
for
two
minutes
a
drop
of
brandy
would
be
nice
now
he
observed
sententiously
but
ivan
made
no
response
you
shall
have
some
too
when
we
get
home
ivan
was
still
silent
fyodor
pavlovitch
waited
another
two
minutes
but
i
shall
take
alyosha
away
from
the
monastery
though
you
will
dislike
it
so
much

ivan
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
and
turning
away
stared
at
the

they
did
not
speak
again

the

in
the
servants
quarters
the
karamazovs
house
was
far
from
being
in
the
center
of
the
town
but
it
was
not
quite
outside
it
it
was
a
pleasantlooking
old
house
of
two
stories
painted
gray
with
a
red
iron
roof
it
was
roomy
and
snug
and
might
still
last
many
years
there
were
all
sorts
of
unexpected
little
cupboards
and
closets
and
staircases
there
were
rats
in
it
but
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
altogether
dislike
them
one
doesnt
feel
so
solitary
when
ones
left
alone
in
the
evening
he
used
to
say
it
was
his
habit
to
send
the
servants
away
to
the
lodge
for
the
night
and
to
lock
himself
up
alone
the
lodge
was
a
roomy
and
solid
building
in
the
yard
fyodor
pavlovitch
used
to
have
the
cooking
done
there
although
there
was
a
kitchen
in
the
house
he
did
not
like
the
smell
of
cooking
and
winter
and
summer
alike
the
dishes
were
carried
in
across
the
courtyard
the
house
was
built
for
a
large
family
there
was
room
for
five
times
as
many
with
their
servants
but
at
the
time
of
our
story
there
was
no
one
living
in
the
house
but
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
his
son
ivan
and
in
the
lodge
there
were
only
three
servants
old
grigory
and
his
old
wife
marfa
and
a
young
man
called
smerdyakov
of
these
three
we
must
say
a
few
words
of
old
grigory
we
have
said
something
already
he
was
firm
and
determined
and
went
blindly
and
obstinately
for
his
object
if
once
he
had
been
brought
by
any
reasons
and
they
were
often
very
illogical
ones
to
believe
that
it
was
immutably
right
he
was
honest
and
incorruptible
his
wife
marfa
ignatyevna
had
obeyed
her
husbands
will
implicitly
all
her
life
yet
she
had
pestered
him
terribly
after
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
she
was
set
on
leaving
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
opening
a
little
shop
in
moscow
with
their
small
savings
but
grigory
decided
then
once
for
all
that
the
womans
talking
nonsense
for
every
woman
is
dishonest
and
that
they
ought
not
to
leave
their
old
master
whatever
he
might
be
for
that
was
now
their
duty
do
you
understand
what
duty
is
he
asked
marfa
ignatyevna
i
understand
what
duty
means
grigory
vassilyevitch
but
why
its
our
duty
to
stay
here
i
never
shall
understand
marfa
answered
firmly
well
dont
understand
then
but
so
it
shall
be
and
you
hold
your
tongue
and
so
it
was
they
did
not
go
away
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
promised
them
a
small
sum
for
wages
and
paid
it
regularly
grigory
knew
too
that
he
had
an
indisputable
influence
over
his
master
it
was
true
and
he
was
aware
of
it
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
an
obstinate
and
cunning
buffoon
yet
though
his
will
was
strong
enough
in
some
of
the
affairs
of
life
as
he
expressed
it
he
found
himself
to
his
surprise
extremely
feeble
in
facing
certain
other
emergencies
he
knew
his
weaknesses
and
was
afraid
of
them
there
are
positions
in
which
one
has
to
keep
a
sharp
look
out
and
thats
not
easy
without
a
trustworthy
man
and
grigory
was
a
most
trustworthy
man
many
times
in
the
course
of
his
life
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
only
just
escaped
a
sound
thrashing
through
grigorys
intervention
and
on
each
occasion
the
old
servant
gave
him
a
good
lecture
but
it
wasnt
only
thrashings
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
afraid
of
there
were
graver
occasions
and
very
subtle
and
complicated
ones
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
could
not
have
explained
the
extraordinary
craving
for
some
one
faithful
and
devoted
which
sometimes
unaccountably
came
upon
him
all
in
a
moment
it
was
almost
a
morbid
condition
corrupt
and
often
cruel
in
his
lust
like
some
noxious
insect
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
sometimes
in
moments
of
drunkenness
overcome
by
superstitious
terror
and
a
moral
convulsion
which
took
an
almost
physical
form
my
souls
simply
quaking
in
my
throat
at
those
times
he
used
to
say
at
such
moments
he
liked
to
feel
that
there
was
near
at
hand
in
the
lodge
if
not
in
the
room
a
strong
faithful
man
virtuous
and
unlike
himself
who
had
seen
all
his
debauchery
and
knew
all
his
secrets
but
was
ready
in
his
devotion
to
overlook
all
that
not
to
oppose
him
above
all
not
to
reproach
him
or
threaten
him
with
anything
either
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
and
in
case
of
need
to
defend
himfrom
whom
from
somebody
unknown
but
terrible
and
dangerous
what
he
needed
was
to
feel
that
there
was
another
man
an
old
and
tried
friend
that
he
might
call
him
in
his
sick
moments
merely
to
look
at
his
face
or
perhaps
exchange
some
quite
irrelevant
words
with
him
and
if
the
old
servant
were
not
angry
he
felt
comforted
and
if
he
were
angry
he
was
more
dejected
it
happened
even
very
rarely
however
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
went
at
night
to
the
lodge
to
wake
grigory
and
fetch
him
for
a
moment
when
the
old
man
came
fyodor
pavlovitch
would
begin
talking
about
the
most
trivial
matters
and
would
soon
let
him
go
again
sometimes
even
with
a
jest
and
after
he
had
gone
fyodor
pavlovitch
would
get
into
bed
with
a
curse
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
just
something
of
the
same
sort
had
happened
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
on
alyoshas
arrival
alyosha
pierced
his
heart
by
living
with
him
seeing
everything
and
blaming
nothing
moreover
alyosha
brought
with
him
something
his
father
had
never
known
before
a
complete
absence
of
contempt
for
him
and
an
invariable
kindness
a
perfectly
natural
unaffected
devotion
to
the
old
man
who
deserved
it
so
little
all
this
was
a
complete
surprise
to
the
old
profligate
who
had
dropped
all
family
ties
it
was
a
new
and
surprising
experience
for
him
who
had
till
then
loved
nothing
but
evil
when
alyosha
had
left
him
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
had
learnt
something
he
had
not
till
then
been
willing
to
learn
i
have
mentioned
already
that
grigory
had
detested
adelada
ivanovna
the
first
wife
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
the
mother
of
dmitri
and
that
he
had
on
the
contrary
protected
sofya
ivanovna
the
poor
crazy
woman
against
his
master
and
any
one
who
chanced
to
speak
ill
or
lightly
of
her
his
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
wife
had
become
something
sacred
to
him
so
that
even
now
twenty
years
after
he
could
not
bear
a
slighting
allusion
to
her
from
any
one
and
would
at
once
check
the
offender
externally
grigory
was
cold
dignified
and
taciturn
and
spoke
weighing
his
words
without
frivolity
it
was
impossible
to
tell
at
first
sight
whether
he
loved
his
meek
obedient
wife
but
he
really
did
love
her
and
she
knew
it
marfa
ignatyevna
was
by
no
means
foolish
she
was
probably
indeed
cleverer
than
her
husband
or
at
least
more
prudent
than
he
in
worldly
affairs
and
yet
she
had
given
in
to
him
in
everything
without
question
or
complaint
ever
since
her
marriage
and
respected
him
for
his
spiritual
superiority
it
was
remarkable
how
little
they
spoke
to
one
another
in
the
course
of
their
lives
and
only
of
the
most
necessary
daily
affairs
the
grave
and
dignified
grigory
thought
over
all
his
cares
and
duties
alone
so
that
marfa
ignatyevna
had
long
grown
used
to
knowing
that
he
did
not
need
her
advice
she
felt
that
her
husband
respected
her
silence
and
took
it
as
a
sign
of
her
good
sense
he
had
never
beaten
her
but
once
and
then
only
slightly
once
during
the
year
after
fyodor
pavlovitchs
marriage
with
adelada
ivanovna
the
village
girls
and
womenat
that
time
serfswere
called
together
before
the
house
to
sing
and
dance
they
were
beginning
in
the
green
meadows
when
marfa
at
that
time
a
young
woman
skipped
forward
and
danced
the
russian
dance
not
in
the
village
fashion
but
as
she
had
danced
it
when
she
was
a
servant
in
the
service
of
the
rich
misov
family
in
their
private
theater
where
the
actors
were
taught
to
dance
by
a
dancing
master
from
moscow
grigory
saw
how
his
wife
danced
and
an
hour
later
at
home
in
their
cottage
he
gave
her
a
lesson
pulling
her
hair
a
little
but
there
it
ended
the
beating
was
never
repeated
and
marfa
ignatyevna
gave
up
dancing
god
had
not
blessed
them
with
children
one
child
was
born
but
it
died
grigory
was
fond
of
children
and
was
not
ashamed
of
showing
it
when
adelada
ivanovna
had
run
away
grigory
took
dmitri
then
a
child
of
three
years
old
combed
his
hair
and
washed
him
in
a
tub
with
his
own
hands
and
looked
after
him
for
almost
a
year
afterwards
he
had
looked
after
ivan
and
alyosha
for
which
the
generals
widow
had
rewarded
him
with
a
slap
in
the
face
but
i
have
already
related
all
that
the
only
happiness
his
own
child
had
brought
him
had
been
in
the
anticipation
of
its
birth
when
it
was
born
he
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
horror
the
baby
had
six
fingers
grigory
was
so
crushed
by
this
that
he
was
not
only
silent
till
the
day
of
the
christening
but
kept
away
in
the
garden
it
was
spring
and
he
spent
three
days
digging
the
kitchen
garden
the
third
day
was
fixed
for
christening
the
baby
meantime
grigory
had
reached
a
conclusion
going
into
the
cottage
where
the
clergy
were
assembled
and
the
visitors
had
arrived
including
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
was
to
stand
god
father
he
suddenly
announced
that
the
baby
ought
not
to
be
christened
at
all
he
announced
this
quietly
briefly
forcing
out
his
words
and
gazing
with
dull
intentness
at
the
priest
why
not
asked
the
priest
with
goodhumored
surprise
because
its
a
dragon
muttered
grigory
a
dragon
what
dragon
grigory
did
not
speak
for
some
time
its
a
confusion
of
nature
he
muttered
vaguely
but
firmly
and
obviously
unwilling
to
say
more
they
laughed
and
of
course
christened
the
poor
baby
grigory
prayed
earnestly
at
the
font
but
his
opinion
of
the
newborn
child
remained
unchanged
yet
he
did
not
interfere
in
any
way
as
long
as
the
sickly
infant
lived
he
scarcely
looked
at
it
tried
indeed
not
to
notice
it
and
for
the
most
part
kept
out
of
the
cottage
but
when
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
baby
died
of
thrush
he
himself
laid
the
child
in
its
little
coffin
looked
at
it
in
profound
grief
and
when
they
were
filling
up
the
shallow
little
grave
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
bowed
down
to
the
earth
he
did
not
for
years
afterwards
mention
his
child
nor
did
marfa
speak
of
the
baby
before
him
and
even
if
grigory
were
not
present
she
never
spoke
of
it
above
a
whisper
marfa
observed
that
from
the
day
of
the
burial
he
devoted
himself
to
religion
and
took
to
reading
the
lives
of
the
saints
for
the
most
part
sitting
alone
and
in
silence
and
always
putting
on
his
big
round
silverrimmed
spectacles
he
rarely
read
aloud
only
perhaps
in
lent
he
was
fond
of
the
book
of
job
and
had
somehow
got
hold
of
a
copy
of
the
sayings
and
sermons
of
the
godfearing
father
isaac
the
syrian
which
he
read
persistently
for
years
together
understanding
very
little
of
it
but
perhaps
prizing
and
loving
it
the
more
for
that
of
late
he
had
begun
to
listen
to
the
doctrines
of
the
sect
of
flagellants
settled
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
evidently
shaken
by
them
but
judged
it
unfitting
to
go
over
to
the
new
faith
his
habit
of
theological
reading
gave
him
an
expression
of
still
greater
gravity
he
was
perhaps
predisposed
to
mysticism
and
the
birth
of
his
deformed
child
and
its
death
had
as
though
by
special
design
been
accompanied
by
another
strange
and
marvelous
event
which
as
he
said
later
had
left
a
stamp
upon
his
soul
it
happened
that
on
the
very
night
after
the
burial
of
his
child
marfa
was
awakened
by
the
wail
of
a
newborn
baby
she
was
frightened
and
waked
her
husband
he
listened
and
said
he
thought
it
was
more
like
some
one
groaning
it
might
be
a
woman
he
got
up
and
dressed
it
was
a
rather
warm
night
in
may
as
he
went
down
the
steps
he
distinctly
heard
groans
coming
from
the
garden
but
the
gate
from
the
yard
into
the
garden
was
locked
at
night
and
there
was
no
other
way
of
entering
it
for
it
was
enclosed
all
round
by
a
strong
high
fence
going
back
into
the
house
grigory
lighted
a
lantern
took
the
garden
key
and
taking
no
notice
of
the
hysterical
fears
of
his
wife
who
was
still
persuaded
that
she
heard
a
child
crying
and
that
it
was
her
own
baby
crying
and
calling
for
her
went
into
the
garden
in
silence
there
he
heard
at
once
that
the
groans
came
from
the
bathhouse
that
stood
near
the
garden
gate
and
that
they
were
the
groans
of
a
woman
opening
the
door
of
the
bathhouse
he
saw
a
sight
which
petrified
him
an
idiot
girl
who
wandered
about
the
streets
and
was
known
to
the
whole
town
by
the
nickname
of
lizaveta
smerdyastchaya
stinking
lizaveta
had
got
into
the
bath
house
and
had
just
given
birth
to
a
child
she
lay
dying
with
the
baby
beside
her
she
said
nothing
for
she
had
never
been
able
to
speak
but
her
story
needs
a
chapter
to
itself
chapter
ii
lizaveta
there
was
one
circumstance
which
struck
grigory
particularly
and
confirmed
a
very
unpleasant
and
revolting
suspicion
this
lizaveta
was
a
dwarfish
creature
not
five
foot
within
a
wee
bit
as
many
of
the
pious
old
women
said
pathetically
about
her
after
her
death
her
broad
healthy
red
face
had
a
look
of
blank
idiocy
and
the
fixed
stare
in
her
eyes
was
unpleasant
in
spite
of
their
meek
expression
she
wandered
about
summer
and
winter
alike
barefooted
wearing
nothing
but
a
hempen
smock
her
coarse
almost
black
hair
curled
like
lambs
wool
and
formed
a
sort
of
huge
cap
on
her
head
it
was
always
crusted
with
mud
and
had
leaves
bits
of
stick
and
shavings
clinging
to
it
as
she
always
slept
on
the
ground
and
in
the
dirt
her
father
a
homeless
sickly
drunkard
called
ilya
had
lost
everything
and
lived
many
years
as
a
workman
with
some
welltodo
tradespeople
her
mother
had
long
been
dead
spiteful
and
diseased
ilya
used
to
beat
lizaveta
inhumanly
whenever
she
returned
to
him
but
she
rarely
did
so
for
every
one
in
the
town
was
ready
to
look
after
her
as
being
an
idiot
and
so
specially
dear
to
god
ilyas
employers
and
many
others
in
the
town
especially
of
the
tradespeople
tried
to
clothe
her
better
and
always
rigged
her
out
with
high
boots
and
sheepskin
coat
for
the
winter
but
although
she
allowed
them
to
dress
her
up
without
resisting
she
usually
went
away
preferably
to
the
cathedral
porch
and
taking
off
all
that
had
been
given
herkerchief
sheepskin
skirt
or
bootsshe
left
them
there
and
walked
away
barefoot
in
her
smock
as
before
it
happened
on
one
occasion
that
a
new
governor
of
the
province
making
a
tour
of
inspection
in
our
town
saw
lizaveta
and
was
wounded
in
his
tenderest
susceptibilities
and
though
he
was
told
she
was
an
idiot
he
pronounced
that
for
a
young
woman
of
twenty
to
wander
about
in
nothing
but
a
smock
was
a
breach
of
the
proprieties
and
must
not
occur
again
but
the
governor
went
his
way
and
lizaveta
was
left
as
she
was
at
last
her
father
died
which
made
her
even
more
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
the
religious
persons
of
the
town
as
an
orphan
in
fact
every
one
seemed
to
like
her
even
the
boys
did
not
tease
her
and
the
boys
of
our
town
especially
the
schoolboys
are
a
mischievous
set
she
would
walk
into
strange
houses
and
no
one
drove
her
away
every
one
was
kind
to
her
and
gave
her
something
if
she
were
given
a
copper
she
would
take
it
and
at
once
drop
it
in
the
almsjug
of
the
church
or
prison
if
she
were
given
a
roll
or
bun
in
the
market
she
would
hand
it
to
the
first
child
she
met
sometimes
she
would
stop
one
of
the
richest
ladies
in
the
town
and
give
it
to
her
and
the
lady
would
be
pleased
to
take
it
she
herself
never
tasted
anything
but
black
bread
and
water
if
she
went
into
an
expensive
shop
where
there
were
costly
goods
or
money
lying
about
no
one
kept
watch
on
her
for
they
knew
that
if
she
saw
thousands
of
roubles
overlooked
by
them
she
would
not
have
touched
a
farthing
she
scarcely
ever
went
to
church
she
slept
either
in
the
church
porch
or
climbed
over
a
hurdle
there
are
many
hurdles
instead
of
fences
to
this
day
in
our
town
into
a
kitchen
garden
she
used
at
least
once
a
week
to
turn
up
at
home
that
is
at
the
house
of
her
fathers
former
employers
and
in
the
winter
went
there
every
night
and
slept
either
in
the
passage
or
the
cowhouse
people
were
amazed
that
she
could
stand
such
a
life
but
she
was
accustomed
to
it
and
although
she
was
so
tiny
she
was
of
a
robust
constitution
some
of
the
townspeople
declared
that
she
did
all
this
only
from
pride
but
that
is
hardly
credible
she
could
hardly
speak
and
only
from
time
to
time
uttered
an
inarticulate
grunt
how
could
she
have
been
proud
it
happened
one
clear
warm
moonlight
night
in
september
many
years
ago
five
or
six
drunken
revelers
were
returning
from
the
club
at
a
very
late
hour
according
to
our
provincial
notions
they
passed
through
the
back
way
which
led
between
the
back
gardens
of
the
houses
with
hurdles
on
either
side
this
way
leads
out
on
to
the
bridge
over
the
long
stinking
pool
which
we
were
accustomed
to
call
a
river
among
the
nettles
and
burdocks
under
the
hurdle
our
revelers
saw
lizaveta
asleep
they
stopped
to
look
at
her
laughing
and
began
jesting
with
unbridled
licentiousness
it
occurred
to
one
young
gentleman
to
make
the
whimsical
inquiry
whether
any
one
could
possibly
look
upon
such
an
animal
as
a
woman
and
so
forth
they
all
pronounced
with
lofty
repugnance
that
it
was
impossible
but
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
was
among
them
sprang
forward
and
declared
that
it
was
by
no
means
impossible
and
that
indeed
there
was
a
certain
piquancy
about
it
and
so
on
it
is
true
that
at
that
time
he
was
overdoing
his
part
as
a
buffoon
he
liked
to
put
himself
forward
and
entertain
the
company
ostensibly
on
equal
terms
of
course
though
in
reality
he
was
on
a
servile
footing
with
them
it
was
just
at
the
time
when
he
had
received
the
news
of
his
first
wifes
death
in
petersburg
and
with
crape
upon
his
hat
was
drinking
and
behaving
so
shamelessly
that
even
the
most
reckless
among
us
were
shocked
at
the
sight
of
him
the
revelers
of
course
laughed
at
this
unexpected
opinion
and
one
of
them
even
began
challenging
him
to
act
upon
it
the
others
repelled
the
idea
even
more
emphatically
although
still
with
the
utmost
hilarity
and
at
last
they
went
on
their
way
later
on
fyodor
pavlovitch
swore
that
he
had
gone
with
them
and
perhaps
it
was
so
no
one
knows
for
certain
and
no
one
ever
knew
but
five
or
six
months
later
all
the
town
was
talking
with
intense
and
sincere
indignation
of
lizavetas
condition
and
trying
to
find
out
who
was
the
miscreant
who
had
wronged
her
then
suddenly
a
terrible
rumor
was
all
over
the
town
that
this
miscreant
was
no
other
than
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
set
the
rumor
going
of
that
drunken
band
five
had
left
the
town
and
the
only
one
still
among
us
was
an
elderly
and
much
respected
civil
councilor
the
father
of
grownup
daughters
who
could
hardly
have
spread
the
tale
even
if
there
had
been
any
foundation
for
it
but
rumor
pointed
straight
at
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
persisted
in
pointing
at
him
of
course
this
was
no
great
grievance
to
him
he
would
not
have
troubled
to
contradict
a
set
of
tradespeople
in
those
days
he
was
proud
and
did
not
condescend
to
talk
except
in
his
own
circle
of
the
officials
and
nobles
whom
he
entertained
so
well
at
the
time
grigory
stood
up
for
his
master
vigorously
he
provoked
quarrels
and
altercations
in
defense
of
him
and
succeeded
in
bringing
some
people
round
to
his
side
its
the
wenchs
own
fault
he
asserted
and
the
culprit
was
karp
a
dangerous
convict
who
had
escaped
from
prison
and
whose
name
was
well
known
to
us
as
he
had
hidden
in
our
town
this
conjecture
sounded
plausible
for
it
was
remembered
that
karp
had
been
in
the
neighborhood
just
at
that
time
in
the
autumn
and
had
robbed
three
people
but
this
affair
and
all
the
talk
about
it
did
not
estrange
popular
sympathy
from
the
poor
idiot
she
was
better
looked
after
than
ever
a
welltodo
merchants
widow
named
kondratyev
arranged
to
take
her
into
her
house
at
the
end
of
april
meaning
not
to
let
her
go
out
until
after
the
confinement
they
kept
a
constant
watch
over
her
but
in
spite
of
their
vigilance
she
escaped
on
the
very
last
day
and
made
her
way
into
fyodor
pavlovitchs
garden
how
in
her
condition
she
managed
to
climb
over
the
high
strong
fence
remained
a
mystery
some
maintained
that
she
must
have
been
lifted
over
by
somebody
others
hinted
at
something
more
uncanny
the
most
likely
explanation
is
that
it
happened
naturallythat
lizaveta
accustomed
to
clambering
over
hurdles
to
sleep
in
gardens
had
somehow
managed
to
climb
this
fence
in
spite
of
her
condition
and
had
leapt
down
injuring
herself
grigory
rushed
to
marfa
and
sent
her
to
lizaveta
while
he
ran
to
fetch
an
old
midwife
who
lived
close
by
they
saved
the
baby
but
lizaveta
died
at
dawn
grigory
took
the
baby
brought
it
home
and
making
his
wife
sit
down
put
it
on
her
lap
a
child
of
godan
orphan
is
akin
to
all
he
said
and
to
us
above
others
our
little
lost
one
has
sent
us
this
who
has
come
from
the
devils
son
and
a
holy
innocent
nurse
him
and
weep
no
more
so
marfa
brought
up
the
child
he
was
christened
pavel
to
which
people
were
not
slow
in
adding
fyodorovitch
son
of
fyodor
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
object
to
any
of
this
and
thought
it
amusing
though
he
persisted
vigorously
in
denying
his
responsibility
the
townspeople
were
pleased
at
his
adopting
the
foundling
later
on
fyodor
pavlovitch
invented
a
surname
for
the
child
calling
him
smerdyakov
after
his
mothers
nickname
so
this
smerdyakov
became
fyodor
pavlovitchs
second
servant
and
was
living
in
the
lodge
with
grigory
and
marfa
at
the
time
our
story
begins
he
was
employed
as
cook
i
ought
to
say
something
of
this
smerdyakov
but
i
am
ashamed
of
keeping
my
readers
attention
so
long
occupied
with
these
common
menials
and
i
will
go
back
to
my
story
hoping
to
say
more
of
smerdyakov
in
the
course
of
it
chapter
iii
the
confession
of
a
passionate
heartin
verse
alyosha
remained
for
some
time
irresolute
after
hearing
the
command
his
father
shouted
to
him
from
the
carriage
but
in
spite
of
his
uneasiness
he
did
not
stand
still
that
was
not
his
way
he
went
at
once
to
the
kitchen
to
find
out
what
his
father
had
been
doing
above
then
he
set
off
trusting
that
on
the
way
he
would
find
some
answer
to
the
doubt
tormenting
him
i
hasten
to
add
that
his
fathers
shouts
commanding
him
to
return
home
with
his
mattress
and
pillow
did
not
frighten
him
in
the
least
he
understood
perfectly
that
those
peremptory
shouts
were
merely
a
flourish
to
produce
an
effect
in
the
same
way
a
tradesman
in
our
town
who
was
celebrating
his
nameday
with
a
party
of
friends
getting
angry
at
being
refused
more
vodka
smashed
up
his
own
crockery
and
furniture
and
tore
his
own
and
his
wifes
clothes
and
finally
broke
his
windows
all
for
the
sake
of
effect
next
day
of
course
when
he
was
sober
he
regretted
the
broken
cups
and
saucers
alyosha
knew
that
his
father
would
let
him
go
back
to
the
monastery
next
day
possibly
even
that
evening
moreover
he
was
fully
persuaded
that
his
father
might
hurt
any
one
else
but
would
not
hurt
him
alyosha
was
certain
that
no
one
in
the
whole
world
ever
would
want
to
hurt
him
and
what
is
more
he
knew
that
no
one
could
hurt
him
this
was
for
him
an
axiom
assumed
once
for
all
without
question
and
he
went
his
way
without
hesitation
relying
on
it
but
at
that
moment
an
anxiety
of
a
different
sort
disturbed
him
and
worried
him
the
more
because
he
could
not
formulate
it
it
was
the
fear
of
a
woman
of
katerina
ivanovna
who
had
so
urgently
entreated
him
in
the
note
handed
to
him
by
madame
hohlakov
to
come
and
see
her
about
something
this
request
and
the
necessity
of
going
had
at
once
aroused
an
uneasy
feeling
in
his
heart
and
this
feeling
had
grown
more
and
more
painful
all
the
morning
in
spite
of
the
scenes
at
the
hermitage
and
at
the
father
superiors
he
was
not
uneasy
because
he
did
not
know
what
she
would
speak
of
and
what
he
must
answer
and
he
was
not
afraid
of
her
simply
as
a
woman
though
he
knew
little
of
women
he
had
spent
his
life
from
early
childhood
till
he
entered
the
monastery
entirely
with
women
he
was
afraid
of
that
woman
katerina
ivanovna
he
had
been
afraid
of
her
from
the
first
time
he
saw
her
he
had
only
seen
her
two
or
three
times
and
had
only
chanced
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
he
thought
of
her
as
a
beautiful
proud
imperious
girl
it
was
not
her
beauty
which
troubled
him
but
something
else
and
the
vagueness
of
his
apprehension
increased
the
apprehension
itself
the
girls
aims
were
of
the
noblest
he
knew
that
she
was
trying
to
save
his
brother
dmitri
simply
through
generosity
though
he
had
already
behaved
badly
to
her
yet
although
alyosha
recognized
and
did
justice
to
all
these
fine
and
generous
sentiments
a
shiver
began
to
run
down
his
back
as
soon
as
he
drew
near
her
house
he
reflected
that
he
would
not
find
ivan
who
was
so
intimate
a
friend
with
her
for
ivan
was
certainly
now
with
his
father
dmitri
he
was
even
more
certain
not
to
find
there
and
he
had
a
foreboding
of
the
reason
and
so
his
conversation
would
be
with
her
alone
he
had
a
great
longing
to
run
and
see
his
brother
dmitri
before
that
fateful
interview
without
showing
him
the
letter
he
could
talk
to
him
about
it
but
dmitri
lived
a
long
way
off
and
he
was
sure
to
be
away
from
home
too
standing
still
for
a
minute
he
reached
a
final
decision
crossing
himself
with
a
rapid
and
accustomed
gesture
and
at
once
smiling
he
turned
resolutely
in
the
direction
of
his
terrible
lady
he
knew
her
house
if
he
went
by
the
high
street
and
then
across
the
marketplace
it
was
a
long
way
round
though
our
town
is
small
it
is
scattered
and
the
houses
are
far
apart
and
meanwhile
his
father
was
expecting
him
and
perhaps
had
not
yet
forgotten
his
command
he
might
be
unreasonable
and
so
he
had
to
make
haste
to
get
there
and
back
so
he
decided
to
take
a
short
cut
by
the
backway
for
he
knew
every
inch
of
the
ground
this
meant
skirting
fences
climbing
over
hurdles
and
crossing
other
peoples
backyards
where
every
one
he
met
knew
him
and
greeted
him
in
this
way
he
could
reach
the
high
street
in
half
the
time
he
had
to
pass
the
garden
adjoining
his
fathers
and
belonging
to
a
little
tumbledown
house
with
four
windows
the
owner
of
this
house
as
alyosha
knew
was
a
bedridden
old
woman
living
with
her
daughter
who
had
been
a
genteel
maidservant
in
generals
families
in
petersburg
now
she
had
been
at
home
a
year
looking
after
her
sick
mother
she
always
dressed
up
in
fine
clothes
though
her
old
mother
and
she
had
sunk
into
such
poverty
that
they
went
every
day
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
kitchen
for
soup
and
bread
which
marfa
gave
readily
yet
though
the
young
woman
came
up
for
soup
she
had
never
sold
any
of
her
dresses
and
one
of
these
even
had
a
long
traina
fact
which
alyosha
had
learned
from
rakitin
who
always
knew
everything
that
was
going
on
in
the
town
he
had
forgotten
it
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
but
now
on
reaching
the
garden
he
remembered
the
dress
with
the
train
raised
his
head
which
had
been
bowed
in
thought
and
came
upon
something
quite
unexpected
over
the
hurdle
in
the
garden
dmitri
mounted
on
something
was
leaning
forward
gesticulating
violently
beckoning
to
him
obviously
afraid
to
utter
a
word
for
fear
of
being
overheard
alyosha
ran
up
to
the
hurdle
its
a
good
thing
you
looked
up
i
was
nearly
shouting
to
you
mitya
said
in
a
joyful
hurried
whisper

in
here
quickly
how
splendid
that
youve
come
i
was
just
thinking
of
you
alyosha
was
delighted
too
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
over
the
hurdle
mitya
put
his
powerful
hand
under
his
elbow
to
help
him
jump
tucking
up
his
cassock
alyosha
leapt
over
the
hurdle
with
the
agility
of
a
bare
legged
street
urchin
well
done
now
come
along
said
mitya
in
an
enthusiastic
whisper
where
whispered
alyosha
looking
about
him
and
finding
himself
in
a
deserted
garden
with
no
one
near
but
themselves
the
garden
was
small
but
the
house
was
at
least
fifty
paces
away
theres
no
one
here
why
do
you
whisper
asked
alyosha
why
do
i
whisper
deuce
take
it
cried
dmitri
at
the
top
of
his
voice
you
see
what
silly
tricks
nature
plays
one
i
am
here
in
secret
and
on
the
watch
ill
explain
later
on
but
knowing
its
a
secret
i
began
whispering
like
a
fool
when
theres
no
need
let
us
go
over
there
till
then
be
quiet
i
want
to
kiss
you
glory
to
god
in
the
world
glory
to
god
in
me

i
was
just
repeating
that
sitting
here
before
you
came
the
garden
was
about
three
acres
in
extent
and
planted
with
trees
only
along
the
fence
at
the
four
sides
there
were
appletrees
maples
limes
and
birchtrees
the
middle
of
the
garden
was
an
empty
grass
space
from
which
several
hundredweight
of
hay
was
carried
in
the
summer
the
garden
was
let
out
for
a
few
roubles
for
the
summer
there
were
also
plantations
of
raspberries
and
currants
and
gooseberries
laid
out
along
the
sides
a
kitchen
garden
had
been
planted
lately
near
the
house
dmitri
led
his
brother
to
the
most
secluded
corner
of
the
garden
there
in
a
thicket
of
limetrees
and
old
bushes
of
black
currant
elder
snowballtree
and
lilac
there
stood
a
tumbledown
green
summerhouse
blackened
with
age
its
walls
were
of
latticework
but
there
was
still
a
roof
which
could
give
shelter
god
knows
when
this
summerhouse
was
built
there
was
a
tradition
that
it
had
been
put
up
some
fifty
years
before
by
a
retired
colonel
called
von
schmidt
who
owned
the
house
at
that
time
it
was
all
in
decay
the
floor
was
rotting
the
planks
were
loose
the
woodwork
smelled
musty
in
the
summerhouse
there
was
a
green
wooden
table
fixed
in
the
ground
and
round
it
were
some
green
benches
upon
which
it
was
still
possible
to
sit
alyosha
had
at
once
observed
his
brothers
exhilarated
condition
and
on
entering
the
arbor
he
saw
half
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
a
wineglass
on
the
table
thats
brandy
mitya
laughed
i
see
your
look
hes
drinking
again
distrust
the
apparition
distrust
the
worthless
lying
crowd
and
lay
aside
thy
doubts
im
not
drinking
im
only
indulging
as
that
pig
your
rakitin
says
hell
be
a
civil
councilor
one
day
but
hell
always
talk
about
indulging
sit
down
i
could
take
you
in
my
arms
alyosha
and
press
you
to
my
bosom
till
i
crush
you
for
in
the
whole
worldin
realityin

one
but
you
he
uttered
the
last
words
in
a
sort
of
exaltation
no
one
but
you
and
one
jade
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
to
my
ruin
but
being
in
love
doesnt
mean
loving
you
may
be
in
love
with
a
woman
and
yet
hate
her
remember
that
i
can
talk
about

here
by
the
table

a
moment
and
put
his
finger
to
his
forehead
shes
asked

her
note
alyosha
took
it
out
of
his
pocket

through
it
quickly
and
you
were
going
the
backway
oh
gods
i
thank
you
for
sending
him
by
the
backway
and
he
came
to
me

golden
fish
to
the
silly
old
fishermen
in
the
fable

on
earth
and

off
into
the
unknown
or
at

of
them
and
before

felt
that
perhaps
indeed
his
work
lay
here
mitya
sank
into
thought
for
a
moment
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hand
both
were
silent
alyosha

how
does

go
he
raised
his
head
thought
a
minute
and
began
with
enthusiasm
wild
and
fearful
in
his
cavern
hid
the
naked
troglodyte
and
the
homeless
nomad
wandered
laying
waste
the
fertile
plain
menacing
with
spear
and
arrow
in
the
woods
the
hunter
strayed
woe
to
all
poor
wretches
stranded
on
those
cruel
and
hostile
shores
from
the
peak
of
high
olympus
came
the
mother
ceres
down
seeking
in
those
savage
regions
her
lost
daughter
proserpine
but
the
goddess
found
no
refuge
found
no
kindly
welcome
there
and
no
temple
bearing
witness
to
the
worship
of
the
gods
from
the
fields
and
from
the
vineyards
came
no
fruits
to
deck
the
feasts
only
flesh
of
bloodstained
victims
smoldered
on
the
altarfires
and
whereer
the
grieving
goddess
turns
her
melancholy
gaze
sunk
in
vilest
degradation
man
his
loathsomeness
displays
mitya
broke
into
sobs
and
seized
alyoshas
hand
my
dear
my
dear
in
degradation
in
degradation
now
too
theres
a
terrible
amount
of
suffering
for
man
on
earth
a
terrible
lot
of
trouble
dont
think
im
only
a
brute
in
an
officers
uniform
wallowing
in
dirt
and
drink
i
hardly
think
of
anything
but
of
that
degraded
manif
only
im
not
lying
i
pray
god
im
not
lying
and
showing
off
i
think
about
that
man
because
i
am
that
man
myself
would
he
purge
his
soul
from
vileness
and
attain
to
light
and
worth
he
must
turn
and
cling
for
ever
to
his
ancient
mother
earth
but
the
difficulty
is
how
am
i
to
cling
for
ever
to
mother
earth
i
dont
kiss
her
i
dont
cleave
to
her
bosom
am
i
to
become
a
peasant
or
a
shepherd
i
go
on
and
i
dont
know
whether
im
going
to
shame
or
to
light
and
joy
thats
the
trouble
for
everything
in
the
world
is
a
riddle
and
whenever
ive
happened
to
sink
into
the
vilest
degradation
and
its
always
been
happening
i
always
read
that
poem
about
ceres
and
man
has
it
reformed
me
never
for
im
a
karamazov
for
when
i
do
leap
into
the
pit
i
go
headlong
with
my
heels
up
and
am
pleased
to
be
falling
in
that
degrading
attitude
and
pride
myself
upon
it
and
in
the
very
depths
of
that
degradation
i
begin
a
hymn
of
praise
let
me
be
accursed
let
me
be
vile
and
base
only
let
me
kiss
the
hem
of
the
veil
in
which
my
god
is
shrouded
though
i
may
be
following
the
devil
i
am
thy
son
o
lord
and
i
love
thee
and
i
feel
the
joy
without
which
the
world
cannot
stand
joy
everlasting
fostereth
the
soul

at

you
now
about
the
insects
to
whom
god
gave
sensual
lust
to
insectssensual
lust
i
am
that
insect
brother
and
it
is
said
of
me
specially
all
we
karamazovs
are
such
insects
and
angel
as
you
are
that
insect
lives
in
you
too
and
will
stir
up
a
tempest
in
your
blood
tempests
because
sensual
lust
is
a
tempestworse
than
a
tempest
beauty
is
a
terrible
and
awful
thing
it
is
terrible
because
it
has
not
been
fathomed
and
never
can
be
fathomed
for
god
sets
us
nothing
but
riddles
here
the
boundaries
meet
and
all
contradictions
exist
side
by
side
i
am
not
a
cultivated
man
brother
but
ive
thought
a
lot
about
this
its
terrible
what
mysteries
there
are
too
many
riddles
weigh
men
down
on
earth
we
must
solve
them
as
we
can
and
try
to
keep
a
dry
skin
in
the
water
beauty
i
cant
endure
the
thought
that
a
man
of
lofty
mind
and
heart
begins
with
the
ideal
of
the
madonna
and
ends
with
the
ideal
of
sodom
whats
still
more
awful
is
that
a
man
with
the
ideal
of
sodom
in
his
soul
does
not
renounce
the
ideal
of
the
madonna
and
his
heart
may
be
on
fire
with
that
ideal
genuinely
on
fire
just
as
in
his
days
of
youth
and
innocence
yes
man
is
broad
too
broad
indeed
id
have
him
narrower
the
devil
only
knows
what
to
make
of
it
what
to
the
mind
is
shameful
is
beauty
and
nothing
else
to
the
heart
is
there
beauty
in
sodom
believe
me
that
for
the
immense
mass
of
mankind
beauty
is
found
in
sodom
did
you
know
that
secret
the
awful
thing
is
that
beauty
is
mysterious
as
well
as
terrible
god
and
the
devil
are
fighting
there
and
the
battlefield
is
the
heart
of
man
but
a
man
always
talks
of
his
own
ache
listen
now
to
come
to
facts
chapter
iv
the
confession
of
a
passionate
heartin
anecdote
i
was
leading
a
wild
life
then
father
said
just
now
that
i
spent
several
thousand
roubles
in
seducing
young
girls
thats
a
swinish
invention
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
and
if
there
was
i
didnt
need
money
simply
for
that
with
me
money
is
an
accessory
the
overflow
of
my
heart
the
framework
today
she
would
be
my
lady
tomorrow
a
wench
out
of
the
streets
in
her
place
i
entertained
them
both
i
threw
away
money
by
the
handful
on
music
rioting
and
gypsies
sometimes
i
gave
it
to
the
ladies
too
for
theyll
take
it
greedily
that
must
be
admitted
and
be
pleased
and
thankful
for
it
ladies
used
to
be
fond
of
me
not
all
of
them
but
it
happened
it
happened
but
i
always
liked
sidepaths
little
dark
backalleys
behind
the
main
roadthere
one
finds
adventures
and
surprises
and
precious
metal
in
the
dirt
i
am
speaking
figuratively
brother
in
the
town
i
was
in
there
were
no
such
backalleys
in
the
literal
sense
but
morally
there
were
if
you
were
like
me
youd
know
what
that
means
i
loved
vice
i
loved
the
ignominy
of
vice
i
loved
cruelty

i
not
a

i
not
a
noxious
insect
in
fact
a
karamazov
once
we
went
a
whole
lot
of
us
for
a
picnic
in
seven
sledges
it
was
dark
it
was
winter
and
i
began
squeezing
a
girls
hand
and
forced
her
to
kiss
me
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
official
a
sweet
gentle
submissive
creature
she
allowed
me
she
allowed
me
much
in
the
dark
she
thought
poor
thing
that
i
should
come
next
day
to
make
her
an
offer
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
good
match
too
but
i
didnt
say
a
word
to
her
for
five
months
i
used
to
see
her
in
a
corner
at
dances
we
were
always
having
dances
her
eyes
watching
me
i
saw
how
they
glowed
with
firea
fire
of
gentle
indignation
this
game
only
tickled
that
insect
lust
i
cherished
in
my
soul
five
months
later
she
married
an
official
and
left
the
town
still
angry
and
still
perhaps
in
love
with
me
now
they
live
happily
observe
that
i
told
no
one
i
didnt
boast
of
it
though
im
full
of
low
desires
and
love
whats
low
im
not
dishonorable
youre
blushing
your
eyes
flashed
enough
of
this
filth
with
you
and
all
this
was
nothing
muchwayside
blossoms

la
paul
de
kockthough
the
cruel
insect
had
already
grown
strong
in
my
soul
ive
a
perfect
album
of
reminiscences
brother
god
bless
them
the
darlings
i
tried
to
break
it
off
without
quarreling
and
i
never
gave
them
away
i
never
bragged
of
one
of
them
but
thats
enough
you
cant
suppose
i
brought
you
here
simply
to
talk
of
such
nonsense
no
im
going
to
tell
you
something
more
curious
and
dont
be
surprised
that
im
glad
to
tell
you
instead
of
being
ashamed
you
say
that
because
i
blushed
alyosha
said
suddenly
i
wasnt
blushing
at
what
you
were
saying
or
at
what
youve
done
i
blushed
because
i
am
the
same
as
you
are
you
come
thats
going
a
little
too
far
no
its
not
too
far
said
alyosha
warmly
obviously
the
idea
was
not
a
new
one
the
ladders
the
same
im
at
the
bottom
step
and
youre
above
somewhere
about
the
thirteenth
thats
how
i
see
it
but
its
all
the
same
absolutely
the
same
in
kind
any
one
on
the
bottom
step
is
bound
to
go
up
to
the
top
one
then
one
ought
not
to
step
on
at
all
any
one
who
can
help
it
had
better
not
but
can
you
i
think
not
hush
alyosha
hush
darling
i
could
kiss
your
hand
you
touch
me
so
that
rogue
grushenka
has
an
eye
for
men
she
told
me
once
that
shed
devour
you
one
day
there
there
i
wont
from
this
field
of
corruption
fouled
by
flies
lets
pass
to
my
tragedy
also
befouled
by
flies
that
is
by
every
sort
of
vileness
although
the
old
man
told
lies
about
my
seducing
innocence
there
really
was
something
of
the
sort
in
my
tragedy
though
it
was
only
once
and
then
it
did
not
come
off
the
old
man
who
has
reproached
me
with
what
never
happened
does
not
even
know
of
this
fact
i
never
told
any
one
about
it
youre
the
first
except
ivan
of
courseivan
knows
everything
he
knew
about
it
long
before
you
but
ivans
a
tomb
ivans
a
tomb
yes
alyosha
listened
with
great
attention
i
was
lieutenant
in
a
line
regiment
but
still
i
was
under
supervision
like
a
kind
of
convict
yet
i
was
awfully
well
received
in
the
little
town
i
spent
money
right
and
left
i
was
thought
to
be
rich
i
thought
so
myself
but
i
must
have
pleased
them
in
other
ways
as
well
although
they
shook
their
heads
over
me
they
liked
me
my
colonel
who
was
an
old
man
took
a
sudden
dislike
to
me
he
was
always
down
upon
me
but
i
had
powerful
friends
and
moreover
all
the
town
was
on
my
side
so
he
couldnt
do
me
much
harm
i
was
in
fault
myself
for
refusing
to
treat
him
with
proper
respect
i
was
proud
this
obstinate
old
fellow
who
was
really
a
very
good
sort
kindhearted
and
hospitable
had
had
two
wives
both
dead
his
first
wife
who
was
of
a
humble
family
left
a
daughter
as
unpretentious
as
herself
she
was
a
young
woman
of
four
and
twenty
when
i
was
there
and
was
living
with
her
father
and
an
aunt
her
mothers
sister
the
aunt
was
simple
and
illiterate
the
niece
was
simple
but
lively
i
like
to
say
nice
things
about
people
i
never
knew
a
woman
of
more
charming
character
than
agafyafancy
her
name
was
agafya
ivanovna
and
she
wasnt
badlooking
either
in
the
russian
style
tall
stout
with
a
full
figure
and
beautiful
eyes
though
a
rather
coarse
face
she
had
not
married
although
she
had
had
two
suitors
she
refused
them
but
was
as
cheerful
as
ever
i
was
intimate
with
her
not
in
that
way
it
was
pure
friendship
i
have
often
been
friendly
with
women
quite
innocently
i
used
to
talk
to
her
with
shocking
frankness
and
she
only
laughed
many
women
like
such
freedom
and
she
was
a
girl
too
which
made
it
very
amusing
another
thing
one
could
never
think
of
her
as
a
young
lady
she
and
her
aunt
lived
in
her
fathers
house
with
a
sort
of
voluntary
humility
not
putting
themselves
on
an
equality
with
other
people
she
was
a
general
favorite
and
of
use
to
every
one
for
she
was
a
clever
dressmaker
she
had
a
talent
for
it
she
gave
her
services
freely
without
asking
for
payment
but
if
any
one
offered
her
payment
she
didnt
refuse
the
colonel
of
course
was
a
very
different
matter
he
was
one
of
the
chief
personages
in
the
district
he
kept
open
house
entertained
the
whole
town
gave
suppers
and
dances
at
the
time
i
arrived
and
joined
the
battalion
all
the
town
was
talking
of
the
expected
return
of
the
colonels
second
daughter
a
great
beauty
who
had
just
left
a
fashionable
school
in
the
capital
this
second
daughter
is
katerina
ivanovna
and
she
was
the
child
of
the
second
wife
who
belonged
to
a
distinguished
generals
family
although
as
i
learnt
on
good
authority
she
too
brought
the
colonel
no
money
she
had
connections
and
that
was
all
there
may
have
been
expectations
but
they
had
come
to
nothing
yet
when
the
young
lady
came
from
boardingschool
on
a
visit
the
whole
town
revived
our
most
distinguished
ladiestwo
excellencies
and
a
colonels
wifeand
all
the
rest
following
their
lead
at
once
took
her
up
and
gave
entertainments
in
her
honor
she
was
the
belle
of
the
balls
and
picnics
and
they
got
up
tableaux
vivants
in
aid
of
distressed
governesses
i
took
no
notice
i
went
on
as
wildly
as
before
and
one
of
my
exploits
at
the
time
set
all
the
town
talking
i
saw
her
eyes
taking
my
measure
one
evening
at
the
battery
commanders
but
i
didnt
go
up
to
her
as
though
i
disdained
her
acquaintance
i
did
go
up
and
speak
to
her
at
an
evening
party
not
long
after
she
scarcely
looked
at
me
and
compressed
her
lips
scornfully
wait
a
bit
ill
have
my
revenge
thought
i
i
behaved
like
an
awful
fool
on
many
occasions
at
that
time
and
i
was
conscious
of
it
myself
what
made
it
worse
was
that
i
felt
that
katenka
was
not
an
innocent
boardingschool
miss
but
a
person
of
character
proud
and
really
highprincipled
above
all
she
had
education
and
intellect
and
i
had
neither
you
think
i
meant
to
make
her
an
offer
no
i
simply
wanted
to
revenge
myself
because
i
was
such
a
hero
and
she
didnt
seem
to
feel
it
meanwhile
i
spent
my
time
in
drink
and
riot
till
the
lieutenantcolonel
put
me
under
arrest
for
three
days
just
at
that
time
father
sent
me
six
thousand
roubles
in
return
for
my
sending
him
a
deed
giving
up
all
claims
upon
himsettling
our
accounts
so
to
speak
and
saying
that
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
more
i
didnt
understand
a
word
of
it
at
the
time
until
i
came
here
alyosha
till
the
last
few
days
indeed
perhaps
even
now
i
havent
been
able
to
make
head
or
tail
of
my
money
affairs
with
father
but
never
mind
that
well
talk
of
it
later
just
as
i
received
the
money
i
got
a
letter
from
a
friend
telling
me
something
that
interested
me
immensely
the
authorities
i
learnt
were
dissatisfied
with
our
lieutenantcolonel
he
was
suspected
of
irregularities
in
fact
his
enemies
were
preparing
a
surprise
for
him
and
then
the
commander
of
the
division
arrived
and
kicked
up
the
devil
of
a
shindy
shortly
afterwards
he
was
ordered
to
retire
i
wont
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
he
had
enemies
certainly
suddenly
there
was
a
marked
coolness
in
the
town
towards
him
and
all
his
family
his
friends
all
turned
their
backs
on
him
then
i
took
my
first
step
i
met
agafya
ivanovna
with
whom
id
always
kept
up
a
friendship
and
said
do
you
know
theres
a
deficit
of
4500
roubles
of
government
money
in
your
fathers
accounts

what
do
you
mean
what
makes
you
say
so
the
general
was
here
not
long
ago
and
everything
was
all
right

then
it
was
but
now
it
isnt
she
was
terribly
scared

dont
frighten
me
she
said
who
told
you
so

dont
be
uneasy
i
said
i
wont
tell
any
one
you
know
im
as
silent
as
the
tomb
i
only
wanted
in
view
of
possibilities
to
add
that
when
they
demand
that
4500
roubles
from
your
father
and
he
cant
produce
it
hell
be
tried
and
made
to
serve
as
a
common
soldier
in
his
old
age
unless
you
like
to
send
me
your
young
lady
secretly
ive
just
had
money
paid
me
ill
give
her
four
thousand
if
you
like
and
keep
the
secret
religiously

ah
you
scoundrelthats
what
she
said
you
wicked
scoundrel
how
dare
you
she
went
away
furiously
indignant
while
i
shouted
after
her
once
more
that
the
secret
should
be
kept
sacred
those
two
simple
creatures
agafya
and
her
aunt
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
behaved
like
perfect
angels
all
through
this
business
they
genuinely
adored
their
katya
thought
her
far
above
them
and
waited
on
her
hand
and
foot
but
agafya
told
her
of
our
conversation
i
found
that
out
afterwards
she
didnt
keep
it
back
and
of
course
that
was
all
i
wanted
suddenly
the
new
major
arrived
to
take
command
of
the
battalion
the
old
lieutenantcolonel
was
taken
ill
at
once
couldnt
leave
his
room
for
two
days
and
didnt
hand
over
the
government
money
dr
kravchenko
declared
that
he
really
was
ill
but
i
knew
for
a
fact
and
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
for
the
last
four
years
the
money
had
never
been
in
his
hands
except
when
the
commander
made
his
visits
of
inspection
he
used
to
lend
it
to
a
trustworthy
person
a
merchant
of
our
town
called
trifonov
an
old
widower
with
a
big
beard
and
goldrimmed
spectacles
he
used
to
go
to
the
fair
do
a
profitable
business
with
the
money
and
return
the
whole
sum
to
the
colonel
bringing
with
it
a
present
from
the
fair
as
well
as
interest
on
the
loan
but
this
time
i
heard
all
about
it
quite
by
chance
from
trifonovs
son
and
heir
a
driveling
youth
and
one
of
the
most
vicious
in
the
worldthis
time
i
say
trifonov
brought
nothing
back
from
the
fair
the
lieutenantcolonel
flew
to
him
ive
never
received
any
money
from
you
and
couldnt
possibly
have
received
any
that
was
all
the
answer
he
got
so
now
our
lieutenantcolonel
is
confined
to
the
house
with
a
towel
round
his
head
while
theyre
all
three
busy
putting
ice
on
it
all
at
once
an
orderly
arrives
on
the
scene
with
the
book
and
the
order
to
hand
over
the
battalion
money
immediately
within
two
hours
he
signed
the
book
i
saw
the
signature
in
the
book
afterwards
stood
up
saying
he
would
put
on
his
uniform
ran
to
his
bedroom
loaded
his
doublebarreled
gun
with
a
service
bullet
took
the
boot
off
his
right
foot
fixed
the
gun
against
his
chest
and
began
feeling
for
the
trigger
with
his
foot
but
agafya
remembering
what
i
had
told
her
had
her
suspicions
she
stole
up
and
peeped
into
the
room
just
in
time
she
rushed
in
flung
herself
upon
him
from
behind
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
the
gun
went
off
hit
the
ceiling
but
hurt
no
one
the
others
ran
in
took
away
the
gun
and
held
him
by
the
arms
i
heard
all
about
this
afterwards
i
was
at
home
it
was
getting
dusk
and
i
was
just
preparing
to
go
out
i
had
dressed
brushed
my
hair
scented
my
handkerchief
and
taken
up
my
cap
when
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
facing
me
in
the
room
stood
katerina
ivanovna
its
strange
how
things
happen
sometimes
no
one
had
seen
her
in
the
street
so
that
no
one
knew
of
it
in
the
town
i
lodged
with
two
decrepit
old
ladies
who
looked
after
me
they
were
most
obliging
old
things
ready
to
do
anything
for
me
and
at
my
request
were
as
silent
afterwards
as
two
castiron
posts
of
course
i
grasped
the
position
at
once
she
walked
in
and
looked
straight
at
me
her
dark
eyes
determined
even
defiant
but
on
her
lips
and
round
her
mouth
i
saw
uncertainty

my
sister
told
me
she
began
that
you
would
give
me
4500
roubles
if
i
came
to
you
for
itmyself
i
have
come

give
me
the
money
she
couldnt
keep
it
up
she
was
breathless
frightened
her
voice
failed
her
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
the
lines
round
it
quivered
alyosha
are
you
listening
or
are
you
asleep
mitya
i
know
you
will
tell
the
whole
truth
said
alyosha
in
agitation
i
am
telling
it
if
i
tell
the
whole
truth
just
as
it
happened
i
shant
spare
myself
my
first
idea
was
akaramazov
one
once
i
was
bitten
by
a
centipede
brother
and
laid
up
a
fortnight
with
fever
from
it
well
i
felt
a
centipede
biting
at
my
heart
thena
noxious
insect
you
understand
i
looked
her
up
and
down
youve
seen
her
shes
a
beauty
but
she
was
beautiful
in
another
way
then
at
that
moment
she
was
beautiful
because
she
was
noble
and
i
was
a
scoundrel
she
in
all
the
grandeur
of
her
generosity
and
sacrifice
for
her
father
and
ia
bug
and
scoundrel
as
i
was
she
was
altogether
at
my
mercy
body
and
soul
she
was
hemmed
in
i
tell
you
frankly
that
thought
that
venomous
thought
so
possessed
my
heart
that
it
almost
swooned
with
suspense
it
seemed
as
if
there
could
be
no
resisting
it
as
though
i
should
act
like
a
bug
like
a
venomous
spider
without
a
spark
of
pity
i
could
scarcely
breathe
understand
i
should
have
gone
next
day
to
ask
for
her
hand
so
that
it
might
end
honorably
so
to
speak
and
that
nobody
would
or
could
know
for
though
im
a
man
of
base
desires
im
honest
and
at
that
very
second
some
voice
seemed
to
whisper
in
my
ear
but
when
you
come
tomorrow
to
make
your
proposal
that
girl
wont
even
see
you
shell
order
her
coachman
to
kick
you
out
of
the
yard
publish
it
through
all
the
town
she
would
say
im
not
afraid
of
you

i
looked
at
the
young
lady
my
voice
had
not
deceived
me
that
is
how
it
would
be
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
could
see
from
her
face
now
that
i
should
be
turned
out
of
the
house
my
spite
was
roused
i
longed
to
play
her
the
nastiest
swinish
cads
trick
to
look
at
her
with
a
sneer
and
on
the
spot
where
she
stood
before
me
to
stun
her
with
a
tone
of
voice
that
only
a
shopman
could
use

four
thousand
what
do
you
mean
i
was
joking
youve
been
counting
your
chickens
too
easily
madam
two
hundred
if
you
like
with
all
my
heart
but
four
thousand
is
not
a
sum
to
throw
away
on
such
frivolity
youve
put
yourself
out
to
no
purpose
i
should
have
lost
the
game
of
course
shed
have
run
away
but
it
would
have
been
an
infernal
revenge
it
would
have
been
worth
it
all
id
have
howled
with
regret
all
the
rest
of
my
life
only
to
have
played
that
trick
would
you
believe
it
it
has
never
happened
to
me
with
any
other
woman
not
one
to
look
at
her
at
such
a
moment
with
hatred
but
on
my
oath
i
looked
at
her
for
three
seconds
or
five
perhaps
with
fearful
hatredthat
hate
which
is
only
a
hairsbreadth
from
love
from
the
maddest
love
i
went
to
the
window
put
my
forehead
against
the
frozen
pane
and
i
remember
the
ice
burnt
my
forehead
like
fire
i
did
not
keep
her
long
dont
be
afraid
i
turned
round
went
up
to
the
table
opened
the
drawer
and
took
out
a
banknote
for
five
thousand
roubles
it
was
lying
in
a
french
dictionary
then
i
showed
it
her
in
silence
folded
it
handed
it
to
her
opened
the
door
into
the
passage
and
stepping
back
made
her
a
deep
bow
a
most
respectful
a
most
impressive
bow
believe
me
she
shuddered
all
over
gazed
at
me
for
a
second
turned
horribly
palewhite
as
a
sheet
in
factand
all
at
once
not
impetuously
but
softly
gently
bowed
down
to
my
feetnot
a
boardingschool
curtsey
but
a
russian
bow
with
her
forehead
to
the
floor
she
jumped
up
and
ran
away
i
was
wearing
my
sword
i
drew
it
and
nearly
stabbed
myself
with
it
on
the
spot
why
i
dont
know
it
would
have
been
frightfully
stupid
of
course
i
suppose
it
was
from
delight
can
you
understand
that
one
might
kill
oneself
from
delight
but
i
didnt
stab
myself
i
only
kissed
my
sword
and
put
it
back
in
the
scabbardwhich
there
was
no
need
to
have
told
you
by
the
way
and
i
fancy
that
in
telling
you
about
my
inner
conflict
i
have
laid
it
on
rather
thick
to
glorify
myself
but
let
it
pass
and
to
hell
with
all
who
pry
into
the
human
heart
well
so
much
for
that
adventure
with
katerina
ivanovna
so
now
ivan
knows
of
it
and
youno
one
else
dmitri
got
up
took
a
step
or
two
in
his
excitement
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
forehead
then
sat
down
again
not
in
the
same
place
as
before
but
on
the
opposite
side
so
that
alyosha
had
to
turn
quite
round
to
face
him
chapter
v
the
confession
of
a
passionate
heartheels
up
now
said
alyosha
i
understand
the
first
half
you
understand
the
first
half
that
half
is
a
drama
and
it
was
played
out
there
the
second
half
is
a
tragedy
and
it
is
being
acted
here
and
i
understand
nothing
of
that
second
half
so
far
said
alyosha
and
i
do
you
suppose
i
understand
it
stop
dmitri
theres
one
important
question
tell
me
you
were
betrothed
you
are
betrothed
still
we
werent
betrothed
at
once
not
for
three
months
after
that
adventure
the
next
day
i
told
myself
that
the
incident
was
closed
concluded
that
there
would
be
no
sequel
it
seemed
to
me
caddish
to
make
her
an
offer
on
her
side
she
gave
no
sign
of
life
for
the
six
weeks
that
she
remained
in
the
town
except
indeed
for
one
action
the
day
after
her
visit
the
maidservant
slipped
round
with
an
envelope
addressed
to
me
i
tore
it
open
it
contained
the
change
out
of
the
banknote
only
four
thousand
five
hundred
roubles
was
needed
but
there
was
a
discount
of
about
two
hundred
on
changing
it
she
only
sent
me
about
two
hundred
and
sixty
i
dont
remember
exactly
but
not
a
note
not
a
word
of
explanation
i
searched
the
packet
for
a
pencil
marknnothing
well
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
money
on
such
an
orgy
that
the
new
major
was
obliged
to
reprimand
me
well
the
lieutenantcolonel
produced
the
battalion
money
to
the
astonishment
of
every
one
for
nobody
believed
that
he
had
the
money
untouched
hed
no
sooner
paid
it
than
he
fell
ill
took
to
his
bed
and
three
weeks
later
softening
of
the
brain
set
in
and
he
died
five
days
afterwards
he
was
buried
with
military
honors
for
he
had
not
had
time
to
receive
his
discharge
ten
days
after
his
funeral
katerina
ivanovna
with
her
aunt
and
sister
went
to
moscow
and
behold
on
the
very
day
they
went
away
i
hadnt
seen
them
didnt
see
them
off
or
take
leave
i
received
a
tiny
note
a
sheet
of
thin
blue
paper
and
on
it
only
one
line
in
pencil
i
will
write
to
you
wait
k
and
that
was
all
ill
explain
the
rest
now
in
two
words
in
moscow
their
fortunes
changed
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
and
the
unexpectedness
of
an
arabian
fairytale
that
generals
widow
their
nearest
relation
suddenly
lost
the
two
nieces
who
were
her
heiresses
and
nextofkinboth
died
in
the
same
week
of
smallpox
the
old
lady
prostrated
with
grief
welcomed
katya
as
a
daughter
as
her
one
hope
clutched
at
her
altered
her
will
in
katyas
favor
but
that
concerned
the
future
meanwhile
she
gave
her
for
present
use
eighty
thousand
roubles
as
a
marriage
portion
to
do
what
she
liked
with
she
was
an
hysterical
woman
i
saw
something
of
her
in
moscow
later
well
suddenly
i
received
by
post
four
thousand
five
hundred
roubles
i
was
speechless
with
surprise
as
you
may
suppose
three
days
later
came
the
promised
letter
i
have
it
with
me
now
you
must
read
it
she
offers
to
be
my
wife
offers
herself
to
me
i
love
you
madly
she
says
even
if
you
dont
love
me
never
mind
be
my
husband
dont
be
afraid
i
wont
hamper
you
in
any
way
i
will
be
your
chattel
i
will
be
the
carpet
under
your
feet
i
want
to
love
you
for
ever
i
want
to
save
you
from
yourself
alyosha
i
am
not
worthy
to
repeat
those
lines
in
my
vulgar
words
and
in
my
vulgar
tone
my
everlastingly
vulgar
tone
that
i
can
never
cure
myself
of
that
letter
stabs
me
even
now
do
you
think
i
dont
mindthat
i
dont
mind
still
i
wrote
her
an
answer
at
once
as
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
go
to
moscow
i
wrote
to
her
with
tears
one
thing
i
shall
be
ashamed
of
for
ever
i
referred
to
her
being
rich
and
having
a
dowry
while
i
was
only
a
stuckup
beggar
i
mentioned
money
i
ought
to
have
borne
it
in
silence
but
it
slipped
from
my
pen
then
i
wrote
at
once
to
ivan
and
told
him
all
i
could
about
it
in
a
letter
of
six
pages
and
sent
him
to
her
why
do
you
look
like
that
why
are
you
staring
at
me
yes
ivan
fell
in
love
with
her
hes
in
love
with
her
still
i
know
that
i
did
a
stupid
thing
in
the
worlds
opinion
but
perhaps
that
one
stupid
thing
may
be
the
saving
of
us
all
now
oo
dont
you
see
what
a
lot
she
thinks
of
ivan
how
she
respects
him
when
she
compares
us
do
you
suppose
she
can
love
a
man
like
me
especially
after
all
that
has
happened
here
but
i
am
convinced
that
she
does
love
a
man
like
you
and
not
a
man
like
him
she
loves
her
own
virtue
not
me
the
words
broke
involuntarily
and
almost
malignantly
from
dmitri
he
laughed
but
a
minute
later
his
eyes
gleamed
he
flushed
crimson
and
struck
the
table
violently
with
his
fist
i
swear
alyosha
he
cried
with
intense
and
genuine
anger
at
himself
you
may
not
believe
me
but
as
god
is
holy
and
as
christ
is
god
i
swear
that
though
i
smiled
at
her
lofty
sentiments
just
now
i
know
that
i
am
a
million
times
baser
in
soul
than
she
and
that
these
lofty
sentiments
of
hers
are
as
sincere
as
a
heavenly
angels
thats
the
tragedy
of
itthat
i
know
that
for
certain
what
if
any
one
does
show
off
a
bit
dont
i
do
it
myself
and
yet
im
sincere
im
sincere
as
for
ivan
i
can
understand
how
he
must
be
cursing
nature
nowwith
his
intellect
too
to
see
the
preference
givento
whom
to
what
to
a
monster
who
though
he
is
betrothed
and
all
eyes
are
fixed
on
him
cant
restrain
his
debaucheriesand
before
the
very
eyes
of
his
betrothed
and
a
man
like
me
is
preferred
while
he
is
rejected
and
why
because
a
girl
wants
to
sacrifice
her
life
and
destiny
out
of
gratitude
its
ridiculous
ive
never
said
a
word
of
this
to
ivan
and
ivan
of
course
has
never
dropped
a
hint
of
the
sort
to
me
but
destiny
will
be
accomplished
and
the
best
man
will
hold
his
ground
while
the
undeserving
one
will
vanish
into
his
back
alley
for
everhis
filthy
backalley
his
beloved
backalley
where
he
is
at
home
and
where
he
will
sink
in
filth
and
stench
at
his
own
free
will
and
with
enjoyment
ive
been
talking
foolishly
ive
no
words
left
i
use
them
at
random
but
it
will
be
as
i
have
said
i
shall
drown
in
the
back
alley
and
she
will
marry
ivan
stop
dmitri
alyosha
interrupted
again
with
great
anxiety
theres
one
thing
you
havent
made
clear
yet
you
are
still
betrothed
all
the
same
arent
you
how
can
you
break
off
the
engagement
if
she
your
betrothed
doesnt
want
to
yes
formally
and
solemnly
betrothed
it
was
all
done
on
my
arrival
in
moscow
with
great
ceremony
with
ikons
all
in
fine
style
the
generals
wife
blessed
us
andwould
you
believe
itcongratulated
katya
youve
made
a
good
choice
she
said
i
see
right
through
him
andwould
you
believe
itshe
didnt
like
ivan
and
hardly
greeted
him
i
had
a
lot
of
talk
with
katya
in
moscow
i
told
her
about
myselfsincerely
honorably
she
listened
to
everything
there
was
sweet
confusion
there
were
tender
words
though
there
were
proud
words
too
she
wrung
out
of
me
a
mighty
promise
to
reform
i
gave
my
promise
and
here
what
why
i
called
to
you
and
brought
you
out
here
today
this
very
dayremember
itto
send
youthis
very
day
againto
katerina
ivanovna
and
what
to
tell
her
that
i
shall
never
come
to
see
her
again
say
he
sends
you
his
compliments

but
is
that
possible
thats
just
the
reason
im
sending
you
in
my
place
because
its
impossible
and
how
could
i
tell
her
myself
and
where
are
you
going
to
the
backalley
to
grushenka
then
alyosha
exclaimed
mournfully
clasping
his
hands
can
rakitin
really
have
told
the
truth
i
thought
that
you
had
just
visited
her
and
that
was
all
can
a
betrothed
man
pay
such
visits
is
such
a
thing
possible
and
with
such
a
betrothed
and
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
confound
it
i
have
some
honor
as
soon
as
i
began
visiting
grushenka
i
ceased
to
be
betrothed
and
to
be
an
honest
man
i
understand
that
why
do
you
look
at
me
you
see
i
went
in
the
first
place
to
beat
her
i
had
heard
and
i
know
for
a
fact
now
that
that
captain
fathers
agent
had
given
grushenka
an
iou
of
mine
for
her
to
sue
me
for
payment
so
as
to
put
an
end
to
me
they
wanted
to
scare
me
i
went
to
beat
her
i
had
had
a
glimpse
of
her
before
she
doesnt
strike
one
at
first
sight
i
knew
about
her
old
merchant
whos
lying
ill
now
paralyzed
but
hes
leaving
her
a
decent
little
sum
i
knew
too
that
she
was
fond
of
money
that
she
hoarded
it
and
lent
it
at
a
wicked
rate
of
interest
that
shes
a
merciless
cheat
and
swindler
i
went
to
beat
her
and
i
stayed
the
storm
brokeit
struck
me
down
like
the
plague
im
plaguestricken
still
and
i
know
that
everything
is
over
that
there
will
never
be
anything
more
for
me
the
cycle
of
the
ages
is
accomplished
thats
my
position
and
though
im
a
beggar
as
fate
would
have
it
i
had
three
thousand
just
then
in
my
pocket
i
drove
with
grushenka
to
mokroe
a
place
twentyfive
versts
from
here
i
got
gypsies
there
and
champagne
and
made
all
the
peasants
there
drunk
on
it
and
all
the
women
and
girls
i
sent
the
thousands
flying
in
three
days
time
i
was
stripped
bare
but
a
hero
do
you
suppose
the
hero
had
gained
his
end
not
a
sign
of
it
from
her
i
tell
you
that
rogue
grushenka
has
a
supple
curve
all
over
her
body
you
can
see
it
in
her
little
foot
even
in
her
little
toe
i
saw
it
and
kissed
it
but
that
was
all
i
swear
ill
marry
you
if
you
like
she
said
youre
a
beggar
you
know
say
that
you
wont
beat
me
and
will
let
me
do
anything
i
choose
and
perhaps
i
will
marry
you
she
laughed
and
shes
laughing
still
dmitri
leapt
up
with
a
sort
of
fury
he
seemed
all
at
once
as
though
he
were
drunk
his
eyes
became
suddenly
bloodshot
and
do
you
really
mean
to
marry
her
at
once
if
she
will
and
if
she
wont
i
shall
stay
all
the
same
ill
be
the
porter
at
her
gate
alyosha
he
cried
he
stopped
short
before
him
and
taking
him
by
the
shoulders
began
shaking
him
violently
do
you
know
you
innocent
boy
that
this
is
all
delirium
senseless
delirium
for
theres
a
tragedy
here
let
me
tell
you
alexey
that
i
may
be
a
low
man
with
low
and
degraded
passions
but
a
thief
and
a
pickpocket
dmitri
karamazov
never
can
be
well
then
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
a
thief
and
a
pickpocket
that
very
morning
just
before
i
went
to
beat
grushenka
katerina
ivanovna
sent
for
me
and
in
strict
secrecy
why
i
dont
know
i
suppose
she
had
some
reason
asked
me
to
go
to
the
chief
town
of
the
province
and
to
post
three
thousand
roubles
to
agafya
ivanovna
in
moscow
so
that
nothing
should
be
known
of
it
in
the
town
here
so
i
had
that
three
thousand
roubles
in
my
pocket
when
i
went
to
see
grushenka
and
it
was
that
money
we
spent
at
mokroe
afterwards
i
pretended
i
had
been
to
the
town
but
did
not
show
her
the
post
office
receipt
i
said
i
had
sent
the
money
and
would
bring
the
receipt
and
so
far
i
havent
brought
it
ive
forgotten
it
now
what
do
you
think
youre
going
to
her
today
to
say
he
sends
his
compliments
and
shell
ask
you
what
about
the
money
you
might
still
have
said
to
her
hes
a
degraded
sensualist
and
a
low
creature
with
uncontrolled
passions
he
didnt
send
your
money
then
but
wasted
it
because
like
a
low
brute
he
couldnt
control
himself
but
still
you
might
have
added
he
isnt
a
thief
though
here
is
your
three
thousand
he
sends
it
back
send
it
yourself
to
agafya
ivanovna
but
he
told
me
to
say
he
sends
his
compliments

but
as
it
is
she
will
ask
but
where
is
the
money

mitya

unhappy

as
unhappy

you
think
dont
worry
yourself
to
death
with
despair
what
do
you
suppose
id

because
i
cant
get
three
thousand
to
pay
back
thats
just
it
i
shant
shoot
myself
i
havent
the
strength
now
afterwards
perhaps
but
now
im
going
to
grushenka

how
great
this
trouble

a
lofty
mind
and

dmitri
with
a
grin

in
it

that
no
woman

you

best

the
first
time
in
earnest
underline
in
earnest
that
grushenka
is
really

not
joking
and
really
means
to
marry
me
he
knows
her
nature
he
knows
the
cat
and
do
you
suppose
hes
going
to
give
me
money
to
help
to
bring
that
about
when
hes
crazy
about
her
himself

thats
not
all
either
i
can
tell
you
more
than
that
i

had
three

notes
of
a
hundred
roubles

into
a
large
envelope
sealed
with
five
seals
and
tied
across

and
in

and
looking
keenly
at

moment
the

him
that

alyosha
went
thoughtfully
towards
his
fathers
house
chapter
vi
smerdyakov
he
did
in
fact
find
his
father
still
at
table
though
there
was
a
dining
room
in
the
house
the
table
was
laid
as
usual
in
the
drawingroom
which
was
the
largest
room
and
furnished
with
oldfashioned
ostentation
the
furniture
was
white
and
very
old
upholstered
in
old
red
silky
material
in
the
spaces
between
the
windows
there
were
mirrors
in
elaborate
white
and
gilt
frames
of
oldfashioned
carving
on
the
walls
covered
with
white
paper
which
was
torn
in
many
places
there
hung
two
large
portraitsone
of
some
prince
who
had
been
governor
of
the
district
thirty
years
before
and
the
other
of
some
bishop
also
long
since
dead
in
the
corner
opposite
the
door
there
were
several
ikons
before
which
a
lamp
was
lighted
at
nightfall

not
so
much
for
devotional
purposes
as
to
light
the
room
fyodor
pavlovitch
used
to
go
to
bed
very
late
at
three
or
four
oclock
in
the
morning
and
would
wander
about
the
room
at
night
or
sit
in
an
armchair
thinking
this
had
become
a
habit
with
him
he
often
slept
quite
alone
in
the
house
sending
his
servants
to
the
lodge
but
usually
smerdyakov
remained
sleeping
on
a
bench
in
the
hall
when
alyosha
came
in
dinner
was
over
but
coffee
and
preserves
had
been
served
fyodor
pavlovitch
liked
sweet
things
with
brandy
after
dinner
ivan
was
also
at
table
sipping
coffee
the
servants
grigory
and
smerdyakov
were
standing
by
both
the
gentlemen
and
the
servants
seemed
in
singularly
good
spirits
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
roaring
with
laughter
before
he
entered
the
room
alyosha
heard
the
shrill
laugh
he
knew
so
well
and
could
tell
from
the
sound
of
it
that
his
father
had
only
reached
the
goodhumored
stage
and
was
far
from
being
completely
drunk
here

fyodor

highly

fyodor

pavlovitch

balaams
ass
has
begun
talking
to
us
hereand
how
he
talks
how
he
talks
balaams
ass
it
appeared
was
the
valet
smerdyakov
he
was
a
young
man
of
about
four
and
twenty
remarkably
unsociable
and
taciturn
not
that
he
was
shy
or
bashful
on
the
contrary
he
was
conceited
and
seemed
to
despise
everybody
but
we
must
pause
to
say
a
few
words
about
him
now
he
was
brought
up
by
grigory
and
marfa
but
the
boy
grew
up
with
no
sense
of
gratitude
as
grigory
expressed
it
he
was
an
unfriendly
boy
and
seemed
to
look
at
the
world
mistrustfully
in
his
childhood
he
was
very
fond
of
hanging
cats
and
burying
them
with
great
ceremony
he
used
to
dress
up
in
a
sheet
as
though
it
were
a
surplice
and
sang
and
waved
some
object
over
the
dead
cat
as
though
it
were
a
censer
all
this
he
did
on
the
sly
with
the
greatest
secrecy
grigory
caught
him
once
at
this
diversion
and
gave
him
a
sound
beating
he
shrank
into
a
corner
and
sulked
there
for
a
week
he
doesnt
care
for
you
or
me
the
monster
grigory
used
to
say
to
marfa
and
he
doesnt
care
for
any
one
are
you
a
human
being
he
said
addressing
the
boy
directly
youre
not
a
human
being
you
grew
from
the
mildew
in
the
bathhouse2
thats
what
you
are
smerdyakov
it
appeared
afterwards
could
never
forgive
him
those
words
grigory
taught
him
to
read
and
write
and
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
began
teaching
him
the
scriptures
but
this
teaching
came
to
nothing
at
the
second
or
third
lesson
the
boy
suddenly
grinned
whats
that
for
asked
grigory
looking
at
him
threateningly
from
under
his
spectacles
oh
nothing
god
created
light
on
the
first
day
and
the
sun
moon
and
stars
on
the
fourth
day
where
did
the
light
come
from
on
the
first
day
grigory
was
thunderstruck
the
boy
looked
sarcastically
at
his
teacher
there
was
something
positively
condescending
in
his
expression
grigory
could
not
restrain
himself
ill
show
you
where
he
cried
and
gave
the
boy
a
violent
slap
on
the
cheek
the
boy
took
the
slap
without
a
word
but
withdrew
into
his
corner
again
for
some
days
a
week
later
he
had
his
first
attack
of
the
disease
to
which
he
was
subject
all
the
rest
of
his
lifeepilepsy
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
heard
of
it
his
attitude
to
the
boy
seemed
changed
at
once
till
then
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
him
though
he
never
scolded
him
and
always
gave
him
a
copeck
when
he
met
him
sometimes
when
he
was
in
good
humor
he
would
send
the
boy
something
sweet
from
his
table
but
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
his
illness
he
showed
an
active
interest
in
him
sent
for
a
doctor
and
tried
remedies
but
the
disease
turned
out
to
be
incurable
the
fits
occurred
on
an
average
once
a
month
but
at
various
intervals
the
fits
varied
too
in
violence
some
were
light
and
some
were
very
severe
fyodor
pavlovitch
strictly
forbade
grigory
to
use
corporal
punishment
to
the
boy
and
began
allowing
him
to
come
upstairs
to
him
he
forbade
him
to
be
taught
anything
whatever
for
a
time
too
one
day
when
the
boy
was
about
fifteen
fyodor
pavlovitch
noticed
him
lingering
by
the
bookcase
and
reading
the
titles
through
the
glass
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
a
fair
number
of
booksover
a
hundredbut
no
one
ever
saw
him
reading
he
at
once
gave
smerdyakov
the
key
of
the
bookcase
come
read
you
shall
be
my
librarian
youll
be
better
sitting
reading
than
hanging
about
the
courtyard
come
read
this
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
gave
him
evenings
in
a
cottage
near
dikanka
he
read
a
little
but
didnt
like
it
he
did
not
once
smile
and
ended
by
frowning
why
isnt
it
funny
asked
fyodor
pavlovitch
smerdyakov
did
not
speak
answer
stupid
its
all
untrue
mumbled
the
boy
with
a
grin
then
go
to
the
devil
you
have
the
soul
of
a
lackey
stay
heres
smaragdovs
universal
history
thats
all
true
read
that
but
smerdyakov
did
not
get
through
ten
pages
of
smaragdov
he
thought
it
dull
so
the
bookcase
was
closed
again
shortly
afterwards
marfa
and
grigory
reported
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
that
smerdyakov
was
gradually
beginning
to
show
an
extraordinary
fastidiousness
he
would
sit
before
his
soup
take
up
his
spoon
and
look
into
the
soup
bend
over
it
examine
it
take
a
spoonful
and
hold
it
to
the
light
what
is
it
a
beetle
grigory
would
ask
a
fly
perhaps
observed
marfa
the
squeamish
youth
never
answered
but
he
did
the
same
with
his
bread
his
meat
and
everything
he
ate
he
would
hold
a
piece
on
his
fork
to
the
light
scrutinize
it
microscopically
and
only
after
long
deliberation
decide
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
ach
what
fine
gentlemens
airs
grigory
muttered
looking
at
him
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
heard
of
this
development
in
smerdyakov
he
determined
to
make
him
his
cook
and
sent
him
to
moscow
to
be
trained
he
spent
some
years
there
and
came
back
remarkably
changed
in
appearance
he
looked
extraordinarily
old
for
his
age
his
face
had
grown
wrinkled
yellow
and
strangely
emasculate
in
character
he
seemed
almost
exactly
the
same
as
before
he
went
away
he
was
just
as
unsociable
and
showed
not
the
slightest
inclination
for
any
companionship
in
moscow
too
as
we
heard
afterwards
he
had
always
been
silent
moscow
itself
had
little
interest
for
him
he
saw
very
little
there
and
took
scarcely
any
notice
of
anything
he
went
once
to
the
theater
but
returned
silent
and
displeased
with
it
on
the
other
hand
he
came
back
to
us
from
moscow
well
dressed
in
a
clean
coat
and
clean
linen
he
brushed
his
clothes
most
scrupulously
twice
a
day
invariably
and
was
very
fond
of
cleaning
his
smart
calf
boots
with
a
special
english
polish
so
that
they
shone
like
mirrors
he
turned
out
a
firstrate
cook
fyodor
pavlovitch
paid
him
a
salary
almost
the
whole
of
which
smerdyakov
spent
on
clothes
pomade
perfumes
and
such
things
but
he
seemed
to
have
as
much
contempt
for
the
female
sex
as
for
men
he
was
discreet
almost
unapproachable
with
them
fyodor
pavlovitch
began
to
regard
him
rather
differently
his
fits
were
becoming
more
frequent
and
on
the
days
he
was
ill
marfa
cooked
which
did
not
suit
fyodor
pavlovitch
at
all
why
are
your
fits
getting
worse
asked
fyodor
pavlovitch
looking
askance
at
his
new
cook
would
you
like
to
get
married
shall
i
find
you
a
wife
but
smerdyakov
turned
pale
with
anger
and
made
no
reply
fyodor
pavlovitch
left
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
the
great
thing
was
that
he
had
absolute
confidence
in
his
honesty
it
happened
once
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
drunk
that
he
dropped
in
the
muddy
courtyard
three
hundredrouble
notes
which
he
had
only
just
received
he
only
missed
them
next
day
and
was
just
hastening
to
search
his
pockets
when
he
saw
the
notes
lying
on
the
table
where
had
they
come
from
smerdyakov
had
picked
them
up
and
brought
them
in
the
day
before
well
my
lad
ive
never
met
any
one
like
you
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
shortly
and
gave
him
ten
roubles
we
may
add
that
he
not
only
believed
in
his
honesty
but
had
for
some
reason
a
liking
for
him
although
the
young
man
looked
as
morosely
at
him
as
at
every
one
and
was
always
silent
he
rarely
spoke
if
it
had
occurred
to
any
one
to
wonder
at
the
time
what
the
young
man
was
interested
in
and
what
was
in
his
mind
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
tell
by
looking
at
him
yet
he
used
sometimes
to
stop
suddenly
in
the
house
or
even
in
the
yard
or
street
and
would
stand
still
for
ten
minutes
lost
in
thought
a
physiognomist
studying
his
face
would
have
said
that
there
was
no
thought
in
it
no
reflection
but
only
a
sort
of
contemplation
there
is
a
remarkable
picture
by
the
painter
kramskoy
called
contemplation
there
is
a
forest
in
winter
and
on
a
roadway
through
the
forest
in
absolute
solitude
stands
a
peasant
in
a
torn
kaftan
and
bark
shoes
he
stands
as
it
were
lost
in
thought
yet
he
is
not
thinking
he
is
contemplating
if
any
one
touched
him
he
would
start
and
look
at
one
as
though
awakening
and
bewildered
its
true
he
would
come
to
himself
immediately
but
if
he
were
asked
what
he
had
been
thinking
about
he
would
remember
nothing
yet
probably
he
has
hidden
within
himself
the
impression
which
had
dominated
him
during
the
period
of
contemplation
those
impressions
are
dear
to
him
and
no
doubt
he
hoards
them
imperceptibly
and
even
unconsciously
how
and
why
of
course
he
does
not
know
either
he
may
suddenly
after
hoarding
impressions
for
many
years
abandon
everything
and
go
off
to
jerusalem
on
a
pilgrimage
for
his
souls
salvation
or
perhaps
he
will
suddenly
set
fire
to
his
native
village
and
perhaps
do
both
there
are
a
good
many
contemplatives
among
the
peasantry
well
smerdyakov
was
probably
one
of
them
and
he
probably
was
greedily
hoarding
up
his
impressions
hardly
knowing
why
chapter
vii
the
controversy
but
balaams
ass
had
suddenly
spoken
the
subject
was
a
strange
one
grigory
had
gone
in
the
morning
to
make
purchases
and
had
heard
from
the
shopkeeper
lukyanov
the
story
of
a
russian
soldier
which
had
appeared
in
the
newspaper
of
that
day
this
soldier
had
been
taken
prisoner
in
some
remote
part
of
asia
and
was
threatened
with
an
immediate
agonizing
death
if
he
did
not
renounce
christianity
and
follow
islam
he
refused
to
deny
his
faith
and
was
tortured
flayed
alive
and
died
praising
and
glorifying
christ
grigory
had
related
the
story
at
table
fyodor
pavlovitch
always
liked
over
the
dessert
after
dinner
to
laugh
and
talk
if
only
with
grigory
this
afternoon
he
was
in
a
particularly
goodhumored
and
expansive
mood
sipping
his
brandy
and
listening
to
the
story
he
observed
that
they
ought
to
make
a
saint
of
a
soldier
like
that
and
to
take
his
skin
to
some
monastery
that
would
make
the
people
flock
and
bring
the
money
in
grigory
frowned
seeing
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
by
no
means
touched
but
as
usual
was
beginning
to
scoff
at
that
moment
smerdyakov
who
was
standing
by
the
door
smiled
smerdyakov
often
waited
at
table
towards
the
end
of
dinner
and
since
ivans
arrival
in
our
town
he
had
done
so
every
day
what
are
you
grinning
at
asked
fyodor
pavlovitch
catching
the
smile
instantly
and
knowing
that
it
referred
to
grigory
well
my
opinion
is
smerdyakov
began
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
in
a
loud
voice
that
if
that
laudable
soldiers
exploit
was
so
very
great
there
would
have
been
to
my
thinking
no
sin
in
it
if
he
had
on
such
an
emergency
renounced
so
to
speak
the
name
of
christ
and
his
own
christening
to
save
by
that
same
his
life
for
good
deeds
by
which
in
the
course
of
years
to
expiate
his
cowardice
how
could
it
not
be
a
sin
youre
talking
nonsense
for
that
youll
go
straight
to
hell
and
be
roasted
there
like
mutton
put
in
fyodor
pavlovitch
it
was
at
this
point
that
alyosha
came
in
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
we
have
seen
was
highly
delighted
at
his
appearance
were
on
your
subject
your
subject
he
chuckled
gleefully
making
alyosha
sit
down
to
listen
as
for
mutton
thats
not
so
and
therell
be
nothing
there
for
this
and
there
shouldnt
be
either
if
its
according
to
justice
smerdyakov
maintained
stoutly
how
do
you
mean
according
to
justice
fyodor
pavlovitch
cried
still
more
gayly
nudging
alyosha
with
his
knee
hes
a
rascal
thats
what
he
is
burst
from
grigory
he
looked
smerdyakov
wrathfully
in
the
face
as
for
being
a
rascal
wait
a
little
grigory
vassilyevitch
answered
smerdyakov
with
perfect
composure
youd
better
consider
yourself
that
once
i
am
taken
prisoner
by
the
enemies
of
the
christian
race
and
they
demand
from
me
to
curse
the
name
of
god
and
to
renounce
my
holy
christening
i
am
fully
entitled
to
act
by
my
own
reason
since
there
would
be
no
sin
in
it
but
youve
said
that
before
dont
waste
words
prove
it
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
soupmaker
muttered
grigory
contemptuously
as
for
being
a
soupmaker
wait
a
bit
too
and
consider
for
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
without
abusing
me
for
as
soon
as
i
say
to
those
enemies
no
im
not
a
christian
and
i
curse
my
true
god
then
at
once
by
gods
high
judgment
i
become
immediately
and
specially
anathema
accursed
and
am
cut
off
from
the
holy
church
exactly
as
though
i
were
a
heathen
so
that
at
that
very
instant
not
only
when
i
say
it
aloud
but
when
i
think
of
saying
it
before
a
quarter
of
a
second
has
passed
i
am
cut
off
is
that
so
or
not
grigory
vassilyevitch
he
addressed
grigory
with
obvious
satisfaction
though
he
was
really
answering
fyodor
pavlovitchs
questions
and
was
well
aware
of
it
and
intentionally
pretending
that
grigory
had
asked
the
questions
ivan
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
suddenly
stoop
down
for
me
to
whisper

got
this
all
up
for
your
benefit
he
wants

with
perfect
seriousness
to
his
fathers
excited
whisper

ivan
looking
steadily
at
his
father

was
watching
smerdyakov
with
great
curiosity
youre
anathema
accursed
as
it
is
grigory

burst
out

all
i
had
to
say
for
at
the
very
moment
i
become
accursed
at
that
same
highest
moment
i
become
exactly
like
a
heathen
and
my
christening
is
taken
off
me
and
becomes
of
no
avail
isnt
that
so
make
haste
and
finish
my
boy
fyodor
pavlovitch
urged
him
sipping
from
his
wineglass
with
relish
and
if
ive
ceased
to
be
a
christian
then
i
told
no
lie
to
the
enemy
when
they
asked
whether
i
was
a
christian
or
not
a
christian
seeing
i
had
already
been
relieved
by
god
himself
of
my
christianity
by
reason
of
the
thought
alone
before
i
had
time
to
utter
a
word
to
the
enemy
and
if
i
have
already
been
discharged
in
what
manner
and
with
what
sort
of
justice
can
i
be
held
responsible
as
a
christian
in
the
other
world
for
having
denied
christ
when
through
the
very
thought
alone
before
denying
him
i
had
been
relieved
from
my
christening
if
im
no
longer
a
christian
then
i
cant
renounce
christ
for
ive
nothing
then
to
renounce
who
will
hold
an
unclean
tatar
responsible
grigory
vassilyevitch
even
in
heaven
for
not
having
been
born
a
christian
and
who
would
punish
him
for
that
considering
that
you
cant
take
two
skins
off
one
ox
for
god
almighty
himself
even
if
he
did
make
the
tatar
responsible
when
he
dies
would
give
him
the
smallest
possible
punishment
i
imagine
since
he
must
be
punished
judging
that
he
is
not
to
blame
if
he
has
come
into
the
world
an
unclean
heathen
from
heathen
parents
the
lord
god
cant
surely
take
a
tatar
and
say
he
was
a
christian
that
would
mean
that
the
almighty
would
tell
a
real
untruth
and
can
the
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
tell
a
lie
even
in
one
word
grigory
was
thunderstruck
and
looked
at
the
orator
his
eyes
nearly
starting
out
of
his
head
though
he
did
not
clearly
understand
what
was
said
he
had
caught
something
in
this
rigmarole
and
stood
looking
like
a
man
who
has
just
hit
his
head
against
a
wall
fyodor
pavlovitch
emptied
his
glass
and
went
off
into
his
shrill
laugh
alyosha
alyosha
what
do
you
say
to
that
ah
you
casuist
he
must
have
been
with
the
jesuits
somewhere
ivan
oh
you
stinking
jesuit
who
taught
you
but
youre
talking
nonsense
you
casuist
nonsense
nonsense
nonsense
dont
cry
grigory
well
reduce
him
to
smoke
and
ashes
in
a
moment
tell
me
this
o
ass
you
may
be
right
before
your
enemies
but
you
have
renounced
your
faith
all
the
same
in
your
own
heart
and
you
say
yourself
that
in
that
very
hour
you
became
anathema
accursed
and
if
once
youre
anathema
they
wont
pat
you
on
the
head
for
it
in
hell
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
fine
jesuit
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
have
renounced
it
in
my
own
heart
but
there
was
no
special
sin
in
that
or
if
there
was
sin
it
was
the
most
ordinary
hows
that
the
most
ordinary
you
lie
accursed
one
hissed
grigory
consider
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
smerdyakov
went
on
staid
and
unruffled
conscious
of
his
triumph
but
as
it
were
generous
to
the
vanquished
foe
consider
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
it
is
said
in
the
scripture
that
if
you
have
faith
even
as
a
mustard
seed
and
bid
a
mountain
move
into
the
sea
it
will
move
without
the
least
delay
at
your
bidding
well
grigory
vassilyevitch
if
im
without
faith
and
you
have
so
great
a
faith
that
you
are
continually
swearing
at
me
you
try
yourself
telling
this
mountain
not
to
move
into
the
sea
for
thats
a
long
way
off
but
even
to
our
stinking
little
river
which
runs
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
youll
see
for
yourself
that
it
wont
budge
but
will
remain
just
where
it
is
however
much
you
shout
at
it
and
that
shows
grigory
vassilyevitch
that
you
havent
faith
in
the
proper
manner
and
only
abuse
others
about
it
again
taking
into
consideration
that
no
one
in
our
day
not
only
you
but
actually
no
one
from
the
highest
person
to
the
lowest
peasant
can
shove
mountains
into
the
seaexcept
perhaps
some
one
man
in
the
world
or
at
most
two
and
they
most
likely
are
saving
their
souls
in
secret
somewhere
in
the
egyptian
desert
so
you
wouldnt
find
themif
so
it
be
if
all
the
rest
have
no
faith
will
god
curse
all
the
rest
that
is
the
population
of
the
whole
earth
except
about
two
hermits
in
the
desert
and
in
his
wellknown
mercy
will
he
not
forgive
one
of
them
and
so
im
persuaded
that
though
i
may
once
have
doubted
i
shall
be
forgiven
if
i
shed
tears
of
repentance
stay
cried
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
a
transport
of
delight
so
you
do
suppose
there
are
two
who
can
move
mountains
ivan
make
a
note
of
it
write
it
down
there
you
have
the
russian
all
over
youre
quite
right
in
saying
its
characteristic
of
the
peoples
faith
ivan
assented
with
an
approving
smile
you
agree
then
it
must
be
so
if
you
agree
its
true
isnt
it
alyosha
thats
the
russian
faith
all
over
isnt
it
no
smerdyakov
has
not
the
russian
faith
at
all
said
alyosha
firmly
and
gravely
im
not
talking
about
his
faith
i
mean
those
two
in
the
desert
only
that
idea
surely
thats
russian
isnt
it
yes
thats
purely
russian
said
alyosha
smiling
your
words
are
worth
a
gold
piece
o
ass
and
ill
give
it
to
you
today
but
as
to
the
rest
you
talk
nonsense
nonsense
nonsense
let
me
tell
you
stupid
that
we
here
are
all
of
little
faith
only
from
carelessness
because
we
havent
time
things
are
too
much
for
us
and
in
the
second
place
the
lord
god
has
given
us
so
little
time
only
twentyfour
hours
in
the
day
so
that
one
hasnt
even
time
to
get
sleep
enough
much
less
to
repent
of
ones
sins
while
you
have
denied
your
faith
to
your
enemies
when
youd
nothing
else
to
think
about
but
to
show
your
faith
so
i
consider
brother
that
it
constitutes
a
sin
constitute
a
sin
it
may
but
consider
yourself
grigory
vassilyevitch
that
it
only
extenuates
it
if
it
does
constitute
if
i
had
believed
then
in
very
truth
as
i
ought
to
have
believed
then
it
really
would
have
been
sinful
if
i
had
not
faced
tortures
for
my
faith
and
had
gone
over
to
the
pagan
mohammedan
faith
but
of
course
it
wouldnt
have
come
to
torture
then
because
i
should
only
have
had
to
say
at
that
instant
to
the
mountain
move
and
crush
the
tormentor
and
it
would
have
moved
and
at
the
very
instant
have
crushed
him
like
a
blackbeetle
and
i
should
have
walked
away
as
though
nothing
had
happened
praising
and
glorifying
god
but
suppose
at
that
very
moment
i
had
tried
all
that
and
cried
to
that
mountain
crush
these
tormentors
and
it
hadnt
crushed
them
how
could
i
have
helped
doubting
pray
at
such
a
time
and
at
such
a
dread
hour
of
mortal
terror
and
apart
from
that
i
should
know
already
that
i
could
not
attain
to
the
fullness
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
for
since
the
mountain
had
not
moved
at
my
word
they
could
not
think
very
much
of
my
faith
up
aloft
and
there
could
be
no
very
great
reward
awaiting
me
in
the
world
to
come
so
why
should
i
let
them
flay
the
skin
off
me
as
well
and
to
no
good
purpose
for
even
though
they
had
flayed
my
skin
half
off
my
back
even
then
the
mountain
would
not
have
moved
at
my
word
or
at
my
cry
and
at
such
a
moment
not
only
doubt
might
come
over
one
but
one
might
lose
ones
reason
from
fear
so
that
one
would
not
be
able
to
think
at
all
and
therefore
how
should
i
be
particularly
to
blame
if
not
seeing
my
advantage
or
reward
there
or
here
i
should
at
least
save
my
skin
and
so
trusting
fully
in
the
grace
of
the
lord
i
should
cherish
the
hope
that
i
might
be
altogether
forgiven
chapter
viii
over
the
brandy
the
controversy
was
over
but
strange
to
say
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
had
been
so
gay
suddenly
began
frowning
he
frowned
and
gulped
brandy
and
it
was
already
a
glass
too
much
get
along
with
you
jesuits
he
cried
to
the
servants
go
away
smerdyakov
ill
send
you
the
gold
piece
i
promised
you
today
but
be
off
dont
cry
grigory
go
to
marfa
shell
comfort
you
and
put
you
to
bed
the
rascals
wont
let
us
sit
in
peace
after
dinner
he
snapped
peevishly
as
the
servants
promptly
withdrew
at
his
word
smerdyakov
always
pokes
himself
in
now
after
dinner
its
you
hes
so
interested
in
what
have
you
done
to
fascinate
him
he
added
to
ivan
nothing
whatever
answered
ivan
hes
pleased
to
have
a
high
opinion
of
me
hes
a
lackey
and
a
mean
soul
raw
material
for
revolution
however
when
the
time
comes
for
revolution
there
will
be
others
and
better
ones
but
there
will
be
some
like
him
as
well
his
kind
will
come
first
and
better
ones
after
and
when
will
the
time
come
the
rocket
will
go
off
and
fizzle
out
perhaps
the
peasants
are
not
very
fond
of
listening
to
these
soupmakers
so
far
ah
brother
but
a
balaams
ass
like
that
thinks
and
thinks
and
the
devil
knows
where
he
gets
to
hes
storing
up
ideas
said
ivan
smiling
you
see
i
know
he
cant
bear
me
nor
any
one
else
even
you
though
you
fancy
that
he
has
a
high
opinion
of
you
worse
still
with
alyosha
he
despises
alyosha
but
he
doesnt
steal
thats
one
thing
and
hes
not
a
gossip
he
holds
his
tongue
and
doesnt
wash
our
dirty
linen
in
public
he
makes
capital
fish
pasties
too
but
damn
him
is
he
worth
talking
about
so
much
of
course
he
isnt
and
as
for
the
ideas
he
may
be
hatching
the
russian
peasant
generally
speaking
needs
thrashing
that
ive
always
maintained
our
peasants
are
swindlers
and
dont
deserve
to
be
pitied
and
its
a
good
thing
theyre
still
flogged
sometimes
russia
is
rich
in
birches
if
they
destroyed
the
forests
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
russia
i
stand
up
for
the
clever
people
weve
left
off
thrashing
the
peasants
weve
grown
so
clever
but
they
go
on
thrashing
themselves
and
a
good
thing
too
for
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
or
how
does
it
go
anyhow
it
will
be
measured
but
russias
all
swinishness
my
dear
if
you
only
knew
how
i
hate
russia
that
is
not
russia
but
all
this
vice
but
maybe
i
mean
russia
tout
cela
cest
de
la
cochonnerie
do
you
know
what
i
like
i
like
wit
youve
had
another
glass
thats
enough
wait
a
bit
ill
have
one
more
and
then
another
and
then
ill
stop
no
stay
you
interrupted
me
at
mokroe
i
was
talking
to
an
old
man
and
he
told
me
theres
nothing
we
like
so
much
as
sentencing
girls
to
be
thrashed
and
we
always
give
the
lads
the
job
of
thrashing
them
and
the
girl
he
has
thrashed
today
the
young
man
will
ask
in
marriage
tomorrow
so
it
quite
suits
the
girls
too
he
said
theres
a
set
of
de
sades
for
you
but
its
clever
anyway
shall
we
go
over
and
have
a
look
at
it
eh
alyosha
are
you
blushing
dont
be
bashful
child
im
sorry
i
didnt
stay
to
dinner
at
the
superiors
and
tell
the
monks
about
the
girls
at
mokroe
alyosha
dont
be
angry
that
i
offended
your
superior
this
morning
i
lost
my
temper
if
there
is
a
god
if
he
exists
then
of
course
im
to
blame
and
i
shall
have
to
answer
for
it
but
if
there
isnt
a
god

your
fathers

not
enough
to
cut
their
heads
off

they

end
of
your
monks
though

id
take
all
that
mystic
stuff
and
suppress
it
once
for
all
all
over
russia
so
as
to
bring
all
the
fools
to
reason
and
the
gold
and
the
silver
that
would
flow
into
the
mint
but
why
suppress
it
asked
ivan
that
truth
may
prevail
thats
why
well
if
truth
were
to
prevail

a
clever
remark
just
now
about
smerdyakovs
belief
in
the
existence
of
two
saints
who
could
move
mountains
why

russian

russian
characteristic

hm

more
likely
ivans

good
lord

think
what
faith
what
force
of
all
kinds
man
has
lavished
for
nothing
on
that
dream

the
last
time

the
last
time
there
is
not
who
is
laughing
at
mankind
ivan

the
devil
does
he
exist
no
theres
no
devil
either
its
a
pity

i
do
to
the
man
who
first
invented
god
hanging
on
a
bitter
aspen
tree
would
be
too
good
for
him
there
would
have
been
no
civilization
if
they
hadnt
invented
god
wouldnt
there
have
been
without
god
no
and

du
piron
ldedans
hes
a
jesuit
a
russian
one
that
is
as
hes
an
honorable
person
theres
a
hidden
indignation
boiling
within
him
at
having
to
pretend
and
affect
holiness
but
of
course
he
believes
in
god
not
a
bit
of
it
didnt
you
know
why
he
tells
every
one
so
himself
that

every
one

the
clever
people
who
come
to
him
he
said
straight
out
to
governor
schultz
not
long
ago

but
i
dont
know
in
what

really
he
really
did
but
i
respect
him
theres
something
of
mephistopheles
about
him
or
rather
of
the
hero
of
our
time

arbenin
or
whats
his
name
you
see
hes
a
sensualist
hes
such
a
sensualist
that
i
should
be
afraid
for
my
daughter
or
my
wife
if
she
went
to
confess
to
him

our
sides
especially
how

the
old
man

state
of
drunkenness
when
the
drunkard
who

inoffensive

to

take
away
the
brandy
ivan
its
the
third
time
ive
told
you
he
mused
and
suddenly
a
slow
cunning
grin
spread
over
his
face
dont
be
angry
with
a
feeble
old
man
ivan
i
know
you
dont
love
me
but
dont
be
angry
all
the
same
youve
nothing

for
you

to
tchermashnya
ill
come
to
you
myself
and
bring
you
a
present
ill
show
you
a
little
wench
there
ive
had
my
eye
on
her
a
long
time
shes
still
running
about
barefoot
dont
be
afraid
of
barefooted
wenchesdont
despise
themtheyre
pearls
and
he
kissed
his
hand
with
a
smack
to
my
thinking
he
revived
at
once
seeming
to
grow
sober
the
instant
he
touched
on
his
favorite
topic
to
my
thinking

ah
you
boys
you
children
little
suckingpigs
to
my
thinking

i
never
thought
a
woman
ugly
in
my
lifethats
been
my
rule
can
you
understand
that
how
could
you
understand
it
youve
milk
in
your
veins
not
blood
youre
not
out
of
your
shells
yet
my
rule
has
been
that
you
can
always
find
something
devilishly
interesting
in
every
woman
that
you
wouldnt
find
in
any
other
only
one
must
know
how
to
find
it
thats
the
point
thats
a
talent
to
my
mind
there
are
no
ugly
women
the
very
fact
that
she
is
a
woman
is
half
the
battle

but
how
could
you
understand
that
even
in
vieilles
filles
even
in
them
you
may
discover
something
that
makes
you
simply
wonder
that
men
have
been
such
fools
as
to
let
them
grow
old
without
noticing
them
barefooted
girls
or
unattractive
ones
you
must
take
by
surprise
didnt
you
know
that
you
must
astound
them
till
theyre
fascinated
upset
ashamed
that
such
a
gentleman
should
fall
in
love
with
such
a
little
slut
its
a
jolly
good
thing
that
there
always
are
and
will
be
masters
and
slaves
in
the
world
so
there
always
will
be
a
little
maid
ofallwork
and
her
master
and
you
know
thats
all
thats
needed
for
happiness
stay

listen
alyosha
i
always
used
to
surprise
your
mother
but
in
a
different
way
i
paid
no
attention
to
her
at
all
but
all
at
once
when
the
minute
came
id
be
all
devotion
to
her
crawl
on
my
knees
kiss
her
feet
and
i
always
alwaysi
remember
it
as
though
it
were
todayreduced
her
to
that
tinkling
quiet
nervous
queer
little
laugh
it
was
peculiar
to
her
i
knew
her
attacks
always
used
to
begin
like
that
the
next
day
she
would
begin
shrieking
hysterically
and
this
little
laugh
was
not
a
sign
of
delight
though
it
made
a
very
good
counterfeit
thats
the
great
thing
to
know
how
to
take
every
one
once
belyavskyhe
was
a
handsome
fellow
and
richused
to
like
to
come
here
and
hang
about
hersuddenly
gave
me
a
slap
in
the
face
in
her
presence
and
shesuch
a
mild
sheepwhy
i
thought
she
would
have
knocked
me
down
for
that
blow
how
she
set
on
me
youre
beaten
beaten
now
she
said
youve
taken
a
blow
from
him
you
have
been
trying
to
sell
me
to
him
she
said
and
how
dared
he
strike
you
in
my
presence
dont
dare
come
near
me
again
never
never
run
at
once
challenge
him
to
a
duel
i
took
her
to
the
monastery
then
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
the
holy
fathers
prayed
her
back
to
reason
but
i
swear
by
god
alyosha
i
never
insulted
the
poor
crazy
girl
only
once
perhaps
in
the
first
year
then
she
was
very
fond
of
praying
she
used
to
keep
the
feasts
of
our
lady
particularly
and
used
to
turn
me
out
of
her
room
then
ill
knock
that
mysticism
out
of
her
thought
i
here
said
i
you
see
your
holy
image
here
it
is
here
i
take
it
down
you
believe
its
miraculous
but
here
ill
spit
on
it
directly
and
nothing
will
happen
to
me
for
it
when
she
saw
it
good
lord
i
thought
she
would
kill
me
but
she
only
jumped
up
wrung
her
hands
then
suddenly
hid
her
face
in
them
began
trembling
all
over
and
fell
on
the
floor

fell
all
of
a
heap
alyosha
alyosha
whats
the
matter
the
old
man
jumped
up
in
alarm
from
the
time
he
had
begun
speaking
about
his
mother
a
change
had
gradually
come
over
alyoshas
face
he
flushed
crimson
his
eyes
glowed
his
lips
quivered
the
old
sot
had
gone
spluttering
on
noticing
nothing
till
the
moment
when
something
very
strange
happened
to
alyosha
precisely
what
he
was
describing
in
the
crazy
woman
was
suddenly
repeated
with
alyosha
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
exactly
as
his
mother
was
said
to
have
done
wrung
his
hands
hid
his
face
in
them
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
shaking
all
over
in
an
hysterical
paroxysm
of
sudden
violent
silent
weeping
his
extraordinary
resemblance

ivan
with
uncontrolled
anger
and
contempt
the
old
man
shrank
before
his
flashing
eyes
but
something
very
strange
had
happened
though
only
for
a
second
it
seemed
really
to
have
escaped
the
old
mans
mind
that
alyoshas
mother
actually
was
the
mother
of

stopped
a
broad
drunken
halfsenseless
grin
overspread
his
face
at
that
moment
a
fearful
noise
and
clamor
was
heard
in
the
hall
there
were
violent
shouts
the
door
was
flung
open
and
dmitri
burst
into
the
room
the
old
man
rushed
to

in
terror

the
sensualists
grigory
and
smerdyakov
ran
into
the
room
after
dmitri
they
had
been
struggling
with
him
in
the
passage
refusing
to
admit
him
acting
on
instructions
given
them
by
fyodor
pavlovitch
some
days
before
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
dmitri
stopped
a
moment
on
entering
the
room
to
look
about
him
grigory
ran
round
the
table
closed
the
double
doors
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
leading
to
the
inner
apartments
and
stood
before
the
closed
doors
stretching
wide
his
arms
prepared
to
defend
the
entrance
so
to
speak
with
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
seeing
this
dmitri
uttered
a
scream
rather
than
a
shout
and
rushed
at
grigory
then
shes
there
shes
hidden
there
out
of
the
way
scoundrel
he
tried
to
pull
grigory
away
but
the
old
servant
pushed
him
back
beside
himself
with
fury
dmitri
struck
out
and
hit
grigory
with
all
his
might
the
old
man
fell
like
a
log
and
dmitri
leaping
over
him
broke
in
the
door
smerdyakov
remained
pale
and
trembling
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
huddling
close
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
shes
here
shouted
dmitri
i
saw
her
turn
towards
the
house
just

but
i
couldnt
catch
her
where

she
where
is
she
that
shout
shes
here
produced
an
indescribable
effect
on
fyodor

all
his
terror
left
him
hold
him
hold
him
he
cried
and
dashed
after
dmitri
meanwhile
grigory
had
got
up
from
the
floor
but
still
seemed
stunned
ivan
and
alyosha
ran
after
their
father
in
the
third
room
something
was
heard
to
fall
on
the
floor
with
a
ringing
crash
it
was
a
large
glass
vasenot
an
expensive
oneon
a
marble
pedestal
which
dmitri
had
upset
as
he
ran
past
it
at
him
shouted
the
old
man
help
ivan
and
alyosha
caught
the
old
man
and
were
forcibly
bringing
him
back
why

outright
ivan
cried
wrathfully
at
his
father
ivan
alyosha
she
must
be
here
grushenkas
here
he
said
he
saw
her
himself
running
he
was
choking
he
was
not
expecting
grushenka
at
the
time
and
the
sudden
news
that
she
was
here
made
him
beside
himself
he
was
trembling
all
over
he
seemed
frantic
but
youve
seen
for
yourself
that
she
hasnt
come
cried
ivan
but
she
may
have
come
by
that
other
entrance
you
know
that
entrance
is
locked
and
you
have
the
key
dmitri
suddenly
reappeared
in
the
drawingroom
he
had
of
course
found
the
other
entrance
locked
and
the
key
actually
was
in
fyodor
pavlovitchs
pocket
the
windows
of
all
the
rooms
were
also
closed
so
grushenka
could
not
have
come
in
anywhere
nor
have
run
out
anywhere
hold
him
shrieked
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
again
hes
been
stealing
money
in
my
bedroom
and
tearing
himself
from
ivan
he
rushed
again
at
dmitri
but
dmitri
threw
up
both
hands
and
suddenly
clutched
the
old
man
by
the
two
tufts
of
hair
that
remained
on
his
temples
tugged
at
them
and
flung
him
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
he
kicked
him
two
or
three
times
with
his
heel
in
the
face
the
old
man
moaned
shrilly
ivan
though
not
so
strong
as
dmitri
threw
his
arms
round
him
and
with
all
his
might
pulled
him
away
alyosha
helped
him
with
his
slender
strength
holding
dmitri
in
front
madman

ivan

ivan
and
grigory
had
raised
the
old
man
and
seated
him
in
an
armchair
his
face
was
covered
with
blood
but
he
was
conscious
and
listened
greedily
to
dmitris
cries
he
was
still
fancying
that
grushenka
really
was
somewhere
in
the
house
dmitri
looked
at
him
with
hatred
as
he
went
out
i
dont
repent
shedding
your
blood
he
cried

and
put
him
to
bed
they
wrapped
a
wet
towel
round
his
head
exhausted
by
the
brandy
by
his
violent
emotion
and
the
blows
he
had
received
he
shut
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
ivan
and
alyosha
went
back
to
the
drawingroom
smerdyakov
removed
the
fragments
of
the
broken
vase
while
grigory
stood
by
the
table
looking
gloomily
at
the
floor
shouldnt

a
wet
bandage
on

head
and

forced
smile

alyosha
why

on
in
the
same
whisper
with
a
malignant
grimace
one
reptile
will
devour
the
other
and
serve
them

to
ache
alyosha
went
to
his
fathers
bedroom
and
sat
by
his
bedside
behind
the
screen
for
about
an
hour
the
old
man
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
and
gazed
for
a
long
while
at
alyosha
evidently
remembering
and
meditating
all
at
once
his
face
betrayed
extraordinary
excitement
alyosha
he
whispered
apprehensively

him
a
little
round
folding
lookingglass
which
stood
on
the
chest
of
drawers
the
old
man
looked
at
himself
in
it
his
nose
was
considerably
swollen
and
on
the
left
side
of
his
forehead
there
was
a
rather
large
crimson
bruise
what

with
joy
as

nothing
more
comforting
could
have
been
said
to
him
in
his
delight
he
seized
alyoshas
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
to
his
heart
tears
positively
glittered
in
his
eyes
that
image
of
the
mother
of

i
was

before
dmitri
has
asked
you
to
go
to
her
and
say
that
hewell
in
facttakes
his
leave
of
her
brother
how
will
all
this
horror
end
between
father
and
dmitri
exclaimed
alyosha
one
cant
tell
for
certain
perhaps
in
nothing
it
may
all
fizzle
out
that
woman
is
a
beast
in
any
case
we
must
keep
the
old
man
indoors
and
not
let
dmitri
in
the
house
brother
let
me
ask
one
thing
more
has
any
man
a
right
to
look
at
other
men
and
decide
which
is
worthy
to
live
why
bring
in
the
question
of
worth
the
matter
is
most
often
decided
in
mens
hearts
on
other
grounds
much
more
natural
and
as
for
rightswho
has
not
the
right
to
wish
not
for
another
mans
death
what
even
if
for
another
mans
death
why
lie
to
oneself
since
all
men
live
so
and
perhaps
cannot
help
living
so
are
you
referring
to
what
i
said
just
nowthat
one
reptile
will
devour
the
other
in
that
case
let
me
ask
you
do
you
think
me
like
dmitri
capable
of
shedding
sops
blood
murdering
him
eh
what
are
you
saying
ivan
such
an
idea
never
crossed
my
mind
i
dont
think
dmitri
is
capable
of
it
either
thanks
if
only
for
that
smiled
ivan
be
sure
i
should
always
defend
him
but
in
my
wishes
i
reserve
myself
full
latitude
in
this
case
goodby
till
tomorrow
dont
condemn
me
and
dont
look
on
me
as
a
villain
he
added
with
a
smile
they
shook
hands
warmly
as
they
had
never
done
before
alyosha
felt
that
his
brother
had
taken
the
first
step
towards
him
and
that
he
had
certainly
done
this
with
some
definite
motive
chapter
x
both
together
alyosha
left
his
fathers
house
feeling
even
more
exhausted
and
dejected
in
spirit
than
when
he
had
entered
it
his
mind
too
seemed
shattered
and
unhinged
while
he
felt
that
he
was
afraid
to
put
together
the
disjointed
fragments
and
form
a
general
idea
from
all
the
agonizing
and
conflicting
experiences
of
the
day
he
felt
something
bordering
upon
despair
which
he
had
never
known
till
then
towering
like
a
mountain
above
all
the
rest
stood
the
fatal
insoluble
question
how
would
things
end
between
his
father
and
his
brother
dmitri
with
this
terrible
woman
now
he
had
himself
been
a
witness
of
it
he
had
been
present
and
seen
them
face
to
face
yet
only
his
brother
dmitri
could
be
made
unhappy
terribly
completely
unhappy
there
was
trouble
awaiting
him
it
appeared
too
that
there
were
other
people
concerned
far
more
so
than
alyosha
could
have
supposed
before
there
was
something
positively
mysterious
in
it
too
ivan
had
made
a
step
towards
him
which
was
what
alyosha
had
been
long
desiring
yet
now
he
felt
for
some
reason
that
he
was
frightened
at
it
and
these
women
strange
to
say
that
morning
he
had
set
out
for
katerina
ivanovnas
in
the
greatest
embarrassment
now
he
felt
nothing
of
the
kind
on
the
contrary
he
was
hastening
there
as
though
expecting
to
find
guidance
from
her
yet
to
give
her
this
message
was
obviously
more
difficult
than
before
the
matter
of
the
three
thousand
was
decided
irrevocably
and
dmitri
feeling
himself
dishonored
and
losing
his
last
hope
might
sink
to
any
depth
he
had
moreover
told
him
to
describe
to
katerina
ivanovna
the
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
with
his
father
it
was
by
now
seven
oclock
and
it
was
getting
dark
as
alyosha
entered
the
very
spacious
and
convenient
house
in
the
high
street
occupied
by
katerina
ivanovna
alyosha
knew
that
she
lived
with
two
aunts
one
of
them
a
woman
of
little
education
was
that
aunt
of
her
halfsister
agafya
ivanovna
who
had
looked
after
her
in
her
fathers
house
when
she
came
from
boardingschool
the
other
aunt
was
a
moscow
lady
of
style
and
consequence
though
in
straitened
circumstances
it
was
said
that
they
both
gave
way
in
everything
to
katerina
ivanovna
and
that
she
only
kept
them
with
her
as
chaperons
katerina
ivanovna
herself
gave
way
to
no
one
but
her
benefactress
the
generals
widow
who
had
been
kept
by
illness
in
moscow
and
to
whom
she
was
obliged
to
write
twice
a
week
a
full
account
of
all
her
doings
when
alyosha
entered
the
hall
and
asked
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
to
him
to
take
his
name
up
it
was
evident
that
they
were
already
aware
of
his
arrival
possibly
he
had
been
noticed
from
the
window
at
least
alyosha
heard
a
noise
caught
the
sound
of
flying
footsteps
and
rustling
skirts
two
or
three
women
perhaps
had
run
out
of
the
room
alyosha
thought
it
strange
that
his
arrival
should
cause
such
excitement
he
was
conducted
however
to
the
drawingroom
at
once
it
was
a
large
room
elegantly
and
amply
furnished
not
at
all
in
provincial
style
there
were
many
sofas
lounges
settees
big
and
little
tables
there
were
pictures
on
the
walls
vases
and
lamps
on
the
tables
masses
of
flowers
and
even
an
aquarium
in
the
window
it
was
twilight
and
rather
dark
alyosha
made
out
a
silk
mantle
thrown
down
on
the
sofa
where
people
had
evidently
just
been
sitting
and
on
a
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
were
two
unfinished
cups
of
chocolate
cakes
a
glass
saucer
with
blue
raisins
and
another
with
sweetmeats
alyosha
saw
that
he
had
interrupted
visitors
and
frowned
but
at
that
instant
the
portire
was
raised
and
with
rapid
hurrying
footsteps
katerina
ivanovna
came
in
holding
out
both
hands
to
alyosha
with
a
radiant
smile
of
delight
at
the
same
instant
a
servant
brought
in
two
lighted
candles
and
set
them
on
the
table
thank
god
at
last
you
have
come
too
ive
been
simply
praying
for
you
all
day
sit
down
alyosha
had
been
struck
by
katerina
ivanovnas
beauty
when
three
weeks
before
dmitri
had
first
brought
him
at
katerina
ivanovnas
special
request
to
be
introduced
to
her
there
had
been
no
conversation
between
them
at
that
interview
however
supposing
alyosha
to
be
very
shy
katerina
ivanovna
had
talked
all
the
time
to
dmitri
to
spare
him
alyosha
had
been
silent
but
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
very
clearly
he
was
struck
by
the
imperiousness
proud
ease
and
selfconfidence
of
the
haughty
girl
and
all
that
was
certain
alyosha
felt
that
he
was
not
exaggerating
it
he
thought
her
great
glowing
black
eyes
were
very
fine
especially
with
her
pale
even
rather
sallow
longish
face
but
in
those
eyes
and
in
the
lines
of
her
exquisite
lips
there
was
something
with
which
his
brother
might
well
be
passionately
in
love
but
which
perhaps
could
not
be
loved
for
long
he
expressed
this
thought
almost
plainly
to
dmitri
when
after
the
visit
his
brother
besought
and
insisted
that
he
should
not
conceal
his
impressions
on
seeing
his
betrothed
youll
be
happy
with
her
but
perhapsnot
tranquilly
happy
quite
so
brother
such
people
remain
always
the
same
they
dont
yield
to
fate
so
you
think
i
shant
love
her
for
ever
no
perhaps
you
will
love
her
for
ever
but
perhaps
you
wont
always
be
happy
with
her
alyosha
had
given
his
opinion
at
the
time
blushing
and
angry
with
himself
for
having
yielded
to
his
brothers
entreaties
and
put
such
foolish
ideas
into
words
for
his
opinion
had
struck
him
as
awfully
foolish
immediately
after
he
had
uttered
it
he
felt
ashamed
too
of
having
given
so
confident
an
opinion
about
a
woman
it
was
with
the
more
amazement
that
he
felt
now
at
the
first
glance
at
katerina
ivanovna
as
she
ran
in
to
him
that
he
had
perhaps
been
utterly
mistaken
this
time
her
face
was
beaming
with
spontaneous
goodnatured
kindliness
and
direct
warmhearted
sincerity
the
pride
and
haughtiness
which
had
struck
alyosha
so
much
before
was
only
betrayed
now
in
a
frank
generous
energy
and
a
sort
of
bright
strong
faith
in
herself
alyosha
realized
at
the
first
glance
at
the
first
word
that
all
the
tragedy
of
her
position
in
relation
to
the
man
she
loved
so
dearly
was
no
secret
to
her
that
she
perhaps
already
knew
everything
positively
everything
and
yet
in
spite
of
that
there
was
such
brightness
in
her
face
such
faith
in
the
future
alyosha
felt
at
once
that
he
had
gravely
wronged
her
in
his
thoughts
he
was
conquered
and
captivated
immediately
besides
all
this
he
noticed
at
her
first
words
that
she
was
in
great
excitement
an
excitement
perhaps
quite
exceptional
and
almost
approaching
ecstasy
i
was
so
eager
to
see
you
because
i
can
learn
from
you
the
whole
truthfrom
you
and
no
one
else
i
have
come
muttered
alyosha
confusedly
ihe
sent
me
ah
he
sent
you
i
foresaw
that
now
i
know
everythingeverything
cried
katerina
ivanovna
her
eyes
flashing
wait
a
moment
alexey
fyodorovitch
ill
tell
you
why
ive
been
so
longing
to
see
you
you
see
i
know
perhaps
far
more
than
you
do
yourself
and
theres
no
need
for
you
to
tell
me
anything
ill
tell
you
what
i
want
from
you
i
want
to
know
your
own
last
impression
of
him
i
want
you
to
tell
me
most
directly
plainly
coarsely
even
oh
as
coarsely
as
you
like
what
you
thought
of
him
just
now
and
of
his
position
after
your
meeting
with
him
today
that
will
perhaps
be
better
than
if
i
had
a
personal
explanation
with
him
as
he
does
not
want
to
come
to
me
do
you
understand
what
i
want
from
you
now
tell
me
simply
tell
me
every
word
of
the
message
he
sent
you
with
i
knew
he
would
send
you
he
told
me
to
give
you
his
complimentsand
to
say
that
he
would
never
come
againbut
to
give
you
his
compliments
his
compliments
was
that
what
he
saidhis
own
expression
yes
accidentally
perhaps
he
made
a
mistake
in
the
word
perhaps
he
did
not
use
the
right
word
no
he
told
me
precisely
to
repeat
that
word
he
begged
me
two
or
three
times
not
to
forget
to
say
so
katerina
ivanovna
flushed
hotly
help
me
now
alexey
fyodorovitch
now
i
really
need
your
help
ill
tell
you
what
i
think
and
you
must
simply
say
whether
its
right
or
not
listen
if
he
had
sent
me
his
compliments
in
passing
without
insisting
on
your
repeating
the
words
without
emphasizing
them
that
would
be
the
end
of
everything
but
if
he
particularly
insisted
on
those
words
if
he
particularly
told
you
not
to
forget
to
repeat
them
to
me
then
perhaps
he
was
in
excitement
beside
himself
he
had
made
his
decision
and
was
frightened
at
it
he
wasnt
walking
away
from
me
with
a
resolute
step
but
leaping
headlong
the
emphasis
on
that
phrase
may
have
been
simply
bravado
yes
yes
cried
alyosha
warmly
i
believe
that
is
it
and
if
so
hes
not
altogether
lost
i
can
still
save
him
stay
did
he
not
tell
you
anything
about
moneyabout
three
thousand
roubles
he
did
speak
about
it
and
its
that
more
than
anything
thats
crushing
him
he
said
he
had
lost
his
honor
and
that
nothing
matters
now
alyosha
answered
warmly
feeling
a
rush
of
hope
in
his
heart
and
believing
that
there
really
might
be
a
way
of
escape
and
salvation
for
his
brother
but
do
you
know
about
the
money
he
added
and
suddenly
broke
off
ive
known
of
it
a
long
time
i
telegraphed
to
moscow
to
inquire
and
heard
long
ago
that
the
money
had
not
arrived
he
hadnt
sent
the
money
but
i
said
nothing
last
week
i
learnt
that
he
was
still
in
need
of
money
my
only
object
in
all
this
was
that
he
should
know
to
whom
to
turn
and
who
was
his
true
friend
no
he
wont
recognize
that
i
am
his
truest
friend
he
wont
know
me
and
looks
on
me
merely
as
a
woman
ive
been
tormented
all
the
week
trying
to
think
how
to
prevent
him
from
being
ashamed
to
face
me
because
he
spent
that
three
thousand
let
him
feel
ashamed
of
himself
let
him
be
ashamed
of
other
peoples
knowing
but
not
of
my
knowing
he
can
tell
god
everything
without
shame
why
is
it
he
still
does
not
understand
how
much
i
am
ready
to
bear
for
his
sake
why
why
doesnt
he
know
me
how
dare
he
not
know
me
after
all
that
has
happened
i
want
to
save
him
for
ever
let
him
forget
me
as
his
betrothed
and
here
he
fears
that
he
is
dishonored
in
my
eyes
why
he
wasnt
afraid
to
be
open
with
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
is
it
that
i
dont
deserve
the
same
the
last
words
she
uttered
in
tears
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
i
must
tell
you
alyosha
began
his
voice
trembling
too
what
happened
just
now
between
him
and
my
father
and
he
described
the
whole
scene
how
dmitri
had
sent
him
to
get
the
money
how
he
had
broken
in
knocked
his
father
down
and
after
that
had
again
specially
and
emphatically
begged
him
to
take
his
compliments
and
farewell
he
went
to
that
woman
alyosha
added
softly
and
do
you
suppose
that
i
cant
put
up
with
that
woman
does
he
think
i
cant
but
he
wont
marry
her
she
suddenly
laughed
nervously
could
such
a
passion
last
for
ever
in
a
karamazov
its
passion
not
love
he
wont
marry
her
because
she
wont
marry
him
again
katerina
ivanovna
laughed
strangely
he
may
marry
her
said
alyosha
mournfully
looking
down
he
wont
marry
her
i
tell
you
that
girl
is
an
angel
do
you
know
that
do
you
know
that
katerina
ivanovna
exclaimed
suddenly
with
extraordinary
warmth
she
is
one
of
the
most
fantastic
of
fantastic
creatures
i
know
how
bewitching
she
is
but
i
know
too
that
she
is
kind
firm
and
noble
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
alexey
fyodorovitch
perhaps
you
are
wondering
at
my
words
perhaps
you
dont
believe
me
agrafena
alexandrovna
my
angel
she
cried
suddenly
to
some
one
peeping
into
the
next
room
come
in
to
us
this
is
a
friend
this
is
alyosha
he
knows
all
about
our
affairs
show
yourself
to
him
ive
only
been
waiting
behind
the
curtain
for
you
to
call
me
said
a
soft
one
might
even
say
sugary
feminine
voice
the
portire
was
raised
and
grushenka
herself
smiling
and
beaming
came
up
to
the
table
a
violent
revulsion
passed
over
alyosha
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
and
could
not
take
them
off
here
she
was
that
awful
woman
the
beast
as
ivan
had
called
her
half
an
hour
before
and
yet
one
would
have
thought
the
creature
standing
before
him
most
simple
and
ordinary
a
goodnatured
kind
woman
handsome
certainly
but
so
like
other
handsome
ordinary
women
it
is
true
she
was
very
very
goodlooking
with
that
russian
beauty
so
passionately
loved
by
many
men
she
was
a
rather
tall
woman
though
a
little
shorter
than
katerina
ivanovna
who
was
exceptionally
tall
she
had
a
full
figure
with
soft
as
it
were
noiseless
movements
softened
to
a
peculiar
oversweetness
like
her
voice
she
moved
not
like
katerina
ivanovna
with
a
vigorous
bold
step
but
noiselessly
her
feet
made
absolutely
no
sound
on
the
floor
she
sank
softly
into
a
low
chair
softly
rustling
her
sumptuous
black
silk
dress
and
delicately
nestling
her
milkwhite
neck
and
broad
shoulders
in
a
costly
cashmere
shawl
she
was
twentytwo
years
old
and
her
face
looked
exactly
that
age
she
was
very
white
in
the
face
with
a
pale
pink
tint
on
her
cheeks
the
modeling
of
her
face
might
be
said
to
be
too
broad
and
the
lower
jaw
was
set
a
trifle
forward
her
upper
lip
was
thin
but
the
slightly
prominent
lower
lip
was
at
least
twice
as
full
and
looked
pouting
but
her
magnificent
abundant
dark
brown
hair
her
sablecolored
eyebrows
and
charming
grayblue
eyes
with
their
long
lashes
would
have
made
the
most
indifferent
person
meeting
her
casually
in
a
crowd
in
the
street
stop
at
the
sight
of
her
face
and
remember
it
long
after
what
struck
alyosha
most
in
that
face
was
its
expression
of
childlike
good
nature
there
was
a
childlike
look
in
her
eyes
a
look
of
childish
delight
she
came
up
to
the
table
beaming
with
delight
and
seeming
to
expect
something
with
childish
impatient
and
confiding
curiosity
the
light
in
her
eyes
gladdened
the
soulalyosha
felt
that
there
was
something
else
in
her
which
he
could
not
understand
or
would
not
have
been
able
to
define
and
which
yet
perhaps
unconsciously
affected
him
it
was
that
softness
that
voluptuousness
of
her
bodily
movements
that
catlike
noiselessness
yet
it
was
a
vigorous
ample
body
under
the
shawl
could
be
seen
full
broad
shoulders
a
high
still
quite
girlish
bosom
her
figure
suggested
the
lines
of
the
venus
of
milo
though
already
in
somewhat
exaggerated
proportions
that
could
be
divined
connoisseurs
of
russian
beauty
could
have
foretold
with
certainty
that
this
fresh
still
youthful
beauty
would
lose
its
harmony
by
the
age
of
thirty
would
spread
that
the
face
would
become
puffy
and
that
wrinkles
would
very
soon
appear
upon
her
forehead
and
round
the
eyes
the
complexion
would
grow
coarse
and
red
perhapsin
fact
that
it
was
the
beauty
of
the
moment
the
fleeting
beauty
which
is
so
often
met
with
in
russian
women
alyosha
of
course
did
not
think
of
this
but
though
he
was
fascinated
yet
he
wondered
with
an
unpleasant
sensation
and
as
it
were
regretfully
why
she
drawled
in
that
way
and
could
not
speak
naturally
she
did
so
evidently
feeling
there
was
a
charm
in
the
exaggerated
honeyed
modulation
of
the
syllables
it
was
of
course
only
a
bad
underbred
habit
that
showed
bad
education
and
a
false
idea
of
good
manners
and
yet
this
intonation
and
manner
of
speaking
impressed
alyosha
as
almost
incredibly
incongruous
with
the
childishly
simple
and
happy
expression
of
her
face
the
soft
babyish
joy
in
her
eyes
katerina
ivanovna
at
once
made
her
sit
down
in
an
arm
chair
facing
alyosha
and
ecstatically
kissed
her
several
times
on
her
smiling
lips
she
seemed
quite
in
love
with
her
this
is
the
first
time
weve
met
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
said
rapturously
i
wanted
to
know
her
to
see
her
i
wanted
to
go
to
her
but
id
no
sooner
expressed
the
wish
than
she
came
to
me
i
knew
we
should
settle
everything
togethereverything
my
heart
told
me
soi
was
begged
not
to
take
the
step
but
i
foresaw
it
would
be
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
i
was
not
mistaken
grushenka
has
explained
everything
to
me
told
me
all
she
means
to
do
she
flew
here
like
an
angel
of
goodness
and
brought
us
peace
and
joy
you
did
not
disdain
me
sweet
excellent
young
lady
drawled
grushenka
in
her
singsong
voice
still
with
the
same
charming
smile
of
delight
dont
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
you
sorceress
you
witch
disdain
you
here
i
must
kiss
your
lower
lip
once
more
it
looks
as
though
it
were
swollen
and
now
it
will
be
more
so
and
more
and
more
look
how
she
laughs
alexey
fyodorovitch
it
does
ones
heart
good
to
see
the
angel
alyosha
flushed
and
faint
imperceptible
shivers
kept
running
down
him
you
make
so
much
of
me
dear
young
lady
and
perhaps
i
am
not
at
all
worthy
of
your
kindness
not
worthy
shes
not
worthy
of
it
katerina
ivanovna
cried
again
with
the
same
warmth
you
know
alexey
fyodorovitch
were
fanciful
were
selfwilled
but
proudest
of
the
proud
in
our
little
heart
were
noble
were
generous
alexey
fyodorovitch
let
me
tell
you
we
have
only
been
unfortunate
we
were
too
ready
to
make
every
sacrifice
for
an
unworthy
perhaps
or
fickle
man
there
was
one
manone
an
officer
too
we
loved
him
we
sacrificed
everything
to
him
that
was
long
ago
five
years
ago
and
he
has
forgotten
us
he
has
married
now
he
is
a
widower
he
has
written
he
is
coming
here
and
do
you
know
weve
loved
him
none
but
him
all
this
time
and
weve
loved
him
all
our
life
he
will
come
and
grushenka
will
be
happy
again
for
the
last
five
years
shes
been
wretched
but
who
can
reproach
her
who
can
boast
of
her
favor
only
that
bedridden
old
merchant
but
he
is
more
like
her
father
her
friend
her
protector
he
found
her
then
in
despair
in
agony
deserted
by
the
man
she
loved
she
was
ready
to
drown
herself
then
but
the
old
merchant
saved
hersaved
her
you
defend
me
very
kindly
dear
young
lady
you
are
in
a
great
hurry
about
everything
grushenka
drawled
again
defend
you
is
it
for
me
to
defend
you
should
i
dare
to
defend
you
grushenka
angel
give
me
your
hand
look
at
that
charming
soft
little
hand
alexey
fyodorovitch
look
at
it
it
has
brought
me
happiness
and
has
lifted
me
up
and
im
going
to
kiss
it
outside
and
inside
here
here
here
and
three
times
she
kissed
the
certainly
charming
though
rather
fat
hand
of
grushenka
in
a
sort
of
rapture
she
held
out
her
hand
with
a
charming
musical
nervous
little
laugh
watched
the
sweet
young
lady
and
obviously
liked
having
her
hand
kissed
perhaps
theres
rather
too
much
rapture
thought
alyosha
he
blushed
he
felt
a
peculiar
uneasiness
at
heart
the
whole
time
you
wont
make
me
blush
dear
young
lady
kissing
my
hand
like
this
before
alexey
fyodorovitch
do
you
think
i
meant
to
make
you
blush
said
katerina
ivanovna
somewhat
surprised
ah
my
dear
how
little
you
understand
me
yes
and
you
too
perhaps
quite
misunderstand
me
dear
young
lady
maybe
im
not
so
good
as
i
seem
to
you
ive
a
bad
heart
i
will
have
my
own
way
i
fascinated
poor
dmitri
fyodorovitch
that
day
simply
for
fun
but
now
youll
save
him
youve
given
me
your
word
youll
explain
it
all
to
him
youll
break
to
him
that
you
have
long
loved
another
man
who
is
now
offering
you
his
hand
oh
no
i
didnt
give
you
my
word
to
do
that
it
was
you
kept
talking
about
that
i
didnt
give
you
my
word
then
i
didnt
quite
understand
you
said
katerina
ivanovna
slowly
turning
a
little
pale
you
promised
oh
no
angel
lady
ive
promised
nothing
grushenka
interrupted
softly
and
evenly
still
with
the
same
gay
and
simple
expression
you
see
at
once
dear
young
lady
what
a
willful
wretch
i
am
compared
with
you
if
i
want
to
do
a
thing
i
do
it
i
may
have
made
you
some
promise
just
now
but
now
again
im
thinking
i
may
take
to
mitya
again
i
liked
him
very
much
onceliked
him
for
almost
a
whole
hour
now
maybe
i
shall
go
and
tell
him
to
stay
with
me
from
this
day
forward
you
see
im
so
changeable
just
now
you
saidsomething
quite
different
katerina
ivanovna
whispered
faintly
ah
just
now
but
you
know
im
such
a
softhearted
silly
creature
only
think
what
hes
gone
through
on
my
account
what
if
when
i
go
home
i
feel
sorry
for
him
what
then
i
never
expected
ah
young
lady
how
good
and
generous
you
are
compared
with
me
now
perhaps
you
wont
care
for
a
silly
creature
like
me
now
you
know
my
character
give
me
your
sweet
little
hand
angelic
lady
she
said
tenderly
and
with
a
sort
of
reverence
took
katerina
ivanovnas
hand
here
dear
young
lady
ill
take
your
hand
and
kiss
it
as
you
did
mine
you
kissed
mine
three
times
but
i
ought
to
kiss
yours
three
hundred
times
to
be
even
with
you
well
but
let
that
pass
and
then
it
shall
be
as
god
wills
perhaps
i
shall
be
your
slave
entirely
and
want
to
do
your
bidding
like
a
slave
let
it
be
as
god
wills
without
any
agreements
and
promises
what
a
sweet
handwhat
a
sweet
hand
you
have
you
sweet
young
lady
you
incredible
beauty
she
slowly
raised
the
hands
to
her
lips
with
the
strange
object
indeed
of
being
even
with
her
in
kisses
katerina
ivanovna
did
not
take
her
hand
away
she
listened
with
timid
hope
to
the
last
words
though
grushenkas
promise
to
do
her
bidding
like
a
slave
was
very
strangely
expressed
she
looked
intently
into
her
eyes
she
still
saw
in
those
eyes
the
same
simplehearted
confiding
expression
the
same
bright
gayety
shes
perhaps
too
nave
thought
katerina
ivanovna
with
a
gleam
of
hope
grushenka
meanwhile
seemed
enthusiastic
over
the
sweet
hand
she
raised
it
deliberately
to
her
lips
but
she
held
it
for
two
or
three
minutes
near
her
lips
as
though
reconsidering
something
do
you
know
angel
lady
she
suddenly
drawled
in
an
even
more
soft
and
sugary
voice
do
you
know
after
all
i
think
i
wont
kiss
your
hand
and
she
laughed
a
little
merry
laugh
as
you
please
whats
the
matter
with
you
said
katerina
ivanovna
starting
suddenly
so
that
you
may
be
left
to
remember
that
you
kissed
my
hand
but
i
didnt
kiss
yours
there
was
a
sudden
gleam
in
her
eyes
she
looked
with
awful
intentness
at
katerina
ivanovna
insolent
creature
cried
katerina
ivanovna
as
though
suddenly
grasping
something
she
flushed
all
over
and
leapt
up
from
her
seat
grushenka
too
got
up
but
without
haste
so
i
shall
tell
mitya
how
you
kissed
my
hand
but
i
didnt
kiss
yours
at
all
and
how
he
will
laugh
vile
slut
go
away

katerina
ivanovna
every
feature
was
working
in
her
utterly
distorted
face
for
sale
indeed
you
used
to
visit
gentlemen
in
the
dusk
for
money
once
you
brought
your
beauty
for

you
see
i
know
katerina
ivanovna
shrieked
and
would
have
rushed
at
her
but
alyosha
held
her
with
all
his
strength
not
a
step
not
a
word
dont
speak
dont
answer
her
shell
go

instant
katerina
ivanovnas
two
aunts
ran
in
at
her
cry
and
with
them
a
maidservant
all
hurried
to
her
i

grushenka
taking
up
her
mantle
from
the
sofa

scene
for

afterwards
alyosha
turned
away
wringing
his
hands
grushenka
ran
out
of
the
house
laughing
musically
katerina
ivanovna
went
into
a
fit
of
hysterics
she
sobbed
and
was
shaken
with
convulsions
every
one
fussed
round
her
i
warned
you
said
the
elder
of
her
aunts
i
tried
to
prevent
your
doing
this
youre
too
impulsive
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing
you
dont
know
these
creatures
and
they
say

worse
than
any
of
them
you

too
selfwilled

a
tigress

katerina
ivanovna

fyodorovitch

beaten
herbeaten
her
she
could
not
control
herself
before
alyosha
perhaps
she
did
not
care
to
indeed
she
ought
to
be
flogged
in
public
on
a
scaffold
alyosha
withdrew
towards
the
door
but
my
god
cried
katerina
ivanovna
clasping
her
hands
he
he
he
could
be
so
dishonorable
so
inhuman
why

told
that
creature
what

on
that
fatal
accursed
day
you
brought
your
beauty
for
sale
dear
young
lady
she
knows

your
brothers
a
scoundrel
alexey
fyodorovitch
alyosha
wanted
to
say
something
but
he
couldnt
find
a
word
his
heart
ached
go

now
alyosha
walked
out
into
the
street
reeling
he
could
have
wept
as
she
did
suddenly
he
was
overtaken
by
the
maid
the
young
lady
forgot
to
give
you
this
letter
from
madame
hohlakov
its
been
left
with
us
since
dinnertime
alyosha
took
the
little
pink
envelope
mechanically
and
put
it
almost
unconsciously
into
his
pocket
chapter
xi
another
reputation
ruined
it
was
not
much
more
than
threequarters
of
a
mile
from
the
town
to
the
monastery
alyosha
walked
quickly
along
the
road
at
that
hour
deserted
it
was
almost
night
and
too
dark
to
see
anything
clearly
at
thirty
paces
ahead
there
were
crossroads
halfway
a
figure
came
into
sight
under
a
solitary
willow
at
the
crossroads
as
soon
as
alyosha
reached
the
cross
roads
the
figure
moved
out
and
rushed
at
him
shouting
savagely
your
money
or
your
life
so
its
you
mitya
cried
alyosha
in
surprise
violently
startled
however
ha
ha
ha
you
didnt
expect
me
i
wondered
where
to
wait
for
you
by
her
house
there
are
three
ways
from
it
and
i
might
have
missed
you
at
last
i
thought
of
waiting
here
for
you
had
to
pass
here
theres
no
other
way
to
the
monastery
come
tell
me
the
truth
crush
me
like
a
beetle
but
whats
the
matter
nothing
brotherits
the
fright
you
gave
me
oh
dmitri
fathers
blood
just
now
alyosha
began
to
cry
he
had
been
on
the
verge
of
tears
for
a
long
time
and
now
something
seemed
to
snap
in
his
soul
you
almost
killed
himcursed
himand
nowhereyoure
making
jokesyour
money
or
your
life

well
what
of
that
its
not
seemlyis
that
it
not
suitable
in
my
position
noi
only
stay
look
at
the
night
you
see
what
a
dark
night
what
clouds
what
a
wind
has
risen
i
hid
here
under
the
willow
waiting
for
you
and
as
gods
above
i
suddenly
thought
why
go
on
in
misery
any
longer
what
is
there
to
wait
for
here
i
have
a
willow
a
handkerchief
a
shirt
i
can
twist
them
into
a
rope
in
a
minute
and
braces
besides
and
why
go
on
burdening
the
earth
dishonoring
it
with
my
vile
presence
and
then
i
heard
you
comingheavens
it
was
as
though
something
flew
down
to
me
suddenly
so
there
is
a
man
then
whom
i
love
here
he
is
that
man
my
dear
little
brother
whom
i
love
more
than
any
one
in
the
world
the
only
one
i
love
in
the
world
and
i
loved
you
so
much
so
much
at
that
moment
that
i
thought
ill
fall
on
his
neck
at
once
then
a
stupid
idea
struck
me
to
have
a
joke
with
you
and
scare
you
i
shouted
like
a
fool
your
money

my
fooleryit
was
only
nonsense
and
theres
nothing
unseemly
in
my
soul
damn
it
all
tell
me
whats
happened
what
did
she
say
strike
me
crush

dont
spare
me
was
she
furious
no
not
that
there
was
nothing
like
that
mitya
therei
found
them
both
there
both
whom
grushenka
at
katerina
ivanovnas
dmitri
was
struck
dumb
impossible
he
cried
youre
raving
grushenka
with
her
alyosha
described
all
that
had
happened
from
the
moment
he
went
in
to
katerina
ivanovnas
he
was
ten
minutes
telling
his
story
he
cant
be
said
to
have
told
it
fluently
and
consecutively
but
he
seemed
to
make
it
clear
not
omitting
any
word
or
action
of
significance
and
vividly
describing
often
in
one
word
his
own
sensations
dmitri
listened
in
silence
gazing
at
him
with
a
terrible
fixed
stare
but
it
was
clear
to
alyosha
that
he
understood
it
all
and
had
grasped
every
point
but
as
the
story
went
on
his
face
became
not
merely
gloomy
but
menacing
he
scowled
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
his
fixed
stare
became
still
more
rigid
more
concentrated
more
terrible
when
suddenly
with
incredible
rapidity
his
wrathful
savage
face
changed
his
tightly
compressed
lips
parted
and
dmitri
fyodorovitch
broke
into
uncontrolled
spontaneous
laughter
he
literally
shook
with
laughter
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
speak
so
she
wouldnt
kiss
her
hand
so
she
didnt
kiss
it
so
she
ran
away
he
kept
exclaiming
with
hysterical
delight
insolent
delight
it
might
have
been
called
if
it
had
not
been
so
spontaneous
so
the
other
one
called
her
tigress
and
a
tigress
she
is
so
she
ought
to
be
flogged
on
a
scaffold
yes
yes
so
she
ought
thats
just
what
i
think
she
ought
to
have
been
long
ago
its
like
this
brother
let
her
be
punished
but
i
must
get
better
first
i
understand
the
queen
of
impudence
thats
her
all
over
you
saw
her
all
over
in
that
handkissing
the
shedevil
shes
magnificent
in
her
own
line
so
she
ran
home
ill
goahill
run
to
her
alyosha
dont
blame
me
i
agree
that
hanging
is
too
good
for
her
but
katerina
ivanovna
exclaimed
alyosha
sorrowfully
i
see
her
too
i
see
right
through
her
as
ive
never
done
before
its
a
regular
discovery
of
the
four
continents
of
the
world
that
is
of
the
five
what
a
thing
to
do
thats
just
like
katya
who
was
not
afraid
to
face
a
coarse
unmannerly
officer
and
risk
a
deadly
insult
on
a
generous
impulse
to
save
her
father
but
the
pride
the
recklessness
the
defiance
of
fate
the
unbounded
defiance
you
say
that
aunt
tried
to
stop
her
that
aunt
you
know
is
overbearing
herself
shes
the
sister
of
the
generals
widow
in
moscow
and
even
more
stuckup
than
she
but
her
husband
was
caught
stealing
government
money
he
lost
everything
his
estate
and
all
and
the
proud
wife
had
to
lower
her
colors
and
hasnt
raised
them
since
so
she
tried
to
prevent
katya
but
she
wouldnt
listen
to
her
she
thinks
she
can
overcome
everything
that
everything
will
give
way
to
her
she
thought
she
could
bewitch
grushenka
if
she
liked
and
she
believed
it
herself
she
plays
a
part
to
herself
and
whose
fault
is
it
do
you
think
she
kissed
grushenkas
hand
first
on
purpose
with
a
motive
no
she
really
was
fascinated
by
grushenka
thats
to
say
not
by
grushenka
but
by
her
own
dream
her
own
delusionbecause
it
was
her
dream
her
delusion
alyosha
darling
how
did
you
escape
from
them
those
women
did
you
pick
up
your
cassock
and
run
ha
ha
ha
brother
you
dont
seem
to
have
noticed
how
youve
insulted
katerina
ivanovna
by
telling
grushenka
about
that
day
and
she
flung
it
in
her
face
just
now
that
she
had
gone
to
gentlemen
in
secret
to
sell
her
beauty
brother
what
could
be
worse
than
that
insult
what
worried
alyosha
more
than
anything
was
that
incredible
as
it
seemed
his
brother
appeared
pleased
at
katerina
ivanovnas
humiliation
bah
dmitri
frowned
fiercely
and
struck
his
forehead
with
his
hand
he
only
now
realized
it
though
alyosha
had
just
told
him
of
the
insult
and
katerina
ivanovnas
cry
your
brother
is
a
scoundrel
yes
perhaps
i
really
did
tell
grushenka
about
that
fatal
day
as
katya
calls
it
yes
i
did
tell
her
i
remember
it
was
that
time
at
mokroe
i
was
drunk
the
gypsies
were
singing
but
i
was
sobbing
i
was
sobbing
then
kneeling
and
praying
to
katyas
image
and
grushenka
understood
it
she
understood
it
all
then
i
remember
she
cried
herself
damn
it
all
but
its
bound
to
be
so
now
then
she
cried
but
now
the
dagger
in
the
heart
thats
how
women
are
he
looked
down
and
sank
into
thought
yes
i
am
a
scoundrel
a
thorough
scoundrel
he
said
suddenly
in
a
gloomy
voice
it
doesnt
matter
whether
i
cried
or
not
im
a
scoundrel
tell
her
i
accept

not
amusing

your
way
and
i

and
i
dont
want
to

he
warmly
pressed
alyoshas
hand
and
still
looking
down
without
raising
his
head
as
though
tearing
himself
away
turned
rapidly
towards
the
town
alyosha
looked
after
him
unable
to
believe
he
would
go
away
so
abruptly
stay
alexey
one
more
confession
to
you
alone
cried
dmitri
suddenly
turning
back
look
at
me
look
at
me
well
you
see
here
heretheres
terrible
disgrace
in
store
for
me
as
he
said
here
dmitri
struck
his
chest
with
his
fist
with
a
strange
air
as
though
the
dishonor
lay
precisely
on
his
chest
in
some
spot
in
a
pocket
perhaps
or
hanging
round
his
neck
you
know
me
now
a
scoundrel
an
avowed
scoundrel
but
let
me
tell
you
that
ive
never
done
anything
before
and
never
shall
again
anything
that
can
compare
in
baseness
with
the
dishonor
which
i
bear
now
at
this
very
minute
on
my
breast
here
here
which
will
come
to
pass
though
im
perfectly
free
to
stop
it
i
can
stop
it
or
carry
it
through
note
that
well
let
me
tell
you
i
shall
carry
it
through
i
shant
stop
it
i
told
you
everything
just
now
but
i
didnt
tell
you
this
because
even
i
had
not
brass
enough
for
it
i
can
still
pull
up
if
i
do
i
can
give
back
the
full
half
of
my
lost
honor
tomorrow
but
i
shant
pull
up
i
shall
carry
out
my
base
plan
and
you
can
bear
witness
that
i
told
you
so
beforehand
darkness
and
destruction
no
need
to
explain
youll
find
out
in
due
time
the
filthy
backalley
and
the
she
devil
goodby
dont
pray
for
me
im
not
worth
it
and
theres
no
need
no
need
at
all
i
dont
need
it
away
and
he
suddenly
retreated
this
time
finally
alyosha
went
towards
the
monastery
what
i
shall
never
see
him
again
what
is
he
saying
he
wondered
wildly
why
i
shall
certainly
see
him
tomorrow
i
shall
look
him
up
i
shall
make
a
point
of
it
what
does
he
mean
he
went
round
the
monastery
and
crossed
the
pinewood
to
the
hermitage
the
door
was
opened
to
him
though
no
one
was
admitted
at
that
hour
there
was
a
tremor
in
his
heart
as
he
went
into
father
zossimas
cell
why
why
had
he
gone
forth
why
had
he
sent
him
into
the
world
here
was
peace
here
was
holiness
but
there
was
confusion
there
was
darkness
in
which
one
lost
ones
way
and
went
astray
at
once
in
the
cell
he
found
the
novice
porfiry
and
father
passy
who
came
every
hour
to
inquire
after
father
zossima
alyosha
learnt
with
alarm
that
he
was
getting
worse
and
worse
even
his
usual
discourse
with
the
brothers
could
not
take
place
that
day
as
a
rule
every
evening
after
service
the
monks
flocked
into
father
zossimas
cell
and
all
confessed
aloud
their
sins
of
the
day
their
sinful
thoughts
and
temptations
even
their
disputes
if
there
had
been
any
some
confessed
kneeling
the
elder
absolved
reconciled
exhorted
imposed
penance
blessed
and
dismissed
them
it
was
against
this
general
confession
that
the
opponents
of
elders
protested
maintaining
that
it
was
a
profanation
of
the
sacrament
of
confession
almost
a
sacrilege
though
this
was
quite
a
different
thing
they
even
represented
to
the
diocesan
authorities
that
such
confessions
attained
no
good
object
but
actually
to
a
large
extent
led
to
sin
and
temptation
many
of
the
brothers
disliked
going
to
the
elder
and
went
against
their
own
will
because
every
one
went
and
for
fear
they
should
be
accused
of
pride
and
rebellious
ideas
people
said
that
some
of
the
monks
agreed
beforehand
saying
ill
confess
i
lost
my
temper
with
you
this
morning
and
you
confirm
it
simply
in
order
to
have
something
to
say
alyosha
knew
that
this
actually
happened
sometimes
he
knew
too
that
there
were
among
the
monks
some
who
deeply
resented
the
fact
that
letters
from
relations
were
habitually
taken
to
the
elder
to
be
opened
and
read
by
him
before
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
it
was
assumed
of
course
that
all
this
was
done
freely
and
in
good
faith
by
way
of
voluntary
submission
and
salutary
guidance
but
in
fact
there
was
sometimes
no
little
insincerity
and
much
that
was
false
and
strained
in
this
practice
yet
the
older
and
more
experienced
of
the
monks
adhered
to
their
opinion
arguing
that
for
those
who
have
come
within
these
walls
sincerely
seeking
salvation
such
obedience
and
sacrifice
will
certainly
be
salutary
and
of
great
benefit
those
on
the
other
hand
who
find
it
irksome
and
repine
are
no
true
monks
and
have
made
a
mistake
in
entering
the
monasterytheir
proper
place
is
in
the
world
even
in
the
temple
one
cannot
be
safe
from
sin
and
the
devil
so
it
was
no
good
taking
it
too
much
into
account
he
is
weaker
a
drowsiness
has
come
over
him
father
passy
whispered
to
alyosha
as
he
blessed
him
its
difficult
to
rouse
him
and
he
must
not
be
roused
he
waked
up
for
five
minutes
sent
his
blessing
to
the
brothers
and
begged
their
prayers
for
him
at
night
he
intends
to
take
the
sacrament
again
in
the
morning
he
remembered
you
alexey
he
asked
whether
you
had
gone
away
and
was
told
that
you
were
in
the
town
i
blessed
him
for
that
work
he
said
his
place
is
there
not
here
for
awhile
those
were
his
words
about
you
he
remembered
you
lovingly
with
anxiety
do
you
understand
how
he
honored
you
but
how
is
it
that
he
has
decided
that
you
shall
spend
some
time
in
the
world
he
must
have
foreseen
something
in
your
destiny
understand
alexey
that
if
you
return
to
the
world
it
must
be
to
do
the
duty
laid
upon
you
by
your
elder
and
not
for
frivolous
vanity
and
worldly
pleasures
father
passy
went
out
alyosha
had
no
doubt
that
father
zossima
was
dying
though
he
might
live
another
day
or
two
alyosha
firmly
and
ardently
resolved
that
in
spite
of
his
promises
to
his
father
the
hohlakovs
and
katerina
ivanovna
he
would
not
leave
the
monastery
next
day
but
would
remain
with
his
elder
to
the
end
his
heart
glowed
with
love
and
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
having
been
able
for
one
instant
to
forget
him
whom
he
had
left
in
the
monastery
on
his
deathbed
and
whom
he
honored
above
every
one
in
the
world
he
went
into
father
zossimas
bedroom
knelt
down
and
bowed
to
the
ground
before
the
elder
who
slept
quietly
without
stirring
with
regular
hardly
audible
breathing
and
a
peaceful
face
alyosha
returned
to
the
other
room
where
father
zossima
had
received
his
guests
in
the
morning
taking
off
his
boots
he
lay
down
on
the
hard
narrow
leathern
sofa
which
he
had
long
used
as
a
bed
bringing
nothing
but
a
pillow
the
mattress
about
which
his
father
had
shouted
to
him
that
morning
he
had
long
forgotten
to
lie
on
he
took
off
his
cassock
which
he
used
as
a
covering
but
before
going
to
bed
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
prayed
a
long
time
in
his
fervent
prayer
he
did
not
beseech
god
to
lighten
his
darkness
but
only
thirsted
for
the
joyous
emotion
which
always
visited
his
soul
after
the
praise
and
adoration
of
which
his
evening
prayer
usually
consisted
that
joy
always
brought
him
light
untroubled
sleep
as
he
was
praying
he
suddenly
felt
in
his
pocket
the
little
pink
note
the
servant
had
handed
him
as
he
left
katerina
ivanovnas
he
was
disturbed
but
finished
his
prayer
then
after
some
hesitation
he
opened
the
envelope
in
it
was
a
letter
to
him
signed
by
lise
the
young
daughter
of
madame
hohlakov
who
had
laughed
at
him
before
the
elder
in
the
morning
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
wrote
i
am
writing
to
you
without
any
ones
knowledge
even
mammas
and
i
know
how
wrong
it
is
but
i
cannot
live
without
telling
you
the
feeling
that
has
sprung
up
in
my
heart
and
this
no
one
but
us
two
must
know
for
a
time
but
how

to
say
what
i
want
so
much
to
tell
you

they

blush
but
i
assure
you
its
not

love
you
ive
loved
you
from
my
childhood
since
our
moscow
days

very
different
from
what
you
are
now
and
i
shall
love
you
all
my
life
my
heart

chosen
you
to
unite
our
lives
and
pass
them
together
till
our
old
age
of
course
on
condition
that
you
will
leave
the
monastery
as
for
our
age
we
will
wait
for
the
time
fixed
by
the
law
by
that
time
i
shall
certainly
be
quite
strong
i
shall
be
walking
and
dancing
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
you
see
how
ive
thought
of
everything
theres
only
one
thing
i
cant
imagine
what
youll
think
of
me
when
you
read
this
im
always
laughing
and
being
naughty
i
made
you
angry
this
morning
but
i
assure
you
before
i
took
up
my
pen
i
prayed
before
the
image
of
the
mother
of
god
and
now
im
praying
and
almost
crying
my
secret
is
in
your
hands
when
you
come
tomorrow
i
dont
know
how
i
shall
look
at
you
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
what
if
i
cant
restrain
myself
like
a
silly
and
laugh
when
i
look
at
you
as
i
did
today
youll
think
im
a
nasty
girl
making
fun
of
you
and
you
wont
believe
my
letter
and
so
i
beg
you
dear
one
if
youve
any
pity
for
me
when
you
come
to
morrow
dont
look
me
straight
in
the
face
for
if
i
meet
your
eyes
it
will
be
sure
to
make
me
laugh
especially
as
youll
be
in
that
long
gown
i
feel
cold
all
over
when
i
think
of
it
so
when
you
come
dont
look
at
me
at
all
for
a
time
look
at
mamma
or
at
the
window
here
ive
written

a
loveletter
oh

very
horrid
and
wounded

secret
of
my
reputation

perhaps
for
ever

alyosha
read
the
note
in
amazement
read
it
through
twice
thought
a
little
and
suddenly
laughed
a
soft
sweet
laugh
he
started
that
laugh
seemed
to
him
sinful
but
a
minute
later
he
laughed
again
just
as
softly
and
happily
he
slowly
replaced
the
note
in
the
envelope
crossed
himself
and
lay
down
the
agitation
in
his
heart
passed
at
once
god
have
mercy
upon
all
of
them
have
all
these
unhappy
and
turbulent
souls
in
thy
keeping
and
set
them
in
the
right
path

father
ferapont
alyosha
was
roused
early
before
daybreak
father
zossima
woke
up
feeling
very
weak
though
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
bed
and
sit
up
in
a
chair
his
mind
was
quite
clear
his
face
looked
very
tired
yet
bright
and
almost
joyful
it
wore
an
expression
of
gayety
kindness
and
cordiality
maybe
i
shall
not
live
through
the
coming
day
he
said
to
alyosha
then
he
desired
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
at
once
he
always
confessed
to
father
passy
after
taking
the
communion
the
service
of
extreme
unction
followed
the
monks
assembled
and
the
cell
was
gradually
filled
up
by
the
inmates
of
the
hermitage
meantime
it
was
daylight
people
began
coming
from
the
monastery
after
the
service
was
over
the
elder
desired
to
kiss
and
take
leave
of
every
one
as
the
cell
was
so
small
the
earlier
visitors
withdrew
to
make
room
for
others
alyosha
stood
beside
the
elder
who
was
seated
again
in
his
armchair
he
talked
as
much
as
he
could
though
his
voice
was
weak
it
was
fairly
steady
ive
been
teaching
you
so
many
years
and
therefore
ive
been
talking
aloud
so
many
years
that
ive
got
into
the
habit
of
talking
and
so
much
so
that
its
almost
more
difficult
for
me
to
hold
my
tongue
than
to
talk
even
now
in
spite
of
my
weakness
dear
fathers
and
brothers
he
jested
looking
with
emotion
at
the
group
round
him
alyosha
remembered
afterwards
something
of
what
he
said
to
them
but
though
he
spoke
out
distinctly
and
his
voice
was
fairly
steady
his
speech
was
somewhat
disconnected
he
spoke
of
many
things
he
seemed
anxious
before
the
moment
of
death
to
say
everything
he
had
not
said
in
his
life
and
not
simply
for
the
sake
of
instructing
them
but
as
though
thirsting
to
share
with
all
men
and
all
creation
his
joy
and
ecstasy
and
once
more
in
his
life
to
open
his
whole
heart
love
one
another
fathers
said
father
zossima
as
far
as
alyosha
could
remember
afterwards
love
gods
people
because
we
have
come
here
and
shut
ourselves
within
these
walls
we
are
no
holier
than
those
that
are
outside
but
on
the
contrary
from
the
very
fact
of
coming
here
each
of
us
has
confessed
to
himself
that
he
is
worse
than
others
than
all
men
on
earth
and
the
longer
the
monk
lives
in
his
seclusion
the
more
keenly
he
must
recognize
that
else
he
would
have
had
no
reason
to
come
here
when
he
realizes
that
he
is
not
only
worse
than
others
but
that
he
is
responsible
to
all
men
for
all
and
everything
for
all
human
sins
national
and
individual
only
then
the
aim
of
our
seclusion
is
attained
for
know
dear
ones
that
every
one
of
us
is
undoubtedly
responsible
for
all
men
and
everything
on
earth
not
merely
through
the
general
sinfulness
of
creation
but
each
one
personally
for
all
mankind
and
every
individual
man
this
knowledge
is
the
crown
of
life
for
the
monk
and
for
every
man
for
monks
are
not
a
special
sort
of
men
but
only
what
all
men
ought
to
be
only
through
that
knowledge
our
heart
grows
soft
with
infinite
universal
inexhaustible
love
then
every
one
of
you
will
have
the
power
to
win
over
the
whole
world
by
love
and
to
wash
away
the
sins
of
the
world
with
your
tears
each
of
you
keep
watch
over
your
heart
and
confess
your
sins
to
yourself
unceasingly
be
not
afraid
of
your
sins
even
when
perceiving
them
if
only
there
be
penitence
but
make
no
conditions
with
god
again

disdainful
pride
or
worse
still
in
covetousness

will
come
from

sides

them

faith
cling
to
the
banner
and
raise
it
on
high
but
the
elder
spoke
more
disconnectedly
than
alyosha
reported
his
words
afterwards
sometimes
he
broke
off
altogether
as
though
to
take
breath
and
recover
his
strength
but
he
was
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
they
heard
him
with
emotion
though
many
wondered
at
his
words
and
found
them
obscure
afterwards
all
remembered
those
words
when
alyosha
happened
for
a
moment
to
leave
the
cell
he
was
struck
by
the
general
excitement
and
suspense
in
the
monks
who
were
crowding
about
it
this
anticipation
showed
itself
in
some
by
anxiety
in
others
by
devout
solemnity
all
were
expecting
that
some
marvel
would
happen
immediately
after
the
elders
death
their
suspense
was
from
one
point
of
view
almost
frivolous
but
even
the
most
austere
of
the
monks
were
affected
by
it
father
passys
face
looked
the
gravest
of
all
alyosha
was
mysteriously
summoned
by
a
monk
to
see
rakitin
who
had
arrived
from
town
with
a
singular
letter
for
him
from
madame
hohlakov
in
it
she
informed
alyosha
of
a
strange
and
very
opportune
incident
it
appeared
that
among
the
women
who
had
come
on
the
previous
day
to
receive
father
zossimas
blessing
there
had
been
an
old
woman
from
the
town
a
sergeants
widow
called
prohorovna
she
had
inquired
whether
she
might
pray
for
the
rest
of
the
soul
of
her
son
vassenka
who
had
gone
to
irkutsk
and
had
sent
her
no
news
for
over
a
year
to
which
father
zossima
had
answered
sternly
forbidding
her
to
do
so
and
saying
that
to
pray
for
the
living
as
though
they
were
dead
was
a
kind
of
sorcery
he
afterwards
forgave
her
on
account
of
her
ignorance
and
added
as
though
reading
the
book
of
the
future
this
was
madame
hohlakovs
expression
words
of
comfort
that
her
son
vassya
was
certainly
alive
and
he
would
either
come
himself
very
shortly
or
send
a
letter
and
that
she
was
to
go
home
and
expect
him
and
would
you
believe
it
exclaimed
madame
hohlakov
enthusiastically
the
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
literally
indeed
and
more
than
that
scarcely
had
the
old
woman
reached
home
when
they
gave
her
a
letter
from
siberia
which
had
been
awaiting
her
but
that
was
not
all
in
the
letter
written
on
the
road
from
ekaterinenburg
vassya
informed
his
mother
that
he
was
returning
to
russia
with
an
official
and
that
three
weeks
after
her
receiving
the
letter
he
hoped
to
embrace
his
mother
madame
hohlakov
warmly
entreated
alyosha
to
report
this
new
miracle
of
prediction
to
the
superior
and
all
the
brotherhood
all
all
ought
to
know
of
it
she
concluded
the
letter
had
been
written
in
haste
the
excitement
of
the
writer
was
apparent
in
every
line
of
it
but
alyosha
had
no
need
to
tell
the
monks
for
all
knew
of
it
already
rakitin
had
commissioned
the
monk
who
brought
his
message
to
inform
most
respectfully
his
reverence
father
passy
that
he
rakitin
has
a
matter
to
speak
of
with
him
of
such
gravity
that
he
dare
not
defer
it
for
a
moment
and
humbly
begs
forgiveness
for
his
presumption
as
the
monk
had
given
the
message
to
father
passy
before
that
to
alyosha
the
latter
found
after
reading
the
letter
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
hand
it
to
father
passy
in
confirmation
of
the
story
and
even
that
austere
and
cautious
man
though
he
frowned
as
he
read
the
news
of
the
miracle
could
not
completely
restrain
some
inner
emotion
his
eyes
gleamed
and
a
grave
and
solemn
smile
came
into
his
lips
we
shall
see
greater
things
broke
from
him
we
shall
see
greater
things
greater
things
yet
the
monks
around
repeated
but
father
passy
frowning
again
begged
all
of
them
at
least
for
a
time
not
to
speak
of
the
matter
till
it
be
more
fully
confirmed
seeing
there
is
so
much
credulity
among
those
of
this
world
and
indeed
this
might
well
have
chanced
naturally
he
added
prudently
as
it
were
to
satisfy
his
conscience
though
scarcely
believing
his
own
disavowal
a
fact
his
listeners
very
clearly
perceived
within
the
hour
the
miracle
was
of
course
known
to
the
whole
monastery
and
many
visitors
who
had
come
for
the
mass
no
one
seemed
more
impressed
by
it
than
the
monk
who
had
come
the
day
before
from
st
sylvester
from
the
little
monastery
of
obdorsk
in
the
far
north
it
was
he
who
had
been
standing
near
madame
hohlakov
the
previous
day
and
had
asked
father
zossima
earnestly
referring
to
the
healing
of
the
ladys
daughter
how
can
you
presume
to
do
such
things
he
was
now
somewhat
puzzled
and
did
not
know
whom
to
believe
the
evening
before
he
had
visited
father
ferapont
in
his
cell
apart
behind
the
apiary
and
had
been
greatly
impressed
and
overawed
by
the
visit
this
father
ferapont
was
that
aged
monk
so
devout
in
fasting
and
observing
silence
who
has
been
mentioned
already
as
antagonistic
to
father
zossima
and
the
whole
institution
of
elders
which
he
regarded
as
a
pernicious
and
frivolous
innovation
he
was
a
very
formidable
opponent
although
from
his
practice
of
silence
he
scarcely
spoke
a
word
to
any
one
what
made
him
formidable
was
that
a
number
of
monks
fully
shared
his
feeling
and
many
of
the
visitors
looked
upon
him
as
a
great
saint
and
ascetic
although
they
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
crazy
but
it
was
just
his
craziness
attracted
them
father
ferapont
never
went
to
see
the
elder
though
he
lived
in
the
hermitage
they
did
not
worry
him
to
keep
its
regulations
and
this
too
because
he
behaved
as
though
he
were
crazy
he
was
seventyfive
or
more
and
he
lived
in
a
corner
beyond
the
apiary
in
an
old
decaying
wooden
cell
which
had
been
built
long
ago
for
another
great
ascetic
father
iona
who
had
lived
to
be
a
hundred
and
five
and
of
whose
saintly
doings
many
curious
stories
were
still
extant
in
the
monastery
and
the
neighborhood
father
ferapont
had
succeeded
in
getting
himself
installed
in
this
same
solitary
cell
seven
years
previously
it
was
simply
a
peasants
hut
though
it
looked
like
a
chapel
for
it
contained
an
extraordinary
number
of
ikons
with
lamps
perpetually
burning
before
themwhich
men
brought
to
the
monastery
as
offerings
to
god
father
ferapont
had
been
appointed
to
look
after
them
and
keep
the
lamps
burning
it
was
said
and
indeed
it
was
true
that
he
ate
only
two
pounds
of
bread
in
three
days
the
beekeeper
who
lived
close
by
the
apiary
used
to
bring
him
the
bread
every
three
days
and
even
to
this
man
who
waited
upon
him
father
ferapont
rarely
uttered
a
word
the
four
pounds
of
bread
together
with
the
sacrament
bread
regularly
sent
him
on
sundays
after
the
late
mass
by
the
father
superior
made
up
his
weekly
rations
the
water
in
his
jug
was
changed
every
day
he
rarely
appeared
at
mass
visitors
who
came
to
do
him
homage
saw
him
sometimes
kneeling
all
day
long
at
prayer
without
looking
round
if
he
addressed
them
he
was
brief
abrupt
strange
and
almost
always
rude
on
very
rare
occasions
however
he
would
talk
to
visitors
but
for
the
most
part
he
would
utter
some
one
strange
saying
which
was
a
complete
riddle
and
no
entreaties
would
induce
him
to
pronounce
a
word
in
explanation
he
was
not
a
priest
but
a
simple
monk
there
was
a
strange
belief
chiefly
however
among
the
most
ignorant
that
father
ferapont
had
communication
with
heavenly
spirits
and
would
only
converse
with
them
and
so
was
silent
with
men
the
monk
from
obdorsk
having
been
directed
to
the
apiary
by
the
beekeeper
who
was
also
a
very
silent
and
surly
monk
went
to
the
corner
where
father
feraponts
cell
stood
maybe
he
will
speak
as
you
are
a
stranger
and
maybe
youll
get
nothing
out
of
him
the
beekeeper
had
warned
him
the
monk
as
he
related
afterwards
approached
in
the
utmost
apprehension
it
was
rather
late
in
the
evening
father
ferapont
was
sitting
at
the
door
of
his
cell
on
a
low
bench
a
huge
old
elm
was
lightly
rustling
overhead
there
was
an
evening
freshness
in
the
air
the
monk
from
obdorsk
bowed
down
before
the
saint
and
asked
his
blessing
do
you
want
me
to
bow
down
to
you
monk
said
father
ferapont
get
up
the
monk
got
up
blessing
be
blessed
sit
beside
me
where
have
you
come
from
what
most
struck
the
poor
monk
was
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
his
strict
fasting
and
great
age
father
ferapont
still
looked
a
vigorous
old
man
he
was
tall
held
himself
erect
and
had
a
thin
but
fresh
and
healthy
face
there
was
no
doubt
he
still
had
considerable
strength
he
was
of
athletic
build
in
spite
of
his
great
age
he
was
not
even
quite
gray
and
still
had
very
thick
hair
and
a
full
beard
both
of
which
had
once
been
black
his
eyes
were
gray
large
and
luminous
but
strikingly
prominent
he
spoke
with
a
broad
accent
he
was
dressed
in
a
peasants
long
reddish
coat
of
coarse
convict
cloth
as
it
used
to
be
called
and
had
a
stout
rope
round
his
waist
his
throat
and
chest
were
bare
beneath
his
coat
his
shirt
of
the
coarsest
linen
showed
almost
black
with
dirt
not
having
been
changed
for
months
they
said
that
he
wore
irons
weighing
thirty
pounds
under
his
coat
his
stockingless
feet
were
thrust
in
old
slippers
almost
dropping
to
pieces
from
the
little
obdorsk
monastery
from
st
sylvester
the
monk
answered
humbly
whilst
his
keen
and
inquisitive
but
rather
frightened
little
eyes
kept
watch
on
the
hermit
i
have
been
at
your
sylvesters
i
used
to
stay
there
is
sylvester
well
the
monk
hesitated
you
are
a
senseless
lot
how
do
you
keep
the
fasts
our
dietary
is
according
to
the
ancient
conventual
rules
during
lent
there
are
no
meals
provided
for
monday
wednesday
and
friday
for
tuesday
and
thursday
we
have
white
bread
stewed
fruit
with
honey
wild
berries
or
salt
cabbage
and
wholemeal
stirabout
on
saturday
white
cabbage
soup
noodles
with
peas
kasha
all
with
hemp
oil
on
weekdays
we
have
dried
fish
and
kasha
with
the
cabbage
soup
from
monday
till
saturday
evening
six
whole
days
in
holy
week
nothing
is
cooked
and
we
have
only
bread
and
water
and
that
sparingly
if
possible
not
taking
food
every
day
just
the
same
as
is
ordered
for
first
week
in
lent
on
good
friday
nothing
is
eaten
in
the
same
way
on
the
saturday
we
have
to
fast
till
three
oclock
and
then
take
a
little
bread
and
water
and
drink
a
single
cup
of
wine
on
holy
thursday
we
drink
wine
and
have
something
cooked
without
oil
or
not
cooked
at
all
inasmuch
as
the
laodicean
council
lays
down
for
holy
thursday
it
is
unseemly
by
remitting
the
fast
on
the
holy
thursday
to
dishonor
the
whole
of
lent
this
is
how
we
keep
the
fast
but
what
is
that
compared
with
you
holy
father
added
the
monk
growing
more
confident
for
all
the
year
round
even
at
easter
you
take
nothing
but
bread
and
water
and
what
we
should
eat
in
two
days
lasts
you
full
seven
its
truly
marvelousyour
great
abstinence
and
mushrooms
asked
father
ferapont
suddenly
mushrooms
repeated
the
surprised
monk
yes
i
can
give
up
their
bread
not
needing
it
at
all
and
go
away
into
the
forest
and
live
there
on
the
mushrooms
or
the
berries
but
they
cant
give
up
their
bread
here
wherefore
they
are
in
bondage
to
the
devil
nowadays
the
unclean
deny
that
there
is
need
of
such
fasting
haughty
and
unclean
is
their
judgment
och
true
sighed
the
monk
and
have
you
seen
devils
among
them
asked
ferapont
among
them
among
whom
asked
the
monk
timidly
i
went
to
the
father
superior
on
trinity
sunday
last
year
i
havent
been
since
i
saw
a
devil
sitting
on
one
mans
chest
hiding
under
his
cassock
only
his
horns
poked
out
another
had
one
peeping
out
of
his
pocket
with
such
sharp
eyes
he
was
afraid
of
me
another
settled
in
the
unclean
belly
of
one
another
was
hanging
round
a
mans
neck
and
so
he
was
carrying
him
about
without
seeing
him
youcan
see
spirits
the
monk
inquired
i
tell
you
i
can
see
i
can
see
through
them
when
i
was
coming
out
from
the
superiors
i
saw
one
hiding
from
me
behind
the
door
and
a
big
one
a
yard
and
a
half
or
more
high
with
a
thick
long
gray
tail
and
the
tip
of
his
tail
was
in
the
crack
of
the
door
and
i
was
quick
and
slammed
the
door
pinching
his
tail
in
it
he
squealed
and
began
to
struggle
and
i
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
three
times
and
he
died
on
the
spot
like
a
crushed
spider
he
must
have
rotted
there
in
the
corner
and
be
stinking
but
they
dont
see
they
dont
smell
it
its
a
year
since
i
have
been
there
i
reveal
it
to
you
as
you
are
a
stranger
your
words
are
terrible
but
holy
and
blessed
father
said
the
monk
growing
bolder
and
bolder
is
it
true
as
they
noise
abroad
even
to
distant
lands
about
you
that
you
are
in
continual
communication
with
the
holy
ghost
he
does
fly
down
at
times
how
does
he
fly
down
in
what
form
as
a
bird
the
holy
ghost
in
the
form
of
a
dove
theres
the
holy
ghost
and
theres
the
holy
spirit
the
holy
spirit
can
appear
as
other
birdssometimes
as
a
swallow
sometimes
a
goldfinch
and
sometimes
as
a
bluetit
how
do
you
know
him
from
an
ordinary
tit
he
speaks
how
does
he
speak
in
what
language
human
language
and
what
does
he
tell
you
why
today
he
told
me
that
a
fool
would
visit
me
and
would
ask
me
unseemly
questions
you
want
to
know
too
much
monk
terrible
are
your
words
most
holy
and
blessed
father
the
monk
shook
his
head
but
there
was
a
doubtful
look
in
his
frightened
little
eyes
do
you
see
this
tree
asked
father
ferapont
after
a
pause
i
do
blessed
father
you
think
its
an
elm
but
for
me
it
has
another
shape
what
sort
of
shape
inquired
the
monk
after
a
pause
of
vain
expectation
it
happens
at
night
you
see
those
two
branches
in
the
night
it
is
christ
holding
out
his
arms
to
me
and
seeking
me
with
those
arms
i
see
it
clearly
and
tremble
its
terrible
terrible
what
is
there
terrible
if
its
christ
himself
why
hell
snatch
me
up
and
carry
me
away
alive
in
the
spirit
and
glory
of
elijah
havent
you
heard
he
will
take
me
in
his
arms
and
bear
me
away
though
the
monk
returned
to
the
cell
he
was
sharing
with
one
of
the
brothers
in
considerable
perplexity
of
mind
he
still
cherished
at
heart
a
greater
reverence
for
father
ferapont
than
for
father
zossima
he
was
strongly
in
favor
of
fasting
and
it
was
not
strange
that
one
who
kept
so
rigid
a
fast
as
father
ferapont
should
see
marvels
his
words
seemed
certainly
queer
but
god
only
could
tell
what
was
hidden
in
those
words
and
were
not
worse
words
and
acts
commonly
seen
in
those
who
have
sacrificed
their
intellects
for
the
glory
of
god
the
pinching
of
the
devils
tail
he
was
ready
and
eager
to
believe
and
not
only
in
the
figurative
sense
besides
he
had
before
visiting
the
monastery
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
institution
of
elders
which
he
only
knew
of
by
hearsay
and
believed
to
be
a
pernicious
innovation
before
he
had
been
long
at
the
monastery
he
had
detected
the
secret
murmurings
of
some
shallow
brothers
who
disliked
the
institution
he
was
besides
a
meddlesome
inquisitive
man
who
poked
his
nose
into
everything
this
was
why
the
news
of
the
fresh
miracle
performed
by
father
zossima
reduced
him
to
extreme
perplexity
alyosha
remembered
afterwards
how
their
inquisitive
guest
from
obdorsk
had
been
continually
flitting
to
and
fro
from
one
group
to
another
listening
and
asking
questions
among
the
monks
that
were
crowding
within
and
without
the
elders
cell
but
he
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
him
at
the
time
and
only
recollected
it
afterwards
he
had
no
thought
to
spare
for
it
indeed
for
when
father
zossima
feeling
tired
again
had
gone
back
to
bed
he
thought
of
alyosha
as
he
was
closing
his
eyes
and
sent
for
him
alyosha
ran
at
once
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
cell
but
father
passy
father
iosif
and
the
novice
porfiry
the
elder
opening
his
weary
eyes
and
looking
intently
at
alyosha
asked
him
suddenly
are
your
people
expecting
you
my
son
alyosha
hesitated
havent
they
need
of
you
didnt
you
promise
some
one
yesterday
to
see
them
today
i
did
promiseto
my
fathermy
brothersothers
too
you
see
you
must
go
dont
grieve
be
sure
i
shall
not
die
without
your
being
by
to
hear
my
last
word
to
you
i
will
say
that
word
my
son
it
will
be
my
last
gift
to
you
to
you
dear
son
because
you
love
me
but
now
go
to
keep
your
promise
alyosha
immediately
obeyed
though
it
was
hard
to
go
but
the
promise
that
he
should
hear
his
last
word
on
earth
that
it
should
be
the
last
gift
to
him
alyosha
sent
a
thrill
of
rapture
through
his
soul
he
made
haste
that
he
might
finish
what
he
had
to
do
in
the
town
and
return
quickly
father
passy
too
uttered
some
words
of
exhortation
which
moved
and
surprised
him
greatly
he
spoke
as
they
left
the
cell
together
remember
young
man
unceasingly
father
passy
began
without
preface
that
the
science
of
this
world
which
has
become
a
great
power
has
especially
in
the
last
century
analyzed
everything
divine
handed
down
to
us
in
the
holy
books
after
this
cruel
analysis
the
learned
of
this
world
have
nothing
left
of
all
that
was
sacred
of
old
but
they
have
only
analyzed
the
parts
and
overlooked
the
whole
and
indeed
their
blindness
is
marvelous
yet
the
whole
still
stands
steadfast
before
their
eyes
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
has
it
not
lasted
nineteen
centuries
is
it
not
still
a
living
a
moving
power
in
the
individual
soul
and
in
the
masses
of
people
it
is
still
as
strong
and
living
even
in
the
souls
of
atheists
who
have
destroyed
everything
for
even
those
who
have
renounced
christianity
and
attack
it
in
their
inmost
being
still
follow
the
christian
ideal
for
hitherto
neither
their
subtlety
nor
the
ardor
of
their
hearts
has
been
able
to
create
a
higher
ideal
of
man
and
of
virtue
than
the
ideal
given
by
christ
of
old
when
it
has
been
attempted
the
result
has
been
only
grotesque
remember
this
especially
young
man
since
you
are
being
sent
into
the
world
by
your
departing
elder
maybe
remembering
this
great
day
you
will
not
forget
my
words
uttered
from
the
heart
for
your
guidance
seeing
you
are
young
and
the
temptations
of
the
world
are
great
and
beyond
your
strength
to
endure
well
now
go
my
orphan
with
these
words
father
passy
blessed
him
as
alyosha
left
the
monastery
and
thought
them
over
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
met
a
new
and
unexpected
friend
a
warmly
loving
teacher
in
this
austere
monk
who
had
hitherto
treated
him
sternly
it
was
as
though
father
zossima
had
bequeathed
him
to
him
at
his
death
and
perhaps
thats
just
what
had
passed
between
them
alyosha
thought
suddenly
the
philosophic
reflections
he
had
just
heard
so
unexpectedly
testified
to
the
warmth
of
father
passys
heart
he
was
in
haste
to
arm
the
boys
mind
for
conflict
with
temptation
and
to
guard
the
young
soul
left
in
his
charge
with
the
strongest
defense
he
could
imagine
chapter
ii
at
his
fathers
first
of
all
alyosha
went
to
his
father
on
the
way
he
remembered
that
his
father
had
insisted
the
day
before
that
he
should
come
without
his
brother
ivan
seeing
him
why
so
alyosha
wondered
suddenly
even
if
my
father
has
something
to
say
to
me
alone
why
should
i
go
in
unseen
most
likely
in
his
excitement
yesterday
he
meant
to
say
something
different
he
decided
yet
he
was
very
glad
when
marfa
ignatyevna
who
opened
the
garden
gate
to
him
grigory
it
appeared
was
ill
in
bed
in
the
lodge
told
him
in
answer
to
his
question
that
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
gone
out
two
hours
ago
and
my
father
he
is
up
taking
his
coffee
marfa
answered
somewhat
dryly
alyosha
went
in
the
old
man
was
sitting
alone
at
the
table
wearing
slippers
and
a
little
old
overcoat
he
was
amusing
himself
by
looking
through
some
accounts
rather
inattentively
however
he
was
quite
alone
in
the
house
for
smerdyakov
too
had
gone
out
marketing
though
he
had
got
up
early
and
was
trying
to
put
a
bold
face
on
it
he
looked
tired
and
weak
his
forehead
upon
which
huge
purple
bruises
had
come
out
during
the
night
was
bandaged
with
a
red
handkerchief
his
nose
too
had
swollen
terribly
in
the
night
and
some
smaller
bruises
covered
it
in
patches
giving
his
whole
face
a
peculiarly
spiteful
and
irritable
look
the
old
man
was
aware
of
this
and
turned
a
hostile
glance
on
alyosha
as
he
came
in
the
coffee
is
cold
he
cried
harshly
i
wont
offer
you
any
ive
ordered
nothing
but
a
lenten
fish
soup
today
and
i
dont
invite
any
one
to
share
it
why
have
you
come
to
find
out
how
you
are
said
alyosha
yes
besides
i
told
you
to
come
yesterday
its
all
of
no
consequence
you
need
not
have
troubled
but
i
knew
youd
come
poking
in
directly
he
said
this
with
almost
hostile
feeling
at
the
same
time
he
got
up
and
looked
anxiously
in
the
lookingglass
perhaps
for
the
fortieth
time
that
morning
at
his
nose
he
began
too
binding
his
red
handkerchief
more
becomingly
on
his
forehead
reds
better
its
just
like
the
hospital
in
a
white
one
he
observed
sententiously
well
how
are
things
over
there
how
is
your
elder
he
is
very
bad
he
may
die
today
answered
alyosha
but
his
father
had
not
listened
and
had
forgotten
his
own
question
at
once
ivans
gone
out
he
said
suddenly
he
is
doing
his
utmost
to
carry
off
mityas
betrothed
thats
what
he
is
staying
here
for
he
added
maliciously
and
twisting
his
mouth
looked
at
alyosha
surely
he
did
not
tell
you
so
asked
alyosha
yes
he
did
long
ago
would
you
believe
it
he
told
me
three
weeks
ago
you
dont
suppose
he
too
came
to
murder
me
do
you
he
must
have
had
some
object
in
coming
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
say
such
things
said
alyosha
troubled
he
doesnt
ask
for
money
its
true
but
yet
he
wont
get
a
farthing
from
me
i
intend
living
as
long
as
possible
you
may
as
well
know
my
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
so
i
need
every
farthing
and
the
longer
i
live
the
more
i
shall
need
it
he
continued
pacing
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
keeping
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
loose
greasy
overcoat
made
of
yellow
cotton
material
i
can
still
pass
for
a
man
at
five
and
fifty
but
i
want
to
pass
for
one
for
another
twenty
years
as
i
get
older
you
know
i
shant
be
a
pretty
object
the
wenches
wont
come
to
me
of
their
own
accord
so
i
shall
want
my
money
so
i
am
saving
up
more
and
more
simply
for
myself
my
dear
son
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
may
as
well
know
for
i
mean
to
go
on
in
my
sins
to
the
end
let
me
tell
you
for
sin
is
sweet
all
abuse
it
but
all
men
live
in
it
only
others
do
it
on
the
sly
and
i
openly
and
so
all
the
other
sinners
fall
upon
me
for
being
so
simple
and
your
paradise
alexey
fyodorovitch
is
not
to
my
taste
let
me
tell
you
that
and
its
not
the
proper
place
for
a
gentleman
your
paradise
even
if
it
exists
i
believe
that
i
fall
asleep
and
dont
wake
up
again
and
thats
all
you
can
pray
for
my
soul
if
you
like
and
if
you
dont
want
to
dont
damn
you
thats
my
philosophy
ivan
talked
well
here
yesterday
though
we
were
all
drunk
ivan
is
a
conceited
coxcomb
but
he
has
no
particular
learning

nor
education
either
he
sits
silent
and
smiles
at
one
without
speakingthats
what
pulls
him
through
alyosha
listened
to
him
in
silence
why
wont
he
talk
to
me
if
he
does
speak
he
gives
himself
airs
your
ivan
is
a
scoundrel
and
ill
marry
grushenka
in
a
minute
if
i
want
to
for
if
youve
money
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
have
only
to
want
a
thing
and
you
can
have
it
thats
what
ivan
is
afraid
of
he
is
on
the
watch
to
prevent
me
getting
married
and
thats
why
he
is
egging
on
mitya
to
marry
grushenka
himself
he
hopes
to
keep
me
from
grushenka
by
that
as
though
i
should
leave
him
my
money
if
i
dont
marry
her
besides
if
mitya
marries
grushenka
ivan
will
carry
off
his
rich
betrothed
thats
what
hes
reckoning
on
he
is
a
scoundrel
your
ivan
how
cross
you
are
its
because
of
yesterday
you
had
better
lie
down
said
alyosha
there
you
say
that
the
old
man
observed
suddenly
as
though
it
had
struck
him
for
the
first
time
and
i
am
not
angry
with
you
but
if
ivan
said
it
i
should
be
angry
with
him
it
is
only
with
you
i
have
good
moments
else
you
know
i
am
an
illnatured
man
you
are
not
illnatured
but
distorted
said
alyosha
with
a
smile
listen
i
meant
this
morning
to
get
that
ruffian
mitya
locked
up
and
i
dont
know
now
what
i
shall
decide
about
it
of
course
in
these
fashionable
days
fathers
and
mothers
are
looked
upon
as
a
prejudice
but
even
now
the
law
does
not
allow
you
to
drag
your
old
father
about
by
the
hair
to
kick
him
in
the
face
in
his
own
house
and
brag
of
murdering
him
outrightall
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
if
i
liked
i
could
crush
him
and
could
have
him
locked
up
at
once
for
what
he
did
yesterday
then
you
dont
mean
to
take
proceedings
ivan
has
dissuaded
me
i
shouldnt
care
about
ivan
but
theres
another
thing
and
bending
down
to
alyosha
he
went
on
in
a
confidential
halfwhisper
if
i
send
the
ruffian
to
prison
shell
hear
of
it
and
run
to
see
him
at
once
but
if
she
hears
that
he
has
beaten
me
a
weak
old
man
within
an
inch
of
my
life
she
may
give
him
up
and
come
to
me
for
thats
her
way
everything
by
contraries
i
know
her
through
and
through
wont
you
have
a
drop
of
brandy
take
some
cold
coffee
and
ill
pour
a
quarter
of
a
glass
of
brandy
into
it
its
delicious
my
boy
no
thank
you
ill
take
that
roll
with
me
if
i
may
said
alyosha
and
taking
a
halfpenny
french
roll
he
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
cassock
and
youd
better
not
have
brandy
either
he
suggested
apprehensively
looking
into
the
old
mans
face
you
are
quite
right
it
irritates
my
nerves
instead
of
soothing
them
only
one
little
glass
ill
get
it
out
of
the
cupboard
he
unlocked
the
cupboard
poured
out
a
glass
drank
it
then
locked
the
cupboard
and
put
the
key
back
in
his
pocket
thats
enough
one
glass
wont
kill
me
you
see
you
are
in
a
better
humor
now
said
alyosha
smiling
um
i
love
you
even
without
the
brandy
but
with
scoundrels
i
am
a
scoundrel
ivan
is
not
going
to
tchermashnyawhy
is
that
he
wants
to
spy
how
much
i
give
grushenka
if
she
comes
they
are
all
scoundrels
but
i
dont
recognize
ivan
i
dont
know
him
at
all
where
does
he
come
from
he
is
not
one
of
us
in
soul
as
though
id
leave
him
anything
i
shant
leave
a
will
at
all
you
may
as
well
know
and
ill
crush
mitya
like
a
beetle
i
squash
blackbeetles
at
night
with
my
slipper
they
squelch
when
you
tread
on
them
and
your
mitya
will
squelch
too
your
mitya
for
you
love
him
yes
you
love
him
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
loving
him
but
if
ivan
loved
him
i
should
be
afraid
for
myself
at
his
loving
him
but
ivan
loves
nobody
ivan
is
not
one
of
us
people
like
ivan
are
not
our
sort
my
boy
they
are
like
a
cloud
of
dust
when
the
wind
blows
the
dust
will
be
gone
i
had
a
silly
idea
in
my
head
when
i
told
you
to
come
today
i
wanted
to
find
out
from
you
about
mitya
if
i
were
to
hand
him
over
a
thousand
or
maybe
two
now
would
the
beggarly
wretch
agree
to
take
himself
off
altogether
for
five
years
or
better
still
thirtyfive
and
without
grushenka
and
give
her
up
once
for
all
eh
iill
ask
him
muttered
alyosha
if
you
would
give
him
three
thousand
perhaps
he
thats
nonsense
you
neednt
ask
him
now
no
need
ive
changed
my
mind
it
was
a
nonsensical
idea
of
mine
i
wont
give
him
anything
not
a
penny
i
want
my
money
myself
cried
the
old
man
waving
his
hand
ill
crush
him
like
a
beetle
without
it
dont
say
anything
to
him
or
else
he
will
begin
hoping
theres
nothing
for
you
to
do
here
you
neednt
stay
is
that
betrothed
of
his
katerina
ivanovna
whom
he
has
kept
so
carefully
hidden
from
me
all
this
time
going
to
marry
him
or
not
you
went
to
see
her

believe

her
to
abandon
him
there
you
see
how
dearly
these
fine
young
ladies

different
fromah

and

betterlooking
than
he
at
eight
and
twenty
id
have
been
a
conquering
hero
just
as

low
cad
but
he

grushenka
anyway
he
shant
ill

him
his
anger
had
returned
with
the
last
words
you

go

nothing
for
you
to
do
here
today
he
snapped
harshly
alyosha
went
up
to
say
goodby
to
him
and
kissed
him
on
the
shoulder
whats
that
for
the
old
man
was
a
little
surprised
we
shall
see
each
other

or
do

said
the
old
man
looking
at
him
listen

he
shouted
after
him
make
haste
and
come

and
as
soon
as
alyosha
had
gone
out
of
the
door
he
went
to
the
cupboard
again
and
poured
out
another
halfglass
i
wont
have
more
he
muttered
clearing
his
throat
and
again
he
locked
the
cupboard
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
then
he
went
into
his
bedroom
lay
down
on
the
bed
exhausted
and
in
one
minute
he
was
asleep
chapter
iii
a
meeting
with
the
schoolboys
thank
goodness
he
did
not
ask
me
about
grushenka
thought
alyosha
as
he
left
his
fathers
house
and
turned
towards
madame
hohlakovs
or
i
might
have
to
tell
him
of
my
meeting
with
grushenka
yesterday
alyosha
felt
painfully
that
since
yesterday
both
combatants
had
renewed
their
energies
and
that
their
hearts
had
grown
hard
again
father
is
spiteful
and
angry
hes
made
some
plan
and
will
stick
to
it
and
what
of
dmitri
he
too
will
be
harder
than
yesterday
he
too
must
be
spiteful
and
angry
and
he
too
no
doubt
has
made
some
plan
oh
i
must
succeed
in
finding
him
today
whatever
happens
but
alyosha
had
not
long
to
meditate
an
incident
occurred
on
the
road
which
though
apparently
of
little
consequence
made
a
great
impression
on
him
just
after
he
had
crossed
the
square
and
turned
the
corner
coming
out
into
mihailovsky
street
which
is
divided
by
a
small
ditch
from
the
high
street
our
whole
town
is
intersected
by
ditches
he
saw
a
group
of
schoolboys
between
the
ages
of
nine
and
twelve
at
the
bridge
they
were
going
home
from
school
some
with
their
bags
on
their
shoulders
others
with
leather
satchels
slung
across
them
some
in
short
jackets
others
in
little
overcoats
some
even
had
those
high
boots
with
creases
round
the
ankles
such
as
little
boys
spoilt
by
rich
fathers
love
to
wear
the
whole
group
was
talking
eagerly
about
something
apparently
holding
a
council
alyosha
had
never
from
his
moscow
days
been
able
to
pass
children
without
taking
notice
of
them
and
although
he
was
particularly
fond
of
children
of
three
or
thereabout
he
liked
schoolboys
of
ten
and
eleven
too
and
so
anxious
as
he
was
today
he
wanted
at
once
to
turn
aside
to
talk
to
them
he
looked
into
their
excited
rosy
faces
and
noticed
at
once
that
all
the
boys
had
stones
in
their
hands
behind
the
ditch
some
thirty
paces
away
there
was
another
schoolboy
standing
by
a
fence
he
too
had
a
satchel
at
his
side
he
was
about
ten
years
old
pale
delicatelooking
and
with
sparkling
black
eyes
he
kept
an
attentive
and
anxious
watch
on
the
other
six
obviously
his
schoolfellows
with
whom
he
had
just
come
out
of
school
but
with
whom
he
had
evidently
had
a
feud
alyosha
went
up
and
addressing
a
fair
curlyheaded
rosy
boy
in
a
black
jacket
observed
when
i
used
to
wear
a
satchel
like
yours
i
always
used
to
carry
it
on
my
left
side
so
as
to
have
my
right
hand
free
but
youve
got
yours
on
your
right
side
so
it
will
be
awkward
for
you
to
get
at
it
alyosha
had
no
art
or
premeditation
in
beginning
with
this
practical
remark
but
it
is
the
only
way
for
a
grownup
person
to
get
at
once
into
confidential
relations
with
a
child
or
still
more
with
a
group
of
children
one
must
begin
in
a
serious
businesslike
way
so
as
to
be
on
a
perfectly
equal
footing
alyosha
understood
it
by
instinct
but
he
is
lefthanded
another
a
fine
healthylooking
boy
of
eleven
answered
promptly
all
the
others
stared
at
alyosha
he
even
throws
stones
with
his
left
hand
observed
a
third
at
that
instant
a
stone
flew
into
the
group
but
only
just
grazed
the
lefthanded
boy
though
it
was
well
and
vigorously
thrown
by
the
boy
standing
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
give
it
him
hit
him
back
smurov
they
all
shouted
but
smurov
the
lefthanded
boy
needed
no
telling
and
at
once
revenged
himself
he
threw
a
stone
but
it
missed
the
boy
and
hit
the
ground
the
boy
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
the
pocket
of
whose
coat
was
visibly
bulging
with
stones
flung
another
stone
at
the
group
this
time
it
flew
straight
at
alyosha
and
hit
him
painfully
on
the
shoulder
he
aimed
it
at
you
he
meant
it
for
you
you
are
karamazov
karamazov
the
boys
shouted
laughing
come
all
throw
at
him
at
once
and
six
stones
flew
at
the
boy
one
struck
the
boy
on
the
head
and
he
fell
down
but
at
once
leapt
up
and
began
ferociously
returning
their
fire
both
sides
threw
stones
incessantly
many
of
the
group
had
their
pockets
full
too
what
are
you
about
arent
you
ashamed
six
against
one
why
youll
kill
him
cried
alyosha
he
ran
forward
and
met
the
flying
stones
to
screen
the
solitary
boy
three
or
four
ceased
throwing
for
a
minute
he
began
first
cried
a
boy
in
a
red
shirt
in
an
angry
childish
voice
he
is
a
beast
he
stabbed
krassotkin
in
class
the
other
day
with
a
penknife
it
bled
krassotkin
wouldnt
tell
tales
but
he
must
be
thrashed
but
what
for
i
suppose

him
there

sent
a
stone
in
your
back

the
children
its

all
of
you
at
him
again
dont

smurov
and
again
a
fire
of
stones
and
a
very
vicious
one
began
the
boy
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
was
hit
in
the
chest
he
screamed
began
to
cry
and
ran
away
uphill
towards
mihailovsky
street
they
all
shouted
aha

is
running

know
what

beast

karamazov
killing

too
good
for
him
said
the
boy
in
the
jacket
with
flashing
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
the
eldest
whats
wrong
with
him
asked
alyosha
is
he
a
telltale
or
what
the
boys
looked
at
one
another
as
though
derisively
are
you
going
that
way
to
mihailovsky
the
same
boy
went
on
catch
him
up
you
see
hes
stopped
again
he
is
waiting
and
looking
at
you
he
is
looking
at
you
the
other
boys
chimed
in
you
ask
him
does

like
a
disheveled
wisp
of
tow
do
you
hear
ask
him
that
there
was
a
general
burst
of
laughter
alyosha
looked
at
them
and
they
at
him
dont
go
near
him
hell
hurt
you
cried
smurov
in
a
warning
voice
i
shant
ask
him
about

wisp
of
tow
for
i
expect

him
with
that
question
somehow
but
ill

out
from
him
why
you
hate
him
so
find
out
then
find
out
cried
the
boys
laughing
alyosha
crossed
the
bridge
and
walked
uphill
by
the
fence
straight
towards
the
boy
youd
better
look
out
the
boys
called
after
him
he
wont
be
afraid
of
you
he
will
stab
you
in
a
minute
on
the
sly
as
he
did
krassotkin
the
boy
waited
for
him
without
budging
coming
up
to
him
alyosha
saw
facing
him
a
child
of
about
nine
years
old
he
was
an
undersized
weakly
boy
with
a
thin
pale
face
with
large
dark
eyes
that
gazed
at
him
vindictively
he
was
dressed
in
a
rather
shabby
old
overcoat
which
he
had
monstrously
outgrown
his
bare
arms
stuck
out
beyond
his
sleeves
there
was
a
large
patch
on
the
right
knee
of
his
trousers
and
in
his
right
boot
just
at
the
toe
there
was
a
big
hole
in
the
leather
carefully
blackened
with
ink
both
the
pockets
of
his
greatcoat
were
weighed
down
with
stones
alyosha
stopped
two
steps
in
front
of
him
looking
inquiringly
at
him
the
boy
seeing
at
once
from
alyoshas
eyes
that
he
wouldnt
beat
him
became
less
defiant
and
addressed
him
first
i
am
alone
and
there
are
six
of
them
ill
beat
them
all
alone
he
said
suddenly
with
flashing
eyes
i
think
one
of
the
stones
must
have
hurt
you
badly
observed
alyosha
but
i
hit
smurov
on
the
head
cried
the
boy
they
told
me
that
you
know
me
and
that
you
threw
a
stone
at
me
on
purpose
said
alyosha
the
boy
looked
darkly
at
him
i
dont
know
you
do
you
know
me
alyosha
continued
let
me
alone
the
boy
cried
irritably
but
he
did
not
move
as
though
he
were
expecting
something
and
again
there
was
a
vindictive
light
in
his
eyes
very
well
i
am
going
said
alyosha
only
i
dont
know
you
and
i
dont
tease
you
they
told
me
how
they
tease
you
but
i
dont
want
to
tease
you
goodby
monk
in
silk
trousers
cried
the
boy
following
alyosha
with
the
same
vindictive
and
defiant
expression
and
he
threw
himself
into
an
attitude
of
defense
feeling
sure
that
now
alyosha
would
fall
upon
him
but
alyosha
turned
looked
at
him
and
walked
away
he
had
not
gone
three
steps
before
the
biggest
stone
the
boy
had
in
his
pocket
hit
him
a
painful
blow
in
the
back
so
youll
hit
a
man
from
behind
they
tell
the
truth
then
when
they
say
that
you
attack
on
the
sly
said
alyosha
turning
round
again
this
time
the
boy
threw
a
stone
savagely
right
into
alyoshas
face
but
alyosha
just
had
time
to
guard
himself
and
the
stone
struck
him
on
the
elbow
arent
you
ashamed
what
have
i
done
to
you
he
cried
the
boy
waited
in
silent
defiance
certain
that
now
alyosha
would
attack
him
seeing
that
even
now
he
would
not
his
rage
was
like
a
little
wild
beasts
he
flew
at
alyosha
himself
and
before
alyosha
had
time
to
move
the
spiteful
child
had
seized
his
left
hand
with
both
of
his
and
bit
his
middle
finger
he
fixed
his
teeth
in
it
and
it
was
ten
seconds
before
he
let
go
alyosha
cried
out
with
pain
and
pulled
his
finger
away
with
all
his
might
the
child
let
go
at
last
and
retreated
to
his
former
distance
alyoshas
finger
had
been
badly
bitten
to
the
bone
close
to
the
nail
it
began
to
bleed
alyosha
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
bound
it
tightly
round
his
injured
hand
he
was
a
full
minute
bandaging
it
the
boy
stood
waiting
all
the
time
at
last
alyosha
raised
his
gentle
eyes
and
looked
at
him
very
well
he
said
you
see
how
badly
youve
bitten
me
thats
enough
isnt
it
now
tell
me
what
have
i
done
to
you
the
boy
stared
in
amazement
though
i
dont
know
you
and
its
the
first
time
ive
seen
you
alyosha
went
on
with
the
same
serenity
yet
i
must
have
done
something
to

wouldnt
have
hurt
me
like
this
for
nothing
so
what
have
i
done
how
have
i
wronged
you
tell
me
instead
of
answering
the
boy
broke
into
a
loud
tearful
wail
and
ran
away
alyosha
walked
slowly
after
him
towards
mihailovsky
street
and
for
a
long
time
he
saw
the
child
running
in
the
distance
as
fast
as
ever
not
turning
his
head
and
no
doubt
still
keeping
up
his
tearful
wail
he
made
up
his
mind
to
find
him
out
as
soon
as
he
had
time
and
to
solve
this
mystery
just
now
he
had
not
the
time
chapter
iv
at
the
hohlakovs
alyosha

house
a
handsome
stone
house
of
two
stories
one
of
the
finest
in
our
town
though
madame
hohlakov

most
of
her
time
in
another
province
where
she
had
an
estate
or
in
moscow
where
she
had
a
house
of
her
own
yet
she
had
a
house
in
our
town
too
inherited
from
her
forefathers
the
estate
in
our
district
was
the
largest
of
her
three
estates
yet
she
had
been
very
little
in
our
province
before
this
time
she
ran
out
to
alyosha

the
hall

her
utmost
to
control
it
alyosha

more
than

he
oh

eyes
and
see
that

all
nonsense
all
nonsense
i
should
be
very
grateful
alyosha
interrupted
suddenly
if
you
could
give
me
a
clean
rag
to
bind
up
my
finger
with
i
have
hurt
it
and
its
very
painful
alyosha
unbound
his
bitten
finger
the
handkerchief
was
soaked
with
blood
madame
hohlakov
screamed
and
shut
her
eyes
good
heavens
what
a
wound
how
awful
but
as
soon
as
lise
saw
alyoshas
finger
through
the
crack
she
flung
the
door
wide
open
come
come
here
she
cried
imperiously
no
nonsense
now
good
heavens
why
did
you
stand
there
saying
nothing
about
it
all
this
time
he
might
have
bled
to
death
mamma
how
did
you
do
it
water
water
you
must
wash
it
first
of
all
simply
hold
it
in
cold
water
to
stop
the
pain
and
keep
it
there
keep
it
there
make
haste
mamma
some
water
in
a
slopbasin
but

she
finished
nervously
she
was
quite
frightened
at
the
sight
of
alyoshas
wound
shouldnt
we
send
for
herzenstube
cried
madame
hohlakov
mamma

slowcoach
and
never
can
come
quickly
make
haste
mamma
or
i
shall
die
why
its
nothing
much
cried
alyosha
frightened
at
this
alarm
yulia
ran
in
with
water
and
alyosha
put
his
finger
in
it
some
lint
mamma
for
mercys
sake
bring
some
lint
and
that
muddy
caustic
lotion
for
wounds
whats
it
called
weve
got
some
you
know
where
the
bottle
is
mamma
its
in
your
bedroom
in
the
righthand
cupboard
theres
a
big
bottle
of
it
there
with
the
lint
ill
bring
everything
in
a
minute
lise
only
dont
scream
and
dont
fuss
you
see
how
bravely
alexey
fyodorovitch
bears
it
where
did
you
get
such
a
dreadful
wound
alexey
fyodorovitch
madame
hohlakov
hastened
away
this
was
all
lise
was
waiting
for
first
of
all
answer
the
question
where
did
you
get
hurt
like
this
she
asked
alyosha
quickly
and
then
ill
talk
to
you
about
something
quite
different
well
instinctively
feeling
that
the
time
of
her
mothers
absence
was
precious
for
her
alyosha
hastened
to
tell
her
of
his
enigmatic
meeting
with
the
schoolboys
in
the
fewest
words
possible
lise
clasped
her
hands
at
his
story
how
can
you
and
in
that
dress
too
associate
with
schoolboys
she
cried
angrily
as
though
she
had
a
right
to
control
him
you
are
nothing
but
a
boy
yourself
if
you
can
do
that
a
perfect
boy
but
you
must
find
out
for
me
about
that
horrid
boy
and
tell
me
all
about
it
for
theres
some
mystery
in
it
now
for
the
second
thing
but
first
a
question
does
the
pain
prevent
you
talking
about
utterly
unimportant
things
but
talking
sensibly
of
course
not
and
i
dont
feel
much
pain
now
thats
because
your
finger
is
in
the
water
it
must
be
changed
directly
for
it
will
get
warm
in
a
minute
yulia
bring
some
ice
from
the
cellar
and
another
basin
of
water
now
she
is
gone
i
can
speak
will
you
give
me
the
letter
i
sent
you
yesterday
dear
alexey
fyodorovitchbe
quick
for
mamma

be
back
in
a
minute
and
i
dont
want
i
havent
got
the
letter
thats
not
true
you

i
knew
you
would

that
pocket
ive
been
regretting
that
joke
all
night
give
me
back
the
letter
at
once
give
it
me
ive
left
it
at
home
but
you
cant
consider
me
as
a
child
a
little
girl
after
that
silly
joke
i
beg
your
pardon
for
that
silliness
but
you
must
bring
me
the
letter
if
you
really
havent
got
itbring
it
today
you
must
you
must
today
i
cant
possibly
for
i
am
going
back
to
the
monastery
and
i
shant
come
and
see
you
for
the
next
two
daysthree
or
four
perhapsfor
father
zossima
four
days
what
nonsense
listen
did
you
laugh
at
me
very
much
i
didnt
laugh
at
all
why
not
because
i
believed
all
you
said
you
are
insulting
me
not
at
all
as
soon
as
i
read
it
i
thought
that
all
that
would
come
to
pass
for
as
soon
as
father
zossima
dies
i
am
to
leave
the
monastery
then
i
shall
go

my
studies
and

the
legal
age
we
will
be
married
i
shall
love
you
though
i
havent
had
time
to
think
about
it
i
believe
i
couldnt
find
a
better
wife
than
you
and
father
zossima
tells
me
i
must
marry
but
i
am
a
cripple
wheeled
about
in
a
chair
laughed
lise
flushing
crimson
ill
wheel
you
about
myself
but
im
sure
youll
get
well
by
then
but
you
are
mad
said
lise
nervously
to
make
all
this
nonsense
out
of
a
joke
heres
mamma
very

propos
perhaps
mamma
how
slow
you
always
are
how
can
you
be
so
long
and
heres
yulia
with
the
ice
oh
lise
dont
scream
above
all
things
dont
scream
that
scream
drives
me

how
can
i
help
it
when
you
put
the
lint
in
another
place
ive
been
hunting
and
huntingi
do
believe
you
did
it
on
purpose
but
i
couldnt
tell
that
he
would
come
with
a
bad
finger
or
else
perhaps
i
might
have
done
it
on
purpose
my
darling
mamma
you
begin
to
say
really
witty
things
never
mind
my
being
witty
but
i
must
say
you
show
nice
feeling
for
alexey
fyodorovitchs
sufferings
oh
my
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
whats
killing
me
is
no
one
thing
in
particular
not
herzenstube
but
everything
together
thats
what
is
too
much
for
me
thats
enough
mamma
enough
about
herzenstube
lise
laughed
gayly
make
haste
with
the
lint
and
the
lotion
mamma
thats
simply
goulards
water
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
remember
the
name
now
but
its
a
splendid
lotion
would
you
believe
it
mamma
on
the
way
here
he
had
a
fight
with
the
boys
in
the
street
and
it
was
a
boy
bit
his
finger
isnt
he
a
child
a
child
himself
is
he
fit
to
be
married
after
that
for
only
fancy
he
wants
to
be
married
mamma
just
think
of
him
married
wouldnt
it
be
funny
wouldnt
it
be
awful
and
lise
kept
laughing
her
thin
hysterical
giggle
looking
slyly
at
alyosha
but
why
married
lise
what
makes
you
talk
of
such
a
thing
its
quite
out
of
placeand
perhaps
the
boy
was
rabid
why
mamma
as
though
there
were
rabid
boys
why
not
lise
as
though
i
had
said
something
stupid
your
boy
might
have
been
bitten
by
a
mad
dog
and
he
would
become
mad
and
bite
any
one
near
him
how
well
she
has
bandaged
it
alexey
fyodorovitch

couldnt
have
done
it

much
now
you
dont
feel
afraid
of
water
asked
lise

thats
enough
lise

i
really
was
rather
too
quick
talking
of
the
boy
being
rabid
and
you
pounced
upon
it
at
once
katerina
ivanovna

rapid
whisper

dont

most
fantastic
farce

her
utmost
to

herself

chapter
v
a
laceration
in
the
drawingroom
but
in
the
drawingroom
the
conversation
was
already
over
katerina
ivanovna
was
greatly
excited
though
she
looked
resolute
at
the
moment
alyosha
and
madame
hohlakov
entered
ivan
fyodorovitch
stood
up
to
take
leave
his
face
was
rather
pale
and
alyosha
looked
at
him
anxiously
for
this
moment
was
to
solve
a
doubt
a
harassing
enigma
which
had
for
some
time
haunted
alyosha
during
the
preceding
month
it
had
been
several
times
suggested
to
him
that
his
brother
ivan
was
in
love
with
katerina
ivanovna
and
what
was
more
that
he
meant
to
carry
her
off
from
dmitri
until
quite
lately
the
idea
seemed
to
alyosha
monstrous
though
it
worried
him
extremely
he
loved
both
his
brothers
and
dreaded
such
rivalry
between
them
meantime
dmitri
had
said
outright
on
the
previous
day
that
he
was
glad
that
ivan
was
his
rival
and
that
it
was
a
great
assistance
to
him
dmitri
in
what
way
did
it
assist
him
to
marry
grushenka
but
that
alyosha
considered
the
worst
thing
possible
besides
all
this
alyosha
had
till
the
evening
before
implicitly
believed
that
katerina
ivanovna
had
a
steadfast
and
passionate
love
for
dmitri
but
he
had
only
believed
it
till
the
evening
before
he
had
fancied
too
that
she
was
incapable
of
loving
a
man
like
ivan
and
that
she
did
love
dmitri
and
loved
him
just
as
he
was
in
spite
of
all
the
strangeness
of
such
a
passion
but
during
yesterdays
scene
with
grushenka
another
idea
had
struck
him
the
word
lacerating
which
madame
hohlakov
had
just
uttered
almost
made
him
start
because
half
waking
up
towards
daybreak
that
night
he
had
cried
out
laceration
laceration
probably
applying
it
to
his
dream
he
had
been
dreaming
all
night
of
the
previous
days
scene
at
katerina
ivanovnas
now
alyosha
was
impressed
by
madame
hohlakovs
blunt
and
persistent
assertion
that
katerina
ivanovna
was
in
love
with
ivan
and
only
deceived
herself
through
some
sort
of
pose
from
selflaceration
and
tortured
herself
by
her
pretended
love
for
dmitri
from
some
fancied
duty
of
gratitude
yes
he
thought
perhaps
the
whole
truth
lies
in
those
words
but
in
that
case
what
was
ivans
position
alyosha
felt
instinctively
that
a
character
like
katerina
ivanovnas
must
dominate
and
she
could
only
dominate
some
one
like
dmitri
and
never
a
man
like
ivan
for
dmitri
might
at
last
submit
to
her
domination
to
his
own
happiness
which
was
what
alyosha
would
have
desired
but
ivanno
ivan
could
not
submit
to
her
and
such
submission
would
not
give
him
happiness
alyosha
could
not
help
believing
that
of
ivan
and
now
all
these
doubts
and
reflections
flitted
through
his
mind
as
he
entered
the
drawingroom
another
idea
too
forced
itself
upon
him
what
if
she
loved
neither
of
themneither
ivan
nor
dmitri
it
must
be
noted
that
alyosha
felt
as
it
were
ashamed
of
his
own
thoughts
and
blamed
himself
when
they
kept
recurring
to
him
during
the
last
month
what
do
i
know
about
love
and
women
and
how
can
i
decide
such
questions
he
thought
reproachfully
after
such
doubts
and
surmises
and
yet
it
was
impossible
not
to
think
about
it
he
felt
instinctively
that
this
rivalry
was
of
immense
importance
in
his
brothers
lives
and
that
a
great
deal
depended
upon
it
one
reptile
will
devour
the
other
ivan
had
pronounced
the
day
before
speaking
in
anger
of
his
father
and
dmitri
so
ivan
looked
upon
dmitri
as
a
reptile
and
perhaps
had
long
done
so
was
it
perhaps
since
he
had
known
katerina
ivanovna
that
phrase
had
of
course
escaped
ivan
unawares
yesterday
but
that
only
made
it
more
important
if
he
felt
like
that
what
chance
was
there
of
peace
were
there
not
on
the
contrary
new
grounds
for
hatred
and
hostility
in
their
family
and
with
which
of
them
was
alyosha
to
sympathize
and
what
was
he
to
wish
for
each
of
them
he
loved
them
both
but
what
could
he
desire
for
each
in
the
midst
of
these
conflicting
interests
he
might
go
quite
astray
in
this
maze
and
alyoshas
heart
could
not
endure
uncertainty
because
his
love
was
always
of
an
active
character
he
was
incapable
of
passive
love
if
he
loved
any
one
he
set
to
work
at
once
to
help
him
and
to
do
so
he
must
know
what
he
was
aiming
at
he
must
know
for
certain
what
was
best
for
each
and
having
ascertained
this
it
was
natural
for
him
to
help
them
both
but
instead
of
a
definite
aim
he
found
nothing
but
uncertainty
and
perplexity
on
all
sides
it
was
lacerating
as
was
said
just
now
but
what
could
he
understand
even
in
this
laceration
he
did
not
understand
the
first
word
in
this
perplexing
maze
seeing
alyosha
katerina
ivanovna
said
quickly
and
joyfully
to
ivan
who
had
already
got
up
to
go
a
minute
stay
another
minute
i
want
to
hear
the
opinion
of
this
person
here
whom
i
trust
absolutely
dont
go
away
she
added
addressing
madame
hohlakov
she
made
alyosha
sit
down
beside
her
and
madame
hohlakov
sat
opposite
by
ivan
you
are
all
my
friends
here
all
i
have
in
the
world
my
dear
friends
she
began
warmly
in
a
voice
which
quivered
with
genuine
tears
of
suffering
and
alyoshas
heart
warmed
to
her
at
once
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
were
witness
yesterday
of
that
abominable
scene
and
saw
what
i
did
you
did
not
see
it
ivan
fyodorovitch
he
did
what
he
thought
of
me
yesterday
i
dont
know
i
only
know
one
thing
that
if
it
were
repeated
today
this
minute
i
should
express
the
same
feelings
again
as
yesterdaythe
same
feelings
the
same
words
the
same
actions
you
remember
my
actions
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
checked
me
in
one
of
them

as
she
said
that
she
flushed
and
her
eyes
shone
i
must
tell
you
that
i
cant
get
over
it
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
dont
even
know
whether
i
still
love
him
i
feel
pity
for
him
and
that
is
a
poor
sign
of
love
if
i
loved
him
if
i
still
loved
him
perhaps
i
shouldnt
be
sorry
for
him
now
but
should
hate
him
her
voice
quivered
and
tears
glittered
on
her
eyelashes
alyosha
shuddered
inwardly
that
girl
is
truthful
and
sincere
he
thought
and
she
does
not
love
dmitri
any
more
thats
true
thats
true
cried
madame
hohlakov
wait
dear
i
havent
told
you
the
chief
the
final
decision
i
came
to
during
the
night
i
feel
that
perhaps
my
decision
is
a
terrible
onefor
me
but
i
foresee
that
nothing
will
induce
me
to
change
itnothing
it
will
be
so
all
my
life
my
dear
kind
everfaithful
and
generous
adviser
the
one
friend
i
have
in
the
world
ivan
fyodorovitch
with
his
deep
insight
into
the
heart
approves
and
commends
my
decision
he
knows
it
yes
i
approve
of
it
ivan
assented
in
a
subdued
but
firm
voice
but
i
should
like
alyosha
too
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
forgive
my
calling
you
simply
alyosha
i
should
like
alexey
fyodorovitch
too
to
tell
me
before
my
two
friends
whether
i
am
right
i
feel
instinctively
that
you
alyosha
my
dear
brother
for
you
are
a
dear
brother
to
me
she
said
again
ecstatically
taking
his
cold
hand
in
her
hot
one
i
foresee
that
your
decision
your
approval
will
bring
me
peace
in
spite
of
all
my
sufferings
for
after
your
words
i
shall
be
calm
and
submiti
feel
that
i
dont
know
what
you
are
asking
me
said
alyosha
flushing
i
only
know
that
i
love
you
and
at
this
moment
wish
for
your
happiness
more
than
my
own
but
i
know
nothing
about
such
affairs
something
impelled
him
to
add
hurriedly
in
such
affairs
alexey
fyodorovitch
in
such
affairs
the
chief
thing
is
honor
and
duty
and
something
higheri
dont
know
whatbut
higher
perhaps
even
than
duty
i
am
conscious
of
this
irresistible
feeling
in
my
heart
and
it
compels
me
irresistibly
but
it
may
all
be
put
in
two
words
ive
already
decided
even
if
he
marries
thatcreature
she
began
solemnly
whom
i
never
never
can
forgive
even
then
i
will
not
abandon
him
henceforward
i
will
never
never
abandon
him
she
cried
breaking
into
a
sort
of
pale
hysterical
ecstasy
not
that
i
would
run
after
him
continually
get
in
his
way
and
worry
him
oh
no
i
will
go
away
to
another
townwhere
you
likebut
i
will
watch
over
him
all
my
lifei
will
watch
over
him
all
my
life
unceasingly
when
he
becomes
unhappy
with
that
woman
and
that
is
bound
to
happen
quite
soon
let
him
come
to
me
and
he
will
find
a
friend
a
sister
only
a
sister
of
course
and
so
for
ever
but
he
will
learn
at
least
that
that
sister
is
really
his
sister
who
loves
him
and
has
sacrificed
all
her
life
to
him
i
will
gain
my
point
i
will
insist
on
his
knowing
me
and
confiding
entirely
in
me
without
reserve
she
cried
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
i
will
be
a
god
to
whom
he
can
prayand
that
at
least
he
owes
me
for
his
treachery
and
for
what
i
suffered
yesterday
through
him
and
let
him
see
that
all
my
life
i
will
be
true
to
him
and
the
promise
i
gave
him
in
spite
of
his
being
untrue
and
betraying
me
i
willi
will
become
nothing
but
a
means
for
his
happiness
orhow
shall
i
sayan
instrument
a
machine
for
his
happiness
and
that
for
my
whole
life
my
whole
life
and
that
he
may
see
that
all
his
life
thats
my
decision
ivan
fyodorovitch
fully
approves
me
she
was
breathless
she
had
perhaps
intended
to
express
her
idea
with
more
dignity
art
and
naturalness
but
her
speech
was
too
hurried
and
crude
it
was
full
of
youthful
impulsiveness
it
betrayed
that
she
was
still
smarting
from
yesterdays
insult
and
that
her
pride
craved
satisfaction
she
felt
this
herself
her
face
suddenly
darkened
an
unpleasant
look
came
into
her
eyes
alyosha
at
once
saw
it
and
felt
a
pang
of
sympathy
his
brother
ivan
made
it
worse
by
adding
ive
only
expressed
my
own
view
he
said
from
any
one
else
this
would
have
been
affected
and
overstrained
but
from
youno
any
other
woman
would
have
been
wrong
but
you
are
right
i
dont
know
how
to
explain
it
but
i
see
that
you
are
absolutely
genuine
and
therefore
you
are
right
but
thats
only
for
the
moment
and
what
does
this
moment
stand
for
nothing
but
yesterdays
insult
madame
hohlakov
obviously
had
not
intended
to
interfere
but
she
could
not
refrain
from
this
very
just
comment
quite
so
quite
so
cried
ivan
with
peculiar
eagerness
obviously
annoyed
at
being
interrupted
in
any
one
else
this
moment
would
be
only
due
to
yesterdays
impression
and
would
be
only
a
moment
but
with
katerina
ivanovnas
character
that
moment
will
last
all
her
life
what
for
any
one
else
would
be
only
a
promise
is
for
her
an
everlasting
burdensome
grim
perhaps
but
unflagging
duty
and
she
will
be
sustained
by
the
feeling
of
this
duty
being
fulfilled
your
life
katerina
ivanovna
will
henceforth
be
spent
in
painful
brooding
over
your
own
feelings
your
own
heroism
and
your
own
suffering
but
in
the
end
that
suffering
will
be
softened
and
will
pass
into
sweet
contemplation
of
the
fulfillment
of
a
bold
and
proud
design
yes
proud
it
certainly
is
and
desperate
in
any
case
but
a
triumph
for
you
and
the
consciousness
of
it
will
at
last
be
a
source
of
complete
satisfaction
and
will
make
you
resigned
to
everything
else
this
was
unmistakably
said
with
some
malice
and
obviously
with
intention
even
perhaps
with
no
desire
to
conceal
that
he
spoke
ironically
and
with
intention
oh
dear
how
mistaken
it
all
is
madame
hohlakov
cried
again
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
speak
i
want
dreadfully
to
know
what
you
will
say
cried
katerina
ivanovna
and
burst
into
tears
alyosha
got
up
from
the
sofa
its
nothing
nothing
she
went
on
through
her
tears
im
upset
i
didnt
sleep
last
night
but
by
the
side
of
two
such
friends
as
you
and
your
brother
i
still
feel
strongfor
i
knowyou
two
will
never
desert
me
unluckily
i
am
obliged
to
return
to
moscowperhaps
tomorrowand
to
leave
you
for
a
long
timeand
unluckily
its
unavoidable
ivan
said
suddenly
tomorrowto
moscow
her
face
was
suddenly
contorted
butbut
dear
me
how
fortunate
she
cried
in
a
voice
suddenly
changed
in
one
instant
there
was
no
trace
left
of
her
tears
she
underwent
an
instantaneous
transformation
which
amazed
alyosha
instead
of
a
poor
insulted
girl
weeping
in
a
sort
of
laceration
he
saw
a
woman
completely
self
possessed
and
even
exceedingly
pleased
as
though
something
agreeable
had
just
happened
oh
not
fortunate
that
i
am
losing
you
of
course
not
she
corrected
herself
suddenly
with
a
charming
society
smile
such
a
friend
as
you
are
could
not
suppose
that
i
am
only
too
unhappy
at
losing
you
she
rushed
impulsively
at
ivan
and
seizing
both
his
hands
pressed
them
warmly
but
what
is
fortunate
is
that
you
will
be
able
in
moscow
to
see
auntie
and
agafya
and
to
tell
them
all
the
horror
of
my
present
position
you
can
speak
with
complete
openness
to
agafya
but
spare
dear
auntie
you
will
know
how
to
do
that
you
cant
think
how
wretched
i
was
yesterday
and
this
morning
wondering
how
i
could
write
them
that
dreadful
letterfor
one
can
never
tell
such
things
in
a
letter
now
it
will
be
easy
for
me
to
write
for
you
will
see
them
and
explain
everything
oh
how
glad
i
am
but
i
am
only
glad
of
that
believe
me
of
course
no
one
can
take
your
place
i
will
run
at
once
to
write
the
letter
she
finished
suddenly
and
took
a
step
as
though
to
go
out
of
the
room
and
what
about
alyosha
and
his
opinion
which
you
were
so
desperately
anxious
to
hear
cried
madame
hohlakov
there
was
a
sarcastic
angry
note
in
her
voice
i
had
not
forgotten
that
cried
katerina
ivanovna
coming
to
a
sudden
standstill
and
why
are
you
so
antagonistic
at
such
a
moment
she
added
with
warm
and
bitter
reproachfulness
what
i
said
i
repeat
i
must
have
his
opinion
more
than
that
i
must
have
his
decision
as
he
says
so
it
shall
be
you
see
how
anxious
i
am
for
your
words
alexey
fyodorovitch
but
whats
the
matter
i
couldnt
have
believed
it
i
cant
understand
it
alyosha
cried
suddenly
in
distress
what
what
he
is
going
to
moscow
and
you
cry
out
that
you
are
glad
you
said
that
on
purpose
and
you
begin
explaining
that
you
are
not
glad
of
that
but
sorry
to
belosing
a
friend
but
that
was
acting
tooyou
were
playing
a
partas
in
a
theater
in
a
theater
what
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
katerina
ivanovna
profoundly
astonished
flushing
crimson
and
frowning
though
you
assure
him
you
are
sorry
to
lose
a
friend
in
him
you
persist
in
telling
him
to
his
face
that
its
fortunate
he
is
going
said
alyosha
breathlessly
he
was
standing
at
the
table
and
did
not
sit
down
what
are
you
talking
about
i
dont
understand
i
dont
understand
myself
i
seemed
to
see
in
a
flash

i
know
i
am
not
saying
it
properly
but
ill
say
it
all
the
same
alyosha
went
on
in
the
same
shaking
and
broken
voice
what
i
see
is
that
perhaps
you
dont
love
dmitri
at
all

and
never
have
from
the
beginning
and
dmitri
too
has
never
loved
you

and
only
esteems
you
i
really
dont
know
how
i
dare
to
say
all
this
but
somebody
must
tell
the
truth

for
nobody
here
will
tell
the
truth
what
truth
cried
katerina
ivanovna
and
there
was
an
hysterical
ring
in
her
voice
ill
tell
you
alyosha
went
on
with
desperate
haste
as
though
he
were
jumping
from
the
top
of
a
house
call
dmitri
i
will
fetch
himand
let
him
come
here
and
take
your
hand
and
take
ivans
and
join
your
hands
for
youre
torturing
ivan
simply
because
you
love
himand
torturing
him
because
you
love
dmitri
through
selflacerationwith
an
unreal
lovebecause
youve
persuaded
yourself
alyosha
broke
off
and
was
silent
you

you

you
are
a
little
religious
idiotthats
what
you
are
katerina
ivanovna
snapped
her
face
was
white
and
her
lips
were
moving
with
anger
ivan
suddenly
laughed
and
got
up
his
hat
was
in
his
hand
you
are
mistaken
my
good
alyosha
he
said
with
an
expression
alyosha
had
never
seen
in
his
face
beforean
expression
of
youthful
sincerity
and
strong
irresistibly
frank
feeling
katerina
ivanovna
has
never
cared
for
me
she
has
known
all
the
time
that
i
cared
for
herthough
i
never
said
a
word
of
my
love
to
hershe
knew
but
she
didnt
care
for
me
i
have
never
been
her
friend
either
not
for
one
moment
she
is
too
proud
to
need
my
friendship
she
kept
me
at
her
side
as
a
means
of
revenge
she
revenged
with
me
and
on
me
all
the
insults
which
she
has
been
continually
receiving
from
dmitri
ever
since
their
first
meeting
for
even
that
first
meeting
has
rankled
in
her
heart
as
an
insultthats
what
her
heart
is
like
she
has
talked
to
me
of
nothing
but
her
love
for
him
i
am
going
now
but
believe
me
katerina
ivanovna
you
really
love
him
and
the
more
he
insults
you
the
more
you
love
himthats
your
laceration
you
love
him
just
as
he
is
you
love
him
for
insulting
you
if
he
reformed
youd
give
him
up
at
once
and
cease
to
love
him
but
you
need
him
so
as
to
contemplate
continually
your
heroic
fidelity
and
to
reproach
him
for
infidelity
and
it
all
comes
from
your
pride
oh
theres
a
great
deal
of
humiliation
and
selfabasement
about
it
but
it
all
comes
from
pride
i
am
too
young
and
ive
loved
you
too
much
i
know
that
i
ought
not
to
say
this
that
it
would
be
more
dignified
on
my
part
simply
to
leave
you
and
it
would
be
less
offensive
for
you
but
i
am
going
far
away
and
shall
never
come
back
it
is
for
ever
i
dont
want
to
sit
beside
a
laceration
but
i
dont
know
how
to
speak
now
ive
said
everything
goodby
katerina
ivanovna
you
cant
be
angry
with
me
for
i
am
a
hundred
times
more
severely
punished
than
you
if
only
by
the
fact
that
i
shall
never
see
you
again
goodby
i
dont
want
your
hand
you
have
tortured
me
too
deliberately
for
me
to
be
able
to
forgive
you
at
this
moment
i
shall
forgive
you
later
but
now
i
dont
want
your
hand

he
added
with
a
forced
smile
showing
however
that
he
could
read
schiller
and
read
him
till
he
knew
him
by
heartwhich
alyosha
would
never
have
believed
he
went
out
of
the
room
without
saying
goodby
even
to
his
hostess
madame
hohlakov
alyosha
clasped
his
hands
ivan
he
cried
desperately
after
him
come
back
ivan
no
nothing
will
induce
him
to
come
back
now
he
cried
again
regretfully
realizing
it
but
its
my
fault
my
fault
i
began
it
ivan
spoke
angrily
wrongly
unjustly
and
angrily
he
must
come
back
here
come
back
alyosha
kept
exclaiming
frantically
katerina
ivanovna
went
suddenly
into
the
next
room
you
have
done
no
harm
you
behaved
beautifully
like
an
angel
madame
hohlakov
whispered
rapidly
and
ecstatically
to
alyosha
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
prevent
ivan
fyodorovitch
from
going
her
face
beamed
with
delight
to
the
great
distress
of
alyosha
but
katerina
ivanovna
suddenly
returned
she
had
two
hundredrouble
notes
in
her
hand
i
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
began
addressing
alyosha
with
an
apparently
calm
and
even
voice
as
though
nothing
had
happened
a
weekyes
i
think
it
was
a
week
agodmitri
fyodorovitch
was
guilty
of
a
hasty
and
unjust
actiona
very
ugly
action
there
is
a
low
tavern
here
and
in
it
he
met
that
discharged
officer
that
captain
whom
your
father
used
to
employ
in
some
business
dmitri
fyodorovitch
somehow
lost
his
temper
with
this
captain
seized
him
by
the
beard
and
dragged
him
out
into
the
street
and
for
some
distance
along
it
in
that
insulting
fashion
and
i
am
told
that
his
son
a
boy
quite
a
child
who
is
at
the
school
here
saw
it
and
ran
beside
them
crying
and
begging
for
his
father
appealing
to
every
one
to
defend
him
while
every
one
laughed
you
must
forgive
me
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
cannot
think
without
indignation
of
that
disgraceful
action
of
his

one
of
those
actions
of
which
only
dmitri
fyodorovitch
would
be
capable
in
his
anger

and
in
his
passions
i
cant
describe
it
even
i
cant
find
my
words
ive
made
inquiries
about
his
victim
and
find
he
is
quite
a
poor
man
his
name
is
snegiryov
he
did
something
wrong
in
the
army
and
was
discharged
i
cant
tell
you
what
and
now
he
has
sunk
into
terrible
destitution
with
his
familyan
unhappy
family
of
sick
children
and
i
believe
an
insane
wife
he
has
been
living
here
a
long
time
he
used
to
work
as
a
copying
clerk
but
now
he
is
getting
nothing
i
thought
if
you

that
is
i
thought

i
dont
know
i
am
so
confused
you
see
i
wanted
to
ask
you
my
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
to
go
to
him
to
find
some
excuse
to
go
to
themi
mean
to
that
captainoh
goodness
how
badly
i
explain
itand
delicately
carefully
as
only
you
know
how
to
alyosha
blushed
manage
to
give
him
this
assistance
these
two
hundred
roubles
he
will
be
sure
to
take
it
i
mean
persuade
him
to
take
it
or
rather
what
do
i
mean
you
see
its
not
by
way
of
compensation
to
prevent
him
from
taking
proceedings
for
i
believe
he
meant
to
but
simply
a
token
of
sympathy
of
a
desire
to
assist
him
from
me
dmitri
fyodorovitchs
betrothed
not
from
himself
but
you
know
i
would
go
myself
but
youll
know
how
to
do
it
ever
so
much
better
he
lives
in
lake
street
in
the
house
of
a
woman
called
kalmikov
for
gods
sake
alexey
fyodorovitch
do
it
for
me
and
now

now
i
am
rather

tired
good
by
she
turned
and
disappeared
behind
the
portire
so
quickly
that
alyosha
had
not
time
to
utter
a
word
though
he
wanted
to
speak
he
longed
to
beg
her
pardon
to
blame
himself
to
say
something
for
his
heart
was
full
and
he
could
not
bear
to
go
out
of
the
room
without
it
but
madame
hohlakov
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
along
with
her
in
the
hall
she
stopped
him
again
as
before
she
is
proud
she
is
struggling
with
herself
but
kind
charming
generous
she
exclaimed
in
a
halfwhisper

sometimes

glad

repeated
unconsoled
hiding
his

when
he
said

that
and
went
out
i
thought
he
was
so
learned
such
a
savant
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
behaved
so
warmly
openly
and
youthfully
with
such
youthful
inexperience
and
it
was
all
so
fine
like
you
and

way
he
repeated
that
german
verse

fly
i
must
fly

madame
hohlakov
at
last
ran
off
before

have
opened
the
door

be
an

an
awful
piece
of
stupidity

i

a
real
sorrow
ill
be
back
directly
but
i
have
a
great
great
sorrow
and
he
ran
out
of
the
room
chapter
vi
a
laceration
in
the
cottage
he
certainly
was
really
grieved
in
a
way
he
had
seldom
been
before
he
had
rushed
in
like
a
fool
and
meddled
in
what
in
a
loveaffair
but
what
do
i
know
about
it
what
can
i
tell
about
such
things
he
repeated
to
himself
for
the
hundredth
time
flushing
crimson
oh
being
ashamed
would
be
nothing
shame
is
only
the
punishment
i
deserve
the
trouble
is
i
shall
certainly
have
caused
more
unhappiness
and
father
zossima
sent
me
to
reconcile
and
bring
them
together
is
this
the
way
to
bring
them
together
then
he
suddenly
remembered
how
he
had
tried
to
join
their
hands
and
he
felt
fearfully
ashamed
again
though
i
acted
quite
sincerely
i
must
be
more
sensible
in
the
future
he
concluded
suddenly
and
did
not
even
smile
at
his
conclusion
katerina
ivanovnas
commission
took
him
to
lake
street
and
his
brother
dmitri
lived
close
by
in
a
turning
out
of
lake
street
alyosha
decided
to
go
to
him
in
any
case
before
going
to
the
captain
though
he
had
a
presentiment
that
he
would
not
find
his
brother
he
suspected
that
he
would
intentionally
keep
out
of
his
way
now
but
he
must
find
him
anyhow
time
was
passing
the
thought
of
his
dying
elder
had
not
left
alyosha
for
one
minute
from
the
time
he
set
off
from
the
monastery
there
was
one
point
which
interested
him
particularly
about
katerina
ivanovnas
commission
when
she
had
mentioned
the
captains
son
the
little
schoolboy
who
had
run
beside
his
father
crying
the
idea
had
at
once
struck
alyosha
that
this
must
be
the
schoolboy
who
had
bitten
his
finger
when
he
alyosha
asked
him
what
he
had
done
to
hurt
him
now
alyosha
felt
practically
certain
of
this
though
he
could
not
have
said
why
thinking
of
another
subject
was
a
relief
and
he
resolved
to
think
no
more
about
the
mischief
he
had
done
and
not
to
torture
himself
with
remorse
but
to
do
what
he
had
to
do
let
come
what
would
at
that
thought
he
was
completely
comforted
turning
to
the
street
where
dmitri
lodged
he
felt
hungry
and
taking
out
of
his
pocket
the
roll
he
had
brought
from
his
fathers
he
ate
it
it
made
him
feel
stronger
dmitri
was
not
at
home
the
people
of
the
house
an
old
cabinetmaker
his
son
and
his
old
wife
looked
with
positive
suspicion
at
alyosha
he
hasnt
slept
here
for
the
last
three
nights
maybe
he
has
gone
away
the
old
man
said
in
answer
to
alyoshas
persistent
inquiries
alyosha
saw
that
he
was
answering
in
accordance
with
instructions
when
he
asked
whether
he
were
not
at
grushenkas
or
in
hiding
at
fomas
alyosha
spoke
so
freely
on
purpose
all
three
looked
at
him
in
alarm
they
are
fond
of
him
they
are
doing
their
best
for
him
thought
alyosha
thats
good
at
last
he
found
the
house
in
lake
street
it
was
a
decrepit
little
house
sunk
on
one
side
with
three
windows
looking
into
the
street
and
with
a
muddy
yard
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
a
solitary
cow
he
crossed
the
yard
and
found
the
door
opening
into
the
passage
on
the
left
of
the
passage
lived
the
old
woman
of
the
house
with
her
old
daughter
both
seemed
to
be
deaf
in
answer
to
his
repeated
inquiry
for
the
captain
one
of
them
at
last
understood
that
he
was
asking
for
their
lodgers
and
pointed
to
a
door
across
the
passage
the
captains
lodging
turned
out
to
be
a
simple
cottage
room
alyosha
had
his
hand
on
the
iron
latch
to
open
the
door
when
he
was
struck
by
the
strange
hush
within
yet
he
knew
from
katerina
ivanovnas
words
that
the
man
had
a
family
either
they
are
all
asleep
or
perhaps
they
have
heard
me
coming
and
are
waiting
for
me
to
open
the
door
id
better
knock
first
and
he
knocked
an
answer
came
but
not
at
once
after
an
interval
of
perhaps
ten
seconds
whos
there
shouted
some
one
in
a
loud
and
very
angry
voice
then
alyosha
opened
the
door
and
crossed
the
threshold
he
found
himself
in
a
regular
peasants
room
though
it
was
large
it
was
cumbered
up
with
domestic
belongings
of
all
sorts
and
there
were
several
people
in
it
on
the
left
was
a
large
russian
stove
from
the
stove
to
the
window
on
the
left
was
a
string
running
across
the
room
and
on
it
there
were
rags
hanging
there
was
a
bedstead
against
the
wall
on
each
side
right
and
left
covered
with
knitted
quilts
on
the
one
on
the
left
was
a
pyramid
of
four
printcovered
pillows
each
smaller
than
the
one
beneath
on
the
other
there
was
only
one
very
small
pillow
the
opposite
corner
was
screened
off
by
a
curtain
or
a
sheet
hung
on
a
string
behind
this
curtain
could
be
seen
a
bed
made
up
on
a
bench
and
a
chair
the
rough
square
table
of
plain
wood
had
been
moved
into
the
middle
window
the
three
windows
which
consisted
each
of
four
tiny
greenish
mildewy
panes
gave
little
light
and
were
close
shut
so
that
the
room
was
not
very
light
and
rather
stuffy
on
the
table
was
a
fryingpan
with
the
remains
of
some
fried
eggs
a
halfeaten
piece
of
bread
and
a
small
bottle
with
a
few
drops
of
vodka
a
woman
of
genteel
appearance
wearing
a
cotton
gown
was
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
bed
on
the
left
her
face
was
thin
and
yellow
and
her
sunken
cheeks
betrayed
at
the
first
glance
that
she
was
ill
but
what
struck
alyosha
most
was
the
expression
in
the
poor
womans
eyesa
look
of
surprised
inquiry
and
yet
of
haughty
pride
and
while
he
was
talking
to
her
husband
her
big
brown
eyes
moved
from
one
speaker
to
the
other
with
the
same
haughty
and
questioning
expression
beside
her
at
the
window
stood
a
young
girl
rather
plain
with
scanty
reddish
hair
poorly
but
very
neatly
dressed
she
looked
disdainfully
at
alyosha
as
he
came
in
beside
the
other
bed
was
sitting
another
female
figure
she
was
a
very
sad
sight
a
young
girl
of
about
twenty
but
hunchback
and
crippled
with
withered
legs
as
alyosha
was
told
afterwards
her
crutches
stood
in
the
corner
close
by
the
strikingly
beautiful
and
gentle
eyes
of
this
poor
girl
looked
with
mild
serenity
at
alyosha
a
man
of
fortyfive
was
sitting
at
the
table
finishing
the
fried
eggs
he
was
spare
small
and
weakly
built
he
had
reddish
hair
and
a
scanty
lightcolored
beard
very
much
like
a
wisp
of
tow
this
comparison
and
the
phrase
a
wisp
of
tow
flashed
at
once
into
alyoshas
mind
for
some
reason
he
remembered
it
afterwards
it
was
obviously
this
gentleman
who
had
shouted
to
him
as
there
was
no
other
man
in
the
room
but
when
alyosha
went
in
he
leapt
up
from
the
bench
on
which
he
was
sitting
and
hastily
wiping
his
mouth
with
a
ragged
napkin
darted
up
to
alyosha
its
a
monk
come
to
beg
for
the
monastery
a
nice
place
to
come
to
the
girl
standing
in
the
left
corner
said
aloud
the
man
spun
round
instantly
towards
her
and
answered
her
in
an
excited
and
breaking
voice
no
varvara
you
are
wrong
allow
me
to
ask
he
turned
again
to
alyosha
what
has
brought
you
toour
retreat
alyosha
looked
attentively
at
him
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
him
there
was
something
angular
flurried
and
irritable
about
him
though
he
had
obviously
just
been
drinking
he
was
not
drunk
there
was
extraordinary
impudence
in
his
expression
and
yet
strange
to
say
at
the
same
time
there
was
fear
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
long
been
kept
in
subjection
and
had
submitted
to
it
and
now
had
suddenly
turned
and
was
trying
to
assert
himself
or
better
still
like
a
man
who
wants
dreadfully
to
hit
you
but
is
horribly
afraid
you
will
hit
him
in
his
words
and
in
the
intonation
of
his
shrill
voice
there
was
a
sort
of
crazy
humor
at
times
spiteful
and
at
times
cringing
and
continually
shifting
from
one
tone
to
another
the
question
about
our
retreat
he
had
asked
as
it
were
quivering
all
over
rolling
his
eyes
and
skipping
up
so
close
to
alyosha
that
he
instinctively
drew
back
a
step
he
was
dressed
in
a
very
shabby
dark
cotton
coat
patched
and
spotted
he
wore
checked
trousers
of
an
extremely
light
color
long
out
of
fashion
and
of
very
thin
material
they
were
so
crumpled
and
so
short
that
he
looked
as
though
he
had
grown
out
of
them
like
a
boy
i
am
alexey
karamazov
alyosha
began
in
reply
i
quite
understand
that
sir
the
gentleman
snapped
out
at
once
to
assure
him
that
he
knew
who
he
was
already
i
am
captain
snegiryov
sir
but
i
am
still
desirous
to
know
precisely
what
has
led
you
oh
ive
come
for
nothing
special
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
youif
only
you
allow
me
in
that
case
here
is
a
chair
sir
kindly
be
seated
thats
what
they
used
to
say
in
the
old
comedies
kindly
be
seated

and
with
a
rapid
gesture
he
seized
an
empty
chair
it
was
a
rough
wooden
chair
not
upholstered
and
set
it
for
him
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
room
then
taking
another
similar
chair
for
himself
he
sat
down
facing
alyosha
so
close
to
him
that
their
knees
almost
touched
nikolay
ilyitch
snegiryov
sir
formerly
a
captain
in
the
russian
infantry
put
to
shame
for
his
vices
but
still
a
captain
though
i
might
not
be
one
now
for
the
way
i
talk
for
the
last
half
of
my
life
ive
learnt
to
say
sir
its
a
word
you
use
when
youve
come
down
in
the
world
thats
very
true
smiled
alyosha
but
is
it
used
involuntarily
or
on
purpose
as
gods
above
its
involuntary
and
i
usent
to
use
it
i
didnt
use
the
word
sir
all
my
life
but
as
soon
as
i
sank
into
low
water
i
began
to
say
sir
its
the
work
of
a
higher
power
i
see
you
are
interested
in
contemporary
questions
but
how
can
i
have
excited
your
curiosity
living
as
i
do
in
surroundings
impossible
for
the
exercise
of
hospitality
ive
comeabout
that
business
about
what
business
the
captain
interrupted
impatiently
about
your
meeting
with
my
brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
alyosha
blurted
out
awkwardly
what
meeting
sir
you
dont
mean
that
meeting
about
my
wisp
of
tow
then
he
moved
closer
so
that
his
knees
positively
knocked
against
alyosha
his
lips
were
strangely
compressed
like
a
thread
what
wisp
of
tow
muttered
alyosha
he
is
come
to
complain
of
me
father
cried
a
voice
familiar
to
alyoshathe
voice
of
the
schoolboyfrom
behind
the
curtain
i
bit
his
finger
just
now
the
curtain
was
pulled
and
alyosha
saw
his
assailant
lying
on
a
little
bed
made
up
on
the
bench
and
the
chair
in
the
corner
under
the
ikons
the
boy
lay
covered
by
his
coat
and
an
old
wadded
quilt
he
was
evidently
unwell
and
judging
by
his
glittering
eyes
he
was
in
a
fever
he
looked
at
alyosha
without
fear
as
though
he
felt
he
was
at
home
and
could
not
be
touched
what
did
he
bite
your
finger
the
captain
jumped
up
from
his
chair
was
it
your
finger
he
bit
yes
he
was
throwing
stones
with
other
schoolboys
there
were
six
of
them
against
him
alone
i
went
up
to
him
and
he
threw
a
stone
at
me
and
then
another
at
my
head
i
asked
him
what
i
had
done
to
him
and
then
he
rushed
at
me
and
bit
my
finger
badly
i
dont
know
why
ill
thrash
him
sir
at
oncethis
minute
the
captain
jumped
up
from
his
seat
but
i
am
not
complaining
at
all
i
am
simply
telling
you

i
dont
want
him
to
be
thrashed
besides
he
seems
to
be
ill
and
do
you
suppose
id
thrash
him
that
id
take
my
ilusha
and
thrash
him
before
you
for
your
satisfaction
would
you
like
it
done
at
once
sir
said
the
captain
suddenly
turning
to
alyosha
as
though
he
were
going
to
attack
him
i
am
sorry
about
your
finger
sir
but
instead
of
thrashing
ilusha
would
you
like
me
to
chop
off
my
four
fingers
with
this
knife
here
before
your
eyes
to
satisfy
your
just
wrath
i
should
think
four
fingers
would
be
enough
to
satisfy
your
thirst
for
vengeance
you
wont
ask
for
the
fifth
one
too
he
stopped
short
with
a
catch
in
his
throat
every
feature
in
his
face
was
twitching
and
working
he
looked
extremely
defiant
he
was
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
i
think
i
understand
it
all
now
said
alyosha
gently
and
sorrowfully
still
keeping
his
seat
so
your
boy
is
a
good
boy
he
loves
his
father
and
he
attacked
me
as
the
brother
of
your
assailant
now
i
understand
it
he
repeated
thoughtfully
but
my
brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
regrets
his
action
i
know
that
and
if
only
it
is
possible
for
him
to
come
to
you
or
better
still
to
meet
you
in
that
same
place
he
will
ask
your
forgiveness
before
every
oneif
you
wish
it
after
pulling
out
my
beard
you
mean
he
will
ask
my
forgiveness
and
he
thinks
that
will
be
a
satisfactory
finish
doesnt
he
oh
no
on
the
contrary
he
will
do
anything
you
like
and
in
any
way
you
like
so
if
i
were
to
ask
his
highness
to
go
down
on
his
knees
before
me
in
that
very
tavernthe
metropolis
its
calledor
in
the
marketplace
he
would
do
it
yes
he
would
even
go
down
on
his
knees
youve
pierced
me
to
the
heart
sir
touched
me
to
tears
and
pierced
me
to
the
heart
i
am
only
too
sensible
of
your
brothers
generosity
allow
me
to
introduce
my
family
my
two
daughters
and
my
sonmy
litter
if
i
die
who
will
care
for
them
and
while
i
live
who
but
they
will
care
for
a
wretch
like
me
thats
a
great
thing
the
lord
has
ordained
for
every
man
of
my
sort
sir
for
there
must
be
some
one
able
to
love
even
a
man
like
me
ah
thats
perfectly
true
exclaimed
alyosha
oh
do
leave
off
playing
the
fool
some
idiot
comes
in
and
you
put
us
to
shame
cried
the
girl
by
the
window
suddenly
turning
to
her
father
with
a
disdainful
and
contemptuous
air
wait
a
little
varvara
cried
her
father
speaking
peremptorily
but
looking
at
her
quite
approvingly
thats
her
character
he
said
addressing
alyosha
again
and
in
all
nature
there
was
naught
that
could
find
favor
in
his
eyes
or
rather
in
the
feminine
that
could
find
favor
in
her
eyes
but
now
let
me
present
you
to
my
wife
arina
petrovna
she
is
crippled
she
is
forty
three
she
can
move
but
very
little
she
is
of
humble
origin
arina
petrovna
compose
your
countenance
this
is
alexey
fyodorovitch
karamazov
get
up
alexey
fyodorovitch
he
took
him
by
the
hand
and
with
unexpected
force
pulled
him
up
you
must
stand
up
to
be
introduced
to
a
lady
its
not
the
karamazov
mamma
who

hm

etcetera
but
his
brother
radiant
with
modest
virtues
come
arina
petrovna
come
mamma
first
your
hand
to
be
kissed
and
he
kissed
his
wifes
hand
respectfully
and
even
tenderly
the
girl
at
the
window
turned
her
back
indignantly
on
the
scene
an
expression
of
extraordinary
cordiality
came
over
the
haughtily
inquiring
face
of
the
woman
good
morning
sit
down
mr
tchernomazov
she
said
karamazov
mamma
karamazov
we
are
of
humble
origin
he
whispered
again
well
karamazov
or
whatever
it
is
but
i
always
think
of
tchernomazov
sit
down
why
has
he
pulled
you
up
he
calls
me
crippled
but
i
am
not
only
my
legs
are
swollen
like
barrels
and
i
am
shriveled
up
myself
once
i
used
to
be
so
fat
but
now
its
as
though
i
had
swallowed
a
needle
we
are
of
humble
origin
the
captain
muttered
again
oh
father
father
the
hunchback
girl
who
had
till
then
been
silent
on
her
chair
said
suddenly
and
she
hid
her
eyes
in
her
handkerchief
buffoon
blurted
out
the
girl
at
the
window
have
you
heard
our
news
said
the
mother
pointing
at
her
daughters
its
like
clouds
coming
over
the
clouds
pass
and
we
have
music
again
when
we
were
with
the
army
we
used
to
have
many
such
guests
i
dont
mean
to
make
any
comparisons
every
one
to
their
taste
the
deacons
wife
used
to
come
then
and
say
alexandr
alexandrovitch
is
a
man
of
the
noblest
heart
but
nastasya
petrovna
she
would
say
is
of
the
brood
of
hell
well
i
said
thats
a
matter
of
taste
but
you

a
little
spitfire
and

keeping
in
your
place
says
she
you
black
sword
said
i
who
asked
you
to
teach
me
but
my
breath
says
she
is
clean
and
yours
is
unclean
you
ask
all
the
officers
whether
my
breath
is
unclean
and
ever
since
then
i
had
it
in
my
mind
not
long
ago
i
was
sitting
here
as
i
am
now
when
i
saw
that
very
general
come
in
who

here
for

and
i
asked
him
your
excellency
said
i
can

ladys

unpleasant
yes
he
answered
you

to
open
a
window
pane
or
open
the
door
for
the
air
is
not
fresh
here
and
they
all
go
on
like
that
and
what
is
my
breath
to
them
the
dead
smell
worse
still

poor
lonely
creature

my
breath

unpleasant
to

and
the
poor
mad
woman
broke
into
sobs
and
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
the
captain
rushed
up
to
her
mamma

dear

one

he
began
kissing
both
her
hands
again
and
tenderly
stroking
her
face
taking
the
dinnernapkin
he
began
wiping
away
her
tears
alyosha
fancied
that
he
too
had
tears
in
his
eyes
there
you
see
you
hear
he
turned
with
a
sort
of
fury
to
alyosha
pointing
to
the
poor
imbecile
i
see
and
hear
muttered
alyosha
father
father
how
can
youwith
him
let
him
alone
cried
the
boy
sitting
up
in
his
bed
and
gazing
at
his
father
with
glowing
eyes
do
give
over
fooling
showing
off
your
silly
antics
which
never
lead
to
anything
shouted
varvara
stamping
her
foot
with
passion
your
anger
is
quite
just
this
time
varvara
and
ill
make
haste
to
satisfy
you
come
put
on
your
cap
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
ill
put
on
mine
we
will
go
out
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
in
earnest
but
not
within
these
walls
this
girl
sitting
here
is
my
daughter
nina
i
forgot
to
introduce
her
to
you
she
is
a
heavenly
angel
incarnate

who
has
flown
down
to
us
mortals
if
you
can
understand
there
he
is
shaking
all
over
as
though
he
is
in
convulsions
varvara
went
on
indignantly
and
she
there
stamping
her
foot
at
me
and
calling
me
a
fool
just
now
she
is
a
heavenly
angel
incarnate
too
and
she
has
good
reason
to
call
me
so
come
along
alexey
fyodorovitch
we
must
make
an
end
and
snatching
alyoshas
hand
he
drew
him
out
of
the
room
into
the
street
chapter
vii
and
in
the
open
air
the
air
is
fresh
but
in
my
apartment
it
is
not
so
in
any
sense
of
the
word
let
us
walk
slowly

should
be
glad

your
kind
interest

something
important
to
say
to
you
observed
alyosha
only
i
dont
know
how
to
begin
to
be
sure
you
must
have
business
with
me
you
would
never
have
looked
in
upon
me
without
some
object
unless
you
come
simply
to
complain
of
the
boy
and
thats
hardly
likely
and
by
the
way
about
the
boy
i
could
not
explain
to
you
in
there
but

brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
pulling
me
by
my
beard
id
done
nothing
he
was
in
a
towering
rage
and
happened
to
come
upon
me
he
dragged
me
out
of
the
tavern
into
the
marketplace
at
that
moment
the
boys
were
coming
out
of
school
and
with
them
ilusha
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
in
such
a
state
he
rushed
up
to
me
father
he
cried
father
he
caught
hold
of
me
hugged
me
tried
to
pull
me
away
crying
to
my
assailant
let
go
let
go
its
my
father
forgive
himyes
he
actually
cried
forgive
him
he
clutched
at
that
hand
that
very
hand
in
his
little
hands
and
kissed
it
i
remember
his
little
face
at
that
moment
i
havent
forgotten
it
and
i
never
shall
i
swear
cried
alyosha
that
my
brother
will
express
his
most
deep
and
sincere
regret
even
if
he
has
to
go
down
on
his
knees
in
that
same
marketplace
ill
make
him
or
he
is
no
brother
of
mine
aha
then
its
only
a
suggestion
and
it
does
not
come
from
him
but
simply
from
the
generosity
of
your
own
warm
heart
you
should
have
said
so
no
in
that
case
allow
me
to
tell
you
of
your
brothers
highly
chivalrous
soldierly
generosity
for
he
did
give
expression
to
it
at
the
time
he
left
off
dragging
me
by
my
beard
and
released
me
you
are
an
officer
he
said
and
i
am
an
officer
if
you
can
find
a
decent
man
to
be
your
second
send
me
your
challenge
i
will
give
satisfaction
though
you
are
a
scoundrel
thats
what
he
said
a
chivalrous
spirit
indeed
i
retired
with
ilusha
and
that
scene
is
a
family
record
imprinted
for
ever
on
ilushas
soul
no
its
not
for
us
to
claim
the
privileges
of
noblemen
judge
for
yourself
youve
just
been
in
our
mansion
what
did
you
see
there
three
ladies
one
a
cripple
and
weakminded
another
a
cripple
and
hunchback
and
the
third
not
crippled
but
far
too
clever
she
is
a
student
dying
to
get
back
to
petersburg
to
work
for
the
emancipation
of
the
russian
woman
on
the
banks
of
the
neva
i
wont
speak
of
ilusha
he
is
only
nine
i
am
alone
in
the
world
and
if
i
die
what
will
become
of
all
of
them
i
simply
ask
you
that
and
if
i
challenge
him
and
he
kills
me
on
the
spot
what
then
what
will
become
of
them
and
worse
still
if
he
doesnt
kill
me
but
only
cripples
me
i
couldnt
work
but
i
should
still
be
a
mouth
to
feed
who
would
feed
it
and
who
would
feed
them
all
must
i
take
ilusha
from
school
and
send
him
to
beg
in
the
streets
thats
what
it
means
for
me
to
challenge
him
to
a
duel
its
silly
talk
and
nothing
else
he
will
beg
your
forgiveness
he
will
bow
down
at
your
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
marketplace
cried
alyosha
again
with
glowing
eyes
i
did
think
of
prosecuting
him
the
captain
went
on
but
look
in
our
code
could
i
get
much
compensation
for
a
personal
injury
and
then
agrafena
alexandrovna3
sent
for
me
and
shouted
at
me
dont
dare
to
dream
of
it
if
you
proceed
against
him
ill
publish
it
to
all
the
world
that
he
beat
you
for
your
dishonesty
and
then
you
will
be
prosecuted
i
call
god
to
witness
whose
was
the
dishonesty
and
by
whose
commands
i
acted
wasnt
it
by
her
own
and
fyodor
pavlovitchs
and
whats
more
she
went
on
ill
dismiss
you
for
good
and
youll
never
earn
another
penny
from
me
ill
speak
to
my
merchant
too
thats
what
she
calls
her
old
man
and
he
will
dismiss
you
and
if
he
dismisses
me
what
can
i
earn
then
from
any
one
those
two
are
all
i
have
to
look
to
for
your
fyodor
pavlovitch
has
not
only
given
over
employing
me
for
another
reason
but
he
means
to
make
use
of
papers
ive
signed
to
go
to
law
against
me
and
so
i
kept
quiet
and
you
have
seen
our
retreat
but
now
let
me
ask
you
did
ilusha
hurt
your
finger
much
i
didnt
like
to
go
into
it
in
our
mansion
before
him
yes
very
much
and
he
was
in
a
great
fury
he
was
avenging
you
on
me
as
a
karamazov
i
see
that
now
but
if
only
you
had
seen
how
he
was
throwing
stones
at
his
schoolfellows
its
very
dangerous
they
might
kill
him
they
are
children
and
stupid
a
stone
may
be
thrown
and
break
somebodys
head
thats
just
what
has
happened
he
has
been
bruised
by
a
stone
today
not
on
the
head
but
on
the
chest
just
above
the
heart
he
came
home
crying
and
groaning
and
now
he
is
ill
and
you
know
he
attacks
them
first
he
is
bitter
against
them
on
your
account
they
say
he
stabbed
a
boy
called
krassotkin
with
a
penknife
not
long
ago
ive
heard
about
that
too
its
dangerous
krassotkin
is
an
official
here
we
may
hear
more
about
it
i
would
advise
you
alyosha
went
on
warmly
not
to
send
him
to
school
at
all
for
a
time
till
he
is
calmer

and
his
anger
is
passed
anger
the
captain
repeated
thats
just
what
it
is
he
is
a
little
creature
but
its
a
mighty
anger
you
dont
know
all
sir
let
me
tell
you
more
since
that
incident
all
the
boys
have
been
teasing
him
about
the
wisp
of
tow
schoolboys
are
a
merciless
race
individually
they
are
angels
but
together
especially
in
schools
they
are
often
merciless
their
teasing
has
stirred
up
a
gallant
spirit
in
ilusha
an
ordinary
boy
a
weak
son
would
have
submitted
have
felt
ashamed
of
his
father
sir
but
he
stood
up
for
his
father
against
them
all
for
his
father
and
for
truth
and
justice
for
what
he
suffered
when
he
kissed
your
brothers
hand
and
cried
to
him
forgive
father
forgive
himthat
only
god
knowsand
i
his
father
for
our
childrennot
your
children
but
oursthe
children
of
the
poor
gentlemen
looked
down
upon
by
every
oneknow
what
justice
means
sir
even
at
nine
years
old
how
should
the
rich
know
they
dont
explore
such
depths
once
in
their
lives
but
at
that
moment
in
the
square
when
he
kissed
his
hand
at
that
moment
my
ilusha
had
grasped
all
that
justice
means
that
truth
entered
into
him
and
crushed
him
for
ever
sir
the
captain
said
hotly
again
with
a
sort
of
frenzy
and
he
struck
his
right
fist
against
his
left
palm
as
though
he
wanted
to
show
how
the
truth
crushed
ilusha
that
very
day
sir
he
fell
ill
with
fever
and
was
delirious
all
night
all
that
day
he
hardly
said
a
word
to
me
but
i
noticed
he
kept
watching
me
from
the
corner
though
he
turned
to
the
window
and
pretended
to
be
learning
his
lessons
but
i
could
see
his
mind
was
not
on
his
lessons
next
day
i
got
drunk
to
forget
my
troubles
sinful
man
as
i
am
and
i
dont
remember
much
mamma
began
crying
tooi
am
very
fond
of
mammawell
i
spent
my
last
penny
drowning
my
troubles
dont
despise
me
for
that
sir
in
russia
men
who
drink
are
the
best
the
best
men
amongst
us
are
the
greatest
drunkards
i
lay
down
and
i
dont
remember
about
ilusha
though
all
that
day
the
boys
had
been
jeering
at
him
at
school
wisp
of
tow
they
shouted
your
father
was
pulled
out
of
the
tavern
by
his
wisp
of
tow
you
ran
by
and
begged
forgiveness

on
the
third
day
when
he
came
back
from
school
i
saw
he
looked
pale
and
wretched
what
is
it
i
asked
he
wouldnt
answer
well
theres
no
talking
in
our
mansion
without
mamma
and
the
girls
taking
part
in
it
whats
more
the
girls
had
heard
about
it
the
very
first
day
varvara
had
begun
snarling
you
fools
and
buffoons
can
you
ever
do
anything
rational
quite
so
i
said
can
we
ever
do
anything
rational
for
the
time
i
turned
it
off
like
that
so
in
the
evening
i
took
the
boy
out
for
a
walk
for
you
must
know
we
go
for
a
walk
every
evening
always
the
same
way
along
which
we
are
going
nowfrom
our
gate
to
that
great
stone
which
lies
alone
in
the
road
under
the
hurdle
which
marks
the
beginning
of
the
town
pasture
a
beautiful
and
lonely
spot
sir
ilusha
and
i
walked
along
hand
in
hand
as
usual
he
has
a
little
hand
his
fingers
are
thin
and
coldhe
suffers
with
his
chest
you
know
father
said
he
father
well
said
i
i
saw
his
eyes
flashing
father
how
he
treated
you
then
it
cant
be
helped
ilusha
i
said
dont
forgive
him
father
dont
forgive
him
at
school
they
say
that
he
has
paid
you
ten
roubles
for
it
no
ilusha
said
i
i
would
not
take
money
from
him
for
anything
then
he
began
trembling
all
over
took
my
hand
in
both
his
and
kissed
it
again
father
he
said
father
challenge
him
to
a
duel
at
school
they
say
you
are
a
coward
and
wont
challenge
him
and
that
youll
accept
ten
roubles
from
him
i
cant
challenge
him
to
a
duel
ilusha
i
answered
and
i
told
briefly
what
ive
just
told
you
he
listened
father
he
said
anyway
dont
forgive
it
when
i
grow
up
ill
call
him
out
myself
and
kill
him
his
eyes
shone
and
glowed
and
of
course
i
am
his
father
and
i
had
to
put
in
a
word
its
a
sin
to
kill
i
said
even
in
a
duel
father
he
said
when
i
grow
up
ill
knock
him
down
knock
the
sword
out
of
his
hand
ill
fall
on
him
wave
my
sword
over
him
and
say
i
could
kill
you
but
i
forgive
you
so
there

you
see
what
the
workings
of
his
little
mind
have
been
during
these
two
days
he
must
have
been
planning
that
vengeance
all
day
and
raving
about
it
at
night
but
he
began
to
come
home
from
school
badly
beaten
i
found
out
about
it
the
day
before
yesterday
and
you
are
right
i
wont
send
him
to
that
school
any
more
i
heard
that
he
was
standing
up
against
all
the
class
alone
and
defying
them
all
that
his
heart
was
full
of
resentment
of
bitternessi
was
alarmed
about
him
we
went
for
another
walk
father
he
asked
are
the
rich
people
stronger
than
any
one
else
on
earth
yes
ilusha
i
said
there
are
no
people
on
earth
stronger
than
the
rich
father
he
said
i
will
get
rich
i
will
become
an
officer
and
conquer
everybody
the
tsar
will
reward
me
i
will
come
back
here
and
then
no
one
will
dare
then
he
was
silent
and
his
lips
still
kept
trembling
father
he
said
what
a
horrid
town
this
is
yes
ilusha
i
said
it
isnt
a
very
nice
town
father
let
us
move
into
another
town
a
nice
one
he
said
where
people
dont
know
about
us
we
will
move
we
will
ilusha
said
i
only
i
must
save
up
for
it
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
turn
his
mind
from
painful
thoughts
and
we
began
to
dream
of
how
we
would
move
to
another
town
how
we
would
buy
a
horse
and
cart
we
will
put
mamma
and
your
sisters
inside
we
will
cover
them
up
and
well
walk
you
shall
have
a
lift
now
and
then
and
ill
walk
beside
for
we
must
take
care
of
our
horse
we
cant
all
ride
thats
how
well
go
he
was
enchanted
at
that
most
of
all
at
the
thought
of
having
a
horse
and
driving
him
for
of
course
a
russian
boy
is
born
among
horses
we
chattered
a
long
while
thank
god
i
thought
i
have
diverted
his
mind
and
comforted
him
that
was
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
evening
but
last
night
everything
was
changed
he
had
gone
to
school
in
the
morning
he
came
back
depressed
terribly
depressed
in
the
evening
i
took
him
by
the
hand
and
we
went
for
a
walk
he
would
not
talk
there
was
a
wind
blowing
and
no
sun
and
a
feeling
of
autumn
twilight
was
coming
on
we
walked
along
both
of
us
depressed
well
my
boy
said
i
how
about
our
setting
off
on
our
travels
i
thought
i
might
bring
him
back
to
our
talk
of
the
day
before
he
didnt
answer
but
i
felt
his
fingers
trembling
in
my
hand
ah
i
thought
its
a
bad
job
theres
something
fresh
we
had
reached
the
stone
where
we
are
now
i
sat
down
on
the
stone
and
in
the
air
there
were
lots
of
kites
flapping
and
whirling
there
were
as
many
as
thirty
in
sight
of
course
its
just
the
season
for
the
kites
look
ilusha
said
i
its
time
we
got
out
our
last
years
kite
again
ill
mend
it
where
have
you
put
it
away
my
boy
made
no
answer
he
looked
away
and
turned
sideways
to
me
and
then
a
gust
of
wind
blew
up
the
sand
he
suddenly
fell
on
me
threw
both
his
little
arms
round
my
neck
and
held
me
tight
you
know
when
children
are
silent
and
proud
and
try
to
keep
back
their
tears
when
they
are
in
great
trouble
and
suddenly
break
down
their
tears
fall
in
streams
with
those
warm
streams
of
tears
he
suddenly
wetted
my
face
he
sobbed
and
shook
as
though
he
were
in
convulsions
and
squeezed
up
against
me
as
i
sat
on
the
stone
father
he
kept
crying
dear
father
how
he
insulted
you
and
i
sobbed
too
we
sat
shaking
in
each
others
arms
ilusha
i
said
to
him
ilusha
darling
no
one
saw
us
then
god
alone
saw
us
i
hope
he
will
record
it
to
my
credit
you
must
thank
your
brother
alexey
fyodorovitch
no
sir
i
wont
thrash
my
boy
for
your
satisfaction
he
had
gone
back
to
his
original
tone
of
resentful
buffoonery
alyosha
felt
though
that
he
trusted
him
and
that
if
there
had
been
some
one
else
in
his
alyoshas
place
the
man
would
not
have
spoken
so
openly
and
would
not
have
told
what
he
had
just
told
this
encouraged
alyosha
whose
heart
was
trembling
on
the
verge
of
tears
ah
how
i
would
like
to
make
friends
with
your
boy
he
cried
if
you
could
arrange
it
certainly
sir
muttered
the
captain
but
now
listen
to
something
quite
different
alyosha
went
on
i
have
a
message
for
you
that
same
brother
of
mine
dmitri
has
insulted
his
betrothed
too
a
noblehearted
girl
of
whom
you
have
probably
heard
i
have
a
right
to
tell
you
of
her
wrong
i
ought
to
do
so
in
fact
for
hearing
of
the
insult
done
to
you
and
learning
all
about
your
unfortunate
position
she
commissioned
me
at
oncejust
nowto
bring
you
this
help
from
herbut
only
from
her
alone
not
from
dmitri
who
has
abandoned
her
nor
from
me
his
brother
nor
from
any
one
else
but
from
her
only
from
her
she
entreats
you
to
accept
her
help
you
have
both
been
insulted
by
the
same
man
she
thought
of
you
only
when
she
had
just
received
a
similar
insult
from
himsimilar
in
its
cruelty
i
mean
she
comes
like
a
sister
to
help
a
brother
in
misfortune
she
told
me
to
persuade
you
to
take
these
two
hundred
roubles
from
her
as
from
a
sister
knowing
that
you
are
in
such
need
no
one
will
know
of
it
it
can
give
rise
to
no
unjust
slander
there
are
the
two
hundred
roubles
and
i
swear
you
must
take
them
unlessunless
all
men
are
to
be
enemies
on
earth
but
there
are
brothers
even
on
earth
you
have
a
generous
heart

you
must
see
that
you
must
and
alyosha
held
out
two
new
rainbowcolored
hundredrouble
notes
they
were
both
standing
at
the
time
by
the
great
stone
close
to
the
fence
and
there
was
no
one
near
the
notes
seemed
to
produce
a
tremendous
impression
on
the
captain
he
started
but
at
first
only
from
astonishment
such
an
outcome
of
their
conversation
was
the
last
thing
he
expected
nothing
could
have
been
farther
from
his
dreams
than
help
from
any
oneand
such
a
sum
he
took
the
notes
and
for
a
minute
he
was
almost
unable
to
answer
quite
a
new
expression
came
into
his
face
that
for
me
so
much
moneytwo
hundred
roubles
good
heavens
why
i
havent
seen
so
much
money
for
the
last
four
years
mercy
on
us
and
she
says
she
is
a
sister
and
is
that
the
truth
i
swear
that
all
i
told
you
is
the
truth
cried
alyosha
the
captain
flushed
red
listen
my
dear
listen
if
i
take
it
i
shant
be
behaving
like
a
scoundrel
in
your
eyes
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
shant
be
a
scoundrel
no
alexey
fyodorovitch
listen
listen
he
hurried
touching
alyosha
with
both
his
hands
you
are
persuading
me
to
take
it
saying
that
its
a
sister
sends
it
but
inwardly
in
your
heart
wont
you
feel
contempt
for
me
if
i
take
it
eh
no
no
on
my
salvation
i
swear
i
shant
and
no
one
will
ever
know
but
mei
you
and
she
and
one
other
lady
her
great
friend
never
mind
the
lady
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
at
a
moment
like
this
you
must
listen
for
you
cant
understand
what
these
two
hundred
roubles
mean
to
me
now
the
poor
fellow
went
on
rising
gradually
into
a
sort
of
incoherent
almost
wild
enthusiasm
he
was
thrown
off
his
balance
and
talked
extremely
fast
as
though
afraid
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
say
all
he
had
to
say
besides
its
being
honestly
acquired
from
a
sister
so
highly
respected
and
revered
do
you
know
that
now
i
can
look
after
mamma
and
nina
my
hunchback
angel
daughter
doctor
herzenstube
came
to
me
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
and
was
examining
them
both
for
a
whole
hour
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
said
he
but
he
prescribed
a
mineral
water
which
is
kept
at
a
chemists
here
he
said
it
would
be
sure
to
do
her
good
and
he
ordered
baths
too
with
some
medicine
in
them
the
mineral
water
costs
thirty
copecks
and
shed
need
to
drink
forty
bottles
perhaps
so
i
took
the
prescription
and
laid
it
on
the
shelf
under
the
ikons
and
there
it
lies
and
he
ordered
hot
baths
for
nina
with
something
dissolved
in
them
morning
and
evening
but
how
can
we
carry
out
such
a
cure
in
our
mansion
without
servants
without
help
without
a
bath
and
without
water
nina
is
rheumatic
all
over
i
dont
think
i
told
you
that
all
her
right
side
aches
at
night
she
is
in
agony
and
would
you
believe
it
the
angel
bears
it
without
groaning
for
fear
of
waking
us
we
eat
what
we
can
get
and
shell
only
take
the
leavings
what
youd
scarcely
give
to
a
dog
i
am
not
worth
it
i
am
taking
it
from
you
i
am
a
burden
on
you
thats
what
her
angel
eyes
try
to
express
we
wait
on
her
but
she
doesnt
like
it
i
am
a
useless
cripple
no
good
to
any
one
as
though
she
were
not
worth
it
when
she
is
the
saving
of
all
of
us
with
her
angelic
sweetness
without
her
without
her
gentle
word
it
would
be
hell
among
us
she
softens
even
varvara
and
dont
judge
varvara
harshly
either
she
is
an
angel
too
she
too
has
suffered
wrong
she
came
to
us
for
the
summer
and
she
brought
sixteen
roubles
she
had
earned
by
lessons
and
saved
up
to
go
back
with
to
petersburg
in
september
that
is
now
but
we
took
her
money
and
lived
on
it
so
now
she
has
nothing
to
go
back
with
though
indeed
she
couldnt
go
back
for
she
has
to
work
for
us
like
a
slave
she
is
like
an
overdriven
horse
with
all
of
us
on
her
back
she
waits
on
us
all
mends
and
washes
sweeps
the
floor
puts
mamma
to
bed
and
mamma
is
capricious
and
tearful
and
insane
and
now
i
can
get
a
servant
with
this
money
you
understand
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
can
get
medicines
for
the
dear
creatures
i
can
send
my
student
to
petersburg
i
can
buy
beef
i
can
feed
them
properly
good
lord
but
its
a
dream
alyosha
was
delighted
that
he
had
brought
him
such
happiness
and
that
the
poor
fellow
had
consented
to
be
made
happy
stay
alexey
fyodorovitch
stay
the
captain
began
to
talk
with
frenzied
rapidity
carried
away
by
a
new
daydream
do
you
know
that
ilusha
and
i
will
perhaps
really
carry
out
our
dream
we
will
buy
a
horse
and
cart
a
black
horse
he
insists
on
its
being
black
and
we
will
set
off
as
we
pretended
the
other
day
i
have
an
old
friend
a
lawyer
in
k
province
and
i
heard
through
a
trustworthy
man
that
if
i
were
to
go
hed
give
me
a
place
as
clerk
in
his
office
so
who
knows
maybe
he
would
so
id
just
put
mamma
and
nina
in
the
cart
and
ilusha
could
drive
and
id
walk
id
walk
why
if
i
only
succeed
in
getting
one
debt
paid
thats
owing
me
i
should
have
perhaps
enough
for
that
too
there
would
be
enough
cried
alyosha
katerina
ivanovna
will
send
you
as
much
more
as
you
need
and
you
know
i
have
money
too
take
what
you
want
as
you
would
from
a
brother
from
a
friend
you
can
give
it
back
later
youll
get
rich
youll
get
rich
and
you
know
you
couldnt
have
a
better
idea
than
to
move
to
another
province
it
would
be
the
saving
of
you
especially
of
your
boyand
you
ought
to
go
quickly
before
the
winter
before
the
cold
you
must
write
to
us
when
you
are
there
and
we
will
always
be
brothers
no
its
not
a
dream
alyosha
could
have
hugged
him
he
was
so
pleased
but
glancing
at
him
he
stopped
short
the
man
was
standing
with
his
neck
outstretched
and
his
lips
protruding
with
a
pale
and
frenzied
face
his
lips
were
moving
as
though
trying
to
articulate
something
no
sound
came
but
still
his
lips
moved
it
was
uncanny
what
is
it
asked
alyosha
startled
alexey
fyodorovitch

i

you
muttered
the
captain
faltering
looking
at
him
with
a
strange
wild
fixed
stare
and
an
air
of
desperate
resolution
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
sort
of
grin
on
his
lips
i

you
sir

wouldnt
you
like
me
to
show
you
a
little
trick
i
know
he
murmured
suddenly
in
a
firm
rapid
whisper
his
voice
no
longer
faltering
what
trick
a
pretty
trick
whispered
the
captain
his
mouth
was
twisted
on
the
left
side
his
left
eye
was
screwed
up
he
still
stared
at
alyosha
what
is
the
matter
what
trick
alyosha
cried
now
thoroughly
alarmed
why
look
squealed
the
captain
suddenly
and
showing
him
the
two
notes
which
he
had
been
holding
by
one
corner
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
during
the
conversation
he
crumpled
them
up
savagely
and
squeezed
them
tight
in
his
right
hand
do
you
see
do
you
see
he
shrieked
pale
and
infuriated
and
suddenly
flinging
up
his
hand
he
threw
the
crumpled
notes
on
the
sand
do
you
see
he
shrieked
again
pointing
to
them
look
there
and
with
wild
fury
he
began
trampling
them
under
his
heel
gasping
and
exclaiming
as
he
did
so
so
much
for
your
money
so
much
for
your
money
so
much
for
your
money
so
much
for
your
money
suddenly
he
darted
back
and
drew
himself
up
before
alyosha
and
his
whole
figure
expressed
unutterable
pride
tell
those
who
sent
you
that
the
wisp
of
tow
does
not
sell
his
honor
he
cried
raising
his
arm
in
the
air
then
he
turned
quickly
and
began
to
run
but
he
had
not
run
five
steps
before
he
turned
completely
round
and
kissed
his
hand
to
alyosha
he
ran
another
five
paces
and
then
turned
round
for
the
last
time
this
time
his
face
was
not
contorted
with
laughter
but
quivering
all
over
with
tears
in
a
tearful
faltering
sobbing
voice
he
cried
what
should
i
say
to
my
boy
if
i
took
money
from
you
for
our
shame
and
then
he
ran
on
without
turning
alyosha
looked
after
him
inexpressibly
grieved
oh
he
saw
that
till
the
very
last
moment
the
man
had
not
known
he
would
crumple
up
and
fling
away
the
notes
he
did
not
turn
back
alyosha
knew
he
would
not
he
would
not
follow
him
and
call
him
back
he
knew
why
when
he
was
out
of
sight
alyosha
picked
up
the
two
notes
they
were
very
much
crushed
and
crumpled
and
had
been
pressed
into
the
sand
but
were
uninjured
and
even
rustled
like
new
ones
when
alyosha
unfolded
them
and
smoothed
them
out
after
smoothing
them
out
he
folded
them
up
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
went
to
katerina
ivanovna
to
report
on
the
success
of
her
commission
book
v
pro
and
contra
chapter
i
the
engagement
madame
hohlakov
was
again
the
first
to
meet
alyosha
she
was
flustered
something
important
had
happened
katerina
ivanovnas
hysterics
had
ended
in
a
fainting
fit
and
then
a
terrible
awful
weakness
had
followed
she
lay
with
her
eyes
turned
up
and
was
delirious
now
she
was
in
a
fever
they
had
sent
for
herzenstube
they
had
sent
for
the
aunts
the
aunts
were
already
here
but
herzenstube
had
not
yet
come
they
were
all
sitting
in
her
room
waiting
she
was
unconscious
now
and
what
if
it
turned
to
brain
fever
madame
hohlakov
looked
gravely
alarmed
this
is
serious
serious
she
added
at
every
word
as
though
nothing
that
had
happened
to
her
before
had
been
serious
alyosha
listened
with
distress
and
was
beginning
to
describe
his
adventures
but
she
interrupted
him
at
the
first
words
she
had
not
time
to
listen
she
begged
him
to
sit
with
lise
and
wait
for
her
there
lise
she
whispered
almost
in
his
ear
lise
has
greatly
surprised
me
just
now
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
touched
me
too
and
so
my
heart
forgives
her
everything
only
fancy
as
soon
as
you
had
gone
she
began
to
be
truly
remorseful
for
having
laughed
at
you
today
and
yesterday
though
she
was
not
laughing
at
you
but
only
joking
but
she
was
seriously
sorry
for
it
almost
ready
to
cry
so
that
i
was
quite
surprised
she
has
never
been
really
sorry
for
laughing
at
me
but
has
only
made
a
joke
of
it
and
you
know
she
is
laughing
at
me
every
minute
but
this
time
she
was
in
earnest
she
thinks
a
great
deal
of
your
opinion
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
dont
take
offense
or
be
wounded
by
her
if
you
can
help
it
i
am
never
hard
upon
her
for
shes
such
a
clever
little
thing
would
you
believe
it
she
said
just
now
that
you
were
a
friend
of
her
childhood
the
greatest
friend
of
her
childhoodjust
think
of
thatgreatest
friendand
what
about
me
she
has
very
strong
feelings
and
memories
and
whats
more
she
uses
these
phrases
most
unexpected
words
which
come
out
all
of
a
sudden
when
you
least
expect
them
she
spoke
lately
about
a
pinetree
for
instance
there
used
to
be
a
pinetree
standing
in
our
garden
in
her
early
childhood
very
likely
its
standing
there
still
so
theres
no
need
to
speak
in
the
past
tense
pinetrees
are
not
like
people
alexey
fyodorovitch
they
dont
change
quickly
mamma
she
said
i
remember
this
pinetree
as
in
a
dream
only
she
said
something
so
original
about
it
that
i
cant
repeat
it
besides
ive
forgotten
it
well
goodby
i
am
so
worried
i
feel
i
shall
go
out
of
my
mind
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
ive
been
out
of
my
mind
twice
in
my
life
go
to
lise
cheer
her
up
as
you
always
can
so
charmingly
lise
she
cried
going
to
her
door
here
ive
brought
you
alexey
fyodorovitch
whom
you
insulted
so
he
is
not
at
all
angry
i
assure
you
on
the
contrary
he
is
surprised
that
you
could
suppose
so
merci
maman
come
in
alexey
fyodorovitch
alyosha
went
in
lise
looked
rather
embarrassed
and
at
once
flushed
crimson
she
was
evidently
ashamed
of
something
and
as
people
always
do
in
such
cases
she
began
immediately
talking
of
other
things
as
though
they
were
of
absorbing
interest
to
her
at
the
moment
mamma
has
just
told
me
all
about
the
two
hundred
roubles
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
your
taking
them
to
that
poor
officer

and
she
told
me
all
the
awful
story
of
how
he
had
been
insulted

and
you
know
although
mamma
muddles
things

she
always
rushes
from
one
thing
to
another

i
cried
when
i
heard
well
did
you
give
him
the
money
and
how
is
that
poor
man
getting
on
the
fact
is
i
didnt
give
it
to
him
and
its
a
long
story
answered
alyosha
as
though
he
too
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
regret
at
having
failed
yet
lise
saw
perfectly
well
that
he
too
looked
away
and
that
he
too
was
trying
to
talk
of
other
things
alyosha
sat
down
to
the
table
and
began
to
tell
his
story
but
at
the
first
words
he
lost
his
embarrassment
and
gained
the
whole
of
lises
attention
as
well
he
spoke
with
deep
feeling
under
the
influence
of
the
strong
impression
he
had
just
received
and
he
succeeded
in
telling
his
story
well
and
circumstantially
in
old
days
in
moscow
he
had
been
fond
of
coming
to
lise
and
describing
to
her
what
had
just
happened
to
him
what
he
had
read
or
what
he
remembered
of
his
childhood
sometimes
they
had
made
daydreams
and
woven
whole
romances
togethergenerally
cheerful
and
amusing
ones
now
they
both
felt
suddenly
transported
to
the
old
days
in
moscow
two
years
before
lise
was
extremely
touched
by
his
story
alyosha
described
ilusha
with
warm
feeling
when
he
finished
describing
how
the
luckless
man
trampled
on
the
money
lise
could
not
help
clasping
her
hands
and
crying
out
so
you
didnt
give
him
the
money
so
you
let
him
run
away
oh
dear
you
ought
to
have
run
after
him
no
lise
its
better
i
didnt
run
after
him
said
alyosha
getting
up
from
his
chair
and
walking
thoughtfully
across
the
room
how
so
how
is
it
better
now
they
are
without
food
and
their
case
is
hopeless
not
hopeless
for
the
two
hundred
roubles
will
still
come
to
them
hell
take
the
money
tomorrow
tomorrow
he
will
be
sure
to
take
it
said
alyosha
pacing
up
and
down
pondering
you
see
lise
he
went
on
stopping
suddenly
before
her
i
made
one
blunder
but
that
even
that
is
all
for
the
best
what
blunder
and
why
is
it
for
the
best
ill
tell
you
he
is
a
man
of
weak
and
timorous
character
he
has
suffered
so
much
and
is
very
goodnatured
i
keep
wondering
why
he
took
offense
so
suddenly
for
i
assure
you
up
to
the
last
minute
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
going
to
trample
on
the
notes
and
i
think
now
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
offend
him

and
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
in
his
position
to
begin
with
he
was
sore
at
having
been
so
glad
of
the
money
in
my
presence
and
not
having
concealed
it
from
me
if
he
had
been
pleased
but
not
so
much
if
he
had
not
shown
it
if
he
had
begun
affecting
scruples
and
difficulties
as
other
people
do
when
they
take
money
he
might
still
endure
to
take
it
but
he
was
too
genuinely
delighted
and
that
was
mortifying
ah
lise
he
is
a
good
and
truthful
manthats
the
worst
of
the
whole
business
all
the
while
he
talked
his
voice
was
so
weak
so
broken
he
talked
so
fast
so
fast
he
kept
laughing
such
a
laugh
or
perhaps
he
was
cryingyes
i
am
sure
he
was
crying
he
was
so
delightedand
he
talked
about
his
daughtersand
about
the
situation
he
could
get
in
another
town
and
when
he
had
poured
out
his
heart
he
felt
ashamed
at
having
shown
me
his
inmost
soul
like
that
so
he
began
to
hate
me
at
once
he
is
one
of
those
awfully
sensitive
poor
people
what
had
made
him
feel
most
ashamed
was
that
he
had
given
in
too
soon
and
accepted
me
as
a
friend
you
see
at
first
he
almost
flew
at
me
and
tried
to
intimidate
me
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
money
he
had
begun
embracing
me
he
kept
touching
me
with
his
hands
this
must
have
been
how
he
came
to
feel
it
all
so
humiliating
and
then
i
made
that
blunder
a
very
important
one
i
suddenly
said
to
him
that
if
he
had
not
money
enough
to
move
to
another
town
we
would
give
it
to
him
and
indeed
i
myself
would
give
him
as
much
as
he
wanted
out
of
my
own
money
that
struck
him
all
at
once
why
he
thought
did
i
put
myself
forward
to
help
him
you
know
lise
its
awfully
hard
for
a
man
who
has
been
injured
when
other
people
look
at
him
as
though
they
were
his
benefactors
ive
heard
that
father
zossima
told
me
so
i
dont
know
how
to
put
it
but
i
have
often
seen
it
myself
and
i
feel
like
that
myself
too
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
though
he
did
not
know
up
to
the
very
last
minute
that
he
would
trample
on
the
notes
he
had
a
kind
of
presentiment
of
it
i
am
sure
of
that
thats
just
what
made
him
so
ecstatic
that
he
had
that
presentiment
and
though
its
so
dreadful
its
all
for
the
best
in
fact
i
believe
nothing
better
could
have
happened
why
why
could
nothing
better
have
happened
cried
lise
looking
with
great
surprise
at
alyosha
because
if
he
had
taken
the
money
in
an
hour
after
getting
home
he
would
be
crying
with
mortification
thats
just
what
would
have
happened
and
most
likely
he
would
have
come
to
me
early
tomorrow
and
perhaps
have
flung
the
notes
at
me
and
trampled
upon
them
as
he
did
just
now
but
now
he
has
gone
home
awfully
proud
and
triumphant
though
he
knows
he
has
ruined
himself
so
now
nothing
could
be
easier
than
to
make
him
accept
the
two
hundred
roubles
by
tomorrow
for
he
has
already
vindicated
his
honor
tossed
away
the
money
and
trampled
it
under
foot
he
couldnt
know
when
he
did
it
that
i
should
bring
it
to
him
again
tomorrow
and
yet
he
is
in
terrible
need
of
that
money
though
he
is
proud
of
himself
now
yet
even
today
hell
be
thinking
what
a
help
he
has
lost
he
will
think
of
it
more
than
ever
at
night
will
dream
of
it
and
by
tomorrow
morning
he
may
be
ready
to
run
to
me
to
ask
forgiveness
its
just
then
that
ill
appear
here
you
are
a
proud
man
i
shall
say
you
have
shown
it
but
now
take
the
money
and
forgive
us
and
then
he
will
take
it
alyosha
was
carried
away
with
joy
as
he
uttered
his
last
words
and
then
he
will
take
it
lise
clapped
her
hands
ah
thats
true
i
understand
that
perfectly
now
ah
alyosha
how
do
you
know
all
this
so
young
and
yet
he
knows
whats
in
the
heart
i
should
never
have
worked
it
out
the
great
thing
now
is
to
persuade
him
that
he
is
on
an
equal
footing
with
us
in
spite
of
his
taking
money
from
us
alyosha
went
on
in
his
excitement
and
not
only
on
an
equal
but
even
on
a
higher
footing

on
a
higher
footing
is
charming
alexey
fyodorovitch
but
go
on
go
on
you
mean
there
isnt
such
an
expression
as
on
a
higher
footing
but
that
doesnt
matter
because
oh
no
of
course
it
doesnt
matter
forgive
me
alyosha
dear
you
know
i
scarcely
respected
you
till
nowthat
is
i
respected
you
but
on
an
equal
footing
but
now
i
shall
begin
to
respect
you
on
a
higher
footing
dont
be
angry
dear
at
my
joking
she
put
in
at
once
with
strong
feeling
i
am
absurd
and
small
but
you
you
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
isnt
there
in
all
our
analysisi
mean
your
analysis

no
better
call
it
oursarent
we
showing
contempt
for
him
for
that
poor
manin
analyzing
his
soul
like
this
as
it
were
from
above
eh
in
deciding
so
certainly
that
he
will
take
the
money
no
lise
its
not
contempt
alyosha
answered
as
though
he
had
prepared
himself
for
the
question
i
was
thinking
of
that
on
the
way
here
how
can
it
be
contempt
when
we
are
all
like
him
when
we
are
all
just
the
same
as
he
is
for
you
know
we
are
just
the
same
no
better
if
we
are
better
we
should
have
been
just
the
same
in
his
place
i
dont
know
about
you
lise
but
i
consider
that
i
have
a
sordid
soul
in
many
ways
and
his
soul
is
not
sordid
on
the
contrary
full
of
fine
feeling
no
lise
i
have
no
contempt
for
him
do
you
know
lise
my
elder
told
me
once
to
care
for
most
people
exactly
as
one
would
for
children
and
for
some
of
them
as
one
would
for
the
sick
in
hospitals
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
dear
let
us
care
for
people
as
we
would
for
the
sick
let
us
lise
i
am
ready
though
i
am
not
altogether
ready
in
myself
i
am
sometimes
very
impatient
and
at
other
times
i
dont
see
things
its
different
with
you
ah
i
dont
believe
it
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
happy
i
am
i
am
so
glad
you
say
so
lise
alexey
fyodorovitch
you
are
wonderfully
good
but
you
are
sometimes
sort
of
formal
and
yet
you
are
not
a
bit
formal
really
go
to
the
door
open
it
gently
and
see
whether
mamma
is
listening
said
lise
in
a
nervous
hurried
whisper
alyosha
went
opened
the
door
and
reported
that
no
one
was
listening
come
here
alexey
fyodorovitch
lise
went
on
flushing
redder
and
redder
give
me
your
handthats
right
i
have
to
make
a
great
confession
i
didnt
write
to
you
yesterday
in
joke
but
in
earnest
and
she
hid
her
eyes
with
her
hand
it
was
evident
that
she
was
greatly
ashamed
of
the
confession
suddenly
she
snatched
his
hand
and
impulsively
kissed
it
three
times
ah
lise
what
a
good
thing
cried
alyosha
joyfully
you
know
i
was
perfectly
sure
you
were
in
earnest
sure
upon
my
word
she
put
aside
his
hand
but
did
not
leave
go
of
it
blushing
hotly
and
laughing
a
little
happy
laugh
i
kiss
his
hand
and
he
says
what
a
good
thing

but
her
reproach
was
undeserved
alyosha
too
was
greatly
overcome
i
should
like
to
please
you
always
lise
but
i
dont
know
how
to
do
it
he
muttered
blushing
too
alyosha
dear
you
are
cold
and
rude
do
you
see
he
has
chosen
me
as
his
wife
and
is
quite
settled
about
it
he
is
sure
i
was
in
earnest
what
a
thing
to
say
why
thats
impertinencethats
what
it
is
why
was
it
wrong
of
me
to
feel
sure
alyosha
asked
laughing
suddenly
ah
alyosha
on
the
contrary
it
was
delightfully
right
cried
lise
looking
tenderly
and
happily
at
him
alyosha
stood
still
holding
her
hand
in
his
suddenly
he
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
on
her
lips
oh
what
are
you
doing
cried
lise
alyosha
was
terribly
abashed
oh
forgive
me
if
i
shouldnt
perhaps
im
awfully
stupid
you
said
i
was
cold
so
i
kissed
you
but
i
see
it
was
stupid
lise
laughed
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
in
that
dress
she
ejaculated
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
but
she
suddenly
ceased
laughing
and
became
serious
almost
stern
alyosha
we
must
put
off
kissing
we
are
not
ready
for
that
yet
and
we
shall
have
a
long
time
to
wait
she
ended
suddenly
tell
me
rather
why
you
who
are
so
clever
so
intellectual
so
observant
choose
a
little
idiot
an
invalid
like
me
ah
alyosha
i
am
awfully
happy
for
i
dont
deserve
you
a
bit
you
do
lise
i
shall
be
leaving
the
monastery
altogether
in
a
few
days
if
i
go
into
the
world
i
must
marry
i
know
that
he
told
me
to
marry
too
whom
could
i
marry
better
than
youand
who
would
have
me
except
you
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
in
the
first
place
youve
known
me
from
a
child
and
youve
a
great
many
qualities
i
havent
you
are
more
light
hearted
than
i
am
above
all
you
are
more
innocent
than
i
am
i
have
been
brought
into
contact
with
many
many
things
already
ah
you
dont
know
but
i
too
am
a
karamazov
what
does
it
matter
if
you
do
laugh
and
make
jokes
and
at
me
too
go
on
laughing
i
am
so
glad
you
do
you
laugh
like
a
little
child
but
you
think
like
a
martyr
like
a
martyr
how
yes
lise
your
question
just
now
whether
we
werent
showing
contempt
for
that
poor
man
by
dissecting
his
soulthat
was
the
question
of
a
sufferer
you
see
i
dont
know
how
to
express
it
but
any
one
who
thinks
of
such
questions
is
capable
of
suffering
sitting
in
your
invalid
chair
you
must
have
thought
over
many
things
already
alyosha
give
me
your
hand
why
are
you
taking
it
away
murmured
lise
in
a
failing
voice
weak
with
happiness
listen
alyosha
what
will
you
wear
when
you
come
out
of
the
monastery
what
sort
of
suit
dont
laugh
dont
be
angry
its
very
very
important
to
me
i
havent
thought
about
the
suit
lise
but
ill
wear
whatever
you
like
i
should
like
you
to
have
a
dark
blue
velvet
coat
a
white
piqu
waistcoat
and
a
soft
gray
felt
hat
tell
me
did
you
believe
that
i
didnt
care
for
you
when
i
said
i
didnt
mean
what
i
wrote
no
i
didnt
believe
it
oh
you
insupportable
person
you
are
incorrigible
you
see
i
knew
that
youseemed
to
care
for
me
but
i
pretended
to
believe
that
you
didnt
care
for
me
to
make
iteasier
for
you
that
makes
it
worse
worse
and
better
than
all
alyosha
i
am
awfully
fond
of
you
just
before
you
came
this
morning
i
tried
my
fortune
i
decided
i
would
ask
you
for
my
letter
and
if
you
brought
it
out
calmly
and
gave
it
to
me
as
might
have
been
expected
from
you
it
would
mean
that
you
did
not
love
me
at
all
that
you
felt
nothing
and
were
simply
a
stupid
boy
good
for
nothing
and
that
i
am
ruined
but
you
left
the
letter
at
home
and
that
cheered
me
you
left
it
behind
on
purpose
so
as
not
to
give
it
back
because
you
knew
i
would
ask
for
it
that
was
it
wasnt
it
ah
lise
it
was
not
so
a
bit
the
letter
is
with
me
now
and
it
was
this
morning
in
this
pocket
here
it
is
alyosha
pulled
the
letter
out
laughing
and
showed
it
her
at
a
distance
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
it
to
you
look
at
it
from
here
why
then
you
told
a
lie
you
a
monk
told
a
lie
i
told
a
lie
if
you
like
alyosha
laughed
too
i
told
a
lie
so
as
not
to
give
you
back
the
letter
its
very
precious
to
me
he
added
suddenly
with
strong
feeling
and
again
he
flushed
it
always
will
be
and
i
wont
give
it
up
to
any
one
lise
looked
at
him
joyfully
alyosha
she
murmured
again
look
at
the
door
isnt
mamma
listening
very
well
lise
ill
look
but
wouldnt
it
be
better
not
to
look
why
suspect
your
mother
of
such
meanness
what
meanness
as
for
her
spying
on
her
daughter
its
her
right
its
not
meanness
cried
lise
firing
up
you
may
be
sure
alexey
fyodorovitch
that
when
i
am
a
mother
if
i
have
a
daughter
like
myself
i
shall
certainly
spy
on
her
really
lise
thats
not
right
oh
my
goodness
what
has
meanness
to
do
with
it
if
she
were
listening
to
some
ordinary
worldly
conversation
it
would
be
meanness
but
when
her
own
daughter
is
shut
up
with
a
young
man
listen
alyosha
do
you
know
i
shall
spy
upon
you
as
soon
as
we
are
married
and
let
me
tell
you
i
shall
open
all
your
letters
and
read
them
so
you
may
as
well
be
prepared
yes
of
course
if
so
muttered
alyosha
only
its
not
right
ah
how
contemptuous
alyosha
dear
we
wont
quarrel
the
very
first
day
id
better
tell
you
the
whole
truth
of
course
its
very
wrong
to
spy
on
people
and
of
course
i
am
not
right
and
you
are
only
i
shall
spy
on
you
all
the
same
do
then
you
wont
find
out
anything
laughed
alyosha
and
alyosha
will
you
give
in
to
me
we
must
decide
that
too
i
shall
be
delighted
to
lise
and
certain
to
only
not
in
the
most
important
things
even
if
you
dont
agree
with
me
i
shall
do
my
duty
in
the
most
important
things
thats
right
but
let
me
tell
you
i
am
ready
to
give
in
to
you
not
only
in
the
most
important
matters
but
in
everything
and
i
am
ready
to
vow
to
do
so
nowin
everything
and
for
all
my
life
cried
lise
fervently
and
ill
do
it
gladly
gladly
whats
more
ill
swear
never
to
spy
on
you
never
once
never
to
read
one
of
your
letters
for
you
are
right
and
i
am
not
and
though
i
shall
be
awfully
tempted
to
spy
i
know
that
i
wont
do
it
since
you
consider
it
dishonorable
you
are
my
conscience
now
listen
alexey
fyodorovitch
why
have
you
been
so
sad
latelyboth
yesterday
and
today
i
know
you
have
a
lot
of
anxiety
and
trouble
but
i
see
you
have
some
special
grief
besides
some
secret
one
perhaps
yes
lise
i
have
a
secret
one
too
answered
alyosha
mournfully
i
see
you
love
me
since
you
guessed
that
what
grief
what
about
can
you
tell
me
asked
lise
with
timid
entreaty
ill
tell
you
later
liseafterwards
said
alyosha
confused
now
you
wouldnt
understand
it
perhapsand
perhaps
i
couldnt
explain
it
i
know
your
brothers
and
your
father
are
worrying
you
too
yes
my
brothers
too
murmured
alyosha
pondering
i
dont
like
your
brother
ivan
alyosha
said
lise
suddenly
he
noticed
this
remark
with
some
surprise
but
did
not
answer
it
my
brothers
are
destroying
themselves
he
went
on
my
father
too
and
they
are
destroying
others
with
them
its
the
primitive
force
of
the
karamazovs
as
father
passy
said
the
other
day
a
crude
unbridled
earthly
force
does
the
spirit
of
god
move
above
that
force
even
that
i
dont
know
i
only
know
that
i
too
am
a
karamazov
me
a
monk
a
monk
am
i
a
monk
lise
you
said
just
now
that
i
was
yes
i
did
and
perhaps
i
dont
even
believe
in
god
you
dont
believe
what
is
the
matter
said
lise
quietly
and
gently
but
alyosha
did
not
answer
there
was
something
too
mysterious
too
subjective
in
these
last
words
of
his
perhaps
obscure
to
himself
but
yet
torturing
him
and
now
on
the
top
of
it
all
my
friend
the
best
man
in
the
world
is
going
is
leaving
the
earth
if
you
knew
lise
how
bound

alyosha
thought
it
better
not
to
go
in
to
madame
hohlakov
and
was
going
out
of
the
house
without
saying
goodby
to
her
but
no
sooner
had
he
opened
the
door
than
he
found
madame
hohlakov
standing
before
him
from
the
first
word
alyosha
guessed
that
she
had
been
waiting
on
purpose
to
meet
him
alexey
fyodorovitch
this
is
awful
this
is
all
childish
nonsense
and
ridiculous
i
trust
you
wont
dreamits
foolishness
nothing
but
foolishness
she
said
attacking
him
at
once
only
dont
tell
her
that
said
alyosha
or
she
will
be
upset
and
thats
bad
for
her
now
sensible
advice
from
a
sensible
young
man
am
i
to
understand
that
you
only
agreed
with
her
from
compassion
for
her
invalid
state
because
you
didnt
want
to
irritate
her
by
contradiction
oh
no
not
at
all
i
was
quite
serious
in
what
i
said
alyosha
declared
stoutly
to
be
serious
about
it
is
impossible
unthinkable
and
in
the
first
place
i
shall
never
be
at
home
to
you
again
and
i
shall
take
her
away
you
may
be
sure
of
that
but
why
asked
alyosha
its
all
so
far
off
we
may
have
to
wait
another
year
and
a
half
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
thats
true
of
course
and
youll
have
time
to
quarrel
and
separate
a
thousand
times
in
a
year
and
a
half
but
i
am
so
unhappy
though
its
such
nonsense
its
a
great
blow
to
me
i
feel
like
famusov
in
the
last
scene
of
sorrow
from
wit
you
are
tchatsky
and
she
is
sofya
and
only
fancy
ive
run
down
to
meet
you
on
the
stairs
and
in
the
play
the
fatal
scene
takes
place
on
the
staircase
i
heard
it
all
i
almost
dropped
so
this
is
the
explanation
of
her
dreadful
night
and
her
hysterics
of
late
it
means
love
to
the
daughter
but
death
to
the
mother
i
might
as
well
be
in
my
grave
at
once
and
a
more
serious
matter
still
what
is
this
letter
she
has
written
show
it
me
at
once
at
once
no
theres
no
need
tell
me
how
is
katerina
ivanovna
now
i
must
know
she
still
lies
in
delirium
she
has
not
regained
consciousness
her
aunts
are
here
but
they
do
nothing
but
sigh
and
give
themselves
airs
herzenstube
came
and
he
was
so
alarmed
that
i
didnt
know
what
to
do
for
him
i
nearly
sent
for
a
doctor
to
look
after
him
he
was
driven
home
in
my
carriage
and
on
the
top
of
it
all
you
and
this
letter
its
true
nothing
can
happen
for
a
year
and
a
half
in
the
name
of
all
thats
holy
in
the
name
of
your
dying
elder
show
me
that
letter
alexey
fyodorovitch
im
her
mother
hold
it
in
your
hand
if
you
like
and
i
will
read
it
so
no
i
wont
show
it
to
you
even
if
she
sanctioned
it
i
wouldnt
i
am
coming
tomorrow
and
if
you
like
we
can
talk
over
many
things
but
now
goodby
and
alyosha
ran
downstairs
and
into
the
street
chapter
ii
smerdyakov
with
a
guitar
he
had
no
time
to
lose
indeed
even
while
he
was
saying
goodby
to
lise
the
thought
had
struck
him
that
he
must
attempt
some
stratagem
to
find
his
brother
dmitri
who
was
evidently
keeping
out
of
his
way
it
was
getting
late
nearly
three
oclock
alyoshas
whole
soul
turned
to
the
monastery
to
his
dying
saint
but
the
necessity
of
seeing
dmitri
outweighed
everything
the
conviction
that
a
great
inevitable
catastrophe
was
about
to
happen
grew
stronger
in
alyoshas
mind
with
every
hour
what
that
catastrophe
was
and
what
he
would
say
at
that
moment
to
his
brother
he
could
perhaps
not
have
said
definitely
even
if
my
benefactor
must
die
without
me
anyway
i
wont
have
to
reproach
myself
all
my
life
with
the
thought
that
i
might
have
saved
something
and
did
not
but
passed
by
and
hastened
home
if
i
do
as
i
intend
i
shall
be
following
his
great
precept
his
plan
was
to
catch
his
brother
dmitri
unawares
to
climb
over
the
fence
as
he
had
the
day
before
get
into
the
garden
and
sit
in
the
summerhouse
if
dmitri
were
not
there
thought
alyosha
he
would
not
announce
himself
to
foma
or
the
women
of
the
house
but
would
remain
hidden
in
the
summerhouse
even
if
he
had
to
wait
there
till
evening
if
as
before
dmitri
were
lying
in
wait
for
grushenka
to
come
he
would
be
very
likely
to
come
to
the
summerhouse
alyosha
did
not
however
give
much
thought
to
the
details
of
his
plan
but
resolved
to
act
upon
it
even
if
it
meant
not
getting
back
to
the
monastery
that
day
everything
happened
without
hindrance
he
climbed
over
the
hurdle
almost
in
the
same
spot
as
the
day
before
and
stole
into
the
summerhouse
unseen
he
did
not
want
to
be
noticed
the
woman
of
the
house
and
foma
too
if
he
were
here
might
be
loyal
to
his
brother
and
obey
his
instructions
and
so
refuse
to
let
alyosha
come
into
the
garden
or
might
warn
dmitri
that
he
was
being
sought
and
inquired
for
there
was
no
one
in
the
summerhouse
alyosha
sat
down
and
began
to
wait
he
looked
round
the
summerhouse
which
somehow
struck
him
as
a
great
deal
more
ancient
than
before
though
the
day
was
just
as
fine
as
yesterday
it
seemed
a
wretched
little
place
this
time
there
was
a
circle
on
the
table
left
no
doubt
from
the
glass
of
brandy
having
been
spilt
the
day
before
foolish
and
irrelevant
ideas
strayed
about
his
mind
as
they
always
do
in
a
time
of
tedious
waiting
he
wondered
for
instance
why
he
had
sat
down
precisely
in
the
same
place
as
before
why
not
in
the
other
seat
at
last
he
felt
very
depresseddepressed
by
suspense
and
uncertainty
but
he
had
not
sat
there
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
suddenly
heard
the
thrum
of
a
guitar
somewhere
quite
close
people
were
sitting
or
had
only
just
sat
down
somewhere
in
the
bushes
not
more
than
twenty
paces
away
alyosha
suddenly
recollected
that
on
coming
out
of
the
summerhouse
the
day
before
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
old
green
low
gardenseat
among
the
bushes
on
the
left
by
the
fence
the
people
must
be
sitting
on
it
now
who
were
they
a
mans
voice
suddenly
began
singing
in
a
sugary
falsetto
accompanying
himself
on
the
guitar
with
invincible
force
i
am
bound
to
my
dear
o
lord
have
mercy
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
the
voice
ceased
it
was
a
lackeys
tenor
and
a
lackeys
song
another
voice
a
womans
suddenly
asked
insinuatingly
and
bashfully
though
with
mincing
affectation
why
havent
you
been
to
see
us
for
so
long
pavel
fyodorovitch
why
do
you
always
look
down
upon
us
not
at
all
answered
a
mans
voice
politely
but
with
emphatic
dignity
it
was
clear
that
the
man
had
the
best
of
the
position
and
that
the
woman
was
making
advances
i
believe
the
man
must
be
smerdyakov
thought
alyosha
from
his
voice
and
the
lady
must
be
the
daughter
of
the
house
here
who
has
come
from
moscow
the
one
who
wears
the
dress
with
a
tail
and
goes
to
marfa
for
soup
i
am
awfully
fond
of
verses
of
all
kinds
if
they
rhyme
the
womans
voice
continued
why
dont
you
go
on
the
man
sang
again
what
do
i
care
for
royal
wealth
if
but
my
dear
one
be
in
health
lord
have
mercy
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
on
her
and
on
me
it
was
even
better
last
time
observed
the
womans
voice
you
sang
if
my
darling
be
in
health
it
sounded
more
tender
i
suppose
youve
forgotten
today
poetry
is
rubbish
said
smerdyakov
curtly
oh
no
i
am
very
fond
of
poetry
so
far
as
its
poetry
its
essential
rubbish
consider
yourself
who
ever
talks
in
rhyme
and
if
we
were
all
to
talk
in
rhyme
even
though
it
were
decreed
by
government
we
shouldnt
say
much
should
we
poetry
is
no
good
marya
kondratyevna
how
clever
you
are
how
is
it
youve
gone
so
deep
into
everything
the
womans
voice
was
more
and
more
insinuating
i
could
have
done
better
than
that
i
could
have
known
more
than
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
destiny
from
my
childhood
up
i
would
have
shot
a
man
in
a
duel
if
he
called
me
names
because
i
am
descended
from
a
filthy
beggar
and
have
no
father
and
they
used
to
throw
it
in
my
teeth
in
moscow
it
had
reached
them
from
here
thanks
to
grigory
vassilyevitch
grigory
vassilyevitch
blames
me
for
rebelling
against
my
birth
but
i
would
have
sanctioned
their
killing
me
before
i
was
born
that
i
might
not
have
come
into
the
world
at
all
they
used
to
say
in
the
market
and
your
mamma
too
with
great
lack
of
delicacy
set
off
telling
me
that
her
hair
was
like
a
mat
on
her
head
and
that
she
was
short
of
five
foot
by
a
wee
bit
why
talk
of
a
wee
bit
while
she
might
have
said
a
little
bit
like
every
one
else
she
wanted
to
make
it
touching
a
regular
peasants
feeling
can
a
russian
peasant
be
said
to
feel
in
comparison
with
an
educated
man
he
cant
be
said
to
have
feeling
at
all
in
his
ignorance
from
my
childhood
up
when
i
hear
a
wee
bit
i
am
ready
to
burst
with
rage
i
hate
all
russia
marya
kondratyevna
if
youd
been
a
cadet
in
the
army
or
a
young
hussar
you
wouldnt
have
talked
like
that
but
would
have
drawn
your
saber
to
defend
all
russia
i
dont
want
to
be
a
hussar
marya
kondratyevna
and
whats
more
i
should
like
to
abolish
all
soldiers
and
when
an
enemy
comes
who
is
going
to
defend
us
theres
no
need
of
defense
in
1812
there
was
a
great
invasion
of
russia
by
napoleon
first
emperor
of
the
french
father
of
the
present
one
and
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
if
they
had
conquered
us
a
clever
nation
would
have
conquered
a
very
stupid
one
and
annexed
it
we
should
have
had
quite
different
institutions
are
they
so
much
better
in
their
own
country
than
we
are
i
wouldnt
change
a
dandy
i
know
of
for
three
young
englishmen
observed
marya
kondratyevna
tenderly
doubtless
accompanying
her
words
with
a
most
languishing
glance
thats
as
one
prefers
but
you
are
just
like
a
foreignerjust
like
a
most
gentlemanly
foreigner
i
tell
you
that
though
it
makes
me
bashful
if
you
care
to
know
the
folks
there
and
ours
here
are
just
alike
in
their
vice
they
are
swindlers
only
there
the
scoundrel
wears
polished
boots
and
here
he
grovels
in
filth
and
sees
no
harm
in
it
the
russian
people
want
thrashing
as
fyodor
pavlovitch
said
very
truly
yesterday
though
he
is
mad
and
all
his
children
you
said
yourself
you
had
such
a
respect
for
ivan
fyodorovitch
but
he
said
i
was
a
stinking
lackey
he
thinks
that
i
might
be
unruly
he
is
mistaken
there
if
i
had
a
certain
sum
in
my
pocket
i
would
have
left
here
long
ago
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
lower
than
any
lackey
in
his
behavior
in
his
mind
and
in
his
poverty
he
doesnt
know
how
to
do
anything
and
yet
he
is
respected
by
every
one
i
may
be
only
a
soup
maker
but
with
luck
i
could
open
a
caf
restaurant
in
petrovka
in
moscow
for
my
cookery
is
something
special
and
theres
no
one
in
moscow
except
the
foreigners
whose
cookery
is
anything
special
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
a
beggar
but
if
he
were
to
challenge
the
son
of
the
first
count
in
the
country
hed
fight
him
though
in
what
way
is
he
better
than
i
am
for
he
is
ever
so
much
stupider
than
i
am
look
at
the
money
he
has
wasted
without
any
need
it
must
be
lovely
a
duel
marya
kondratyevna
observed
suddenly
how
so
it
must
be
so
dreadful
and
so
brave
especially
when
young
officers
with
pistols
in
their
hands
pop
at
one
another
for
the
sake
of
some
lady
a
perfect
picture
ah
if
only
girls
were
allowed
to
look
on
id
give
anything
to
see
one
its
all
very
well
when
you
are
firing
at
some
one
but
when
he
is
firing
straight
in
your
mug
you
must
feel
pretty
silly
youd
be
glad
to
run
away
marya
kondratyevna
you
dont
mean
you
would
run
away
but
smerdyakov
did
not
deign
to
reply
after
a
moments
silence
the
guitar
tinkled
again
and
he
sang
again
in
the
same
falsetto
whatever
you
may
say
i
shall
go
far
away
life
will
be
bright
and
gay
in
the
city
far
away
i
shall
not
grieve
i
shall
not
grieve
at
all
i
dont
intend
to
grieve
at
all
then
something
unexpected
happened
alyosha
suddenly
sneezed
they
were
silent
alyosha
got
up
and
walked
towards
them
he
found
smerdyakov
dressed
up
and
wearing
polished
boots
his
hair
pomaded
and
perhaps
curled
the
guitar
lay
on
the
gardenseat
his
companion
was
the
daughter
of
the
house
wearing
a
lightblue
dress
with
a
train
two
yards
long
she
was
young
and
would
not
have
been
badlooking
but
that
her
face
was
so
round
and
terribly
freckled
will
my
brother
dmitri
soon
be
back
asked
alyosha
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
smerdyakov
got
up
slowly
marya
kondratyevna
rose
too
how
am
i
to
know
about
dmitri
fyodorovitch
its
not
as
if
i
were
his
keeper
answered
smerdyakov
quietly
distinctly
and
superciliously
but
i
simply
asked
whether
you
do
know
alyosha
explained
i
know
nothing
of
his
whereabouts
and
dont
want
to
but
my
brother
told
me
that
you
let
him
know
all
that
goes
on
in
the
house
and
promised
to
let
him
know
when
agrafena
alexandrovna
comes
smerdyakov
turned
a
deliberate
unmoved
glance
upon
him
and
how
did
you
get
in
this
time
since
the
gate
was
bolted
an
hour
ago
he
asked
looking
at
alyosha
i
came
in
from
the
backalley
over
the
fence
and
went
straight
to
the
summerhouse
i
hope
youll
forgive
me
he
added
addressing
marya
kondratyevna
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
find
my
brother
ach
as
though
we
could
take
it
amiss
in
you
drawled
marya
kondratyevna
flattered
by
alyoshas
apology
for
dmitri
fyodorovitch
often
goes
to
the
summerhouse
in
that
way
we
dont
know
he
is
here
and
he
is
sitting
in
the
summerhouse
i
am
very
anxious
to
find
him
or
to
learn
from
you
where
he
is
now
believe
me
its
on
business
of
great
importance
to
him
he
never
tells
us
lisped
marya
kondratyevna
though
i
used
to
come
here
as
a
friend
smerdyakov
began
again
dmitri
fyodorovitch
has
pestered
me
in
a
merciless
way
even
here
by
his
incessant
questions
about
the
master
what
news
hell
ask
whats
going
on
in
there
now
whos
coming
and
going
and
cant
i
tell
him
something
more
twice
already
hes
threatened
me
with
death
with
death
alyosha
exclaimed
in
surprise
do
you
suppose
hed
think
much
of
that
with
his
temper
which
you
had
a
chance
of
observing
yourself
yesterday
he
says
if
i
let
agrafena
alexandrovna
in
and
she
passes
the
night
there
ill
be
the
first
to
suffer
for
it
i
am
terribly
afraid
of
him
and
if
i
were
not
even
more
afraid
of
doing
so
i
ought
to
let
the
police
know
god
only
knows
what
he
might
not
do
his
honor
said
to
him
the
other
day
ill
pound
you
in
a
mortar

added
marya
kondratyevna
oh
if
its
pounding
in
a
mortar
it
may
be
only
talk
observed
alyosha
if
i
could
meet
him
i
might
speak
to
him
about
that
too
well
the
only
thing
i
can
tell
you
is
this
said
smerdyakov
as
though
thinking
better
of
it
i
am
here
as
an
old
friend
and
neighbor
and
it
would
be
odd
if
i
didnt
come
on
the
other
hand
ivan
fyodorovitch
sent
me
first
thing
this
morning
to
your
brothers
lodging
in
lake
street
without
a
letter
but
with
a
message
to
dmitri
fyodorovitch
to
go
to
dine
with
him
at
the
restaurant
here
in
the
marketplace
i
went
but
didnt
find
dmitri
fyodorovitch
at
home
though
it
was
eight
oclock
hes
been
here
but
he
is
quite
gone
those
were
the
very
words
of
his
landlady
its
as
though
there
was
an
understanding
between
them
perhaps
at
this
moment
he
is
in
the
restaurant
with
ivan
fyodorovitch
for
ivan
fyodorovitch
has
not
been
home
to
dinner
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
dined
alone
an
hour
ago
and
is
gone
to
lie
down
but
i
beg
you
most
particularly
not
to
speak
of
me
and
of
what
i
have
told
you
for
hed
kill
me
for
nothing
at
all
brother
ivan
invited
dmitri
to
the
restaurant
today
repeated
alyosha
quickly
thats
so
the
metropolis
tavern
in
the
marketplace
the
very
same
thats
quite
likely
cried
alyosha
much
excited
thank
you
smerdyakov
thats
important
ill
go
there
at
once
dont
betray
me
smerdyakov
called
after
him
oh
no
ill
go
to
the
tavern
as
though
by
chance
dont
be
anxious
but
wait
a
minute
ill
open
the
gate
to
you
cried
marya
kondratyevna
no
its
a
short
cut
ill
get
over
the
fence
again
what
he
had
heard
threw
alyosha
into
great
agitation
he
ran
to
the
tavern
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
into
the
tavern
in
his
monastic
dress
but
he
could
inquire
at
the
entrance
for
his
brothers
and
call
them
down
but
just
as
he
reached
the
tavern
a
window
was
flung
open
and
his
brother
ivan
called
down
to
him
from
it
alyosha
cant
you
come
up
here
to
me
i
shall
be
awfully
grateful
to
be
sure
i
can
only
i
dont
quite
know
whether
in
this
dress
but
i
am
in
a
room
apart
come
up
the
steps
ill
run
down
to
meet
you
a
minute
later
alyosha
was
sitting
beside
his
brother
ivan
was
alone
dining
chapter
iii
the
brothers
make
friends
ivan
was
not
however
in
a
separate
room
but
only
in
a
place
shut
off
by
a
screen
so
that
it
was
unseen
by
other
people
in
the
room
it
was
the
first
room
from
the
entrance
with
a
buffet
along
the
wall
waiters
were
continually
darting
to
and
fro
in
it
the
only
customer
in
the
room
was
an
old
retired
military
man
drinking
tea
in
a
corner
but
there
was
the
usual
bustle
going
on
in
the
other
rooms
of
the
tavern
there
were
shouts
for
the
waiters
the
sound
of
popping
corks
the
click
of
billiard
balls
the
drone
of
the
organ
alyosha
knew
that
ivan
did
not
usually
visit
this
tavern
and
disliked
taverns
in
general
so
he
must
have
come
here
he
reflected
simply
to
meet
dmitri
by
arrangement
yet
dmitri
was
not
there
shall
i
order
you
fish
soup
or
anything
you
dont
live
on
tea
alone
i
suppose
cried
ivan
apparently
delighted
at
having
got
hold
of
alyosha
he
had
finished
dinner
and
was
drinking
tea
let
me
have
soup
and
tea
afterwards
i
am
hungry
said
alyosha
gayly
and
cherry
jam
they
have
it
here
you
remember
how
you
used
to
love
cherry
jam
when
you
were
little
you
remember
that
let
me
have
jam
too
i
like
it
still
ivan
rang
for
the
waiter
and
ordered
soup
jam
and
tea
i
remember
everything
alyosha
i
remember
you
till
you
were
eleven
i
was
nearly
fifteen
theres
such
a
difference
between
fifteen
and
eleven
that
brothers
are
never
companions
at
those
ages
i
dont
know
whether
i
was
fond
of
you
even
when
i
went
away
to
moscow
for
the
first
few
years
i
never
thought
of
you
at
all
then
when
you
came
to
moscow
yourself
we
only
met
once
somewhere
i
believe
and
now
ive
been
here
more
than
three
months
and
so
far
we
have
scarcely
said
a
word
to
each
other
tomorrow
i
am
going
away
and
i
was
just
thinking
as
i
sat
here
how
i
could
see
you
to
say
goodby
and
just
then
you
passed
were
you
very
anxious
to
see
me
then
very
i
want
to
get
to
know
you
once
for
all
and
i
want
you
to
know
me
and
then
to
say
goodby
i
believe
its
always
best
to
get
to
know
people
just
before
leaving
them
ive
noticed
how
youve
been
looking
at
me
these
three
months
there
has
been
a
continual
look
of
expectation
in
your
eyes
and
i
cant
endure
that
thats
how
it
is
ive
kept
away
from
you
but
in
the
end
i
have
learned
to
respect
you
the
little
man
stands
firm
i
thought
though
i
am
laughing
i
am
serious
you
do
stand
firm
dont
you
i
like
people
who
are
firm
like
that
whatever
it
is
they
stand
by
even
if
they
are
such
little
fellows
as
you
your
expectant
eyes
ceased
to
annoy
me
i
grew
fond
of
them
in
the
end
those
expectant
eyes
you
seem
to
love
me
for
some
reason
alyosha
i
do
love
you
ivan
dmitri
says
of
youivan
is
a
tomb
i
say
of
you
ivan
is
a
riddle
you
are
a
riddle
to
me
even
now
but
i
understand
something
in
you
and
i
did
not
understand
it
till
this
morning
whats
that
laughed
ivan
you
wont
be
angry
alyosha
laughed
too
well
that
you
are
just
as
young
as
other
young
men
of
three
and
twenty
that
you
are
just
a
young
and
fresh
and
nice
boy
green
in
fact
now
have
i
insulted
you
dreadfully
on
the
contrary
i
am
struck
by
a
coincidence
cried
ivan
warmly
and
goodhumoredly
would
you
believe
it
that
ever
since
that
scene
with
her
i
have
thought
of
nothing
else
but
my
youthful
greenness
and
just
as
though
you
guessed
that
you
begin
about
it
do
you
know
ive
been
sitting
here
thinking
to
myself
that
if
i
didnt
believe
in
life
if
i
lost
faith
in
the
woman
i
love
lost
faith
in
the
order
of
things
were
convinced
in
fact
that
everything
is
a
disorderly
damnable
and
perhaps
devilridden
chaos
if
i
were
struck
by
every
horror
of
mans
disillusionmentstill
i
should
want
to
live
and
having
once
tasted
of
the
cup
i
would
not
turn
away
from
it
till
i
had
drained
it
at
thirty
though
i
shall
be
sure
to
leave
the
cup
even
if
ive
not
emptied
it
and
turn
awaywhere
i
dont
know
but
till
i
am
thirty
i
know
that
my
youth
will
triumph
over
everythingevery
disillusionment
every
disgust
with
life
ive
asked
myself
many
times
whether
there
is
in
the
world
any
despair
that
would
overcome
this
frantic
and
perhaps
unseemly
thirst
for
life
in
me
and
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
isnt
that
is
till
i
am
thirty
and
then
i
shall
lose
it
of
myself
i
fancy
some
driveling
consumptive
moralistsand
poets
especiallyoften
call
that
thirst
for
life
base
its
a
feature
of
the
karamazovs
its
true
that
thirst
for
life
regardless
of
everything
you
have
it
no
doubt
too
but
why
is
it
base
the
centripetal
force
on
our
planet
is
still
fearfully
strong
alyosha
i
have
a
longing
for
life
and
i
go
on
living
in
spite
of
logic
though
i
may
not
believe
in
the
order
of
the
universe
yet
i
love
the
sticky
little
leaves
as
they
open
in
spring
i
love
the
blue
sky
i
love
some
people
whom
one
loves
you
know
sometimes
without
knowing
why
i
love
some
great
deeds
done
by
men
though
ive
long
ceased
perhaps
to
have
faith
in
them
yet
from
old
habit
ones
heart
prizes
them
here
they
have
brought
the
soup
for
you
eat
it
it
will
do
you
good
its
firstrate
soup
they
know
how
to
make
it
here
i
want
to
travel
in
europe
alyosha
i
shall
set
off
from
here
and
yet
i
know
that
i
am
only
going
to
a
graveyard
but
its
a
most
precious
graveyard
thats
what
it
is
precious
are
the
dead
that
lie
there
every
stone
over
them
speaks
of
such
burning
life
in
the
past
of
such
passionate
faith
in
their
work
their
truth
their
struggle
and
their
science
that
i
know
i
shall
fall
on
the
ground
and
kiss
those
stones
and
weep
over
them
though
im
convinced
in
my
heart
that
its
long
been
nothing
but
a
graveyard
and
i
shall
not
weep
from
despair
but
simply
because
i
shall
be
happy
in
my
tears
i
shall
steep
my
soul
in
my
emotion
i
love
the
sticky
leaves
in
spring
the
blue
skythats
all
it
is
its
not
a
matter
of
intellect
or
logic
its
loving
with
ones
inside
with
ones
stomach
one
loves
the
first
strength
of
ones
youth
do
you
understand
anything
of
my
tirade
alyosha
ivan
laughed
suddenly
i
understand
too
well
ivan
one
longs
to
love
with
ones
inside
with
ones
stomach
you
said
that
so
well
and
i
am
awfully
glad
that
you
have
such
a
longing
for
life
cried
alyosha
i
think
every
one
should
love
life
above
everything
in
the
world
love
life
more
than
the
meaning
of
it
certainly
love
it
regardless
of
logic
as
you
say
it
must
be
regardless
of
logic
and
its
only
then
one
will
understand
the
meaning
of
it
i
have
thought
so
a
long
time
half
your
work
is
done
ivan
you
love
life
now
youve
only
to
try
to
do
the
second
half
and
you
are
saved
you
are
trying
to
save
me
but
perhaps
i
am
not
lost
and
what
does
your
second
half
mean
why
one
has
to
raise
up
your
dead
who
perhaps
have
not
died
after
all
come
let
me
have
tea
i
am
so
glad
of
our
talk
ivan
i
see
you
are
feeling
inspired
i
am
awfully
fond
of
such
professions
de
foi
from
suchnovices
you
are
a
steadfast
person
alexey
is
it
true
that
you
mean
to
leave
the
monastery
yes
my
elder
sends
me
out
into
the
world
we
shall
see
each
other
then
in
the
world
we
shall
meet
before
i
am
thirty
when
i
shall
begin
to
turn
aside
from
the
cup
father
doesnt
want
to
turn
aside
from
his
cup
till
he
is
seventy
he
dreams
of
hanging
on
to
eighty
in
fact
so
he
says
he
means
it
only
too
seriously
though
he
is
a
buffoon
he
stands
on
a
firm
rock
too
he
stands
on
his
sensualitythough
after
we
are
thirty
indeed
there
may
be
nothing
else
to
stand
on
but
to
hang
on
to
seventy
is
nasty
better
only
to
thirty
one
might
retain
a
shadow
of
nobility
by
deceiving
oneself
have
you
seen
dmitri
today
no
but
i
saw
smerdyakov
and
alyosha
rapidly
though
minutely
described
his
meeting
with
smerdyakov
ivan
began
listening
anxiously
and
questioned
him
but
he
begged
me
not
to
tell
dmitri
that
he
had
told
me
about
him
added
alyosha
ivan
frowned
and
pondered
are
you
frowning
on
smerdyakovs
account
asked
alyosha
yes
on
his
account
damn
him
i
certainly
did
want
to
see
dmitri
but
now
theres
no
need
said
ivan
reluctantly
but
are
you
really
going
so
soon
brother
yes
what
of
dmitri
and
father
how
will
it
end
asked
alyosha
anxiously
you
are
always
harping
upon
it
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
am
i
my
brother
dmitris
keeper
ivan
snapped
irritably
but
then
he
suddenly
smiled
bitterly
cains
answer
about
his
murdered
brother
wasnt
it
perhaps
thats
what
youre
thinking
at
this
moment
well
damn
it
all
i
cant
stay
here
to
be
their
keeper
can
i
ive
finished
what
i
had
to
do
and
i
am
going
do
you
imagine
i
am
jealous
of
dmitri
that
ive
been
trying
to
steal
his
beautiful
katerina
ivanovna
for
the
last
three
months
nonsense
i
had
business
of
my
own
i
finished
it
i
am
going
i
finished
it
just
now
you
were
witness
at
katerina
ivanovnas
yes
and
ive
released
myself
once
for
all
and
after
all
what
have
i
to
do
with
dmitri
dmitri
doesnt
come
in
i
had
my
own
business
to
settle
with
katerina
ivanovna
you
know
on
the
contrary
that
dmitri
behaved
as
though
there
was
an
understanding
between
us
i
didnt
ask
him
to
do
it
but
he
solemnly
handed
her
over
to
me
and
gave
us
his
blessing
its
all
too
funny
ah
alyosha
if
you
only
knew
how
light
my
heart
is
now
would
you
believe
it
i
sat
here
eating
my
dinner
and
was
nearly
ordering
champagne
to
celebrate
my
first
hour
of
freedom
tfoo
its
been
going
on
nearly
six
months
and
all
at
once
ive
thrown
it
off
i
could
never
have
guessed
even
yesterday
how
easy
it
would
be
to
put
an
end
to
it
if
i
wanted
you
are
speaking
of
your
love
ivan
of
my
love
if
you
like
i
fell
in
love
with
the
young
lady
i
worried
myself
over
her
and
she
worried
me
i
sat
watching
over
her

and
all
at
once
its
collapsed
i
spoke
this
morning
with
inspiration
but
i
went
away
and
roared
with
laughter
would
you
believe
it
yes
its
the
literal
truth
you
seem
very
merry
about
it
now
observed
alyosha
looking
into
his
face
which
had
suddenly
grown
brighter
but
how
could
i
tell
that
i
didnt
care
for
her
a
bit
ha
ha
it
appears
after
all
i
didnt
and
yet
how
she
attracted
me
how
attractive
she
was
just
now
when
i
made
my
speech
and
do
you
know
she
attracts
me
awfully
even
now
yet
how
easy
it
is
to
leave
her
do
you
think
i
am
boasting
no
only
perhaps
it
wasnt
love
alyosha
laughed
ivan
dont
make
reflections
about
love
its
unseemly
for
you
how
you
rushed
into
the
discussion
this
morning
ive
forgotten
to
kiss
you
for
it
but
how
she
tormented
me
it
certainly
was
sitting
by
a
laceration
ah
she
knew
how
i
loved
her
she
loved
me
and
not
dmitri
ivan
insisted
gayly
her
feeling
for
dmitri
was
simply
a
self
laceration
all
i
told
her
just
now
was
perfectly
true
but
the
worst
of
it
is
it
may
take
her
fifteen
or
twenty
years
to
find
out
that
she
doesnt
care
for
dmitri
and
loves
me
whom
she
torments
and
perhaps
she
may
never
find
it
out
at
all
in
spite
of
her
lesson
today
well
its
better
so
i
can
simply
go
away
for
good
by
the
way
how
is
she
now
what
happened
after
i
departed
alyosha
told
him
she
had
been
hysterical
and
that
she
was
now
he
heard
unconscious
and
delirious
isnt
madame
hohlakov
laying
it
on
i
think
not
i
must
find
out
nobody
dies
of
hysterics
though
they
dont
matter
god
gave
woman
hysterics
as
a
relief
i
wont
go
to
her
at
all
why
push
myself
forward
again
but
you
told
her
that
she
had
never
cared
for
you
i
did
that
on
purpose
alyosha
shall
i
call
for
some
champagne
let
us
drink
to
my
freedom
ah
if
only
you
knew
how
glad
i
am
no
brother
we
had
better
not
drink
said
alyosha
suddenly
besides
i
feel
somehow
depressed
yes
youve
been
depressed
a
long
time
ive
noticed
it
have
you
settled
to
go
tomorrow
morning
then
morning
i
didnt
say
i
should
go
in
the
morning
but
perhaps
it
may
be
the
morning
would
you
believe
it
i
dined
here
today
only
to
avoid
dining
with
the
old
man
i
loathe
him
so
i
should
have
left
long
ago
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
but
why
are
you
so
worried
about
my
going
away
weve
plenty
of
time
before
i
go
an
eternity
if
you
are
going
away
tomorrow
what
do
you
mean
by
an
eternity
but
what
does
it
matter
to
us
laughed
ivan
weve
time
enough
for
our
talk
for
what
brought
us
here
why
do
you
look
so
surprised
answer
why
have
we
met
here
to
talk
of
my
love
for
katerina
ivanovna
of
the
old
man
and
dmitri
of
foreign
travel
of
the
fatal
position
of
russia
of
the
emperor
napoleon
is
that
it
no
then
you
know
what
for
its
different
for
other
people
but
we
in
our
green
youth
have
to
settle
the
eternal
questions
first
of
all
thats
what
we
care
about
young
russia
is
talking
about
nothing
but
the
eternal
questions
now
just
when
the
old
folks
are
all
taken
up
with
practical
questions
why
have
you
been
looking
at
me
in
expectation
for
the
last
three
months
to
ask
me
what
do
you
believe
or
dont
you
believe
at
all
thats
what
your
eyes
have
been
meaning
for
these
three
months
havent
they
perhaps
so
smiled
alyosha
you
are
not
laughing
at
me
now
ivan
me
laughing
i
dont
want
to
wound
my
little
brother
who
has
been
watching
me
with
such
expectation
for
three
months
alyosha
look
straight
at
me
of
course
i
am
just
such
a
little
boy
as
you
are
only
not
a
novice
and
what
have
russian
boys
been
doing
up
till
now
some
of
them
i
mean
in
this
stinking
tavern
for
instance
here
they
meet
and
sit
down
in
a
corner
theyve
never
met
in
their
lives
before
and
when
they
go
out
of
the
tavern
they
wont
meet
again
for
forty
years
and
what
do
they
talk
about
in
that
momentary
halt
in
the
tavern
of
the
eternal
questions
of
the
existence
of
god
and
immortality
and
those
who
do
not
believe
in
god
talk
of
socialism
or
anarchism
of
the
transformation
of
all
humanity
on
a
new
pattern
so
that
it
all
comes
to
the
same
theyre
the
same
questions
turned
inside
out
and
masses
masses
of
the
most
original
russian
boys
do
nothing
but
talk
of
the
eternal
questions
isnt
it
so
yes
for
real
russians
the
questions
of
gods
existence
and
of
immortality
or
as
you
say
the
same
questions
turned
inside
out
come
first
and
foremost
of
course
and
so
they
should
said
alyosha
still
watching
his
brother
with
the
same
gentle
and
inquiring
smile
well
alyosha
its
sometimes
very
unwise
to
be
a
russian
at
all
but
anything
stupider
than
the
way
russian
boys
spend
their
time
one
can
hardly
imagine
but
theres
one
russian
boy
called
alyosha
i
am
awfully
fond
of
how
nicely
you
put
that
in
alyosha
laughed
suddenly
well
tell
me
where
to
begin
give
your
orders
the
existence
of
god
eh
begin
where
you
like
you
declared
yesterday
at
fathers
that
there
was
no
god
alyosha
looked
searchingly
at
his
brother
i
said
that
yesterday
at
dinner
on
purpose
to
tease
you
and
i
saw
your
eyes
glow
but
now
ive
no
objection
to
discussing
with
you
and
i
say
so
very
seriously
i
want
to
be
friends
with
you
alyosha
for
i
have
no
friends
and
want
to
try
it
well
only
fancy
perhaps
i
too
accept
god
laughed
ivan
thats
a
surprise
for
you
isnt
it
yes
of
course
if
you
are
not
joking
now
joking
i
was
told
at
the
elders
yesterday
that
i
was
joking
you
know
dear
boy
there
was
an
old
sinner
in
the
eighteenth
century
who
declared
that
if
there
were
no
god
he
would
have
to
be
invented
sil
nexistait
pas
dieu
il
faudrait
linventer
and
man
has
actually
invented
god
and
whats
strange
what
would
be
marvelous
is
not
that
god
should
really
exist
the
marvel
is
that
such
an
idea
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
god
could
enter
the
head
of
such
a
savage
vicious
beast
as
man
so
holy
it
is
so
touching
so
wise
and
so
great
a
credit
it
does
to
man
as
for
me
ive
long
resolved
not
to
think
whether
man
created
god
or
god
man
and
i
wont
go
through
all
the
axioms
laid
down
by
russian
boys
on
that
subject
all
derived
from
european
hypotheses
for
whats
a
hypothesis
there
is
an
axiom
with
the
russian
boy
and
not
only
with
the
boys
but
with
their
teachers
too
for
our
russian
professors
are
often
just
the
same
boys
themselves
and
so
i
omit
all
the
hypotheses
for
what
are
we
aiming
at
now
i
am
trying
to
explain
as
quickly
as
possible
my
essential
nature
that
is
what
manner
of
man
i
am
what
i
believe
in
and
for
what
i
hope
thats
it
isnt
it
and
therefore
i
tell
you
that
i
accept
god
simply
but
you
must
note
this
if
god
exists
and
if
he
really
did
create
the
world
then
as
we
all
know
he
created
it
according
to
the
geometry
of
euclid
and
the
human
mind
with
the
conception
of
only
three
dimensions
in
space
yet
there
have
been
and
still
are
geometricians
and
philosophers
and
even
some
of
the
most
distinguished
who
doubt
whether
the
whole
universe
or
to
speak
more
widely
the
whole
of
being
was
only
created
in
euclids
geometry
they
even
dare
to
dream
that
two
parallel
lines
which
according
to
euclid
can
never
meet
on
earth
may
meet
somewhere
in
infinity
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
since
i
cant
understand
even
that
i
cant
expect
to
understand
about
god
i
acknowledge
humbly
that
i
have
no
faculty
for
settling
such
questions
i
have
a
euclidian
earthly
mind
and
how
could
i
solve
problems
that
are
not
of
this
world
and
i
advise
you
never
to
think
about
it
either
my
dear
alyosha
especially
about
god
whether
he
exists
or
not
all
such
questions
are
utterly
inappropriate
for
a
mind
created
with
an
idea
of
only
three
dimensions
and
so
i
accept
god
and
am
glad
to
and
whats
more
i
accept
his
wisdom
his
purposewhich
are
utterly
beyond
our
ken
i
believe
in
the
underlying
order
and
the
meaning
of
life
i
believe
in
the
eternal
harmony
in
which
they
say
we
shall
one
day
be
blended
i
believe
in
the
word
to
which
the
universe
is
striving
and
which
itself
was
with
god
and
which
itself
is
god
and
so
on
and
so
on
to
infinity
there
are
all
sorts
of
phrases
for
it
i
seem
to
be
on
the
right
path
dont
i
yet
would
you
believe
it
in
the
final
result
i
dont
accept
this
world
of
gods
and
although
i
know
it
exists
i
dont
accept
it
at
all
its
not
that
i
dont
accept
god
you
must
understand
its
the
world
created
by
him
i
dont
and
cannot
accept
let
me
make
it
plain
i
believe
like
a
child
that
suffering
will
be
healed
and
made
up
for
that
all
the
humiliating
absurdity
of
human
contradictions
will
vanish
like
a
pitiful
mirage
like
the
despicable
fabrication
of
the
impotent
and
infinitely
small
euclidian
mind
of
man
that
in
the
worlds
finale
at
the
moment
of
eternal
harmony
something
so
precious
will
come
to
pass
that
it
will
suffice
for
all
hearts
for
the
comforting
of
all
resentments
for
the
atonement
of
all
the
crimes
of
humanity
of
all
the
blood
theyve
shed
that
it
will
make
it
not
only
possible
to
forgive
but
to
justify
all
that
has
happened
with
menbut
though
all
that
may
come
to
pass
i
dont
accept
it
i
wont
accept
it
even
if
parallel
lines
do
meet
and
i
see
it
myself
i
shall
see
it
and
say
that
theyve
met
but
still
i
wont
accept
it
thats
whats
at
the
root
of
me
alyosha
thats
my
creed
i
am
in
earnest
in
what
i
say
i
began
our
talk
as
stupidly
as
i
could
on
purpose
but
ive
led
up
to
my
confession
for
thats
all
you
want
you
didnt
want
to
hear
about
god
but
only
to
know
what
the
brother
you
love
lives
by
and
so
ive
told
you
ivan
concluded
his
long
tirade
with
marked
and
unexpected
feeling
and
why
did
you
begin
as
stupidly
as
you
could
asked
alyosha
looking
dreamily
at
him
to
begin
with
for
the
sake
of
being
russian
russian
conversations
on
such
subjects
are
always
carried
on
inconceivably
stupidly
and
secondly
the
stupider
one
is
the
closer
one
is
to
reality
the
stupider
one
is
the
clearer
one
is
stupidity
is
brief
and
artless
while
intelligence
wriggles
and
hides
itself
intelligence
is
a
knave
but
stupidity
is
honest
and
straightforward
ive
led
the
conversation
to
my
despair
and
the
more
stupidly
i
have
presented
it
the
better
for
me
you
will
explain
why
you
dont
accept
the
world
said
alyosha
to
be
sure
i
will
its
not
a
secret
thats
what
ive
been
leading
up
to
dear
little
brother
i
dont
want
to
corrupt
you
or
to
turn
you
from
your
stronghold
perhaps
i
want
to
be
healed
by
you
ivan
smiled
suddenly
quite
like
a
little
gentle
child
alyosha
had
never
seen
such
a
smile
on
his
face
before
chapter
iv
rebellion
i
must
make
you
one
confession
ivan
began
i
could
never
understand
how
one
can
love
ones
neighbors
its
just
ones
neighbors
to
my
mind
that
one
cant
love
though
one
might
love
those
at
a
distance
i
once
read
somewhere
of
john
the
merciful
a
saint
that
when
a
hungry
frozen
beggar
came
to
him
he
took
him
into
his
bed
held
him
in
his
arms
and
began
breathing
into
his
mouth
which
was
putrid
and
loathsome
from
some
awful
disease
i
am
convinced
that
he
did
that
from
selflaceration
from
the
selflaceration
of
falsity
for
the
sake
of
the
charity
imposed
by
duty
as
a
penance
laid
on
him
for
any
one
to
love
a
man
he
must
be
hidden
for
as
soon
as
he
shows
his
face
love
is
gone
father
zossima
has
talked
of
that
more
than
once
observed
alyosha
he
too
said
that
the
face
of
a
man
often
hinders
many
people
not
practiced
in
love
from
loving
him
but
yet
theres
a
great
deal
of
love
in
mankind
and
almost
christlike
love
i
know
that
myself
ivan
well
i
know
nothing
of
it
so
far
and
cant
understand
it
and
the
innumerable
mass
of
mankind
are
with
me
there
the
question
is
whether
thats
due
to
mens
bad
qualities
or
whether
its
inherent
in
their
nature
to
my
thinking
christlike
love
for
men
is
a
miracle
impossible
on
earth
he
was
god
but
we
are
not
gods
suppose
i
for
instance
suffer
intensely
another
can
never
know
how
much
i
suffer
because
he
is
another
and
not
i
and
whats
more
a
man
is
rarely
ready
to
admit
anothers
suffering
as
though
it
were
a
distinction
why
wont
he
admit
it
do
you
think
because
i
smell
unpleasant
because
i
have
a
stupid
face
because
i
once
trod
on
his
foot
besides
there
is
suffering
and
suffering
degrading
humiliating
suffering
such
as
humbles
mehunger
for
instancemy
benefactor
will
perhaps
allow
me
but
when
you
come
to
higher
sufferingfor
an
idea
for
instancehe
will
very
rarely
admit
that
perhaps
because
my
face
strikes
him
as
not
at
all
what
he
fancies
a
man
should
have
who
suffers
for
an
idea
and
so
he
deprives
me
instantly
of
his
favor
and
not
at
all
from
badness
of
heart
beggars
especially
genteel
beggars
ought
never
to
show
themselves
but
to
ask
for
charity
through
the
newspapers
one
can
love
ones
neighbors
in
the
abstract
or
even
at
a
distance
but
at
close
quarters
its
almost
impossible
if
it
were
as
on
the
stage
in
the
ballet
where
if
beggars
come
in
they
wear
silken
rags
and
tattered
lace
and
beg
for
alms
dancing
gracefully
then
one
might
like
looking
at
them
but
even
then
we
should
not
love
them
but
enough
of
that
i
simply
wanted
to
show
you
my
point
of
view
i
meant
to
speak
of
the
suffering
of
mankind
generally
but
we
had
better
confine
ourselves
to
the
sufferings
of
the
children
that
reduces
the
scope
of
my
argument
to
a
tenth
of
what
it
would
be
still
wed
better
keep
to
the
children
though
it
does
weaken
my
case
but
in
the
first
place
children
can
be
loved
even
at
close
quarters
even
when
they
are
dirty
even
when
they
are
ugly
i
fancy
though
children
never
are
ugly
the
second
reason
why
i
wont
speak
of
grownup
people
is
that
besides
being
disgusting
and
unworthy
of
love
they
have
a
compensationtheyve
eaten
the
apple
and
know
good
and
evil
and
they
have
become
like
gods
they
go
on
eating
it
still
but
the
children
havent
eaten
anything
and
are
so
far
innocent
are
you
fond
of
children
alyosha
i
know
you
are
and
you
will
understand
why
i
prefer
to
speak
of
them
if
they
too
suffer
horribly
on
earth
they
must
suffer
for
their
fathers
sins
they
must
be
punished
for
their
fathers
who
have
eaten
the
apple
but
that
reasoning
is
of
the
other
world
and
is
incomprehensible
for
the
heart
of
man
here
on
earth
the
innocent
must
not
suffer
for
anothers
sins
and
especially
such
innocents
you
may
be
surprised
at
me
alyosha
but
i
am
awfully
fond
of
children
too
and
observe
cruel
people
the
violent
the
rapacious
the
karamazovs
are
sometimes
very
fond
of
children
children
while
they
are
quite
littleup
to
seven
for
instanceare
so
remote
from
grownup
people
they
are
different
creatures
as
it
were
of
a
different
species
i
knew
a
criminal
in
prison
who
had
in
the
course
of
his
career
as
a
burglar
murdered
whole
families
including
several
children
but
when
he
was
in
prison
he
had
a
strange
affection
for
them
he
spent
all
his
time
at
his
window
watching
the
children
playing
in
the
prison
yard
he
trained
one
little
boy
to
come
up
to
his
window
and
made
great
friends
with
him
you
dont
know
why
i
am
telling
you
all
this
alyosha
my
head
aches
and
i
am
sad
you
speak
with
a
strange
air
observed
alyosha
uneasily
as
though
you
were
not
quite
yourself
by
the
way
a
bulgarian
i
met
lately
in
moscow
ivan
went
on
seeming
not
to
hear
his
brothers
words
told
me
about
the
crimes
committed
by
turks
and
circassians
in
all
parts
of
bulgaria
through
fear
of
a
general
rising
of
the
slavs
they
burn
villages
murder
outrage
women
and
children
they
nail
their
prisoners
by
the
ears
to
the
fences
leave
them
so
till
morning
and
in
the
morning
they
hang
themall
sorts
of
things
you
cant
imagine
people
talk
sometimes
of
bestial
cruelty
but
thats
a
great
injustice
and
insult
to
the
beasts
a
beast
can
never
be
so
cruel
as
a
man
so
artistically
cruel
the
tiger
only
tears
and
gnaws
thats
all
he
can
do
he
would
never
think
of
nailing
people
by
the
ears
even
if
he
were
able
to
do
it
these
turks
took
a
pleasure
in
torturing
children
too
cutting
the
unborn
child
from
the
mothers
womb
and
tossing
babies
up
in
the
air
and
catching
them
on
the
points
of
their
bayonets
before
their
mothers
eyes
doing
it
before
the
mothers
eyes
was
what
gave
zest
to
the
amusement
here
is
another
scene
that
i
thought
very
interesting
imagine
a
trembling
mother
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
a
circle
of
invading
turks
around
her
theyve
planned
a
diversion
they
pet
the
baby
laugh
to
make
it
laugh
they
succeed
the
baby
laughs
at
that
moment
a
turk
points
a
pistol
four
inches
from
the
babys
face
the
baby
laughs
with
glee
holds
out
its
little
hands
to
the
pistol
and
he
pulls
the
trigger
in
the
babys
face
and
blows
out
its
brains
artistic
wasnt
it
by
the
way
turks
are
particularly
fond
of
sweet
things
they
say
brother
what
are
you
driving
at
asked
alyosha
i
think
if
the
devil
doesnt
exist
but
man
has
created
him
he
has
created
him
in
his
own
image
and
likeness
just
as
he
did
god
then
observed
alyosha

its
wonderful
how
you
can
turn
words
as
polonius
says
in
hamlet
laughed
ivan
you
turn
my
words
against
me
well
i
am
glad
yours
must
be
a
fine
god
if
man
created
him
in
his
image
and
likeness
you
asked
just
now
what
i
was
driving
at
you
see
i
am
fond
of
collecting
certain
facts
and
would
you
believe
i
even
copy
anecdotes
of
a
certain
sort
from
newspapers
and
books
and
ive
already
got
a
fine
collection
the
turks
of
course
have
gone
into
it
but
they
are
foreigners
i
have
specimens
from
home
that
are
even
better
than
the
turks
you
know
we
prefer
beatingrods
and
scourgesthats
our
national
institution
nailing
ears
is
unthinkable
for
us
for
we
are
after
all
europeans
but
the
rod
and
the
scourge
we
have
always
with
us
and
they
cannot
be
taken
from
us
abroad
now
they
scarcely
do
any
beating
manners
are
more
humane
or
laws
have
been
passed
so
that
they
dont
dare
to
flog
men
now
but
they
make
up
for
it
in
another
way
just
as
national
as
ours
and
so
national
that
it
would
be
practically
impossible
among
us
though
i
believe
we
are
being
inoculated
with
it
since
the
religious
movement
began
in
our
aristocracy
i
have
a
charming
pamphlet
translated
from
the
french
describing
how
quite
recently
five
years
ago
a
murderer
richard
was
executeda
young
man
i
believe
of
three
and
twenty
who
repented
and
was
converted
to
the
christian
faith
at
the
very
scaffold
this
richard
was
an
illegitimate
child
who
was
given
as
a
child
of
six
by
his
parents
to
some
shepherds
on
the
swiss
mountains
they
brought
him
up
to
work
for
them
he
grew
up
like
a
little
wild
beast
among
them
the
shepherds
taught
him
nothing
and
scarcely
fed
or
clothed
him
but
sent
him
out
at
seven
to
herd
the
flock
in
cold
and
wet
and
no
one
hesitated
or
scrupled
to
treat
him
so
quite
the
contrary
they
thought
they
had
every
right
for
richard
had
been
given
to
them
as
a
chattel
and
they
did
not
even
see
the
necessity
of
feeding
him
richard
himself
describes
how
in
those
years
like
the
prodigal
son
in
the
gospel
he
longed
to
eat
of
the
mash
given
to
the
pigs
which
were
fattened
for
sale
but
they
wouldnt
even
give
him
that
and
beat
him
when
he
stole
from
the
pigs
and
that
was
how
he
spent
all
his
childhood
and
his
youth
till
he
grew
up
and
was
strong
enough
to
go
away
and
be
a
thief
the
savage
began
to
earn
his
living
as
a
day
laborer
in
geneva
he
drank
what
he
earned
he
lived
like
a
brute
and
finished
by
killing
and
robbing
an
old
man
he
was
caught
tried
and
condemned
to
death
they
are
not
sentimentalists
there
and
in
prison
he
was
immediately
surrounded
by
pastors
members
of
christian
brotherhoods
philanthropic
ladies
and
the
like
they
taught
him
to
read
and
write
in
prison
and
expounded
the
gospel
to
him
they
exhorted
him
worked
upon
him
drummed
at
him
incessantly
till
at
last
he
solemnly
confessed
his
crime
he
was
converted
he
wrote
to
the
court
himself
that
he
was
a
monster
but
that
in
the
end
god
had
vouchsafed
him
light
and
shown
grace
all
geneva
was
in
excitement
about
himall
philanthropic
and
religious
geneva
all
the
aristocratic
and
wellbred
society
of
the
town
rushed
to
the
prison
kissed
richard
and
embraced
him
you
are
our
brother
you
have
found
grace
and
richard
does
nothing
but
weep
with
emotion
yes
ive
found
grace
all
my
youth
and
childhood
i
was
glad
of
pigs
food
but
now
even
i
have
found
grace
i
am
dying
in
the
lord
yes
richard
die
in
the
lord
you
have
shed
blood
and
must
die
though
its
not
your
fault
that
you
knew
not
the
lord
when
you
coveted
the
pigs
food
and
were
beaten
for
stealing
it
which
was
very
wrong
of
you
for
stealing
is
forbidden
but
youve
shed
blood
and
you
must
die
and
on
the
last
day
richard
perfectly
limp
did
nothing
but
cry
and
repeat
every
minute
this
is
my
happiest
day
i
am
going
to
the
lord
yes
cry
the
pastors
and
the
judges
and
philanthropic
ladies
this
is
the
happiest
day
of
your
life
for
you
are
going
to
the
lord
they
all
walk
or
drive
to
the
scaffold
in
procession
behind
the
prison
van
at
the
scaffold
they
call
to
richard
die
brother
die
in
the
lord
for
even
thou
hast
found
grace
and
so
covered
with
his
brothers
kisses
richard
is
dragged
on
to
the
scaffold
and
led
to
the
guillotine
and
they
chopped
off
his
head
in
brotherly
fashion
because
he
had
found
grace
yes
thats
characteristic
that
pamphlet
is
translated
into
russian
by
some
russian
philanthropists
of
aristocratic
rank
and
evangelical
aspirations
and
has
been
distributed
gratis
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
the
case
of
richard
is
interesting
because
its
national
though
to
us
its
absurd
to
cut
off
a
mans
head
because
he
has
become
our
brother
and
has
found
grace
yet
we
have
our
own
speciality
which
is
all
but
worse
our
historical
pastime
is
the
direct
satisfaction
of
inflicting
pain
there
are
lines
in
nekrassov
describing
how
a
peasant
lashes
a
horse
on
the
eyes
on
its
meek
eyes
every
one
must
have
seen
it
its
peculiarly
russian
he
describes
how
a
feeble
little
nag
has
foundered
under
too
heavy
a
load
and
cannot
move
the
peasant
beats
it
beats
it
savagely
beats
it
at
last
not
knowing
what
he
is
doing
in
the
intoxication
of
cruelty
thrashes
it
mercilessly
over
and
over
again
however
weak
you
are
you
must
pull
if
you
die
for
it
the
nag
strains
and
then
he
begins
lashing
the
poor
defenseless
creature
on
its
weeping
on
its
meek
eyes
the
frantic
beast
tugs
and
draws
the
load
trembling
all
over
gasping
for
breath
moving
sideways
with
a
sort
of
unnatural
spasmodic
actionits
awful
in
nekrassov
but
thats
only
a
horse
and
god
has
given
horses
to
be
beaten
so
the
tatars
have
taught
us
and
they
left
us
the
knout
as
a
remembrance
of
it
but
men
too
can
be
beaten
a
welleducated
cultured
gentleman
and
his
wife
beat
their
own
child
with
a
birchrod
a
girl
of
seven
i
have
an
exact
account
of
it
the
papa
was
glad
that
the
birch
was
covered
with
twigs
it
stings
more
said
he
and
so
he
began
stinging
his
daughter
i
know
for
a
fact
there
are
people
who
at
every
blow
are
worked
up
to
sensuality
to
literal
sensuality
which
increases
progressively
at
every
blow
they
inflict
they
beat
for
a
minute
for
five
minutes
for
ten
minutes
more
often
and
more
savagely
the
child
screams
at
last
the
child
cannot
scream
it
gasps
daddy
daddy
by
some
diabolical
unseemly
chance
the
case
was
brought
into
court
a
counsel
is
engaged
the
russian
people
have
long
called
a
barrister
a
conscience
for
hire
the
counsel
protests
in
his
clients
defense
its
such
a
simple
thing
he
says
an
everyday
domestic
event
a
father
corrects
his
child
to
our
shame
be
it
said
it
is
brought
into
court
the
jury
convinced
by
him
give
a
favorable
verdict
the
public
roars
with
delight
that
the
torturer
is
acquitted
ah
pity
i
wasnt
there
i
would
have
proposed
to
raise
a
subscription
in
his
honor
charming
pictures
but
ive
still
better
things
about
children
ive
collected
a
great
great
deal
about
russian
children
alyosha
there
was
a
little
girl
of
five
who
was
hated
by
her
father
and
mother
most
worthy
and
respectable
people
of
good
education
and
breeding
you
see
i
must
repeat
again
it
is
a
peculiar
characteristic
of
many
people
this
love
of
torturing
children
and
children
only
to
all
other
types
of
humanity
these
torturers
behave
mildly
and
benevolently
like
cultivated
and
humane
europeans
but
they
are
very
fond
of
tormenting
children
even
fond
of
children
themselves
in
that
sense
its
just
their
defenselessness
that
tempts
the
tormentor
just
the
angelic
confidence
of
the
child
who
has
no
refuge
and
no
appeal
that
sets
his
vile
blood
on
fire
in
every
man
of
course
a
demon
lies
hiddenthe
demon
of
rage
the
demon
of
lustful
heat
at
the
screams
of
the
tortured
victim
the
demon
of
lawlessness
let
off
the
chain
the
demon
of
diseases
that
follow
on
vice
gout
kidney
disease
and
so
on
this
poor
child
of
five
was
subjected
to
every
possible
torture
by
those
cultivated
parents
they
beat
her
thrashed
her
kicked
her
for
no
reason
till
her
body
was
one
bruise
then
they
went
to
greater
refinements
of
crueltyshut
her
up
all
night
in
the
cold
and
frost
in
a
privy
and
because
she
didnt
ask
to
be
taken
up
at
night
as
though
a
child
of
five
sleeping
its
angelic
sound
sleep
could
be
trained
to
wake
and
ask
they
smeared
her
face
and
filled
her
mouth
with
excrement
and
it
was
her
mother
her
mother
did
this
and
that
mother
could
sleep
hearing
the
poor
childs
groans
can
you
understand
why
a
little
creature
who
cant
even
understand
whats
done
to
her
should
beat
her
little
aching
heart
with
her
tiny
fist
in
the
dark
and
the
cold
and
weep
her
meek
unresentful
tears
to
dear
kind
god
to
protect
her
do
you
understand
that
friend
and
brother
you
pious
and
humble
novice
do
you
understand
why
this
infamy
must
be
and
is
permitted
without
it
i
am
told
man
could
not
have
existed
on
earth
for
he
could
not
have
known
good
and
evil
why
should
he
know
that
diabolical
good
and
evil
when
it
costs
so
much
why
the
whole
world
of
knowledge
is
not
worth
that
childs
prayer
to
dear
kind
god
i
say
nothing
of
the
sufferings
of
grownup
people
they
have
eaten
the
apple
damn
them
and
the
devil
take
them
all
but
these
little
ones
i
am
making
you
suffer
alyosha
you
are
not
yourself
ill
leave
off
if
you
like
never
mind
i
want
to
suffer
too
muttered
alyosha
one
picture
only
one
more
because
its
so
curious
so
characteristic
and
i
have
only
just
read
it
in
some
collection
of
russian
antiquities
ive
forgotten
the
name
i
must
look
it
up
it
was
in
the
darkest
days
of
serfdom
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
long
live
the
liberator
of
the
people
there
was
in
those
days
a
general
of
aristocratic
connections
the
owner
of
great
estates
one
of
those
mensomewhat
exceptional
i
believe
even
thenwho
retiring
from
the
service
into
a
life
of
leisure
are
convinced
that
theyve
earned
absolute
power
over
the
lives
of
their
subjects
there
were
such
men
then
so
our
general
settled
on
his
property
of
two
thousand
souls
lives
in
pomp
and
domineers
over
his
poor
neighbors
as
though
they
were
dependents
and
buffoons
he
has
kennels
of
hundreds
of
hounds
and
nearly
a
hundred
dogboysall
mounted
and
in
uniform
one
day
a
serfboy
a
little
child
of
eight
threw
a
stone
in
play
and
hurt
the
paw
of
the
generals
favorite
hound
why
is
my

is
told
that
the
boy
threw
a
stone
that
hurt
the
dogs
paw
so
you
did
it
the
general
looked
the
child
up
and
down
take
him
he
was
takentaken
from
his
mother
and
kept
shut
up
all
night
early
that
morning
the
general
comes
out
on
horseback
with
the
hounds
his
dependents
dogboys
and
huntsmen
all
mounted
around
him
in
full
hunting
parade
the
servants
are
summoned
for
their
edification
and
in
front
of
them
all
stands
the
mother
of
the
child
the
child
is
brought
from
the
lockup
its
a
gloomy
cold
foggy
autumn
day
a
capital
day
for
hunting
the
general
orders
the
child
to
be
undressed
the
child
is
stripped
naked
he
shivers
numb
with
terror
not
daring
to
cry
make
him
run
commands
the
general
run
run
shout
the
dogboys
the
boy
runs
at

the

and
he
sets
the
whole
pack
of
hounds
on
the
child
the
hounds
catch
him
and
tear
him
to
pieces
before
his
mothers
eyes
i
believe
the
general
was
afterwards
declared
incapable
of
administering
his
estates
wellwhat
did
he
deserve
to
be
shot
to
be
shot
for
the
satisfaction
of
our
moral
feelings
speak
alyosha
to
be
shot
murmured
alyosha
lifting
his
eyes
to
ivan
with
a
pale
twisted
smile
bravo
cried
ivan
delighted
if
even
you
say
so
youre
a
pretty
monk
so
there
is
a
little
devil
sitting
in
your
heart
alyosha
karamazov
what
i
said
was
absurd
but
thats
just
the
point
that
but
cried
ivan
let
me
tell
you
novice
that
the
absurd
is
only
too
necessary
on
earth
the
world
stands
on
absurdities
and
perhaps
nothing
would
have
come
to
pass
in
it
without
them
we
know
what
we
know
what
do
you
know
i
understand
nothing
ivan
went
on
as
though
in
delirium
i
dont
want
to
understand
anything
now
i
want
to
stick
to
the
fact
i
made
up
my
mind
long
ago
not
to
understand
if
i
try
to
understand
anything
i
shall
be
false
to
the
fact
and
i
have
determined
to
stick
to
the
fact
why
are
you
trying
me
alyosha
cried
with
sudden
distress
will
you
say
what
you
mean
at
last
of
course
i
will
thats
what
ive
been
leading
up
to
you
are
dear
to
me
i
dont
want
to
let
you
go
and
i
wont
give
you
up
to
your
zossima
ivan
for
a
minute
was
silent
his
face
became
all
at
once
very
sad
listen
i
took
the
case
of
children
only
to
make
my
case
clearer
of
the
other
tears
of
humanity
with
which
the
earth
is
soaked
from
its
crust
to
its
center
i
will
say
nothing
i
have
narrowed
my
subject
on
purpose
i
am
a
bug
and
i
recognize
in
all
humility
that
i
cannot
understand
why
the
world
is
arranged
as
it
is
men
are
themselves
to
blame
i
suppose
they
were
given
paradise
they
wanted
freedom
and
stole
fire
from
heaven
though
they
knew
they
would
become
unhappy
so
there
is
no
need
to
pity
them
with
my
pitiful
earthly
euclidian
understanding
all
i
know
is
that
there
is
suffering
and
that
there
are
none
guilty
that
cause
follows
effect
simply
and
directly
that
everything
flows
and
finds
its
levelbut
thats
only
euclidian
nonsense
i
know
that
and
i
cant
consent
to
live
by
it
what
comfort
is
it
to
me
that
there
are
none
guilty
and
that
cause
follows
effect
simply
and
directly
and
that
i
know
iti
must
have
justice
or
i
will
destroy
myself
and
not
justice
in
some
remote
infinite
time
and
space
but
here
on
earth
and
that
i
could
see
myself
i
have
believed
in
it
i
want
to
see
it
and
if
i
am
dead
by
then
let
me
rise
again
for
if
it
all
happens
without
me
it
will
be
too
unfair
surely
i
havent
suffered
simply
that
i
my
crimes
and
my
sufferings
may
manure
the
soil
of
the
future
harmony
for
somebody
else
i
want
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
the
hind
lie
down
with
the
lion
and
the
victim
rise
up
and
embrace
his
murderer
i
want
to
be
there
when
every
one
suddenly
understands
what
it
has
all
been
for
all
the
religions
of
the
world
are
built
on
this
longing
and
i
am
a
believer
but
then
there
are
the
children
and
what
am
i
to
do
about
them
thats
a
question
i
cant
answer
for
the
hundredth
time
i
repeat
there
are
numbers
of
questions
but
ive
only
taken
the
children
because
in
their
case
what
i
mean
is
so
unanswerably
clear
listen
if
all
must
suffer
to
pay
for
the
eternal
harmony
what
have
children
to
do
with
it
tell
me
please
its
beyond
all
comprehension
why
they
should
suffer
and
why
they
should
pay
for
the
harmony
why
should
they
too
furnish
material
to
enrich
the
soil
for
the
harmony
of
the
future
i
understand
solidarity
in
sin
among
men
i
understand
solidarity
in
retribution
too
but
there
can
be
no
such
solidarity
with
children
and
if
it
is
really
true
that
they
must
share
responsibility
for
all
their
fathers
crimes
such
a
truth
is
not
of
this
world
and
is
beyond
my
comprehension
some
jester
will
say
perhaps
that
the
child
would
have
grown
up
and
have
sinned
but
you
see
he
didnt
grow
up
he
was
torn
to
pieces
by
the
dogs
at
eight
years
old
oh
alyosha
i
am
not
blaspheming
i
understand
of
course
what
an
upheaval
of
the
universe
it
will
be
when
everything
in
heaven
and
earth
blends
in
one
hymn
of
praise
and
everything
that
lives
and
has
lived
cries
aloud
thou
art
just
o
lord
for
thy
ways
are
revealed
when
the
mother
embraces
the
fiend
who
threw
her
child
to
the
dogs
and
all
three
cry
aloud
with
tears
thou
art
just
o
lord
then
of
course
the
crown
of
knowledge
will
be
reached
and
all
will
be
made
clear
but
what
pulls
me
up
here
is
that
i
cant
accept
that
harmony
and
while
i
am
on
earth
i
make
haste
to
take
my
own
measures
you
see
alyosha
perhaps
it
really
may
happen
that
if
i
live
to
that
moment
or
rise
again
to
see
it
i
too
perhaps
may
cry
aloud
with
the
rest
looking
at
the
mother
embracing
the
childs
torturer
thou
art
just
o
lord
but
i
dont
want
to
cry
aloud
then
while
there
is
still
time
i
hasten
to
protect
myself
and
so
i
renounce
the
higher
harmony
altogether
its
not
worth
the
tears
of
that
one
tortured
child
who
beat
itself
on
the
breast
with
its
little
fist
and
prayed
in
its
stinking
outhouse
with
its
unexpiated
tears
to
dear
kind
god
its
not
worth
it
because
those
tears
are
unatoned
for
they
must
be
atoned
for
or
there
can
be
no
harmony
but
how
how
are
you
going
to
atone
for
them
is
it
possible
by
their
being
avenged
but
what
do
i
care
for
avenging
them
what
do
i
care
for
a
hell
for
oppressors
what
good
can
hell
do
since
those
children
have
already
been
tortured
and
what
becomes
of
harmony
if
there
is
hell
i
want
to
forgive
i
want
to
embrace
i
dont
want
more
suffering
and
if
the
sufferings
of
children
go
to
swell
the
sum
of
sufferings
which
was
necessary
to
pay
for
truth
then
i
protest
that
the
truth
is
not
worth
such
a
price
i
dont
want
the
mother
to
embrace
the
oppressor
who
threw
her
son
to
the
dogs
she
dare
not
forgive
him
let
her
forgive
him
for
herself
if
she
will
let
her
forgive
the
torturer
for
the
immeasurable
suffering
of
her
mothers
heart
but
the
sufferings
of
her
tortured
child
she
has
no
right
to
forgive
she
dare
not
forgive
the
torturer
even
if
the
child
were
to
forgive
him
and
if
that
is
so
if
they
dare
not
forgive
what
becomes
of
harmony
is
there
in
the
whole
world
a
being
who
would
have
the
right
to
forgive
and
could
forgive
i
dont
want
harmony
from
love
for
humanity
i
dont
want
it
i
would
rather
be
left
with
the
unavenged
suffering
i
would
rather
remain
with
my
unavenged
suffering
and
unsatisfied
indignation
even
if
i
were
wrong
besides
too
high
a
price
is
asked
for
harmony
its
beyond
our
means
to
pay
so
much
to
enter
on
it
and
so
i
hasten
to
give
back
my
entrance
ticket
and
if
i
am
an
honest
man
i
am
bound
to
give
it
back
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
i
am
doing
its
not
god
that
i
dont
accept
alyosha
only
i
most
respectfully
return
him
the
ticket
thats
rebellion
murmured
alyosha
looking
down
rebellion
i
am
sorry
you
call
it
that
said
ivan
earnestly
one
can
hardly
live
in
rebellion
and
i
want
to
live
tell
me
yourself
i
challenge
youanswer
imagine
that
you
are
creating
a
fabric
of
human
destiny
with
the
object
of
making
men
happy
in
the
end
giving
them
peace
and
rest
at
last
but
that
it
was
essential
and
inevitable
to
torture
to
death
only
one
tiny
creaturethat
baby
beating
its
breast
with
its
fist
for
instanceand
to
found
that
edifice
on
its
unavenged
tears
would
you
consent
to
be
the
architect
on
those
conditions
tell
me
and
tell
the
truth
no
i
wouldnt
consent
said
alyosha
softly
and
can
you
admit
the
idea
that
men
for
whom
you
are
building
it
would
agree
to
accept
their
happiness
on
the
foundation
of
the
unexpiated
blood
of
a
little
victim
and
accepting
it
would
remain
happy
for
ever
no
i
cant
admit
it
brother
said
alyosha
suddenly
with
flashing
eyes
you
said
just
now
is
there
a
being
in
the
whole
world
who
would
have
the
right
to
forgive
and
could
forgive
but
there
is
a
being
and
he
can
forgive
everything
all
and
for
all
because
he
gave
his
innocent
blood
for
all
and
everything
you
have
forgotten
him
and
on
him
is
built
the
edifice
and
it
is
to
him
they
cry
aloud
thou
art
just
o
lord
for
thy
ways
are
revealed

ah
the
one
without
sin
and
his
blood
no
i
have
not
forgotten
him
on
the
contrary
ive
been
wondering
all
the
time
how
it
was
you
did
not
bring
him
in
before
for
usually
all
arguments
on
your
side
put
him
in
the
foreground
do
you
know
alyoshadont
laugh
i
made
a
poem
about
a
year
ago
if
you
can
waste
another
ten
minutes
on
me
ill
tell
it
to
you
you
wrote
a
poem
oh
no
i
didnt
write
it
laughed
ivan
and
ive
never
written
two
lines
of
poetry
in
my
life
but
i
made
up
this
poem
in
prose
and
i
remembered
it
i
was
carried
away
when
i
made
it
up
you
will
be
my
first
readerthat
is
listener
why
should
an
author
forego
even
one
listener
smiled
ivan
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
i
am
all
attention
said
alyosha
my
poem
is
called
the
grand
inquisitor
its
a
ridiculous
thing
but
i
want
to
tell
it
to
you
chapter
v
the
grand
inquisitor
even
this
must
have
a
prefacethat
is
a
literary
preface
laughed
ivan
and
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
making
one
you
see
my
action
takes
place
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
at
that
time
as
you
probably
learnt
at
school
it
was
customary
in
poetry
to
bring
down
heavenly
powers
on
earth
not
to
speak
of
dante
in
france
clerks
as
well
as
the
monks
in
the
monasteries
used
to
give
regular
performances
in
which
the
madonna
the
saints
the
angels
christ
and
god
himself
were
brought
on
the
stage
in
those
days
it
was
done
in
all
simplicity
in
victor
hugos
notre
dame
de
paris
an
edifying
and
gratuitous
spectacle
was
provided
for
the
people
in
the

of

in
the
reign
of
louis

similar
plays
chiefly
from
the
old
testament
were
occasionally
performed
in
moscow
too
up
to
the
times
of
peter
the
great
but
besides
plays
there
were
all
sorts
of
legends
and
ballads
scattered
about
the
world
in
which
the
saints
and
angels
and
all
the
powers
of
heaven
took
part
when
required
in
our
monasteries
the
monks
busied
themselves
in
translating
copying
and
even
composing
such
poemsand
even
under
the
tatars
there
is
for
instance
one
such
poem
of
course
from
the
greek
the
wanderings
of
our
lady
through
hell
with
descriptions
as
bold
as
dantes
our
lady
visits
hell
and
the
archangel
michael
leads
her
through
the
torments
she
sees
the
sinners
and
their
punishment
there
she
sees
among
others
one
noteworthy
set
of
sinners
in
a
burning
lake
some
of
them
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
so
that
they
cant
swim
out
and
these
god
forgetsan
expression
of
extraordinary
depth
and
force
and
so
our
lady
shocked
and
weeping
falls
before
the
throne
of
god
and
begs
for
mercy
for
all
in
hellfor
all
she
has
seen
there
indiscriminately
her
conversation
with
god
is
immensely
interesting
she
beseeches
him
she
will
not
desist
and
when
god
points
to
the
hands
and
feet
of
her
son
nailed
to
the
cross
and
asks
how
can
i
forgive
his
tormentors
she
bids
all
the
saints
all
the
martyrs
all
the
angels
and
archangels
to
fall
down
with
her
and
pray
for
mercy
on
all
without
distinction
it
ends
by
her
winning
from
god
a
respite
of
suffering
every
year
from
good
friday
till
trinity
day
and
the
sinners
at
once
raise
a
cry
of
thankfulness
from
hell
chanting
thou
art
just
o
lord
in
this
judgment
well
my
poem
would
have
been
of
that
kind
if
it
had
appeared
at
that
time
he
comes
on
the
scene
in
my
poem
but
he
says
nothing
only
appears
and
passes
on
fifteen
centuries
have
passed
since
he
promised
to
come
in
his
glory
fifteen
centuries
since
his
prophet
wrote
behold
i
come
quickly
of
that
day
and
that
hour
knoweth
no
man
neither
the
son
but
the
father
as
he
himself
predicted
on
earth
but
humanity
awaits
him
with
the
same
faith
and
with
the
same
love
oh
with
greater
faith
for
it
is
fifteen
centuries
since
man
has
ceased
to
see
signs
from
heaven
no
signs
from
heaven
come
today
to
add
to
what
the
heart
doth
say
there
was
nothing
left
but
faith
in
what
the
heart
doth
say
it
is
true
there
were
many
miracles
in
those
days
there
were
saints
who
performed
miraculous
cures
some
holy
people
according
to
their
biographies
were
visited
by
the
queen
of
heaven
herself
but
the
devil
did
not
slumber
and
doubts
were
already
arising
among
men
of
the
truth
of
these
miracles
and
just
then
there
appeared
in
the
north
of
germany
a
terrible
new
heresy
a
huge
star
like
to
a
torch
that
is
to
a
church
fell
on
the
sources
of
the
waters
and
they
became
bitter
these
heretics
began
blasphemously
denying
miracles
but
those
who
remained
faithful
were
all
the
more
ardent
in
their
faith
the
tears
of
humanity
rose
up
to
him
as
before
awaited
his
coming
loved
him
hoped
for
him
yearned
to
suffer
and
die
for
him
as
before
and
so
many
ages
mankind
had
prayed
with
faith
and
fervor
o
lord
our
god
hasten
thy
coming
so
many
ages
called
upon
him
that
in
his
infinite
mercy
he
deigned
to
come
down
to
his
servants
before
that
day
he
had
come
down
he
had
visited
some
holy
men
martyrs
and
hermits
as
is
written
in
their
lives
among
us
tyutchev
with
absolute
faith
in
the
truth
of
his
words
bore
witness
that
bearing
the
cross
in
slavish
dress
weary
and
worn
the
heavenly
king
our
mother
russia
came
to
bless
and
through
our
land
went
wandering
and
that
certainly
was
so
i
assure
you
and
behold
he
deigned
to
appear
for
a
moment
to
the
people
to
the
tortured
suffering
people
sunk
in
iniquity
but
loving
him
like
children
my
story
is
laid
in
spain
in
seville
in
the
most
terrible
time
of
the
inquisition
when
fires
were
lighted
every
day
to
the
glory
of
god
and
in
the
splendid
auto
da
f
the
wicked
heretics
were
burnt
oh
of
course
this
was
not
the
coming
in
which
he
will
appear
according
to
his
promise
at
the
end
of
time
in
all
his
heavenly
glory
and
which
will
be
sudden
as
lightning
flashing
from
east
to
west
no
he
visited
his
children
only
for
a
moment
and
there
where
the
flames
were
crackling
round
the
heretics
in
his
infinite
mercy
he
came
once
more
among
men
in
that
human
shape
in
which
he
walked
among
men
for
three
years
fifteen
centuries
ago
he
came
down
to
the
hot
pavements
of
the
southern
town
in
which
on
the
day
before
almost
a
hundred
heretics
had
ad
majorem
gloriam
dei
been
burnt
by
the
cardinal
the
grand
inquisitor
in
a
magnificent
auto
da
f
in
the
presence
of
the
king
the
court
the
knights
the
cardinals
the
most
charming
ladies
of
the
court
and
the
whole
population
of
seville
he
came
softly
unobserved
and
yet
strange
to
say
every
one
recognized
him
that
might
be
one
of
the
best
passages
in
the
poem
i
mean
why
they
recognized
him
the
people
are
irresistibly
drawn
to
him
they
surround
him
they
flock
about
him
follow
him
he
moves
silently
in
their
midst
with
a
gentle
smile
of
infinite
compassion
the
sun
of
love
burns
in
his
heart
light
and
power
shine
from
his
eyes
and
their
radiance
shed
on
the
people
stirs
their
hearts
with
responsive
love
he
holds
out
his
hands
to
them
blesses
them
and
a
healing
virtue
comes
from
contact
with
him
even
with
his
garments
an
old
man
in
the
crowd
blind
from
childhood
cries
out
o
lord
heal
me
and
i
shall
see
thee
and
as
it
were
scales
fall
from
his
eyes
and
the
blind
man
sees
him
the
crowd
weeps
and
kisses
the
earth
under
his
feet
children
throw
flowers
before
him
sing
and
cry
hosannah
it
is
heit
is
he
all
repeat
it
must
be
he
it
can
be
no
one
but
him
he
stops
at
the
steps
of
the
seville
cathedral
at
the
moment
when
the
weeping
mourners
are
bringing
in
a
little
open
white
coffin
in
it
lies
a
child
of
seven
the
only
daughter
of
a
prominent
citizen
the
dead
child
lies
hidden
in
flowers
he
will
raise
your
child
the
crowd
shouts
to
the
weeping
mother
the
priest
coming
to
meet
the
coffin
looks
perplexed
and
frowns
but
the
mother
of
the
dead
child
throws
herself
at
his
feet
with
a
wail
if
it
is
thou
raise
my
child
she
cries
holding
out
her
hands
to
him
the
procession
halts
the
coffin
is
laid
on
the
steps
at
his
feet
he
looks
with
compassion
and
his
lips
once
more
softly
pronounce
maiden
arise
and
the
maiden
arises
the
little
girl
sits
up
in
the
coffin
and
looks
round
smiling
with
wide
open
wondering
eyes
holding
a
bunch
of
white
roses
they
had
put
in
her
hand
there
are
cries
sobs
confusion
among
the
people
and
at
that
moment
the
cardinal
himself
the
grand
inquisitor
passes
by
the
cathedral
he
is
an
old
man
almost
ninety
tall
and
erect
with
a
withered
face
and
sunken
eyes
in
which
there
is
still
a
gleam
of
light
he
is
not
dressed
in
his
gorgeous
cardinals
robes
as
he
was
the
day
before
when
he
was
burning
the
enemies
of
the
roman
churchat
this
moment
he
is
wearing
his
coarse
old
monks
cassock
at
a
distance
behind
him
come
his
gloomy
assistants
and
slaves
and
the
holy
guard
he
stops
at
the
sight
of
the
crowd
and
watches
it
from
a
distance
he
sees
everything
he
sees
them
set
the
coffin
down
at
his
feet
sees
the
child
rise
up
and
his
face
darkens
he
knits
his
thick
gray
brows
and
his
eyes
gleam
with
a
sinister
fire
he
holds
out
his
finger
and
bids
the
guards
take
him
and
such
is
his
power
so
completely
are
the
people
cowed
into
submission
and
trembling
obedience
to
him
that
the
crowd
immediately
makes
way
for
the
guards
and
in
the
midst
of
deathlike
silence
they
lay
hands
on
him
and
lead
him
away
the
crowd
instantly
bows
down
to
the
earth
like
one
man
before
the
old
inquisitor
he
blesses
the
people
in
silence
and
passes
on
the
guards
lead
their
prisoner
to
the
close
gloomy
vaulted
prison
in
the
ancient
palace
of
the
holy
inquisition
and
shut
him
in
it
the
day
passes
and
is
followed
by
the
dark
burning
breathless
night
of
seville
the
air
is
fragrant
with
laurel
and
lemon
in
the
pitch
darkness
the
iron
door
of
the
prison
is
suddenly
opened
and
the
grand
inquisitor
himself
comes
in
with
a
light
in
his
hand
he
is
alone
the
door
is
closed
at
once
behind
him
he
stands
in
the
doorway
and
for
a
minute
or
two
gazes
into
his
face
at
last
he
goes
up
slowly
sets
the
light
on
the
table
and
speaks

is
it
thou
thou
but
receiving
no
answer
he
adds
at
once
dont
answer
be
silent
what
canst
thou
say
indeed
i
know
too
well
what
thou
wouldst
say
and
thou
hast
no
right
to
add
anything
to
what
thou
hadst
said
of
old
why
then
art
thou
come
to
hinder
us
for
thou
hast
come
to
hinder
us
and
thou
knowest
that
but
dost
thou
know
what
will
be
to
morrow
i
know
not
who
thou
art
and
care
not
to
know
whether
it
is
thou
or
only
a
semblance
of
him
but
tomorrow
i
shall
condemn
thee
and
burn
thee
at
the
stake
as
the
worst
of
heretics
and
the
very
people
who
have
today
kissed
thy
feet
tomorrow
at
the
faintest
sign
from
me
will
rush
to
heap
up
the
embers
of
thy
fire
knowest
thou
that
yes
maybe
thou
knowest
it
he
added
with
thoughtful
penetration
never
for
a
moment
taking
his
eyes
off
the
prisoner
i
dont
quite
understand
ivan
what
does
it
mean
alyosha
who
had
been
listening
in
silence
said
with
a
smile
is
it
simply
a
wild
fantasy
or
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
old
mansome
impossible
quiproquo
take
it
as
the
last
said
ivan
laughing
if
you
are
so
corrupted
by
modern
realism
and
cant
stand
anything
fantastic
if
you
like
it
to
be
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
let
it
be
so
it
is
true
he
went
on
laughing
the
old
man
was
ninety
and
he
might
well
be
crazy
over
his
set
idea
he
might
have
been
struck
by
the
appearance
of
the
prisoner
it
might
in
fact
be
simply
his
ravings
the
delusion
of
an
old
man
of
ninety
overexcited
by
the
auto
da
f
of
a
hundred
heretics
the
day
before
but
does
it
matter
to
us
after
all
whether
it
was
a
mistake
of
identity
or
a
wild
fantasy
all
that
matters
is
that
the
old
man
should
speak
out
should
speak
openly
of
what
he
has
thought
in
silence
for
ninety
years
and
the
prisoner
too
is
silent
does
he
look
at
him
and
not
say
a
word
thats
inevitable
in
any
case
ivan
laughed
again
the
old
man
has
told
him
he
hasnt
the
right
to
add
anything
to
what
he
has
said
of
old
one
may
say
it
is
the
most
fundamental
feature
of
roman
catholicism
in
my
opinion
at
least
all
has
been
given
by
thee
to
the
pope
they
say
and
all
therefore
is
still
in
the
popes
hands
and
there
is
no
need
for
thee
to
come
now
at
all
thou
must
not
meddle
for
the
time
at
least
thats
how
they
speak
and
write
toothe
jesuits
at
any
rate
i
have
read
it
myself
in
the
works
of
their
theologians
hast
thou
the
right
to
reveal
to
us
one
of
the
mysteries
of
that
world
from
which
thou
hast
come
my
old
man
asks
him
and
answers
the
question
for
him
no
thou
hast
not
that
thou
mayest
not
add
to
what
has
been
said
of
old
and
mayest
not
take
from
men
the
freedom
which
thou
didst
exalt
when
thou
wast
on
earth
whatsoever
thou
revealest
anew
will
encroach
on
mens
freedom
of
faith
for
it
will
be
manifest
as
a
miracle
and
the
freedom
of
their
faith
was
dearer
to
thee
than
anything
in
those
days
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
didst
thou
not
often
say
then
i
will
make
you
free
but
now
thou
hast
seen
these
free
men
the
old
man
adds
suddenly
with
a
pensive
smile
yes
weve
paid
dearly
for
it
he
goes
on
looking
sternly
at
him
but
at
last
we
have
completed
that
work
in
thy
name
for
fifteen
centuries
we
have
been
wrestling
with
thy
freedom
but
now
it
is
ended
and
over
for
good
dost
thou
not
believe
that
its
over
for
good
thou
lookest
meekly
at
me
and
deignest
not
even
to
be
wroth
with
me
but
let
me
tell
thee
that
now
today
people
are
more
persuaded
than
ever
that
they
have
perfect
freedom
yet
they
have
brought
their
freedom
to
us
and
laid
it
humbly
at
our
feet
but
that
has
been
our
doing
was
this
what
thou
didst
was
this
thy
freedom

i
dont
understand
again
alyosha
broke
in
is
he
ironical
is
he
jesting
not
a
bit
of
it
he
claims
it
as
a
merit
for
himself
and
his
church
that
at
last
they
have
vanquished
freedom
and
have
done
so
to
make
men
happy
for
now
he
is
speaking
of
the
inquisition
of
course
for
the
first
time
it
has
become
possible
to
think
of
the
happiness
of
men
man
was
created
a
rebel
and
how
can
rebels
be
happy
thou
wast
warned
he
says
to
him
thou
hast
had
no
lack
of
admonitions
and
warnings
but
thou
didst
not
listen
to
those
warnings
thou
didst
reject
the
only
way
by
which
men
might
be
made
happy
but
fortunately
departing
thou
didst
hand
on
the
work
to
us
thou
hast
promised
thou
hast
established
by
thy
word
thou
hast
given
to
us
the
right
to
bind
and
to
unbind
and
now
of
course
thou
canst
not
think
of
taking
it
away
why
then
hast
thou
come
to
hinder
us

and
whats
the
meaning
of
no
lack
of
admonitions
and
warnings
asked
alyosha
why
thats
the
chief
part
of
what
the
old
man
must
say

the
wise
and
dread
spirit
the
spirit
of
selfdestruction
and
non
existence
the
old
man
goes
on
the
great
spirit
talked
with
thee
in
the
wilderness
and
we
are
told
in
the
books
that
he
tempted
thee
is
that
so
and
could
anything
truer
be
said
than
what
he
revealed
to
thee
in
three
questions
and
what
thou
didst
reject
and
what
in
the
books
is
called
the
temptation
and
yet
if
there
has
ever
been
on
earth
a
real
stupendous
miracle
it
took
place
on
that
day
on
the
day
of
the
three
temptations
the
statement
of
those
three
questions
was
itself
the
miracle
if
it
were
possible
to
imagine
simply
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
those
three
questions
of
the
dread
spirit
had
perished
utterly
from
the
books
and
that
we
had
to
restore
them
and
to
invent
them
anew
and
to
do
so
had
gathered
together
all
the
wise
men
of
the
earthrulers
chief
priests
learned
men
philosophers
poetsand
had
set
them
the
task
to
invent
three
questions
such
as
would
not
only
fit
the
occasion
but
express
in
three
words
three
human
phrases
the
whole
future
history
of
the
world
and
of
humanitydost
thou
believe
that
all
the
wisdom
of
the
earth
united
could
have
invented
anything
in
depth
and
force
equal
to
the
three
questions
which
were
actually
put
to
thee
then
by
the
wise
and
mighty
spirit
in
the
wilderness
from
those
questions
alone
from
the
miracle
of
their
statement
we
can
see
that
we
have
here
to
do
not
with
the
fleeting
human
intelligence
but
with
the
absolute
and
eternal
for
in
those
three
questions
the
whole
subsequent
history
of
mankind
is
as
it
were
brought
together
into
one
whole
and
foretold
and
in
them
are
united
all
the
unsolved
historical
contradictions
of
human
nature
at
the
time
it
could
not
be
so
clear
since
the
future
was
unknown
but
now
that
fifteen
hundred
years
have
passed
we
see
that
everything
in
those
three
questions
was
so
justly
divined
and
foretold
and
has
been
so
truly
fulfilled
that
nothing
can
be
added
to
them
or
taken
from
them

judge
thyself
who
was
rightthou
or
he
who
questioned
thee
then
remember
the
first
question
its
meaning
in
other
words
was
this
thou
wouldst
go
into
the
world
and
art
going
with
empty
hands
with
some
promise
of
freedom
which
men
in
their
simplicity
and
their
natural
unruliness
cannot
even
understand
which
they
fear
and
dreadfor
nothing
has
ever
been
more
insupportable
for
a
man
and
a
human
society
than
freedom
but
seest
thou
these
stones
in
this
parched
and
barren
wilderness
turn
them
into
bread
and
mankind
will
run
after
thee
like
a
flock
of
sheep
grateful
and
obedient
though
for
ever
trembling
lest
thou
withdraw
thy
hand
and
deny
them
thy
bread
but
thou
wouldst
not
deprive
man
of
freedom
and
didst
reject
the
offer
thinking
what
is
that
freedom
worth
if
obedience
is
bought
with
bread
thou
didst
reply
that
man
lives
not
by
bread
alone
but
dost
thou
know
that
for
the
sake
of
that
earthly
bread
the
spirit
of
the
earth
will
rise
up
against
thee
and
will
strive
with
thee
and
overcome
thee
and
all
will
follow
him
crying
who
can
compare
with
this
beast
he
has
given
us
fire
from
heaven
dost
thou
know
that
the
ages
will
pass
and
humanity
will
proclaim
by
the
lips
of
their
sages
that
there
is
no
crime
and
therefore
no
sin
there
is
only
hunger
feed
men
and
then
ask
of
them
virtue
thats
what
theyll
write
on
the
banner
which
they
will
raise
against
thee
and
with
which
they
will
destroy
thy
temple
where
thy
temple
stood
will
rise
a
new
building
the
terrible
tower
of
babel
will
be
built
again
and
though
like
the
one
of
old
it
will
not
be
finished
yet
thou
mightest
have
prevented
that
new
tower
and
have
cut
short
the
sufferings
of
men
for
a
thousand
years
for
they
will
come
back
to
us
after
a
thousand
years
of
agony
with
their
tower
they
will
seek
us
again
hidden
underground
in
the
catacombs
for
we
shall
be
again
persecuted
and
tortured
they
will
find
us
and
cry
to
us
feed
us
for
those
who
have
promised
us
fire
from
heaven
havent
given
it
and
then
we
shall
finish
building
their
tower
for
he
finishes
the
building
who
feeds
them
and
we
alone
shall
feed
them
in
thy
name
declaring
falsely
that
it
is
in
thy
name
oh
never
never
can
they
feed
themselves
without
us
no
science
will
give
them
bread
so
long
as
they
remain
free
in
the
end
they
will
lay
their
freedom
at
our
feet
and
say
to
us
make
us
your
slaves
but
feed
us
they
will
understand
themselves
at
last
that
freedom
and
bread
enough
for
all
are
inconceivable
together
for
never
never
will
they
be
able
to
share
between
them
they
will
be
convinced
too
that
they
can
never
be
free
for
they
are
weak
vicious
worthless
and
rebellious
thou
didst
promise
them
the
bread
of
heaven
but
i
repeat
again
can
it
compare
with
earthly
bread
in
the
eyes
of
the
weak
ever
sinful
and
ignoble
race
of
man
and
if
for
the
sake
of
the
bread
of
heaven
thousands
shall
follow
thee
what
is
to
become
of
the
millions
and
tens
of
thousands
of
millions
of
creatures
who
will
not
have
the
strength
to
forego
the
earthly
bread
for
the
sake
of
the
heavenly
or
dost
thou
care
only
for
the
tens
of
thousands
of
the
great
and
strong
while
the
millions
numerous
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
who
are
weak
but
love
thee
must
exist
only
for
the
sake
of
the
great
and
strong
no
we
care
for
the
weak
too
they
are
sinful
and
rebellious
but
in
the
end
they
too
will
become
obedient
they
will
marvel
at
us
and
look
on
us
as
gods
because
we
are
ready
to
endure
the
freedom
which
they
have
found
so
dreadful
and
to
rule
over
themso
awful
it
will
seem
to
them
to
be
free
but
we
shall
tell
them
that
we
are
thy
servants
and
rule
them
in
thy
name
we
shall
deceive
them
again
for
we
will
not
let
thee
come
to
us
again
that
deception
will
be
our
suffering
for
we
shall
be
forced
to
lie

this
is
the
significance
of
the
first
question
in
the
wilderness
and
this
is
what
thou
hast
rejected
for
the
sake
of
that
freedom
which
thou
hast
exalted
above
everything
yet
in
this
question
lies
hid
the
great
secret
of
this
world
choosing
bread
thou
wouldst
have
satisfied
the
universal
and
everlasting
craving
of
humanityto
find
some
one
to
worship
so
long
as
man
remains
free
he
strives
for
nothing
so
incessantly
and
so
painfully
as
to
find
some
one
to
worship
but
man
seeks
to
worship
what
is
established
beyond
dispute
so
that
all
men
would
agree
at
once
to
worship
it
for
these
pitiful
creatures
are
concerned
not
only
to
find
what
one
or
the
other
can
worship
but
to
find
something
that
all
would
believe
in
and
worship
what
is
essential
is
that
all
may
be
together
in
it
this
craving
for
community
of
worship
is
the
chief
misery
of
every
man
individually
and
of
all
humanity
from
the
beginning
of
time
for
the
sake
of
common
worship
theyve
slain
each
other
with
the
sword
they
have
set
up
gods
and
challenged
one
another
put
away
your
gods
and
come
and
worship
ours
or
we
will
kill
you
and
your
gods
and
so
it
will
be
to
the
end
of
the
world
even
when
gods
disappear
from
the
earth
they
will
fall
down
before
idols
just
the
same
thou
didst
know
thou
couldst
not
but
have
known
this
fundamental
secret
of
human
nature
but
thou
didst
reject
the
one
infallible
banner
which
was
offered
thee
to
make
all
men
bow
down
to
thee
alonethe
banner
of
earthly
bread
and
thou
hast
rejected
it
for
the
sake
of
freedom
and
the
bread
of
heaven
behold
what
thou
didst
further
and
all
again
in
the
name
of
freedom
i
tell
thee
that
man
is
tormented
by
no
greater
anxiety
than
to
find
some
one
quickly
to
whom
he
can
hand
over
that
gift
of
freedom
with
which
the
illfated
creature
is
born
but
only
one
who
can
appease
their
conscience
can
take
over
their
freedom
in
bread
there
was
offered
thee
an
invincible
banner
give
bread
and
man
will
worship
thee
for
nothing
is
more
certain
than
bread
but
if
some
one
else
gains
possession
of
his
conscienceoh
then
he
will
cast
away
thy
bread
and
follow
after
him
who
has
ensnared
his
conscience
in
that
thou
wast
right
for
the
secret
of
mans
being
is
not
only
to
live
but
to
have
something
to
live
for
without
a
stable
conception
of
the
object
of
life
man
would
not
consent
to
go
on
living
and
would
rather
destroy
himself
than
remain
on
earth
though
he
had
bread
in
abundance
that
is
true
but
what
happened
instead
of
taking
mens
freedom
from
them
thou
didst
make
it
greater
than
ever
didst
thou
forget
that
man
prefers
peace
and
even
death
to
freedom
of
choice
in
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
nothing
is
more
seductive
for
man
than
his
freedom
of
conscience
but
nothing
is
a
greater
cause
of
suffering
and
behold
instead
of
giving
a
firm
foundation
for
setting
the
conscience
of
man
at
rest
for
ever
thou
didst
choose
all
that
is
exceptional
vague
and
enigmatic
thou
didst
choose
what
was
utterly
beyond
the
strength
of
men
acting
as
though
thou
didst
not
love
them
at
allthou
who
didst
come
to
give
thy
life
for
them
instead
of
taking
possession
of
mens
freedom
thou
didst
increase
it
and
burdened
the
spiritual
kingdom
of
mankind
with
its
sufferings
for
ever
thou
didst
desire
mans
free
love
that
he
should
follow
thee
freely
enticed
and
taken
captive
by
thee
in
place
of
the
rigid
ancient
law
man
must
hereafter
with
free
heart
decide
for
himself
what
is
good
and
what
is
evil
having
only
thy
image
before
him
as
his
guide
but
didst
thou
not
know
that
he
would
at
last
reject
even
thy
image
and
thy
truth
if
he
is
weighed
down
with
the
fearful
burden
of
free
choice
they
will
cry
aloud
at
last
that
the
truth
is
not
in
thee
for
they
could
not
have
been
left
in
greater
confusion
and
suffering
than
thou
hast
caused
laying
upon
them
so
many
cares
and
unanswerable
problems

so
that
in
truth
thou
didst
thyself
lay
the
foundation
for
the
destruction
of
thy
kingdom
and
no
one
is
more
to
blame
for
it
yet
what
was
offered
thee
there
are
three
powers
three
powers
alone
able
to
conquer
and
to
hold
captive
for
ever
the
conscience
of
these
impotent
rebels
for
their
happinessthose
forces
are
miracle
mystery
and
authority
thou
hast
rejected
all
three
and
hast
set
the
example
for
doing
so
when
the
wise
and
dread
spirit
set
thee
on
the
pinnacle
of
the
temple
and
said
to
thee
if
thou
wouldst
know
whether
thou
art
the
son
of
god
then
cast
thyself
down
for
it
is
written
the
angels
shall
hold
him
up
lest
he
fall
and
bruise
himself
and
thou
shalt
know
then
whether
thou
art
the
son
of
god
and
shalt
prove
then
how
great
is
thy
faith
in
thy
father
but
thou
didst
refuse
and
wouldst
not
cast
thyself
down
oh
of
course
thou
didst
proudly
and
well
like
god
but
the
weak
unruly
race
of
men
are
they
gods
oh
thou
didst
know
then
that
in
taking
one
step
in
making
one
movement
to
cast
thyself
down
thou
wouldst
be
tempting
god
and
have
lost
all
thy
faith
in
him
and
wouldst
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
against
that
earth
which
thou
didst
come
to
save
and
the
wise
spirit
that
tempted
thee
would
have
rejoiced
but
i
ask
again
are
there
many
like
thee
and
couldst
thou
believe
for
one
moment
that
men
too
could
face
such
a
temptation
is
the
nature
of
men
such
that
they
can
reject
miracle
and
at
the
great
moments
of
their
life
the
moments
of
their
deepest
most
agonizing
spiritual
difficulties
cling
only
to
the
free
verdict
of
the
heart
oh
thou
didst
know
that
thy
deed
would
be
recorded
in
books
would
be
handed
down
to
remote
times
and
the
utmost
ends
of
the
earth
and
thou
didst
hope
that
man
following
thee
would
cling
to
god
and
not
ask
for
a
miracle
but
thou
didst
not
know
that
when
man
rejects
miracle
he
rejects
god
too
for
man
seeks
not
so
much
god
as
the
miraculous
and
as
man
cannot
bear
to
be
without
the
miraculous
he
will
create
new
miracles
of
his
own
for
himself
and
will
worship
deeds
of
sorcery
and
witchcraft
though
he
might
be
a
hundred
times
over
a
rebel
heretic
and
infidel
thou
didst
not
come
down
from
the
cross
when
they
shouted
to
thee
mocking
and
reviling
thee
come
down
from
the
cross
and
we
will
believe
that
thou
art
he
thou
didst
not
come
down
for
again
thou
wouldst
not
enslave
man
by
a
miracle
and
didst
crave
faith
given
freely
not
based
on
miracle
thou
didst
crave
for
free
love
and
not
the
base
raptures
of
the
slave
before
the
might
that
has
overawed
him
for
ever
but
thou
didst
think
too
highly
of
men
therein
for
they
are
slaves
of
course
though
rebellious
by
nature
look
round
and
judge
fifteen
centuries
have
passed
look
upon
them
whom
hast
thou
raised
up
to
thyself
i
swear
man
is
weaker
and
baser
by
nature
than
thou
hast
believed
him
can
he
can
he
do
what
thou
didst
by
showing
him
so
much
respect
thou
didst
as
it
were
cease
to
feel
for
him
for
thou
didst
ask
far
too
much
from
himthou
who
hast
loved
him
more
than
thyself
respecting
him
less
thou
wouldst
have
asked
less
of
him
that
would
have
been
more
like
love
for
his
burden
would
have
been
lighter
he
is
weak
and
vile
what
though
he
is
everywhere
now
rebelling
against
our
power
and
proud
of
his
rebellion
it
is
the
pride
of
a
child
and
a
schoolboy
they
are
little
children
rioting
and
barring
out
the
teacher
at
school
but
their
childish
delight
will
end
it
will
cost
them
dear
they
will
cast
down
temples
and
drench
the
earth
with
blood
but
they
will
see
at
last
the
foolish
children
that
though
they
are
rebels
they
are
impotent
rebels
unable
to
keep
up
their
own
rebellion
bathed
in
their
foolish
tears
they
will
recognize
at
last
that
he
who
created
them
rebels
must
have
meant
to
mock
at
them
they
will
say
this
in
despair
and
their
utterance
will
be
a
blasphemy
which
will
make
them
more
unhappy
still
for
mans
nature
cannot
bear
blasphemy
and
in
the
end
always
avenges
it
on
itself
and
so
unrest
confusion
and
unhappinessthat
is
the
present
lot
of
man
after
thou
didst
bear
so
much
for
their
freedom
the
great
prophet
tells
in
vision
and
in
image
that
he
saw
all
those
who
took
part
in
the
first
resurrection
and
that
there
were
of
each
tribe
twelve
thousand
but
if
there
were
so
many
of
them
they
must
have
been
not
men
but
gods
they
had
borne
thy
cross
they
had
endured
scores
of
years
in
the
barren
hungry
wilderness
living
upon
locusts
and
rootsand
thou
mayest
indeed
point
with
pride
at
those
children
of
freedom
of
free
love
of
free
and
splendid
sacrifice
for
thy
name
but
remember
that
they
were
only
some
thousands
and
what
of
the
rest
and
how
are
the
other
weak
ones
to
blame
because
they
could
not
endure
what
the
strong
have
endured
how
is
the
weak
soul
to
blame
that
it
is
unable
to
receive
such
terrible
gifts
canst
thou
have
simply
come
to
the
elect
and
for
the
elect
but
if
so
it
is
a
mystery
and
we
cannot
understand
it
and
if
it
is
a
mystery
we
too
have
a
right
to
preach
a
mystery
and
to
teach
them
that
its
not
the
free
judgment
of
their
hearts
not
love
that
matters
but
a
mystery
which
they
must
follow
blindly
even
against
their
conscience
so
we
have
done
we
have
corrected
thy
work
and
have
founded
it
upon
miracle
mystery
and
authority
and
men
rejoiced
that
they
were
again
led
like
sheep
and
that
the
terrible
gift
that
had
brought
them
such
suffering
was
at
last
lifted
from
their
hearts
were
we
right
teaching
them
this
speak
did
we
not
love
mankind
so
meekly
acknowledging
their
feebleness
lovingly
lightening
their
burden
and
permitting
their
weak
nature
even
sin
with
our
sanction
why
hast
thou
come
now
to
hinder
us
and
why
dost
thou
look
silently
and
searchingly
at
me
with
thy
mild
eyes
be
angry
i
dont
want
thy
love
for
i
love
thee
not
and
what
use
is
it
for
me
to
hide
anything
from
thee
dont
i
know
to
whom
i
am
speaking
all
that
i
can
say
is
known
to
thee
already
and
is
it
for
me
to
conceal
from
thee
our
mystery
perhaps
it
is
thy
will
to
hear
it
from
my
lips
listen
then
we
are
not
working
with
thee
but
with
himthat
is
our
mystery
its
longeight
centuriessince
we
have
been
on
his
side
and
not
on
thine
just
eight
centuries
ago
we
took
from
him
what
thou
didst
reject
with
scorn
that
last
gift
he
offered
thee
showing
thee
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
we
took
from
him
rome
and
the
sword
of
csar
and
proclaimed
ourselves
sole
rulers
of
the
earth
though
hitherto
we
have
not
been
able
to
complete
our
work
but
whose
fault
is
that
oh
the
work
is
only
beginning
but
it
has
begun
it
has
long
to
await
completion
and
the
earth
has
yet
much
to
suffer
but
we
shall
triumph
and
shall
be
csars
and
then
we
shall
plan
the
universal
happiness
of
man
but
thou
mightest
have
taken
even
then
the
sword
of
csar
why
didst
thou
reject
that
last
gift
hadst
thou
accepted
that
last
counsel
of
the
mighty
spirit
thou
wouldst
have
accomplished
all
that
man
seeks
on
earththat
is
some
one
to
worship
some
one
to
keep
his
conscience
and
some
means
of
uniting
all
in
one
unanimous
and
harmonious
antheap
for
the
craving
for
universal
unity
is
the
third
and
last
anguish
of
men
mankind
as
a
whole
has
always
striven
to
organize
a
universal
state
there
have
been
many
great
nations
with
great
histories
but
the
more
highly
they
were
developed
the
more
unhappy
they
were
for
they
felt
more
acutely
than
other
people
the
craving
for
worldwide
union
the
great
conquerors
timours
and
ghenghiskhans
whirled
like
hurricanes
over
the
face
of
the
earth
striving
to
subdue
its
people
and
they
too
were
but
the
unconscious
expression
of
the
same
craving
for
universal
unity
hadst
thou
taken
the
world
and
csars
purple
thou
wouldst
have
founded
the
universal
state
and
have
given
universal
peace
for
who
can
rule
men
if
not
he
who
holds
their
conscience
and
their
bread
in
his
hands
we
have
taken
the
sword
of
csar
and
in
taking
it
of
course
have
rejected
thee
and
followed
him
oh
ages
are
yet
to
come
of
the
confusion
of
free
thought
of
their
science
and
cannibalism
for
having
begun
to
build
their
tower
of
babel
without
us
they
will
end
of
course
with
cannibalism
but
then
the
beast
will
crawl
to
us
and
lick
our
feet
and
spatter
them
with
tears
of
blood
and
we
shall
sit
upon
the
beast
and
raise
the
cup
and
on
it
will
be
written
mystery
but
then
and
only
then
the
reign
of
peace
and
happiness
will
come
for
men
thou
art
proud
of
thine
elect
but
thou
hast
only
the
elect
while
we
give
rest
to
all
and
besides
how
many
of
those
elect
those
mighty
ones
who
could
become
elect
have
grown
weary
waiting
for
thee
and
have
transferred
and
will
transfer
the
powers
of
their
spirit
and
the
warmth
of
their
heart
to
the
other
camp
and
end
by
raising
their
free
banner
against
thee
thou
didst
thyself
lift
up
that
banner
but
with
us
all
will
be
happy
and
will
no
more
rebel
nor
destroy
one
another
as
under
thy
freedom
oh
we
shall
persuade
them
that
they
will
only
become
free
when
they
renounce
their
freedom
to
us
and
submit
to
us
and
shall
we
be
right
or
shall
we
be
lying
they
will
be
convinced
that
we
are
right
for
they
will
remember
the
horrors
of
slavery
and
confusion
to
which
thy
freedom
brought
them
freedom
free
thought
and
science
will
lead
them
into
such
straits
and
will
bring
them
face
to
face
with
such
marvels
and
insoluble
mysteries
that
some
of
them
the
fierce
and
rebellious
will
destroy
themselves
others
rebellious
but
weak
will
destroy
one
another
while
the
rest
weak
and
unhappy
will
crawl
fawning
to
our
feet
and
whine
to
us
yes
you
were
right
you
alone
possess
his
mystery
and
we
come
back
to
you
save
us
from
ourselves

receiving
bread
from
us
they
will
see
clearly
that
we
take
the
bread
made
by
their
hands
from
them
to
give
it
to
them
without
any
miracle
they
will
see
that
we
do
not
change
the
stones
to
bread
but
in
truth
they
will
be
more
thankful
for
taking
it
from
our
hands
than
for
the
bread
itself
for
they
will
remember
only
too
well
that
in
old
days
without
our
help
even
the
bread
they
made
turned
to
stones
in
their
hands
while
since
they
have
come
back
to
us
the
very
stones
have
turned
to
bread
in
their
hands
too
too
well
will
they
know
the
value
of
complete
submission
and
until
men
know
that
they
will
be
unhappy
who
is
most
to
blame
for
their
not
knowing
itspeak
who
scattered
the
flock
and
sent
it
astray
on
unknown
paths
but
the
flock
will
come
together
again
and
will
submit
once
more
and
then
it
will
be
once
for
all
then
we
shall
give
them
the
quiet
humble
happiness
of
weak
creatures
such
as
they
are
by
nature
oh
we
shall
persuade
them
at
last
not
to
be
proud
for
thou
didst
lift
them
up
and
thereby
taught
them
to
be
proud
we
shall
show
them
that
they
are
weak
that
they
are
only
pitiful
children
but
that
childlike
happiness
is
the
sweetest
of
all
they
will
become
timid
and
will
look
to
us
and
huddle
close
to
us
in
fear
as
chicks
to
the
hen
they
will
marvel
at
us
and
will
be
awestricken
before
us
and
will
be
proud
at
our
being
so
powerful
and
clever
that
we
have
been
able
to
subdue
such
a
turbulent
flock
of
thousands
of
millions
they
will
tremble
impotently
before
our
wrath
their
minds
will
grow
fearful
they
will
be
quick
to
shed
tears
like
women
and
children
but
they
will
be
just
as
ready
at
a
sign
from
us
to
pass
to
laughter
and
rejoicing
to
happy
mirth
and
childish
song
yes
we
shall
set
them
to
work
but
in
their
leisure
hours
we
shall
make
their
life
like
a
childs
game
with
childrens
songs
and
innocent
dance
oh
we
shall
allow
them
even
sin
they
are
weak
and
helpless
and
they
will
love
us
like
children
because
we
allow
them
to
sin
we
shall
tell
them
that
every
sin
will
be
expiated
if
it
is
done
with
our
permission
that
we
allow
them
to
sin
because
we
love
them
and
the
punishment
for
these
sins
we
take
upon
ourselves
and
we
shall
take
it
upon
ourselves
and
they
will
adore
us
as
their
saviors
who
have
taken
on
themselves
their
sins
before
god
and
they
will
have
no
secrets
from
us
we
shall
allow
or
forbid
them
to
live
with
their
wives
and
mistresses
to
have
or
not
to
have
childrenaccording
to
whether
they
have
been
obedient
or
disobedientand
they
will
submit
to
us
gladly
and
cheerfully
the
most
painful
secrets
of
their
conscience
all
all
they
will
bring
to
us
and
we
shall
have
an
answer
for
all
and
they
will
be
glad
to
believe
our
answer
for
it
will
save
them
from
the
great
anxiety
and
terrible
agony
they
endure
at
present
in
making
a
free
decision
for
themselves
and
all
will
be
happy
all
the
millions
of
creatures
except
the
hundred
thousand
who
rule
over
them
for
only
we
we
who
guard
the
mystery
shall
be
unhappy
there
will
be
thousands
of
millions
of
happy
babes
and
a
hundred
thousand
sufferers
who
have
taken
upon
themselves
the
curse
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
peacefully
they
will
die
peacefully
they
will
expire
in
thy
name
and
beyond
the
grave
they
will
find
nothing
but
death
but
we
shall
keep
the
secret
and
for
their
happiness
we
shall
allure
them
with
the
reward
of
heaven
and
eternity
though
if
there
were
anything
in
the
other
world
it
certainly
would
not
be
for
such
as
they
it
is
prophesied
that
thou
wilt
come
again
in
victory
thou
wilt
come
with
thy
chosen
the
proud
and
strong
but
we
will
say
that
they
have
only
saved
themselves
but
we
have
saved
all
we
are
told
that
the
harlot
who
sits
upon
the
beast
and
holds
in
her
hands
the
mystery
shall
be
put
to
shame
that
the
weak
will
rise
up
again
and
will
rend
her
royal
purple
and
will
strip
naked
her
loathsome
body
but
then
i
will
stand
up
and
point
out
to
thee
the
thousand
millions
of
happy
children
who
have
known
no
sin
and
we
who
have
taken
their
sins
upon
us
for
their
happiness
will
stand
up
before
thee
and
say
judge
us
if
thou
canst
and
darest
know
that
i
fear
thee
not
know
that
i
too
have
been
in
the
wilderness
i
too
have
lived
on
roots
and
locusts
i
too
prized
the
freedom
with
which
thou
hast
blessed
men
and
i
too
was
striving
to
stand
among
thy
elect
among
the
strong
and
powerful
thirsting
to
make
up
the
number
but
i
awakened
and
would
not
serve
madness
i
turned
back
and
joined
the
ranks
of
those
who
have
corrected
thy
work
i
left
the
proud
and
went
back
to
the
humble
for
the
happiness
of
the
humble
what
i
say
to
thee
will
come
to
pass
and
our
dominion
will
be
built
up
i
repeat
tomorrow
thou
shalt
see
that
obedient
flock
who
at
a
sign
from
me
will
hasten
to
heap
up
the
hot
cinders
about
the
pile
on
which
i
shall
burn
thee
for
coming
to
hinder
us
for
if
any
one
has
ever
deserved
our
fires
it
is
thou
tomorrow
i
shall
burn
thee

his

thats
absurd
he

your

not
in

you

who
will
believe
you
about

is
that
the
way
to
understand
it
thats
not
the
idea

it
in
the
orthodox

thats
rome
and
not
even
the
whole
of
rome
its
falsethose
are
the
worst
of
the
catholics
the
inquisitors
the
jesuits
and
there
could
not
be
such
a
fantastic
creature
as
your
inquisitor
what
are
these
sins
of
mankind
they
take
on
themselves
who
are
these
keepers
of
the
mystery
who
have
taken
some
curse
upon
themselves
for
the
happiness
of
mankind
when
have
they
been
seen
we
know
the
jesuits
they
are
spoken
ill
of
but
surely
they
are
not
what
you
describe
they
are
not
that
at
all
not
at
all
they
are
simply
the
romish
army
for
the
earthly
sovereignty
of
the
world
in
the
future
with
the
pontiff
of
rome
for
emperor

thats
their
ideal
but
theres
no
sort
of
mystery
or
lofty
melancholy
about
it
its
simple
lust
of
power
of
filthy
earthly
gain
of

like
a
universal
serfdom
with
them
as

all
they
stand
for
they
dont
even
believe
in

perhaps
your
suffering

is
a
mere
fantasy

ivan
how
hot
you
are
a
fantasy
you
say
let
it
be
so
of
course
its
a
fantasy
but
allow
me
to
say
do
you
really
think
that
the
roman
catholic
movement
of
the
last
centuries
is
actually
nothing
but
the
lust
of
power
of
filthy
earthly
gain
is
that
father
passys
teaching
no
no
on
the
contrary
father
passy
did
once
say
something
rather
the
same
as
you

but
of
course
its
not
the
same
not
a
bit
the
same
alyosha
hastily
corrected
himself
a
precious
admission
in
spite
of
your
not
a
bit
the
same
i
ask
you
why
your
jesuits
and
inquisitors
have
united
simply
for
vile
material
gain
why
can
there
not
be
among
them
one
martyr
oppressed
by
great
sorrow
and
loving
humanity
you
see
only
suppose
that
there
was
one
such
man
among
all
those
who
desire
nothing
but
filthy
material
gainif
theres
only
one
like
my
old
inquisitor
who
had
himself
eaten
roots
in
the
desert
and
made
frenzied
efforts
to
subdue
his
flesh
to
make
himself
free
and
perfect
but
yet
all
his
life
he
loved
humanity
and
suddenly
his
eyes
were
opened
and
he
saw
that
it
is
no
great
moral
blessedness
to
attain
perfection
and
freedom
if
at
the
same
time
one
gains
the
conviction
that
millions
of
gods
creatures
have
been
created
as
a
mockery
that
they
will
never
be
capable
of
using
their
freedom
that
these
poor
rebels
can
never
turn
into
giants
to
complete
the
tower
that
it
was
not
for
such
geese
that
the
great
idealist
dreamt
his
dream
of
harmony
seeing
all
that
he
turned
back
and
joinedthe
clever
people
surely
that
could
have
happened
joined
whom
what
clever
people
cried
alyosha
completely
carried
away
they
have
no
such
great
cleverness
and
no
mysteries
and
secrets
perhaps
nothing
but
atheism
thats
all
their
secret
your
inquisitor
does
not
believe
in
god
thats
his
secret
what
if
it
is
so
at
last
you
have
guessed
it
its
perfectly
true
its
true
that
thats
the
whole
secret
but
isnt
that
suffering
at
least
for
a
man
like
that
who
has
wasted
his
whole
life
in
the
desert
and
yet
could
not
shake
off
his
incurable
love
of
humanity
in
his
old
age
he
reached
the
clear
conviction
that
nothing
but
the
advice
of
the
great
dread
spirit
could
build
up
any
tolerable
sort
of
life
for
the
feeble
unruly
incomplete
empirical
creatures
created
in
jest
and
so
convinced
of
this
he
sees
that
he
must
follow
the
counsel
of
the
wise
spirit
the
dread
spirit
of
death
and
destruction
and
therefore
accept
lying
and
deception
and
lead
men
consciously
to
death
and
destruction
and
yet
deceive
them
all
the
way
so
that
they
may
not
notice
where
they
are
being
led
that
the
poor
blind
creatures
may
at
least
on
the
way
think
themselves
happy
and
note
the
deception
is
in
the
name
of
him
in
whose
ideal
the
old
man
had
so
fervently
believed
all
his
life
long
is
not
that
tragic
and
if
only
one
such
stood
at
the
head
of
the
whole
army
filled
with
the
lust
of
power
only
for
the
sake
of
filthy
gainwould
not
one
such
be
enough
to
make
a
tragedy
more
than
that
one
such
standing
at
the
head
is
enough
to
create
the
actual
leading
idea
of
the
roman
church
with
all
its
armies
and
jesuits
its
highest
idea
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
firmly
believe
that
there
has
always
been
such
a
man
among
those
who
stood
at
the
head
of
the
movement
who
knows
there
may
have
been
some
such
even
among
the
roman
popes
who
knows
perhaps
the
spirit
of
that
accursed
old
man
who
loves
mankind
so
obstinately
in
his
own
way
is
to
be
found
even
now
in
a
whole
multitude
of
such
old
men
existing
not
by
chance
but
by
agreement
as
a
secret
league
formed
long
ago
for
the
guarding
of
the
mystery
to
guard
it
from
the
weak
and
the
unhappy
so
as
to
make
them
happy
no
doubt
it
is
so
and
so
it
must
be
indeed
i
fancy
that
even
among
the
masons
theres
something
of
the
same
mystery
at
the
bottom
and
that
thats
why
the
catholics
so
detest
the
masons
as
their
rivals
breaking
up
the
unity
of
the
idea
while
it
is
so
essential
that
there
should
be
one
flock
and
one
shepherd
but
from
the
way
i
defend
my
idea
i
might
be
an
author
impatient
of
your
criticism
enough
of
it
you
are
perhaps
a
mason
yourself
broke
suddenly
from
alyosha
you
dont
believe
in
god
he
added
speaking
this
time
very
sorrowfully
he
fancied
besides
that
his
brother
was
looking
at
him
ironically
how
does
your
poem
end
he
asked
suddenly
looking
down
or
was
it
the
end
i
meant
to
end
it
like
this
when
the
inquisitor
ceased
speaking
he
waited
some
time
for
his
prisoner
to
answer
him
his
silence
weighed
down
upon
him
he
saw
that
the
prisoner
had
listened
intently
all
the
time
looking
gently
in
his
face
and
evidently
not
wishing
to
reply
the
old
man
longed
for
him
to
say
something
however
bitter
and
terrible
but
he
suddenly
approached
the
old
man
in
silence
and
softly
kissed
him
on
his
bloodless
aged
lips
that
was
all
his
answer
the
old
man
shuddered
his
lips
moved
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
said
to
him
go
and
come
no
more

come
not
at
all
never
never
and
he
let
him
out
into
the
dark
alleys
of
the
town
the
prisoner
went
away
and
the
old
man
the
kiss
glows
in
his
heart
but
the
old
man
adheres
to
his
idea
and
you
with
him
you
too
cried
alyosha
mournfully
ivan
laughed
why
its
all
nonsense
alyosha
its
only
a
senseless
poem
of
a
senseless
student
who
could
never
write
two
lines
of
verse
why
do
you
take
it
so
seriously
surely
you
dont
suppose
i
am
going
straight
off
to
the
jesuits
to
join
the
men
who
are
correcting
his
work
good
lord
its
no
business
of
mine
i
told
you
all
i
want
is
to
live
on
to
thirty
and
then

dash
the
cup
to
the
ground
but
the
little
sticky
leaves
and
the
precious
tombs
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
woman
you
love
how
will
you
live
how
will
you
love
them
alyosha
cried
sorrowfully
with
such
a
hell
in
your
heart
and
your
head
how
can
you
no
thats
just
what
you
are
going
away
for
to
join
them

if
not
you
will
kill
yourself
you
cant
endure
it
there
is
a
strength
to
endure
everything
ivan
said
with
a
cold
smile
what
strength
the
strength
of
the
karamazovsthe
strength
of
the
karamazov
baseness
to
sink
into
debauchery
to
stifle
your
soul
with
corruption
yes
possibly
even
that

only
perhaps
till
i
am
thirty
i
shall
escape
it
and
then
how
will
you
escape
it
by
what
will
you
escape
it
thats
impossible
with
your
ideas
in
the
karamazov
way
again

everything
is
lawful
you
mean
everything
is
lawful
is
that
it
ivan
scowled
and
all
at
once
turned
strangely
pale
ah
youve
caught
up
yesterdays
phrase
which
so
offended
misovand
which
dmitri
pounced
upon
so
navely
and
paraphrased
he
smiled
queerly
yes
if
you
like
everything
is
lawful
since
the
word
has
been
said
i
wont
deny
it
and
mityas
version
isnt
bad
alyosha
looked
at
him
in
silence
i
thought
that
going
away
from
here
i
have
you
at
least
ivan
said
suddenly
with
unexpected
feeling
but
now
i
see
that
there
is
no
place
for
me
even
in
your
heart
my
dear
hermit
the
formula
all
is
lawful
i
wont
renouncewill
you
renounce
me
for
that
yes
alyosha
got
up
went
to
him
and
softly
kissed
him
on
the
lips
thats
plagiarism
cried
ivan
highly
delighted
you
stole
that
from
my
poem
thank
you
though
get
up
alyosha
its
time
we
were
going
both
of
us
they
went
out
but
stopped
when
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
restaurant
listen
alyosha
ivan
began
in
a
resolute
voice
if
i
am
really
able
to
care
for
the
sticky
little
leaves
i
shall
only
love
them
remembering
you
its
enough
for
me
that
you
are
somewhere
here
and
i
shant
lose
my
desire
for
life
yet
is
that
enough
for
you
take
it
as
a
declaration
of
love
if
you
like
and
now
you
go
to
the
right
and
i
to
the
left
and
its
enough
do
you
hear
enough
i
mean
even
if
i
dont
go
away
tomorrow
i
think
i
certainly
shall
go
and
we
meet
again
dont
say
a
word
more
on
these
subjects
i
beg
that
particularly
and
about
dmitri
too
i
ask
you
specially
never
speak
to
me
again
he
added
with
sudden
irritation
its
all
exhausted
it
has
all
been
said
over
and
over
again
hasnt
it
and
ill
make
you
one
promise
in
return
for
it
when
at
thirty
i
want
to
dash
the
cup
to
the
ground
wherever
i
may
be
ill
come
to
have
one
more
talk
with
you
even
though
it
were
from
america
you
may
be
sure
of
that
ill
come
on
purpose
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
have
a
look
at
you
to
see
what
youll
be
by
that
time
its
rather
a
solemn
promise
you
see
and
we
really
may
be
parting
for
seven
years
or
ten
come
go
now
to
your
pater
seraphicus
he
is
dying
if
he
dies
without
you

will
be
angry
with
me
for
having
kept
you
goodby
kiss
me
once
more
thats
right
now
go
ivan
turned
suddenly
and
went
his
way
without
looking
back
it
was
just
as
dmitri
had
left
alyosha
the
day
before
though
the
parting
had
been
very
different
the
strange
resemblance
flashed
like
an
arrow
through
alyoshas
mind
in
the
distress
and
dejection
of
that
moment
he
waited
a
little
looking
after
his
brother
he
suddenly
noticed
that
ivan
swayed
as
he
walked
and
that
his
right
shoulder
looked
lower
than
his
left
he
had
never
noticed
it
before
but
all
at
once
he
turned
too
and
almost
ran
to
the
monastery
it
was
nearly
dark
and
he
felt
almost
frightened
something
new
was
growing
up
in
him
for
which
he
could
not
account
the
wind
had
risen
again
as
on
the
previous
evening
and
the
ancient
pines
murmured
gloomily
about
him
when
he
entered
the
hermitage
copse
he
almost
ran
pater
seraphicushe
got
that
name
from
somewherewhere
from
alyosha
wondered
ivan
poor
ivan
and
when
shall
i
see
you
again
here
is
the
hermitage
yes
yes
that
he
is
pater
seraphicus
he
will
save
mefrom
him
and
for
ever
several
times
afterwards
he
wondered
how
he
could
on
leaving
ivan
so
completely
forget
his
brother
dmitri
though
he
had
that
morning
only
a
few
hours
before
so
firmly
resolved
to
find
him
and
not
to
give
up
doing
so
even
should
he
be
unable
to
return
to
the
monastery
that
night
chapter
vi
for
awhile
a
very
obscure
one
and
ivan
on
parting
from
alyosha
went
home
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
house
but
strange
to
say
he
was
overcome
by
insufferable
depression
which
grew
greater
at
every
step
he
took
towards
the
house
there
was
nothing
strange
in
his
being
depressed
what
was
strange
was
that
ivan
could
not
have
said
what
was
the
cause
of
it
he
had
often
been
depressed
before
and
there
was
nothing
surprising
at
his
feeling
so
at
such
a
moment
when
he
had
broken
off
with
everything
that
had
brought
him
here
and
was
preparing
that
day
to
make
a
new
start
and
enter
upon
a
new
unknown
future
he
would
again
be
as
solitary
as
ever
and
though
he
had
great
hopes
and
greattoo
greatexpectations
from
life
he
could
not
have
given
any
definite
account
of
his
hopes
his
expectations
or
even
his
desires
yet
at
that
moment
though
the
apprehension
of
the
new
and
unknown
certainly
found
place
in
his
heart
what
was
worrying
him
was
something
quite
different
is
it
loathing
for
my
fathers
house
he
wondered
quite
likely
i
am
so
sick
of
it
and
though
its
the
last
time
i
shall
cross
its
hateful
threshold
still
i
loathe
it
no
its
not
that
either
is
it
the
parting
with
alyosha
and
the
conversation
i
had
with
him
for
so
many
years
ive
been
silent
with
the
whole
world
and
not
deigned
to
speak
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
reel
off
a
rigmarole
like
that
it
certainly
might
have
been
the
youthful
vexation
of
youthful
inexperience
and
vanityvexation
at
having
failed
to
express
himself
especially
with
such
a
being
as
alyosha
on
whom
his
heart
had
certainly
been
reckoning
no
doubt
that
came
in
that
vexation
it
must
have
done
indeed
but
yet
that
was
not
it
that
was
not
it
either
i
feel
sick
with
depression
and
yet
i
cant
tell
what
i
want
better
not
think
perhaps
ivan
tried
not
to
think
but
that
too
was
no
use
what
made
his
depression
so
vexatious
and
irritating
was
that
it
had
a
kind
of
casual
external
characterhe
felt
that
some
person
or
thing
seemed
to
be
standing
out
somewhere
just
as
something
will
sometimes
obtrude
itself
upon
the
eye
and
though
one
may
be
so
busy
with
work
or
conversation
that
for
a
long
time
one
does
not
notice
it
yet
it
irritates
and
almost
torments
one
till
at
last
one
realizes
and
removes
the
offending
object
often
quite
a
trifling
and
ridiculous
onesome
article
left
about
in
the
wrong
place
a
handkerchief
on
the
floor
a
book
not
replaced
on
the
shelf
and
so
on
at
last
feeling
very
cross
and
illhumored
ivan
arrived
home
and
suddenly
about
fifteen
paces
from
the
garden
gate
he
guessed
what
was
fretting
and
worrying
him
on
a
bench
in
the
gateway
the
valet
smerdyakov
was
sitting
enjoying
the
coolness
of
the
evening
and
at
the
first
glance
at
him
ivan
knew
that
the
valet
smerdyakov
was
on
his
mind
and
that
it
was
this
man
that
his
soul
loathed
it
all
dawned
upon
him
suddenly
and
became
clear
just
before
when
alyosha
had
been
telling
him
of
his
meeting
with
smerdyakov
he
had
felt
a
sudden
twinge
of
gloom
and
loathing
which
had
immediately
stirred
responsive
anger
in
his
heart
afterwards
as
he
talked
smerdyakov
had
been
forgotten
for
the
time
but
still
he
had
been
in
his
mind
and
as
soon
as
ivan
parted
with
alyosha
and
was
walking
home
the
forgotten
sensation
began
to
obtrude
itself
again
is
it
possible
that
a
miserable
contemptible
creature
like
that
can
worry
me
so
much
he
wondered
with
insufferable
irritation
it
was
true
that
ivan
had
come
of
late
to
feel
an
intense
dislike
for
the
man
especially
during
the
last
few
days
he
had
even
begun
to
notice
in
himself
a
growing
feeling
that
was
almost
of
hatred
for
the
creature
perhaps
this
hatred
was
accentuated
by
the
fact
that
when
ivan
first
came
to
the
neighborhood
he
had
felt
quite
differently
then
he
had
taken
a
marked
interest
in
smerdyakov
and
had
even
thought
him
very
original
he
had
encouraged
him
to
talk
to
him
although
he
had
always
wondered
at
a
certain
incoherence
or
rather
restlessness
in
his
mind
and
could
not
understand
what
it
was
that
so
continually
and
insistently
worked
upon
the
brain
of
the
contemplative
they
discussed
philosophical
questions
and
even
how
there
could
have
been
light
on
the
first
day
when
the
sun
moon
and
stars
were
only
created
on
the
fourth
day
and
how
that
was
to
be
understood
but
ivan
soon
saw
that
though
the
sun
moon
and
stars
might
be
an
interesting
subject
yet
that
it
was
quite
secondary
to
smerdyakov
and
that
he
was
looking
for
something
altogether
different
in
one
way
and
another
he
began
to
betray
a
boundless
vanity
and
a
wounded
vanity
too
and
that
ivan
disliked
it
had
first
given
rise
to
his
aversion
later
on
there
had
been
trouble
in
the
house
grushenka
had
come
on
the
scene
and
there
had
been
the
scandals
with
his
brother
dmitrithey
discussed
that
too
but
though
smerdyakov
always
talked
of
that
with
great
excitement
it
was
impossible
to
discover
what
he
desired
to
come
of
it
there
was
in
fact
something
surprising
in
the
illogicality
and
incoherence
of
some
of
his
desires
accidentally
betrayed
and
always
vaguely
expressed
smerdyakov
was
always
inquiring
putting
certain
indirect
but
obviously
premeditated
questions
but
what
his
object
was
he
did
not
explain
and
usually
at
the
most
important
moment
he
would
break
off
and
relapse
into
silence
or
pass
to
another
subject
but
what
finally
irritated
ivan
most
and
confirmed
his
dislike
for
him
was
the
peculiar
revolting
familiarity
which
smerdyakov
began
to
show
more
and
more
markedly
not
that
he
forgot
himself
and
was
rude
on
the
contrary
he
always
spoke
very
respectfully
yet
he
had
obviously
begun
to
considergoodness
knows
whythat
there
was
some
sort
of
understanding
between
him
and
ivan
fyodorovitch
he
always
spoke
in
a
tone
that
suggested
that
those
two
had
some
kind
of
compact
some
secret
between
them
that
had
at
some
time
been
expressed
on
both
sides
only
known
to
them
and
beyond
the
comprehension
of
those
around
them
but
for
a
long
while
ivan
did
not
recognize
the
real
cause
of
his
growing
dislike
and
he
had
only
lately
realized
what
was
at
the
root
of
it
with
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
irritation
he
tried
to
pass
in
at
the
gate
without
speaking
or
looking
at
smerdyakov
but
smerdyakov
rose
from
the
bench
and
from
that
action
alone
ivan
knew
instantly
that
he
wanted
particularly
to
talk
to
him
ivan
looked
at
him
and
stopped
and
the
fact
that
he
did
stop
instead
of
passing
by
as
he
meant
to
the
minute
before
drove
him
to
fury
with
anger
and
repulsion
he
looked
at
smerdyakovs
emasculate
sickly
face
with
the
little
curls
combed
forward
on
his
forehead
his
left
eye
winked
and
he
grinned
as
if
to
say
where
are
you
going
you
wont
pass
by
you
see
that
we
two
clever
people
have
something
to
say
to
each
other
ivan
shook
get
away
miserable
idiot
what
have
i
to
do
with
you
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
but
to
his
profound
astonishment
he
heard
himself
say
is
my
father
still
asleep
or
has
he
waked
he
asked
the
question
softly
and
meekly
to
his
own
surprise
and
at
once
again
to
his
own
surprise
sat
down
on
the
bench
for
an
instant
he
felt
almost
frightened
he
remembered
it
afterwards
smerdyakov
stood
facing
him
his
hands
behind
his
back
looking
at
him
with
assurance
and
almost
severity
his
honor
is
still
asleep
he
articulated
deliberately
you
were
the
first
to
speak
not
i
he
seemed
to
say
i
am
surprised
at
you
sir
he
added
after
a
pause
dropping
his
eyes
affectedly
setting
his
right
foot
forward
and
playing
with
the
tip
of
his
polished
boot
why
are
you
surprised
at
me
ivan
asked
abruptly
and
sullenly
doing
his
utmost
to
restrain
himself
and
suddenly
realizing
with
disgust
that
he
was
feeling
intense
curiosity
and
would
not
on
any
account
have
gone
away
without
satisfying
it
why
dont
you
go
to
tchermashnya
sir
smerdyakov
suddenly
raised
his
eyes
and
smiled
familiarly
why
i
smile
you
must
understand
of
yourself
if
you
are
a
clever
man
his
screwedup
left
eye
seemed
to
say
why
should
i
go
to
tchermashnya
ivan
asked
in
surprise
smerdyakov
was
silent
again
fyodor
pavlovitch
himself
has
so
begged
you
to
he
said
at
last
slowly
and
apparently
attaching
no
significance
to
his
answer
i
put
you
off
with
a
secondary
reason
he
seemed
to
suggest
simply
to
say
something
damn
you
speak
out
what
you
want
ivan
cried
angrily
at
last
passing
from
meekness
to
violence
smerdyakov
drew
his
right
foot
up
to
his
left
pulled
himself
up
but
still
looked
at
him
with
the
same
serenity
and
the
same
little
smile
substantially
nothingbut
just
by
way
of
conversation
another
silence
followed
they
did
not
speak
for
nearly
a
minute
ivan
knew
that
he
ought
to
get
up
and
show
anger
and
smerdyakov
stood
before
him
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
as
though
to
see
whether
he
would
be
angry
or
not
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
ivan
at
last
he
moved
to
get
up
smerdyakov
seemed
to
seize
the
moment
im
in
an
awful
position
ivan
fyodorovitch
i
dont
know
how
to
help
myself
he
said
resolutely
and
distinctly
and
at
his
last
word
he
sighed
ivan
fyodorovitch
sat
down
again
they
are
both
utterly
crazy
they
are
no
better
than
little
children
smerdyakov
went
on
i
am
speaking
of
your
parent
and
your
brother
dmitri
fyodorovitch
here
fyodor
pavlovitch
will
get
up
directly
and
begin
worrying
me
every
minute
has
she
come
why
hasnt
she
come
and
so
on
up
till
midnight
and
even
after
midnight
and
if
agrafena
alexandrovna
doesnt
come
for
very
likely
she
does
not
mean
to
come
at
all
then
he
will
be
at
me
again
tomorrow
morning
why
hasnt
she
come
when
will
she
comeas
though
i
were
to
blame
for
it
on
the
other
side
its
no
better
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
or
even
before
your
brother
will
appear
with
his
gun
in
his
hands
look
out
you
rogue
you
soupmaker
if
you
miss
her
and
dont
let
me
know
shes
beenill
kill
you
before
any
one
when
the
nights
over
in
the
morning
he
too
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
begins
worrying
me
to
death
why
hasnt
she
come
will
she
come
soon
and
he
too
thinks
me
to
blame
because
his
lady
hasnt
come
and
every
day
and
every
hour
they
get
angrier
and
angrier
so
that
i
sometimes
think
i
shall
kill
myself
in
a
fright
i
cant
depend
upon
them
sir
and
why
have
you
meddled
why
did
you
begin
to
spy
for
dmitri
fyodorovitch
said
ivan
irritably
how
could
i
help
meddling
though
indeed
i
havent
meddled
at
all
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
i
kept
quiet
from
the
very
beginning
not
daring
to
answer
but
he
pitched
on
me
to
be
his
servant
he
has
had
only
one
thing
to
say
since
ill
kill
you
you
scoundrel
if
you
miss
her
i
feel
certain
sir
that
i
shall
have
a
long
fit
to
morrow
what
do
you
mean
by
a
long
fit
a
long
fit
lasting
a
long
timeseveral
hours
or
perhaps
a
day
or
two
once
it
went
on
for
three
days
i
fell
from
the
garret
that
time
the
struggling
ceased
and
then
began
again
and
for
three
days
i
couldnt
come
back
to
my
senses
fyodor
pavlovitch
sent
for
herzenstube
the
doctor
here
and
he
put
ice
on
my
head
and
tried
another
remedy
too
i
might
have
died
but
they
say
one
cant
tell
with
epilepsy
when
a
fit
is
coming
what
makes
you
say
you
will
have
one
tomorrow
ivan
inquired
with
a
peculiar
irritable
curiosity
thats
just
so
you
cant
tell
beforehand
besides
you
fell
from
the
garret
then
i
climb
up
to
the
garret
every
day
i
might
fall
from
the
garret
again
tomorrow
and
if
not
i
might
fall
down
the
cellar
steps
i
have
to
go
into
the
cellar
every
day
too
ivan
took
a
long
look
at
him
you
are
talking
nonsense
i
see
and
i
dont
quite
understand
you
he
said
softly
but
with
a
sort
of
menace
do
you
mean
to
pretend
to
be
ill
tomorrow
for
three
days
eh
smerdyakov
who
was
looking
at
the
ground
again
and
playing
with
the
toe
of
his
right
foot
set
the
foot
down
moved
the
left
one
forward
and
grinning
articulated
if
i
were
able
to
play
such
a
trick
that
is
pretend
to
have
a
fitand
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
a
man
accustomed
to
themi
should
have
a
perfect
right
to
use
such
a
means
to
save
myself
from
death
for
even
if
agrafena
alexandrovna
comes
to
see
his
father
while
i
am
ill
his
honor
cant
blame
a
sick
man
for
not
telling
him
hed
be
ashamed
to
hang
it
all
ivan
cried
his
face
working
with
anger
why
are
you
always
in
such
a
funk
for
your
life
all
my
brother
dmitris
threats
are
only
hasty
words
and
mean
nothing
he
wont
kill
you
its
not
you
hell
kill
hed
kill
me
first
of
all
like
a
fly
but
even
more
than
that
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
taken
for
an
accomplice
of
his
when
he
does
something
crazy
to
his
father
why
should
you
be
taken
for
an
accomplice
theyll
think
i
am
an
accomplice
because
i
let
him
know
the
signals
as
a
great
secret
what
signals
whom
did
you
tell
confound
you
speak
more
plainly
im
bound
to
admit
the
fact
smerdyakov
drawled
with
pedantic
composure
that
i
have
a
secret
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
this
business
as
you
know
yourself
if
only
you
do
know
it
he
has
for
several
days
past
locked
himself
in
as
soon
as
night
or
even
evening
comes
on
of
late
youve
been
going
upstairs
to
your
room
early
every
evening
and
yesterday
you
did
not
come
down
at
all
and
so
perhaps
you
dont
know
how
carefully
he
has
begun
to
lock
himself
in
at
night
and
even
if
grigory
vassilyevitch
comes
to
the
door
he
wont
open
to
him
till
he
hears
his
voice
but
grigory
vassilyevitch
does
not
come
because
i
wait
upon
him
alone
in
his
room
now
thats
the
arrangement
he
made
himself
ever
since
this
todo
with
agrafena
alexandrovna
began
but
at
night
by
his
orders
i
go
away
to
the
lodge
so
that
i
dont
get
to
sleep
till
midnight
but
am
on
the
watch
getting
up
and
walking
about
the
yard
waiting
for
agrafena
alexandrovna
to
come
for
the
last
few
days
hes
been
perfectly
frantic
expecting
her
what
he
argues
is
she
is
afraid
of
him
dmitri
fyodorovitch
mitya
as
he
calls
him
and
so
says
he
shell
come
the
backway
late
at
night
to
me
you
look
out
for
her
says
he
till
midnight
and
later
and
if
she
does
come
you
run
up
and
knock
at
my
door
or
at
the
window
from
the
garden
knock
at
first
twice
rather
gently
and
then
three
times
more
quickly
then
says
he
i
shall
understand
at
once
that
she
has
come
and
will
open
the
door
to
you
quietly
another
signal
he
gave
me
in
case
anything
unexpected
happens
at
first
two
knocks
and
then
after
an
interval
another
much
louder
then
he
will
understand
that
something
has
happened
suddenly
and
that
i
must
see
him
and
he
will
open
to
me
so
that
i
can
go
and
speak
to
him
thats
all
in
case
agrafena
alexandrovna
cant
come
herself
but
sends
a
message
besides
dmitri
fyodorovitch
might
come
too
so
i
must
let
him
know
he
is
near
his
honor
is
awfully
afraid
of
dmitri
fyodorovitch
so
that
even
if
agrafena
alexandrovna
had
come
and
were
locked
in
with
him
and
dmitri
fyodorovitch
were
to
turn
up
anywhere
near
at
the
time
i
should
be
bound
to
let
him
know
at
once
knocking
three
times
so
that
the
first
signal
of
five
knocks
means
agrafena
alexandrovna
has
come
while
the
second
signal
of
three
knocks
means
something
important
to
tell
you
his
honor
has
shown
me
them
several
times
and
explained
them
and
as
in
the
whole
universe
no
one
knows
of
these
signals
but
myself
and
his
honor
so
hed
open
the
door
without
the
slightest
hesitation
and
without
calling
out
he
is
awfully
afraid
of
calling
out
aloud
well
those
signals
are
known
to
dmitri
fyodorovitch
too
now
how
are
they
known
did
you
tell
him
how
dared
you
tell
him
it
was
through
fright
i
did
it
how
could
i
dare
to
keep
it
back
from
him
dmitri
fyodorovitch
kept
persisting
every
day
you
are
deceiving
me
you
are
hiding
something
from
me
ill
break
both
your
legs
for
you
so
i
told
him
those
secret
signals
that
he
might
see
my
slavish
devotion
and
might
be
satisfied
that
i
was
not
deceiving
him
but
was
telling
him
all
i
could
if
you
think
that
hell
make
use
of
those
signals
and
try
to
get
in
dont
let
him
in
but
if
i
should
be
laid
up
with
a
fit
how
can
i
prevent
him
coming
in
then
even
if
i
dared
prevent
him
knowing
how
desperate
he
is
hang
it
how
can
you
be
so
sure
you
are
going
to
have
a
fit
confound
you
are
you
laughing
at
me
how
could
i
dare
laugh
at
you
i
am
in
no
laughing
humor
with
this
fear
on
me
i
feel
i
am
going
to
have
a
fit
i
have
a
presentiment
fright
alone
will
bring
it
on
confound
it
if
you
are
laid
up
grigory
will
be
on
the
watch
let
grigory
know
beforehand
he
will
be
sure
not
to
let
him
in
i
should
never
dare
to
tell
grigory
vassilyevitch
about
the
signals
without
orders
from
my
master
and
as
for
grigory
vassilyevitch
hearing
him
and
not
admitting
him
he
has
been
ill
ever
since
yesterday
and
marfa
ignatyevna
intends
to
give
him
medicine
tomorrow
theyve
just
arranged
it
its
a
very
strange
remedy
of
hers
marfa
ignatyevna
knows
of
a
preparation
and
always
keeps
it
its
a
strong
thing
made
from
some
herb
she
has
the
secret
of
it
and
she
always
gives
it
to
grigory
vassilyevitch
three
times
a
year
when
his
lumbagos
so
bad
he
is
almost
paralyzed
by
it
then
she
takes
a
towel
wets
it
with
the
stuff
and
rubs
his
whole
back
for
half
an
hour
till
its
quite
red
and
swollen
and
whats
left
in
the
bottle
she
gives
him
to
drink
with
a
special
prayer
but
not
quite
all
for
on
such
occasions
she
leaves
some
for
herself
and
drinks
it
herself
and
as
they
never
take
strong
drink
i
assure
you
they
both
drop
asleep
at
once
and
sleep
sound
a
very
long
time
and
when
grigory
vassilyevitch
wakes
up
he
is
perfectly
well
after
it
but
marfa
ignatyevna
always
has
a
headache
from
it
so
if
marfa
ignatyevna
carries
out
her
intention
to
morrow
they
wont
hear
anything
and
hinder
dmitri
fyodorovitch
theyll
be
asleep
what
a
rigmarole
and
it
all
seems
to
happen
at
once
as
though
it
were
planned
youll
have
a
fit
and
theyll
both
be
unconscious
cried
ivan
but
arent
you
trying
to
arrange
it
so
broke
from
him
suddenly
and
he
frowned
threateningly
how
could
i
and
why
should
i
when
it
all
depends
on
dmitri
fyodorovitch
and
his
plans
if
he
means
to
do
anything
hell
do
it
but
if
not
i
shant
be
thrusting
him
upon
his
father
and
why
should
he
go
to
father
especially
on
the
sly
if
as
you
say
yourself
agrafena
alexandrovna
wont
come
at
all
ivan
went
on
turning
white
with
anger
you
say
that
yourself
and
all
the
while
ive
been
here
ive
felt
sure
it
was
all
the
old
mans
fancy
and
the
creature
wont
come
to
him
why
should
dmitri
break
in
on
him
if
she
doesnt
come
speak
i
want
to
know
what
you
are
thinking
you
know
yourself
why
hell
come
whats
the
use
of
what
i
think
his
honor
will
come
simply
because
he
is
in
a
rage
or
suspicious
on
account
of
my
illness
perhaps
and
hell
dash
in
as
he
did
yesterday
through
impatience
to
search
the
rooms
to
see
whether
she
hasnt
escaped
him
on
the
sly
he
is
perfectly
well
aware
too
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
has
a
big
envelope
with
three
thousand
roubles
in
it
tied
up
with
ribbon
and
sealed
with
three
seals
on
it
is
written
in
his
own
hand
to
my
angel
grushenka
if
she
will
come
to
which
he
added
three
days
later
for
my
little
chicken
theres
no
knowing
what
that
might
do
nonsense
cried
ivan
almost
beside
himself
dmitri
wont
come
to
steal
money
and
kill
my
father
to
do
it
he
might
have
killed
him
yesterday
on
account
of
grushenka
like
the
frantic
savage
fool
he
is
but
he
wont
steal
he
is
in
very
great
need
of
money
nowthe
greatest
need
ivan
fyodorovitch
you
dont
know
in
what
need
he
is
smerdyakov
explained
with
perfect
composure
and
remarkable
distinctness
he
looks
on
that
three
thousand
as
his
own
too
he
said
so
to
me
himself
my
father
still
owes
me
just
three
thousand
he
said
and
besides
that
consider
ivan
fyodorovitch
there
is
something
else
perfectly
true
its
as
good
as
certain
so
to
say
that
agrafena
alexandrovna
will
force
him
if
only
she
cares
to
to
marry
herthe
master
himself
i
mean
fyodor
pavlovitchif
only
she
cares
to
and
of
course
she
may
care
to
all
ive
said
is
that
she
wont
come
but
maybe
shes
looking
for
more
than
thati
mean
to
be
mistress
here
i
know
myself
that
samsonov
her
merchant
was
laughing
with
her
about
it
telling
her
quite
openly
that
it
would
not
be
at
all
a
stupid
thing
to
do
and
shes
got
plenty
of
sense
she
wouldnt
marry
a
beggar
like
dmitri
fyodorovitch
so
taking
that
into
consideration
ivan
fyodorovitch
reflect
that
then
neither
dmitri
fyodorovitch
nor
yourself
and
your
brother
alexey
fyodorovitch
would
have
anything
after
the
masters
death
not
a
rouble
for
agrafena
alexandrovna
would
marry
him
simply
to
get
hold
of
the
whole
all
the
money
there
is
but
if
your
father
were
to
die
now
thered
be
some
forty
thousand
for
sure
even
for
dmitri
fyodorovitch
whom
he
hates
so
for
hes
made
no
will
dmitri
fyodorovitch
knows
all
that
very
well
a
sort
of
shudder
passed
over
ivans
face
he
suddenly
flushed
then
why
on
earth
he
suddenly
interrupted
smerdyakov
do
you
advise
me
to
go
to
tchermashnya
what
did
you
mean
by
that
if
i
go
away
you
see
what
will
happen
here
ivan
drew
his
breath
with
difficulty
precisely
so
said
smerdyakov
softly
and
reasonably
watching
ivan
intently
however
what
do
you
mean
by
precisely
so
ivan
questioned
him
with
a
menacing
light
in
his
eyes
restraining
himself
with
difficulty
i
spoke
because
i
felt
sorry
for
you
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
simply
throw
it
all
up

rather
than
stay
on
in
such
a
position
answered
smerdyakov
with
the
most
candid
air
looking
at
ivans
flashing
eyes
they
were
both
silent
you
seem
to
be
a
perfect
idiot
and
whats
more

an
awful
scoundrel
too
ivan
rose
suddenly
from
the
bench
he
was
about
to
pass
straight
through
the
gate
but
he
stopped
short
and
turned
to
smerdyakov
something
strange
followed
ivan
in
a
sudden
paroxysm
bit
his
lip
clenched
his
fists
and
in
another
minute
would
have
flung
himself
on
smerdyakov
the
latter
anyway
noticed
it
at
the
same
moment
started
and
shrank
back
but
the
moment
passed
without
mischief
to
smerdyakov
and
ivan
turned
in
silence
as
it
seemed
in
perplexity
to
the
gate
i
am
going
away
to
moscow
tomorrow
if
you
care
to
knowearly
tomorrow
morning
thats
all
he
suddenly
said
aloud
angrily
and
wondered
himself
afterwards
what
need
there
was
to
say
this
then
to
smerdyakov
thats
the
best
thing
you
can
do
he
responded
as
though
he
had
expected
to
hear
it
except
that
you
can
always
be
telegraphed
for
from
moscow
if
anything
should
happen
here
ivan
stopped
again
and
again
turned
quickly
to
smerdyakov
but
a
change
had
passed
over
him
too
all
his
familiarity
and
carelessness
had
completely
disappeared
his
face
expressed
attention
and
expectation
intent
but
timid
and
cringing
havent
you
something
more
to
saysomething
to
add
could
be
read
in
the
intent
gaze
he
fixed
on
ivan
and
couldnt
i
be
sent
for
from
tchermashnya
tooin
case
anything
happened
ivan
shouted
suddenly
for
some
unknown
reason
raising
his
voice
from
tchermashnya
too

you
could
be
sent
for
smerdyakov
muttered
almost
in
a
whisper
looking
disconcerted
but
gazing
intently
into
ivans
eyes
only
moscow
is
farther
and
tchermashnya
is
nearer
is
it
to
save
my
spending
money
on
the
fare
or
to
save
my
going
so
far
out
of
my
way
that
you
insist
on
tchermashnya
precisely
so

muttered
smerdyakov
with
a
breaking
voice
he
looked
at
ivan
with
a
revolting
smile
and
again
made
ready
to
draw
back
but
to
his
astonishment
ivan
broke
into
a
laugh
and
went
through
the
gate
still
laughing
any
one
who
had
seen
his
face
at
that
moment
would
have
known
that
he
was
not
laughing
from
lightness
of
heart
and
he
could
not
have
explained
himself
what
he
was
feeling
at
that
instant
he
moved
and
walked
as
though
in
a
nervous
frenzy
chapter
vii
its
always
worth
while
speaking
to
a
clever
man
and
in
the
same
nervous
frenzy
too
he
spoke
meeting
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
the
drawingroom
directly
he
went
in
he
shouted
to
him
waving
his
hands
i
am
going
upstairs
to
my
room
not
in
to
you
goodby
and
passed
by
trying
not
even
to
look
at
his
father
very
possibly
the
old
man
was
too
hateful
to
him
at
that
moment
but
such
an
unceremonious
display
of
hostility
was
a
surprise
even
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
the
old
man
evidently
wanted
to
tell
him
something
at
once
and
had
come
to
meet
him
in
the
drawingroom
on
purpose
receiving
this
amiable
greeting
he
stood
still
in
silence
and
with
an
ironical
air
watched
his
son
going
upstairs
till
he
passed
out
of
sight
whats
the
matter
with
him
he
promptly
asked
smerdyakov
who
had
followed
ivan
angry
about
something
who
can
tell
the
valet
muttered
evasively
confound
him
let
him
be
angry
then
bring
in
the
samovar
and
get
along
with
you
look
sharp
no
news
then
followed
a
series
of
questions
such
as
smerdyakov
had
just
complained
of
to
ivan
all
relating
to
his
expected
visitor
and
these
questions
we
will
omit
half
an
hour
later
the
house
was
locked
and
the
crazy
old
man
was
wandering
along
through
the
rooms
in
excited
expectation
of
hearing
every
minute
the
five
knocks
agreed
upon
now
and
then
he
peered
out
into
the
darkness
seeing
nothing
it
was
very
late
but
ivan
was
still
awake
and
reflecting
he
sat
up
late
that
night
till
two
oclock
but
we
will
not
give
an
account
of
his
thoughts
and
this
is
not
the
place
to
look
into
that
soulits
turn
will
come
and
even
if
one
tried
it
would
be
very
hard
to
give
an
account
of
them
for
there
were
no
thoughts
in
his
brain
but
something
very
vague
and
above
all
intense
excitement
he
felt
himself
that
he
had
lost
his
bearings
he
was
fretted
too
by
all
sorts
of
strange
and
almost
surprising
desires
for
instance
after
midnight
he
suddenly
had
an
intense
irresistible
inclination
to
go
down
open
the
door
go
to
the
lodge
and
beat
smerdyakov
but
if
he
had
been
asked
why
he
could
not
have
given
any
exact
reason
except
perhaps
that
he
loathed
the
valet
as
one
who
had
insulted
him
more
gravely
than
any
one
in
the
world
on
the
other
hand
he
was
more
than
once
that
night
overcome
by
a
sort
of
inexplicable
humiliating
terror
which
he
felt
positively
paralyzed
his
physical
powers
his
head
ached
and
he
was
giddy
a
feeling
of
hatred
was
rankling
in
his
heart
as
though
he
meant
to
avenge
himself
on
some
one
he
even
hated
alyosha
recalling
the
conversation
he
had
just
had
with
him
at
moments
he
hated
himself
intensely
of
katerina
ivanovna
he
almost
forgot
to
think
and
wondered
greatly
at
this
afterwards
especially
as
he
remembered
perfectly
that
when
he
had
protested
so
valiantly
to
katerina
ivanovna
that
he
would
go
away
next
day
to
moscow
something
had
whispered
in
his
heart
thats
nonsense
you
are
not
going
and
it
wont
be
so
easy
to
tear
yourself
away
as
you
are
boasting
now
remembering
that
night
long
afterwards
ivan
recalled
with
peculiar
repulsion
how
he
had
suddenly
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
had
stealthily
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
being
watched
opened
the
door
gone
out
on
the
staircase
and
listened
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
stirring
down
below
had
listened
a
long
whilesome
five
minuteswith
a
sort
of
strange
curiosity
holding
his
breath
while
his
heart
throbbed
and
why
he
had
done
all
this
why
he
was
listening
he
could
not
have
said
that
action
all
his
life
afterwards
he
called
infamous
and
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
thought
of
it
as
the
basest
action
of
his
life
for
fyodor
pavlovitch
himself
he
felt
no
hatred
at
that
moment
but
was
simply
intensely
curious
to
know
how
he
was
walking
down
there
below
and
what
he
must
be
doing
now
he
wondered
and
imagined
how
he
must
be
peeping
out
of
the
dark
windows
and
stopping
in
the
middle
of
the
room
listening
listeningfor
some
one
to
knock
ivan
went
out
on
to
the
stairs
twice
to
listen
like
this
about
two
oclock
when
everything
was
quiet
and
even
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
gone
to
bed
ivan
had
got
into
bed
firmly
resolved
to
fall
asleep
at
once
as
he
felt
fearfully
exhausted
and
he
did
fall
asleep
at
once
and
slept
soundly
without
dreams
but
waked
early
at
seven
oclock
when
it
was
broad
daylight
opening
his
eyes
he
was
surprised
to
feel
himself
extraordinarily
vigorous
he
jumped
up
at
once
and
dressed
quickly
then
dragged
out
his
trunk
and
began
packing
immediately
his
linen
had
come
back
from
the
laundress
the
previous
morning
ivan
positively
smiled
at
the
thought
that
everything
was
helping
his
sudden
departure
and
his
departure
certainly
was
sudden
though
ivan
had
said
the
day
before
to
katerina
ivanovna
alyosha
and
smerdyakov
that
he
was
leaving
next
day
yet
he
remembered
that
he
had
no
thought
of
departure
when
he
went
to
bed
or
at
least
had
not
dreamed
that
his
first
act
in
the
morning
would
be
to
pack
his
trunk
at
last
his
trunk
and
bag
were
ready
it
was
about
nine
oclock
when
marfa
ignatyevna
came
in
with
her
usual
inquiry
where
will
your
honor
take
your
tea
in
your
own
room
or
downstairs
he
looked
almost
cheerful
but
there
was
about
him
about
his
words
and
gestures
something
hurried
and
scattered
greeting
his
father
affably
and
even
inquiring
specially
after
his
health
though
he
did
not
wait
to
hear
his
answer
to
the
end
he
announced
that
he
was
starting
off
in
an
hour
to
return
to
moscow
for
good
and
begged
him
to
send
for
the
horses
his
father
heard
this
announcement
with
no
sign
of
surprise
and
forgot
in
an
unmannerly
way
to
show
regret
at
losing
him
instead
of
doing
so
he
flew
into
a
great
flutter
at
the
recollection
of
some
important
business
of
his
own
what
a
fellow
you
are
not
to
tell
me
yesterday
never
mind
well
manage
it
all
the
same
do
me
a
great
service
my
dear
boy
go
to
tchermashnya
on
the
way
its
only
to
turn
to
the
left
from
the
station
at
volovya
only
another
twelve
versts
and
you

to
tchermashnya
im
sorry
i
cant
its
eighty
versts
to
the
railway
and
the
train

for
moscow
at
seven
oclock
tonight
i
can
only
just
catch
it
youll
catch
it
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
but
today
turn
off
to
tchermashnya
it
wont
put
you
out
much
to
humor
your
father
if
i
hadnt
had
something
to
keep
me
here
i
would
have
run
over
myself
long
ago
for
ive
some
business
there
in
a
hurry
but
here
i

its
not
the
time
for
me
to
go
now
you
see
ive
two
pieces
of
copse
land
there
the
maslovs
an
old
merchant
and
his
son
will
give
eight
thousand
for
the
timber
but
last
year
i
just
missed
a
purchaser
who
would
have
given
twelve
theres
no
getting
any
one
about
here
to
buy
it
the
maslovs
have
it
all
their
own
way
one
has
to
take
what
theyll
give
for
no
one
here
dare
bid
against
them
the
priest
at
ilyinskoe
wrote
to
me
last
thursday
that
a
merchant
called
gorstkin
a
man
i
know
had
turned
up
what
makes
him
valuable
is
that
he
is
not
from
these
parts
so
he
is
not
afraid
of
the
maslovs
he
says
he
will
give
me
eleven
thousand
for
the
copse
do
you
hear
but
hell
only
be
here
the
priest
writes
for
a
week
altogether
so
you
must
go
at
once
and
make
a
bargain
with
him
well
you
write
to
the
priest
hell
make
the
bargain
he
cant
do
it
he
has
no
eye
for
business
he
is
a
perfect
treasure
id
give
him
twenty
thousand
to
take
care
of
for
me
without
a
receipt
but
he
has
no
eye
for
business
he
is
a
perfect
child
a
crow
could
deceive
him
and
yet
he
is
a
learned
man
would
you
believe
it
this
gorstkin
looks
like
a
peasant
he
wears
a
blue
kaftan
but
he
is
a
regular
rogue
thats
the
common
complaint
he
is
a
liar
sometimes
he
tells
such
lies
that
you
wonder
why
he
is
doing
it
he
told
me
the
year
before
last
that
his
wife
was
dead
and
that
he
had
married
another
and
would
you
believe
it
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
his
wife
has
never
died
at
all
she
is
alive
to
this
day
and
gives
him
a
beating
twice
a
week
so
what
you
have
to
find
out
is
whether
he
is
lying
or
speaking
the
truth
when
he
says
he
wants
to
buy
it
and
would
give
eleven
thousand
i
shall
be
no
use
in
such
a
business
i
have
no
eye
either
stay
wait
a
bit
you
will
be
of
use
for
i
will
tell
you
the
signs
by
which
you
can
judge
about
gorstkin
ive
done
business
with
him
a
long
time
you
see
you
must
watch
his
beard
he
has
a
nasty
thin
red
beard
if
his
beard
shakes
when
he
talks
and
he
gets
cross
its
all
right
he
is
saying
what
he
means
he
wants
to
do
business
but
if
he
strokes
his
beard
with
his
left
hand
and
grinshe
is
trying
to
cheat
you
dont
watch
his
eyes
you
wont
find
out
anything
from
his
eyes
he
is
a
deep
one
a
roguebut
watch
his
beard
ill
give
you
a
note
and
you
show
it
to
him
hes
called
gorstkin
though
his
real
name
is
lyagavy4
but
dont
call
him
so
he
will
be
offended
if
you
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
and
see
its
all
right
write
here
at
once
you
need
only
write
hes
not
lying
stand
out
for
eleven
thousand
one
thousand
you
can
knock
off
but
not
more
just
think
theres
a
difference
between
eight
thousand
and
eleven
thousand
its
as
good
as
picking
up
three
thousand
its
not
so
easy
to
find
a
purchaser
and
im
in
desperate
need
of
money
only
let
me
know
its
serious
and
ill
run
over
and
fix
it
up
ill
snatch
the
time
somehow
but
whats
the
good
of
my
galloping
over
if
its
all
a
notion
of
the
priests
come
will
you
go

a
thing

i
send

because
you

a
clever
fellow
do
you
suppose
i
dont
see
that
you
know
nothing
about
timber
but
youve
got
an
eye
all
that
is
wanted
is
to
see
whether
the
man
is
in
earnest
i
tell

beardif

beard

he
is
in
earnest

me
to
go
to
that
damned
tchermashnya
yourself
then
cried
ivan
with
a
malignant
smile
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
catch
or
would
not
catch
the
malignancy
but
he
caught
the
smile
then
youll
go
youll
go
ill
scribble
the
note
for
you
at
once
i
dont
know
whether
i
shall
go
i
dont
know
ill
decide
on
the
way

at
once
my
dear
fellow
decide
if
you

the
matter

me
a
line
give
it
to
the
priest
and
hell

it
on
to
me
at
once
and
i
wont
delay
you
more
than
that
you
can
go
to
venice
the
priest
will
give
you
horses
back
to
volovya
station
the
old
man
was
quite
delighted
he
wrote
the
note
and
sent
for
the
horses
a
light
lunch
was
brought
in
with
brandy
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
pleased
he
usually
became
expansive
but
today
he
seemed
to
restrain
himself
of
dmitri
for
instance
he
did
not
say
a
word
he
was
quite
unmoved
by
the
parting
and
seemed
in
fact
at
a
loss
for
something
to
say
ivan
noticed
this
particularly
he
must
be
bored
with
me
he
thought
only
when
accompanying
his
son
out
on
to
the
steps
the
old
man
began
to
fuss
about
he
would
have
kissed
him
but
ivan
made
haste
to
hold
out
his
hand
obviously
avoiding
the
kiss
his
father
saw
it
at
once
and
instantly
pulled
himself
up
well
good
luck
to
you
good
luck
to
you
he
repeated
from
the
steps
youll
come
again
some
time
or
other
mind
you
do
come
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
well
christ
be
with
you
ivan
got
into
the
carriage
goodby
ivan
dont
be
too
hard
on
me
the
father
called
for
the
last
time
the
whole
household
came
out
to
take
leavesmerdyakov
marfa
and
grigory
ivan
gave
them
ten
roubles
each
when
he
had
seated
himself
in
the
carriage
smerdyakov
jumped
up
to
arrange
the
rug
you
see

i
am
going
to
tchermashnya
broke
suddenly
from
ivan
again
as
the
day
before
the
words
seemed
to
drop
of
themselves
and
he
laughed
too
a
peculiar
nervous
laugh
he
remembered
it
long
after
its
a
true
saying
then
that
its
always
worth
while
speaking
to
a
clever
man

answered
smerdyakov
firmly
looking
significantly
at
ivan
the
carriage
rolled
away
nothing
was
clear
in
ivans
soul
but
he
looked
eagerly
around
him
at
the
fields
at
the
hills
at
the
trees
at
a
flock
of
geese
flying
high
overhead
in
the
bright
sky
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
felt
very
happy
he
tried
to
talk
to
the
driver
and
he
felt
intensely
interested
in
an
answer
the
peasant
made
him
but
a
minute
later
he
realized
that
he
was
not
catching
anything
and
that
he
had
not
really
even
taken
in
the
peasants
answer
he
was
silent
and
it
was
pleasant
even
so
the
air
was
fresh
pure
and
cool
the
sky
bright
the
images
of
alyosha
and
katerina
ivanovna
floated
into
his
mind
but
he
softly
smiled
blew
softly
on
the
friendly
phantoms
and
they
flew
away
theres
plenty
of
time
for
them
he
thought
they
reached
the
station
quickly
changed
horses
and
galloped
to
volovya
why
is
it
worth
while
speaking
to
a
clever
man
what
did
he
mean
by
that
the
thought
seemed
suddenly
to
clutch
at
his
breathing
and
why
did
i
tell
him
i
was
going
to
tchermashnya
they
reached
volovya
station
ivan
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
the
drivers
stood
round
him
bargaining
over
the
journey
of
twelve
versts
to
tchermashnya
he
told
them
to
harness
the
horses
he
went
into
the
station
house
looked
round
glanced
at
the
overseers

and
suddenly
went
back

the
entrance

delight
his
soul
was
filled
with
such
gloom
and
his
heart
ached
with
such
anguish
as
he
had
never
known
in
his
life
before
he
was
thinking
all
the
night
the
train
flew
on
and
only
at
daybreak
when
he
was
approaching
moscow
he
suddenly
roused
himself
from
his
meditation
i
am
a
scoundrel
he
whispered
to
himself
fyodor
pavlovitch
remained
well
satisfied
at
having
seen
his
son
off
for
two
hours
afterwards
he
felt
almost
happy
and
sat
drinking
brandy
but
suddenly
something
happened
which
was
very
annoying
and
unpleasant
for
every
one
in
the
house
and
completely
upset
fyodor
pavlovitchs
equanimity
at
once
smerdyakov
went
to
the
cellar
for
something
and
fell
down
from
the
top
of
the
steps
fortunately
marfa
ignatyevna
was
in
the
yard
and
heard
him
in
time
she
did
not
see
the
fall
but
heard
his
screamthe
strange
peculiar
scream
long
familiar
to
herthe
scream
of
the
epileptic
falling
in
a
fit
they
could
not
tell
whether
the
fit
had
come
on
him
at
the
moment
he
was
descending
the
steps
so
that
he
must
have
fallen
unconscious
or
whether
it
was
the
fall
and
the
shock
that
had
caused
the
fit
in
smerdyakov
who
was
known
to
be
liable
to
them
they
found
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
cellar
steps
writhing
in
convulsions
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
it
was
thought
at
first
that
he
must
have
broken
somethingan
arm
or
a
legand
hurt
himself
but
god
had
preserved
him
as
marfa
ignatyevna
expressed
itnothing
of
the
kind
had
happened
but
it
was
difficult
to
get
him
out
of
the
cellar
they
asked
the
neighbors
to
help
and
managed
it
somehow
fyodor
pavlovitch
himself
was
present
at
the
whole
ceremony
he
helped
evidently
alarmed
and
upset
the
sick
man
did
not
regain
consciousness
the
convulsions
ceased
for
a
time
but
then
began
again
and
every
one
concluded
that
the
same
thing
would
happen
as
had
happened
a
year
before
when
he
accidentally
fell
from
the
garret
they
remembered
that
ice
had
been
put
on
his
head
then
there
was
still
ice
in
the
cellar
and
marfa
ignatyevna
had
some
brought
up
in
the
evening
fyodor
pavlovitch
sent
for
doctor
herzenstube
who
arrived
at
once
he
was
a
most
estimable
old
man
and
the
most
careful
and
conscientious
doctor
in
the
province
after
careful
examination
he
concluded
that
the
fit
was
a
very
violent
one
and
might
have
serious
consequences
that
meanwhile
he
herzenstube
did
not
fully
understand
it
but
that
by
tomorrow
morning
if
the
present
remedies
were
unavailing
he
would
venture
to
try
something
else
the
invalid
was
taken
to
the
lodge
to
a
room
next
to
grigorys
and
marfa
ignatyevnas
then
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
one
misfortune
after
another
to
put
up
with
that
day
marfa
ignatyevna
cooked
the
dinner
and
the
soup
compared
with
smerdyakovs
was
no
better
than
dishwater
and
the
fowl
was
so
dried
up
that
it
was
impossible
to
masticate
it
to
her
masters
bitter
though
deserved
reproaches
marfa
ignatyevna
replied
that
the
fowl
was
a
very
old
one
to
begin
with
and
that
she
had
never
been
trained
as
a
cook
in
the
evening
there
was
another
trouble
in
store
for
fyodor
pavlovitch
he
was
informed
that
grigory
who
had
not
been
well
for
the
last
three
days
was
completely
laid
up
by
his
lumbago
fyodor
pavlovitch
finished
his
tea
as
early
as
possible
and
locked
himself
up
alone
in
the
house
he
was
in
terrible
excitement
and
suspense
that
evening
he
reckoned
on
grushenkas
coming
almost
as
a
certainty
he
had
received
from
smerdyakov
that
morning
an
assurance
that
she
had
promised
to
come
without
fail
the
incorrigible
old
mans
heart
throbbed
with
excitement
he
paced
up
and
down
his
empty
rooms
listening
he
had
to
be
on
the
alert
dmitri
might
be
on
the
watch
for
her
somewhere
and
when
she
knocked
on
the
window
smerdyakov
had
informed
him
two
days
before
that
he
had
told
her
where
and
how
to
knock
the
door
must
be
opened
at
once
she
must
not
be
a
second
in
the
passage
for
fearwhich
god
forbidthat
she
should
be
frightened
and
run
away
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
much
to
think
of
but
never
had
his
heart
been
steeped
in
such
voluptuous
hopes
this
time
he
could
say
almost
certainly
that
she
would
come

vi
the
russian
monk
chapter
i
father
zossima
and
his
visitors
when
with
an
anxious
and
aching
heart
alyosha
went
into
his
elders
cell
he
stood
still
almost
astonished
instead
of
a
sick
man
at
his
last
gasp
perhaps
unconscious
as
he
had
feared
to
find
him
he
saw
him
sitting
up
in
his
chair
and
though
weak
and
exhausted
his
face
was
bright
and
cheerful
he
was
surrounded
by
visitors
and
engaged
in
a
quiet
and
joyful
conversation
but
he
had
only
got
up
from
his
bed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
alyoshas
arrival
his
visitors
had
gathered
together
in
his
cell
earlier
waiting
for
him
to
wake
having
received
a
most
confident
assurance
from
father
passy
that
the
teacher
would
get
up
and
as
he
had
himself
promised
in
the
morning
converse
once
more
with
those
dear
to
his
heart
this
promise
and
indeed
every
word
of
the
dying
elder
father
passy
put
implicit
trust
in
if
he
had
seen
him
unconscious
if
he
had
seen
him
breathe
his
last
and
yet
had
his
promise
that
he
would
rise
up
and
say
goodby
to
him
he
would
not
have
believed
perhaps
even
in
death
but
would
still
have
expected
the
dead
man
to
recover
and
fulfill
his
promise
in
the
morning
as
he
lay
down
to
sleep
father
zossima
had
told
him
positively
i
shall
not
die
without
the
delight
of
another
conversation
with
you
beloved
of
my
heart
i
shall
look
once
more
on
your
dear
face
and
pour
out
my
heart
to
you
once
again
the
monks
who
had
gathered
for
this
probably
last
conversation
with
father
zossima
had
all
been
his
devoted
friends
for
many
years
there
were
four
of
them
father
iosif
and
father
passy
father
mihal
the
warden
of
the
hermitage
a
man
not
very
old
and
far
from
being
learned
he
was
of
humble
origin
of
strong
will
and
steadfast
faith
of
austere
appearance
but
of
deep
tenderness
though
he
obviously
concealed
it
as
though
he
were
almost
ashamed
of
it
the
fourth
father
anfim
was
a
very
old
and
humble
little
monk
of
the
poorest
peasant
class
he
was
almost
illiterate
and
very
quiet
scarcely
speaking
to
any
one
he
was
the
humblest
of
the
humble
and
looked
as
though
he
had
been
frightened
by
something
great
and
awful
beyond
the
scope
of
his
intelligence
father
zossima
had
a
great
affection
for
this
timorous
man
and
always
treated
him
with
marked
respect
though
perhaps
there
was
no
one
he
had
known
to
whom
he
had
said
less
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
had
spent
years
wandering
about
holy
russia
with
him
that
was
very
long
ago
forty
years
before
when
father
zossima
first
began
his
life
as
a
monk
in
a
poor
and
little
monastery
at
kostroma
and
when
shortly
after
he
had
accompanied
father
anfim
on
his
pilgrimage
to
collect
alms
for
their
poor
monastery
the
whole
party
were
in
the
bedroom
which
as
we
mentioned
before
was
very
small
so
that
there
was
scarcely
room
for
the
four
of
them
in
addition
to
porfiry
the
novice
who
stood
to
sit
round
father
zossima
on
chairs
brought
from
the
sittingroom
it
was
already
beginning
to
get
dark
the
room
was
lighted
up
by
the
lamps
and
the
candles
before
the
ikons
seeing
alyosha
standing
embarrassed
in
the
doorway
father
zossima
smiled
at
him
joyfully
and
held
out
his
hand
welcome
my
quiet
one
welcome
my
dear
here
you
are
too
i
knew
you
would
come
alyosha
went
up
to
him
bowed
down
before
him
to
the
ground
and
wept
something
surged
up
from
his
heart
his
soul
was
quivering
he
wanted
to
sob
come
dont
weep
over
me
yet
father
zossima
smiled
laying
his
right
hand
on
his
head
you
see
i
am
sitting
up
talking
maybe
i
shall
live
another
twenty
years
yet
as
that
dear
good
woman
from
vishegorye
with
her
little
lizaveta
in
her
arms
wished
me
yesterday
god
bless
the
mother
and
the
little
girl
lizaveta
he
crossed
himself
porfiry
did
you
take
her
offering
where
i
told
you
he
meant
the
sixty
copecks
brought
him
the
day
before
by
the
goodhumored
woman
to
be
given
to
some
one
poorer
than
me
such
offerings
always
of
money
gained
by
personal
toil
are
made
by
way
of
penance
voluntarily
undertaken
the
elder
had
sent
porfiry
the
evening
before
to
a
widow
whose
house
had
been
burnt
down
lately
and
who
after
the
fire
had
gone
with
her
children
begging
alms
porfiry
hastened
to
reply
that
he
had
given
the
money
as
he
had
been
instructed
from
an
unknown
benefactress
get
up
my
dear
boy
the
elder
went
on
to
alyosha
let
me
look
at
you
have
you
been
home
and
seen
your
brother
it
seemed
strange
to
alyosha
that
he
asked
so
confidently
and
precisely
about
one
of
his
brothers
onlybut
which
one
then
perhaps
he
had
sent
him
out
both
yesterday
and
today
for
the
sake
of
that
brother
i
have
seen
one
of
my
brothers
answered
alyosha
i
mean
the
elder
one
to
whom
i
bowed
down
i
only
saw
him
yesterday
and
could
not
find
him
today
said
alyosha
make
haste
to
find
him
go
again
tomorrow
and
make
haste
leave
everything
and
make
haste
perhaps
you
may
still
have
time
to
prevent
something
terrible
i
bowed
down
yesterday
to
the
great
suffering
in
store
for
him
he
was
suddenly
silent
and
seemed
to
be
pondering
the
words
were
strange
father
iosif
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
yesterday
exchanged
glances
with
father
passy
alyosha
could
not
resist
asking
father
and
teacher
he
began
with
extreme
emotion
your
words
are
too
obscure
what
is
this
suffering
in
store
for
him
dont
inquire
i
seemed
to
see
something
terrible
yesterday

as
though
his
whole
future
were
expressed
in
his
eyes
a
look
came
into
his
eyesso
that
i
was
instantly
horrorstricken
at
what
that
man
is
preparing
for
himself
once
or
twice
in
my
life
ive
seen
such
a
look
in
a
mans
face

reflecting
as
it
were
his
future
fate
and
that
fate
alas
came
to
pass
i
sent
you
to
him
alexey
for
i
thought
your
brotherly
face
would
help
him
but
everything
and
all
our
fates
are
from
the
lord
except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
die
it
abideth
alone
but
if
it
die
it
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
remember
that
you
alexey
ive
many
times
silently
blessed
for
your
face
know
that
added
the
elder
with
a
gentle
smile
this
is
what
i
think
of
you
you
will
go
forth
from
these
walls
but
will
live
like
a
monk
in
the
world
you
will
have
many
enemies
but
even
your
foes
will
love
you
life
will
bring
you
many
misfortunes
but
you
will
find
your
happiness
in
them
and
will
bless
life
and
will
make
others
bless
itwhich
is
what
matters
most
well
that
is
your
character
fathers
and
teachers
he
addressed
his
friends
with
a
tender
smile
i
have
never
till
today
told
even
him
why
the
face
of
this
youth
is
so
dear
to
me
now
i
will
tell
you
his
face
has
been
as
it
were
a
remembrance
and
a
prophecy
for
me
at
the
dawn
of
my
life
when
i
was
a
child
i
had
an
elder
brother
who
died
before
my
eyes
at
seventeen
and
later
on
in
the
course
of
my
life
i
gradually
became
convinced
that
that
brother
had
been
for
a
guidance
and
a
sign
from
on
high
for
me
for
had
he
not
come
into
my
life
i
should
never
perhaps
so
i
fancy
at
least
have
become
a
monk
and
entered
on
this
precious
path
he
appeared
first
to
me
in
my
childhood
and
here
at
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
he
seems
to
have
come
to
me
over
again
it
is
marvelous
fathers
and
teachers
that
alexey
who
has
some
though
not
a
great
resemblance
in
face
seems
to
me
so
like
him
spiritually
that
many
times
i
have
taken
him
for
that
young
man
my
brother
mysteriously
come
back
to
me
at
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
as
a
reminder
and
an
inspiration
so
that
i
positively
wondered
at
so
strange
a
dream
in
myself
do
you
hear
this
porfiry
he
turned
to
the
novice
who
waited
on
him
many
times
ive
seen
in
your
face
as
it
were
a
look
of
mortification
that
i
love
alexey
more
than
you
now
you
know
why
that
was
so
but
i
love
you
too
know
that
and
many
times
i
grieved
at
your
mortification
i
should
like
to
tell
you
dear
friends
of
that
youth
my
brother
for
there
has
been
no
presence
in
my
life
more
precious
more
significant
and
touching
my
heart
is
full
of
tenderness
and
i
look
at
my
whole
life
at
this
moment
as
though
living
through
it
again
here
i
must
observe
that
this
last
conversation
of
father
zossima
with
the
friends
who
visited
him
on
the
last
day
of
his
life
has
been
partly
preserved
in
writing
alexey
fyodorovitch
karamazov
wrote
it
down
from
memory
some
time
after
his
elders
death
but
whether
this
was
only
the
conversation
that
took
place
then
or
whether
he
added
to
it
his
notes
of
parts
of
former
conversations
with
his
teacher
i
cannot
determine
in
his
account
father
zossimas
talk
goes
on
without
interruption
as
though
he
told
his
life
to
his
friends
in
the
form
of
a
story
though
there
is
no
doubt
from
other
accounts
of
it
that
the
conversation
that
evening
was
general
though
the
guests
did
not
interrupt
father
zossima
much
yet
they
too
talked
perhaps
even
told
something
themselves
besides
father
zossima
could
not
have
carried
on
an
uninterrupted
narrative
for
he
was
sometimes
gasping
for
breath
his
voice
failed
him
and
he
even
lay
down
to
rest
on
his
bed
though
he
did
not
fall
asleep
and
his
visitors
did
not
leave
their
seats
once
or
twice
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
father
passys
reading
the
gospel
it
is
worthy
of
note
too
that
no
one
of
them
supposed
that
he
would
die
that
night
for
on
that
evening
of
his
life
after
his
deep
sleep
in
the
day
he
seemed
suddenly
to
have
found
new
strength
which
kept
him
up
through
this
long
conversation
it
was
like
a
last
effort
of
love
which
gave
him
marvelous
energy
only
for
a
little
time
however
for
his
life
was
cut
short
immediately
but
of
that
later
i
will
only
add
now
that
i
have
preferred
to
confine
myself
to
the
account
given
by
alexey
fyodorovitch
karamazov
it
will
be
shorter
and
not
so
fatiguing
though
of
course
as
i
must
repeat
alyosha
took
a
great
deal
from
previous
conversations
and
added
them
to
it
notes
of
the
life
of
the
deceased
priest
and
monk
the
elder
zossima
taken
from
his
own
words

biographical
notes
a
father
zossimas
brother
beloved
fathers
and
teachers
i
was
born
in
a
distant
province
in
the
north
in
the
town
of
v
my
father
was
a
gentleman
by
birth
but
of
no
great
consequence
or
position
he
died
when
i
was
only
two
years
old
and
i
dont
remember
him
at
all
he
left
my
mother
a
small
house
built
of
wood
and
a
fortune
not
large
but
sufficient
to
keep
her
and
her
children
in
comfort
there
were
two
of
us
my
elder
brother
markel
and
i
he
was
eight
years
older
than
i
was
of
hasty
irritable
temperament
but
kindhearted
and
never
ironical
he
was
remarkably
silent
especially
at
home
with
me
his
mother
and
the
servants
he
did
well
at
school
but
did
not
get
on
with
his
schoolfellows
though
he
never
quarreled
at
least
so
my
mother
has
told
me
six
months
before
his
death
when
he
was
seventeen
he
made
friends
with
a
political
exile
who
had
been
banished
from
moscow
to
our
town
for
freethinking
and
led
a
solitary
existence
there
he
was
a
good
scholar
who
had
gained
distinction
in
philosophy
in
the
university
something
made
him
take
a
fancy
to
markel
and
he
used
to
ask
him
to
see
him
the
young
man
would
spend
whole
evenings
with
him
during
that
winter
till
the
exile
was
summoned
to
petersburg
to
take
up
his
post
again
at
his
own
request
as
he
had
powerful
friends
it
was
the
beginning
of
lent
and
markel
would
not
fast
he
was
rude
and
laughed
at
it
thats
all
silly
twaddle
and
there
is
no
god
he
said
horrifying
my
mother
the
servants
and
me
too
for
though
i
was
only
nine
i
too
was
aghast
at
hearing
such
words
we
had
four
servants
all
serfs
i
remember
my
mother
selling
one
of
the
four
the
cook
afimya
who
was
lame
and
elderly
for
sixty
paper
roubles
and
hiring
a
free
servant
to
take
her
place
in
the
sixth
week
in
lent
my
brother
who
was
never
strong
and
had
a
tendency
to
consumption
was
taken
ill
he
was
tall
but
thin
and
delicate
looking
and
of
very
pleasing
countenance
i
suppose
he
caught
cold
anyway
the
doctor
who
came
soon
whispered
to
my
mother
that
it
was
galloping
consumption
that
he
would
not
live
through
the
spring
my
mother
began
weeping
and
careful
not
to
alarm
my
brother
she
entreated
him
to
go
to
church
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
as
he
was
still
able
to
move
about
this
made
him
angry
and
he
said
something
profane
about
the
church
he
grew
thoughtful
however
he
guessed
at
once
that
he
was
seriously
ill
and
that
that
was
why
his
mother
was
begging
him
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
he
had
been
aware
indeed
for
a
long
time
past
that
he
was
far
from
well
and
had
a
year
before
coolly
observed
at
dinner
to
our
mother
and
me
my
life
wont
be
long
among
you
i
may
not
live
another
year
which
seemed
now
like
a
prophecy
three
days
passed
and
holy
week
had
come
and
on
tuesday
morning
my
brother
began
going
to
church
i
am
doing
this
simply
for
your
sake
mother
to
please
and
comfort
you
he
said
my
mother
wept
with
joy
and
grief
his
end
must
be
near
she
thought
if
theres
such
a
change
in
him
but
he
was
not
able
to
go
to
church
long
he
took
to
his
bed
so
he
had
to
confess
and
take
the
sacrament
at
home
it
was
a
late
easter
and
the
days
were
bright
fine
and
full
of
fragrance
i
remember
he
used
to
cough
all
night
and
sleep
badly
but
in
the
morning
he
dressed
and
tried
to
sit
up
in
an
armchair
thats
how
i
remember
him
sitting
sweet
and
gentle
smiling
his
face
bright
and
joyous
in
spite
of
his
illness
a
marvelous
change
passed
over
him
his
spirit
seemed
transformed
the
old
nurse
would
come
in
and
say
let
me
light
the
lamp
before
the
holy
image
my
dear
and
once
he
would
not
have
allowed
it
and
would
have
blown
it
out
light
it
light
it
dear
i
was
a
wretch
to
have
prevented
you
doing
it
you
are
praying
when
you
light
the
lamp
and
i
am
praying
when
i
rejoice
seeing
you
so
we
are
praying
to
the
same
god
those
words
seemed
strange
to
us
and
mother
would
go
to
her
room
and
weep
but
when
she
went
in
to
him
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
looked
cheerful
mother
dont
weep
darling
he
would
say
ive
long
to
live
yet
long
to
rejoice
with
you
and
life
is
glad
and
joyful
ah
dear
boy
how
can
you
talk
of
joy
when
you
lie
feverish
at
night
coughing
as
though
you
would
tear
yourself
to
pieces
dont
cry
mother
he
would
answer
life
is
paradise
and
we
are
all
in
paradise
but
we
wont
see
it
if
we
would
we
should
have
heaven
on
earth
the
next
day
every
one
wondered
at
his
words
he
spoke
so
strangely
and
positively
we
were
all
touched
and
wept
friends
came
to
see
us
dear
ones
he
would
say
to
them
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
love
me
so
how
can
you
love
any
one
like
me
and
how
was
it
i
did
not
know
i
did
not
appreciate
it
before
when
the
servants
came
in
to
him
he
would
say
continually
dear
kind
people
why
are
you
doing
so
much
for
me
do
i
deserve
to
be
waited
on
if
it
were
gods
will
for
me
to
live
i
would
wait
on
you
for
all
men
should
wait
on
one
another
mother
shook
her
head
as
she
listened
my
darling
its
your
illness
makes
you
talk
like
that
mother
darling
he
would
say
there
must
be
servants
and
masters
but
if
so
i
will
be
the
servant
of
my
servants
the
same
as
they
are
to
me
and
another
thing
mother
every
one
of
us
has
sinned
against
all
men
and
i
more
than
any
mother
positively
smiled
at
that
smiled
through
her
tears
why
how
could
you
have
sinned
against
all
men
more
than
all
robbers
and
murderers
have
done
that
but
what
sin
have
you
committed
yet
that
you
hold
yourself
more
guilty
than
all
mother
little
heart
of
mine
he
said
he
had
begun
using
such
strange
caressing
words
at
that
time
little
heart
of
mine
my
joy
believe
me
every
one
is
really
responsible
to
all
men
for
all
men
and
for
everything
i
dont
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
but
i
feel
it
is
so
painfully
even
and
how
is
it
we
went
on
then
living
getting
angry
and
not
knowing
so
he
would
get
up
every
day
more
and
more
sweet
and
joyous
and
full
of
love
when
the
doctor
an
old
german
called
eisenschmidt
came
well
doctor
have
i
another
day
in
this
world
he
would
ask
joking
youll
live
many
days
yet
the
doctor
would
answer
and
months
and
years
too
months
and
years
he
would
exclaim
why
reckon
the
days
one
day
is
enough
for
a
man
to
know
all
happiness
my
dear
ones
why
do
we
quarrel
try
to
outshine
each
other
and
keep
grudges
against
each
other
lets
go
straight
into
the
garden
walk
and
play
there
love
appreciate
and
kiss
each
other
and
glorify
life
your
son
cannot
last
long
the
doctor
told
my
mother
as
she
accompanied
him
to
the
door
the
disease
is
affecting
his
brain
the
windows
of
his
room
looked
out
into
the
garden
and
our
garden
was
a
shady
one
with
old
trees
in
it
which
were
coming
into
bud
the
first
birds
of
spring
were
flitting
in
the
branches
chirruping
and
singing
at
the
windows
and
looking
at
them
and
admiring
them
he
began
suddenly
begging
their
forgiveness
too
birds
of
heaven
happy
birds
forgive
me
for
i
have
sinned
against
you
too
none
of
us
could
understand
that
at
the
time
but
he
shed
tears
of
joy
yes
he
said
there
was
such
a
glory
of
god
all
about
me
birds
trees
meadows
sky
only
i
lived
in
shame
and
dishonored
it
all
and
did
not
notice
the
beauty
and
glory
you
take
too
many
sins
on
yourself
mother
used
to
say
weeping
mother
darling
its
for
joy
not
for
grief
i
am
crying
though
i
cant
explain
it
to
you
i
like
to
humble
myself
before
them
for
i
dont
know
how
to
love
them
enough
if
i
have
sinned
against
every
one
yet
all
forgive
me
too
and
thats
heaven
am
i
not
in
heaven
now
and
there
was
a
great
deal
more
i
dont
remember
i
remember
i
went
once
into
his
room
when
there
was
no
one
else
there
it
was
a
bright
evening
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
whole
room
was
lighted
up
he
beckoned
me
and
i
went
up
to
him
he
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
looked
into
my
face
tenderly
lovingly
he
said
nothing
for
a
minute
only
looked
at
me
like
that
well
he
said
run
and
play
now
enjoy
life
for
me
too
i
went
out
then
and
ran
to
play
and
many
times
in
my
life
afterwards
i
remembered
even
with
tears
how
he
told
me
to
enjoy
life
for
him
too
there
were
many
other
marvelous
and
beautiful
sayings
of
his
though
we
did
not
understand
them
at
the
time
he
died
the
third
week
after
easter
he
was
fully
conscious
though
he
could
not
talk
up
to
his
last
hour
he
did
not
change
he
looked
happy
his
eyes
beamed
and
sought
us
he
smiled
at
us
beckoned
us
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
even
in
the
town
about
his
death
i
was
impressed
by
all
this
at
the
time
but
not
too
much
so
though
i
cried
a
good
deal
at
his
funeral
i
was
young
then
a
child
but
a
lasting
impression
a
hidden
feeling
of
it
all
remained
in
my
heart
ready
to
rise
up
and
respond
when
the
time
came
so
indeed
it
happened
b
of
the
holy
scriptures
in
the
life
of
father
zossima
i
was
left
alone
with
my
mother
her
friends
began
advising
her
to
send
me
to
petersburg
as
other
parents
did
you
have
only
one
son
now
they
said
and
have
a
fair
income
and
you
will
be
depriving
him
perhaps
of
a
brilliant
career
if
you
keep
him
here
they
suggested
i
should
be
sent
to
petersburg
to
the
cadet
corps
that
i
might
afterwards
enter
the
imperial
guard
my
mother
hesitated
for
a
long
time
it
was
awful
to
part
with
her
only
child
but
she
made
up
her
mind
to
it
at
last
though
not
without
many
tears
believing
she
was
acting
for
my
happiness
she
brought
me
to
petersburg
and
put
me
into
the
cadet
corps
and
i
never
saw
her
again
for
she
too
died
three
years
afterwards
she
spent
those
three
years
mourning
and
grieving
for
both
of
us
from
the
house
of
my
childhood
i
have
brought
nothing
but
precious
memories
for
there
are
no
memories
more
precious
than
those
of
early
childhood
in
ones
first
home
and
that
is
almost
always
so
if
there
is
any
love
and
harmony
in
the
family
at
all
indeed
precious
memories
may
remain
even
of
a
bad
home
if
only
the
heart
knows
how
to
find
what
is
precious
with
my
memories
of
home
i
count
too
my
memories
of
the
bible
which
child
as
i
was
i
was
very
eager
to
read
at
home
i
had
a
book
of
scripture
history
then
with
excellent
pictures
called
a
hundred
and
four
stories
from
the
old
and
new
testament
and
i
learned
to
read
from
it
i
have
it
lying
on
my
shelf
now
i
keep
it
as
a
precious
relic
of
the
past
but
even
before
i
learned
to
read
i
remember
first
being
moved
to
devotional
feeling
at
eight
years
old
my
mother
took
me
alone
to
mass
i
dont
remember
where
my
brother
was
at
the
time
on
the
monday
before
easter
it
was
a
fine
day
and
i
remember
today
as
though
i
saw
it
now
how
the
incense
rose
from
the
censer
and
softly
floated
upwards
and
overhead
in
the
cupola
mingled
in
rising
waves
with
the
sunlight
that
streamed
in
at
the
little
window
i
was
stirred
by
the
sight
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
consciously
received
the
seed
of
gods
word
in
my
heart
a
youth
came
out
into
the
middle
of
the
church
carrying
a
big
book
so
large
that
at
the
time
i
fancied
he
could
scarcely
carry
it
he
laid
it
on
the
reading
desk
opened
it
and
began
reading
and
suddenly
for
the
first
time
i
understood
something
read
in
the
church
of
god
in
the
land
of
uz
there
lived
a
man
righteous
and
godfearing
and
he
had
great
wealth
so
many
camels
so
many
sheep
and
asses
and
his
children
feasted
and
he
loved
them
very
much
and
prayed
for
them
it
may
be
that
my
sons
have
sinned
in
their
feasting
now
the
devil
came
before
the
lord
together
with
the
sons
of
god
and
said
to
the
lord
that
he
had
gone
up
and
down
the
earth
and
under
the
earth
and
hast
thou
considered
my
servant
job
god
asked
of
him
and
god
boasted
to
the
devil
pointing
to
his
great
and
holy
servant
and
the
devil
laughed
at
gods
words
give
him
over
to
me
and
thou
wilt
see
that
thy
servant
will
murmur
against
thee
and
curse
thy
name
and
god
gave
up
the
just
man
he
loved
so
to
the
devil
and
the
devil
smote
his
children
and
his
cattle
and
scattered
his
wealth
all
of
a
sudden
like
a
thunderbolt
from
heaven
and
job
rent
his
mantle
and
fell
down
upon
the
ground
and
cried
aloud
naked
came
i
out
of
my
mothers
womb
and
naked
shall
i
return
into
the
earth
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
has
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
for
ever
and
ever
fathers
and
teachers
forgive
my
tears
now
for
all
my
childhood
rises
up
again
before
me
and
i
breathe
now
as
i
breathed
then
with
the
breast
of
a
little
child
of
eight
and
i
feel
as
i
did
then
awe
and
wonder
and
gladness
the
camels
at
that
time
caught
my
imagination
and
satan
who
talked
like
that
with
god
and
god
who
gave
his
servant
up
to
destruction
and
his
servant
crying
out
blessed
be
thy
name
although
thou
dost
punish
me
and
then
the
soft
and
sweet
singing
in
the
church
let
my
prayer
rise
up
before
thee
and
again
incense
from
the
priests
censer
and
the
kneeling
and
the
prayer
ever
since
thenonly
yesterday
i
took
it
upive
never
been
able
to
read
that
sacred
tale
without
tears
and
how
much
that
is
great
mysterious
and
unfathomable
there
is
in
it
afterwards
i
heard
the
words
of
mockery
and
blame
proud
words
how
could
god
give
up
the
most
loved
of
his
saints
for
the
diversion
of
the
devil
take
from
him
his
children
smite
him
with
sore
boils
so
that
he
cleansed
the
corruption
from
his
sores
with
a
potsherdand
for
no
object
except
to
boast
to
the
devil
see
what
my
saint
can
suffer
for
my
sake

but
the
greatness
of
it
lies
just
in
the
fact
that
it
is
a
mysterythat
the
passing
earthly
show
and
the
eternal
verity
are
brought
together
in
it
in
the
face
of
the
earthly
truth
the
eternal
truth
is
accomplished
the
creator
just
as
on
the
first
days
of
creation
he
ended
each
day
with
praise
that
is
good
that
i
have
created
looks
upon
job
and
again
praises
his
creation
and
job
praising
the
lord
serves
not
only
him
but
all
his
creation
for
generations
and
generations
and
for
ever
and
ever
since
for
that
he
was
ordained
good
heavens
what
a
book
it
is
and
what
lessons
there
are
in
it
what
a
book
the
bible
is
what
a
miracle
what
strength
is
given
with
it
to
man
it
is
like
a
mold
cast
of
the
world
and
man
and
human
nature
everything
is
there
and
a
law
for
everything
for
all
the
ages
and
what
mysteries
are
solved
and
revealed
god
raises
job
again
gives
him
wealth
again
many
years
pass
by
and
he
has
other
children
and
loves
them
but
how
could
he
love
those
new
ones
when
those
first
children
are
no
more
when
he
has
lost
them
remembering
them
how
could
he
be
fully
happy
with
those
new
ones
however
dear
the
new
ones
might
be
but
he
could
he
could
its
the
great
mystery
of
human
life
that
old
grief
passes
gradually
into
quiet
tender
joy
the
mild
serenity
of
age
takes
the
place
of
the
riotous
blood
of
youth
i
bless
the
rising
sun
each
day
and
as
before
my
hearts
sings
to
meet
it
but
now
i
love
even
more
its
setting
its
long
slanting
rays
and
the
soft
tender
gentle
memories
that
come
with
them
the
dear
images
from
the
whole
of
my
long
happy
lifeand
over
all
the
divine
truth
softening
reconciling
forgiving
my
life
is
ending
i
know
that
well
but
every
day
that
is
left
me
i
feel
how
my
earthly
life
is
in
touch
with
a
new
infinite
unknown
that
approaching
life
the
nearness
of
which
sets
my
soul
quivering
with
rapture
my
mind
glowing
and
my
heart
weeping
with
joy
friends
and
teachers
i
have
heard
more
than
once
and
of
late
one
may
hear
it
more
often
that
the
priests
and
above
all
the
village
priests
are
complaining
on
all
sides
of
their
miserable
income
and
their
humiliating
lot
they
plainly
state
even
in
printive
read
it
myselfthat
they
are
unable
to
teach
the
scriptures
to
the
people
because
of
the
smallness
of
their
means
and
if
lutherans
and
heretics
come
and
lead
the
flock
astray
they
let
them
lead
them
astray
because
they
have
so
little
to
live
upon
may
the
lord
increase
the
sustenance
that
is
so
precious
to
them
for
their
complaint
is
just
too
but
of
a
truth
i
say
if
any
one
is
to
blame
in
the
matter
half
the
fault
is
ours
for
he
may
be
short
of
time
he
may
say
truly
that
he
is
overwhelmed
all
the
while
with
work
and
services
but
still
its
not
all
the
time
even
he
has
an
hour
a
week
to
remember
god
and
he
does
not
work
the
whole
year
round
let
him
gather
round
him

that
book
and
begin
reading
it
without
grand
words
or
superciliousness
without
condescension
to
them
but
gently
and
kindly
being
glad
that
he
is
reading
to
them
and
that
they
are
listening
with
attention

that
his
darling
boy
was
still
alive
and
how
he
went
to
egypt
leaving
his
own
country
and
died
in
a
foreign
land
bequeathing
his
great
prophecy
that
had
lain
mysteriously
hidden
in
his
meek
and
timid
heart
all
his
life
that
from
his
offspring
from
judah
will
come
the
great
hope
of
the
world
the
messiah
and
saviour
fathers
and
teachers
forgive
me
and
dont
be
angry
that
like
a
little
child
ive
been
babbling
of
what
you
know
long
ago
and
can
teach
me
a
hundred
times
more
skillfully
i
only
speak
from
rapture
and
forgive
my
tears
for
i
love
the
bible
let
him
too
weep
the
priest
of
god
and
be
sure
that
the
hearts
of
his
listeners
will
throb
in
response
only
a
little
tiny
seed
is
neededdrop
it
into
the
heart
of
the
peasant
and
it
wont
die
it
will
live
in
his
soul
all
his
life
it
will
be
hidden
in
the
midst
of
his
darkness
and
sin
like
a
bright
spot
like
a
great
reminder
and
theres
no
need
of
much
teaching
or
explanation
he
will
understand
it
all
simply
do
you
suppose
that
the
peasants
dont
understand
try
reading
them
the
touching
story
of
the
fair
esther
and
the
haughty
vashti
or
the
miraculous
story
of
jonah
in
the
whale
dont
forget
either
the
parables
of
our
lord
choose
especially
from
the
gospel
of
st
luke
that
is
what
i
did
and
then
from
the
acts
of
the
apostles
the
conversion
of
st
paul
that
you
mustnt
leave
out
on
any
account
and
from
the
lives
of
the
saints
for
instance
the
life
of
alexey
the
man
of
god
and
greatest
of
all
the
happy
martyr
and
the
seer
of
god
mary
of
egyptand
you
will
penetrate
their
hearts
with
these
simple
tales
give
one
hour
a
week
to
it
in
spite
of
your
poverty
only
one
little
hour
and
you
will
see
for
yourselves
that
our
people
is
gracious
and
grateful
and
will
repay
you
a
hundredfold
mindful
of
the
kindness
of
their
priest
and
the
moving
words
they
have
heard
from
him
they
will
of
their
own
accord
help
him
in
his
fields
and
in
his
house
and
will
treat
him
with
more
respect
than
beforeso
that
it
will
even
increase
his
worldly
wellbeing
too
the
thing
is
so
simple
that
sometimes
one
is
even
afraid
to
put
it
into
words
for
fear
of
being
laughed
at
and
yet
how
true
it
is
one
who
does
not
believe
in
god
will
not
believe
in
gods
people
he
who
believes
in
gods
people
will
see
his
holiness
too
even
though
he
had
not
believed
in
it
till
then
only
the
people
and
their
future
spiritual
power
will
convert
our
atheists
who
have
torn
themselves
away
from
their
native
soil
and
what
is
the
use
of
christs
words
unless
we
set
an
example
the
people
is
lost
without
the
word
of
god
for
its
soul
is
athirst
for
the
word
and
for
all
that
is
good
in
my
youth
long
ago
nearly
forty
years
ago
i
traveled
all
over
russia
with
father
anfim
collecting
funds
for
our
monastery
and
we
stayed
one
night
on
the
bank
of
a
great
navigable
river
with
some
fishermen
a
good
looking
peasant
lad
about
eighteen
joined
us
he
had
to
hurry
back
next
morning
to
pull
a
merchants
barge
along
the
bank
i
noticed
him
looking
straight
before
him
with
clear
and
tender
eyes
it
was
a
bright
warm
still
july
night
a
cool
mist
rose
from
the
broad
river
we
could
hear
the
plash
of
a
fish
the
birds
were
still
all
was
hushed
and
beautiful
everything
praying
to
god
only
we
two
were
not
sleeping
the
lad
and
i
and
we
talked
of
the
beauty
of
this
world
of
gods
and
of
the
great
mystery
of
it
every
blade
of
grass
every
insect
ant
and
golden
bee
all
so
marvelously
know
their
path
though
they
have
not
intelligence
they
bear
witness
to
the
mystery
of
god
and
continually
accomplish
it
themselves
i
saw
the
dear
lads
heart
was
moved
he
told
me
that
he
loved
the
forest
and
the
forest
birds
he
was
a
birdcatcher
knew
the
note
of
each
of
them
could
call
each
bird
i
know
nothing
better
than
to
be
in
the
forest
said
he
though
all
things
are
good
truly
i
answered
him
all
things
are
good
and
fair
because
all
is
truth
look
said
i
at
the
horse
that
great
beast
that
is
so
near
to
man
or
the
lowly
pensive
ox
which
feeds
him
and
works
for
him
look
at
their
faces
what
meekness
what
devotion
to
man
who
often
beats
them
mercilessly
what
gentleness
what
confidence
and
what
beauty
its
touching
to
know
that
theres
no
sin
in
them
for
all
all
except
man
is
sinless
and
christ
has
been
with
them
before
us
why
asked
the
boy
is
christ
with
them
too
it
cannot
but
be
so
said
i
since
the
word
is
for
all
all
creation
and
all
creatures
every
leaf
is
striving
to
the
word
singing
glory
to
god
weeping
to
christ
unconsciously
accomplishing
this
by
the
mystery
of
their
sinless
life
yonder
said
i
in
the
forest
wanders
the
dreadful
bear
fierce
and
menacing
and
yet
innocent
in
it
and
i
told
him
how
once
a
bear
came
to
a
great
saint
who
had
taken
refuge
in
a
tiny
cell
in
the
wood
and
the
great
saint
pitied
him
went
up
to
him
without
fear
and
gave
him
a
piece
of
bread
go
along
said
he
christ
be
with
you
and
the
savage
beast
walked
away
meekly
and
obediently
doing
no
harm
and
the
lad
was
delighted
that
the
bear
had
walked
away
without
hurting
the
saint
and
that
christ
was
with
him
too
ah
said
he
how
good
that
is
how
good
and
beautiful
is
all
gods
work
he
sat
musing
softly
and
sweetly
i
saw
he
understood
and
he
slept
beside
me
a
light
and
sinless
sleep
may
god
bless
youth
and
i
prayed
for
him
as
i
went
to
sleep
lord
send
peace
and
light
to
thy
people
chapter
ii
the
duel
c
recollections
of
father
zossimas
youth
before
he
became
a
monk
the
duel
i
spent
a
long
time
almost
eight
years
in
the
military
cadet
school
at
petersburg
and
in
the
novelty
of
my
surroundings
there
many
of
my
childish
impressions
grew
dimmer
though
i
forgot
nothing
i
picked
up
so
many
new
habits
and
opinions
that
i
was
transformed
into
a
cruel
absurd
almost
savage
creature
a
surface
polish
of
courtesy
and
society
manners
i
did
acquire
together
with
the
french
language
but
we
all
myself
included
looked
upon
the
soldiers
in
our
service
as
cattle
i
was
perhaps
worse
than
the
rest
in
that
respect
for
i
was
so
much
more
impressionable
than
my
companions
by
the
time
we
left
the
school
as
officers
we
were
ready
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
the
honor
of
the
regiment
but
no
one
of
us
had
any
knowledge
of
the
real
meaning
of
honor
and
if
any
one
had
known
it
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
ridicule
it
drunkenness
debauchery
and
devilry
were
what
we
almost
prided
ourselves
on
i
dont
say
that
we
were
bad
by
nature
all
these
young
men
were
good
fellows
but
they
behaved
badly
and
i
worst
of
all
what
made
it
worse
for
me
was
that
i
had
come
into
my
own
money
and
so
i
flung
myself
into
a
life
of
pleasure
and
plunged
headlong
into
all
the
recklessness
of
youth
i
was
fond
of
reading
yet
strange
to
say
the
bible
was
the
one
book
i
never
opened
at
that
time
though
i
always
carried
it
about
with
me
and
i
was
never
separated
from
it
in
very
truth
i
was
keeping
that
book
for
the
day
and
the
hour
for
the
month
and
the
year
though
i
knew
it
not
after
four
years
of
this
life
i
chanced
to
be
in
the
town
of
k
where
our
regiment
was
stationed
at
the
time
we
found
the
people
of
the
town
hospitable
rich
and
fond
of
entertainments
i
met
with
a
cordial
reception
everywhere
as
i
was
of
a
lively
temperament
and
was
known
to
be
well
off
which
always
goes
a
long
way
in
the
world
and
then
a
circumstance
happened
which
was
the
beginning
of
it
all
i
formed
an
attachment
to
a
beautiful
and
intelligent
young
girl
of
noble
and
lofty
character
the
daughter
of
people
much
respected
they
were
welltodo
people
of
influence
and
position
they
always
gave
me
a
cordial
and
friendly
reception
i
fancied
that
the
young
lady
looked
on
me
with
favor
and
my
heart
was
aflame
at
such
an
idea
later
on
i
saw
and
fully
realized
that
i
perhaps
was
not
so
passionately
in
love
with
her
at
all
but
only
recognized
the
elevation
of
her
mind
and
character
which
i
could
not
indeed
have
helped
doing
i
was
prevented
however
from
making
her
an
offer
at
the
time
by
my
selfishness
i
was
loath
to
part
with
the
allurements
of
my
free
and
licentious
bachelor
life
in
the
heyday
of
my
youth
and
with
my
pockets
full
of
money
i
did
drop
some
hint
as
to
my
feelings
however
though
i
put
off
taking
any
decisive
step
for
a
time
then
all
of
a
sudden
we
were
ordered
off
for
two
months
to
another
district
on
my
return
two
months
later
i
found
the
young
lady
already
married
to
a
rich
neighboring
landowner
a
very
amiable
man
still
young
though
older
than
i
was
connected
with
the
best
petersburg
society
which
i
was
not
and
of
excellent
education
which
i
also
was
not
i
was
so
overwhelmed
at
this
unexpected
circumstance
that
my
mind
was
positively
clouded
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
as
i
learned
then
the
young
landowner
had
been
a
long
while
betrothed
to
her
and
i
had
met
him
indeed
many
times
in
her
house
but
blinded
by
my
conceit
i
had
noticed
nothing
and
this
particularly
mortified
me
almost
everybody
had
known
all
about
it
while
i
knew
nothing
i
was
filled
with
sudden
irrepressible
fury
with
flushed
face
i
began
recalling
how
often
i
had
been
on
the
point
of
declaring
my
love
to
her
and
as
she
had
not
attempted
to
stop
me
or
to
warn
me
she
must
i
concluded
have
been
laughing
at
me
all
the
time
later
on
of
course
i
reflected
and
remembered
that
she
had
been
very
far
from
laughing
at
me
on
the
contrary
she
used
to
turn
off
any
lovemaking
on
my
part
with
a
jest
and
begin
talking
of
other
subjects
but
at
that
moment
i
was
incapable
of
reflecting
and
was
all
eagerness
for
revenge
i
am
surprised
to
remember
that
my
wrath
and
revengeful
feelings
were
extremely
repugnant
to
my
own
nature
for
being
of
an
easy
temper
i
found
it
difficult
to
be
angry
with
any
one
for
long
and
so
i
had
to
work
myself
up
artificially
and
became
at
last
revolting
and
absurd
i
waited
for
an
opportunity
and
succeeded
in
insulting
my
rival
in
the
presence
of
a
large
company
i
insulted
him
on
a
perfectly
extraneous
pretext
jeering
at
his
opinion
upon
an
important
public
eventit
was
in
the
year
18265and
my
jeer
was
so
people
said
clever
and
effective
then
i
forced
him
to
ask
for
an
explanation
and
behaved
so
rudely
that
he
accepted
my
challenge
in
spite
of
the
vast
inequality
between
us
as
i
was
younger
a
person
of
no
consequence
and
of
inferior
rank
i
learned
afterwards
for
a
fact
that
it
was
from
a
jealous
feeling
on
his
side
also
that
my
challenge
was
accepted
he
had
been
rather
jealous
of
me
on
his
wifes
account
before
their
marriage
he
fancied
now
that
if
he
submitted
to
be
insulted
by
me
and
refused
to
accept
my
challenge
and
if
she
heard
of
it
she
might
begin
to
despise
him
and
waver
in
her
love
for
him
i
soon
found
a
second
in
a
comrade
an
ensign
of
our
regiment
in
those
days
though
duels
were
severely
punished
yet
dueling
was
a
kind
of
fashion
among
the
officersso
strong
and
deeply
rooted
will
a
brutal
prejudice
sometimes
be
it
was
the
end
of
june
and
our
meeting
was
to
take
place
at
seven
oclock
the
next
day
on
the
outskirts
of
the
townand
then
something
happened
that
in
very
truth
was
the
turningpoint
of
my
life
in
the
evening
returning
home
in
a
savage
and
brutal
humor
i
flew
into
a
rage
with
my
orderly
afanasy
and
gave
him
two
blows
in
the
face
with
all
my
might
so
that
it
was
covered
with
blood
he
had
not
long
been
in
my
service
and
i
had
struck
him
before
but
never
with
such
ferocious
cruelty
and
believe
me
though
its
forty
years
ago
i
recall
it
now
with
shame
and
pain
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
for
about
three
hours
when
i
waked
up
the
day
was
breaking
i
got
upi
did
not
want
to
sleep
any
morei
went
to
the
windowopened
it
it
looked
out
upon
the
garden
i
saw
the
sun
rising
it
was
warm
and
beautiful
the
birds
were
singing
whats
the
meaning
of
it
i
thought
i
feel
in
my
heart
as
it
were
something
vile
and
shameful
is
it
because
i
am
going
to
shed
blood
no
i
thought
i
feel
its
not
that
can
it
be
that
i
am
afraid
of
death
afraid
of
being
killed
no
thats
not
it
thats
not
it
at
all
and
all
at
once
i
knew
what
it
was
it
was
because
i
had
beaten
afanasy
the
evening
before
it
all
rose
before
my
mind
it
all
was
as
it
were
repeated
over
again
he
stood
before
me
and
i
was
beating
him
straight
on
the
face
and
he
was
holding
his
arms
stiffly
down
his
head
erect
his
eyes
fixed
upon
me
as
though
on
parade
he
staggered
at
every
blow
and
did
not
even
dare
to
raise
his
hands
to
protect
himself
that
is
what
a
man
has
been
brought
to
and
that
was
a
man
beating
a
fellow
creature
what
a
crime
it
was
as
though
a
sharp
dagger
had
pierced
me
right
through
i
stood
as
if
i
were
struck
dumb
while
the
sun
was
shining
the
leaves
were
rejoicing
and
the
birds
were
trilling
the
praise
of
god
i
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
fell
on
my
bed
and
broke
into
a
storm
of
tears
and
then
i
remembered
my
brother
markel
and
what
he
said
on
his
deathbed
to
his
servants
my
dear
ones
why
do
you
wait
on
me
why
do
you
love
me
am
i
worth
your
waiting
on
me
yes
am
i
worth
it
flashed
through
my
mind
after
all
what
am
i
worth
that
another
man
a
fellow
creature
made
in
the
likeness
and
image
of
god
should
serve
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
this
question
forced
itself
upon
me
he
had
said
mother
my
little
heart
in
truth
we
are
each
responsible
to
all
for
all
its
only
that
men
dont
know
this
if
they
knew
it
the
world
would
be
a
paradise
at
once
god
can
that
too
be
false
i
thought
as
i
wept
in
truth
perhaps
i
am
more
than
all
others
responsible
for
all
a
greater
sinner
than
all
men
in
the
world
and
all
at
once
the
whole
truth
in
its
full
light
appeared
to
me
what
was
i
going
to
do
i
was
going
to
kill
a
good
clever
noble
man
who
had
done
me
no
wrong
and
by
depriving
his
wife
of
happiness
for
the
rest
of
her
life
i
should
be
torturing
and
killing
her
too
i
lay
thus
in
my
bed
with
my
face
in
the
pillow
heedless
how
the
time
was
passing
suddenly
my
second
the
ensign
came
in
with
the
pistols
to
fetch
me
ah
said
he
its
a
good
thing
you
are
up
already
its
time
we
were
off
come
along
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
hurried
to
and
fro
undecided
we
went
out
to
the
carriage
however
wait
here
a
minute
i
said
to
him
ill
be
back
directly
i
have
forgotten
my
purse
and
i
ran
back
alone
to
afanasys
little
room
afanasy
i
said
i
gave
you
two
blows
on
the
face
yesterday
forgive
me
i
said
he
started
as
though
he
were
frightened
and
looked
at
me
and
i
saw
that
it
was
not
enough
and
on
the
spot
in
my
full
officers
uniform
i
dropped
at
his
feet
and
bowed
my
head
to
the
ground
forgive
me
i
said
then
he
was
completely
aghast
your
honor

sir
what
are
you
doing
am
i
worth
it
and
he
burst
out
crying
as
i
had
done
before
hid
this
face
in
his
hands
turned
to
the
window
and
shook
all
over
with
his
sobs
i
flew
out
to
my
comrade
and
jumped
into
the
carriage
ready
i
cried
have
you
ever
seen
a
conqueror
i
asked
him
here
is
one
before
you
i
was
in
ecstasy
laughing
and
talking
all
the
way
i
dont
remember
what
about
he
looked
at
me
well
brother
you
are
a
plucky
fellow
youll
keep
up
the
honor
of
the
uniform
i
can
see
so
we
reached
the
place
and
found
them
there
waiting
us
we
were
placed
twelve
paces
apart
he
had
the
first
shot
i
stood
gayly
looking
him
full
in
the
face
i
did
not
twitch
an
eyelash
i
looked
lovingly
at
him
for
i
knew
what
i
would
do
his
shot
just
grazed
my
cheek
and
ear
thank
god
i
cried
no
man
has
been
killed
and
i
seized
my
pistol
turned
back
and
flung
it
far
away
into
the
wood
thats
the
place
for
you
i
cried
i
turned
to
my
adversary
forgive
me
young
fool
that
i
am
sir
i
said
for
my
unprovoked
insult
to
you
and
for
forcing
you
to
fire
at
me
i
am
ten
times
worse
than
you
and
more
maybe
tell
that
to
the
person
whom
you
hold
dearest
in
the
world
i
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
they
all
three
shouted
at
me
upon
my
word
cried
my
adversary
annoyed
if
you
did
not
want
to
fight
why
did
not
you
let
me
alone
yesterday
i
was
a
fool
today
i
know
better
i
answered
him
gayly
as
to
yesterday
i
believe
you
but
as
for
today
it
is
difficult
to
agree
with
your
opinion
said
he
bravo
i
cried
clapping
my
hands
i
agree
with
you
there
too
i
have
deserved
it
will
you
shoot
sir
or
not
no
i
wont
i
said
if
you
like
fire
at
me
again
but
it
would
be
better
for
you
not
to
fire
the
seconds
especially
mine
were
shouting
too
can
you
disgrace
the
regiment
like
this
facing
your
antagonist
and
begging
his
forgiveness
if
id
only
known
this
i
stood
facing
them
all
not
laughing
now
gentlemen
i
said
is
it
really
so
wonderful
in
these
days
to
find
a
man
who
can
repent
of
his
stupidity
and
publicly
confess
his
wrongdoing
but
not
in
a
duel
cried
my
second
again
thats
whats
so
strange
i
said
for
i
ought
to
have
owned
my
fault
as
soon
as
i
got
here
before
he
had
fired
a
shot
before
leading
him
into
a
great
and
deadly
sin
but
we
have
made
our
life
so
grotesque
that
to
act
in
that
way
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
only
after
i
have
faced
his
shot
at
the
distance
of
twelve
paces
could
my
words
have
any
significance
for
him
and
if
i
had
spoken
before
he
would
have
said
he
is
a
coward
the
sight
of
the
pistols
has
frightened
him
no
use
to
listen
to
him
gentlemen
i
cried
suddenly
speaking
straight
from
my
heart
look
around
you
at
the
gifts
of
god
the
clear
sky
the
pure
air
the
tender
grass
the
birds
nature
is
beautiful
and
sinless
and
we
only
we
are
sinful
and
foolish
and
we
dont
understand
that
life
is
heaven
for
we
have
only
to
understand
that
and
it
will
at
once
be
fulfilled
in
all
its
beauty
we
shall
embrace
each
other
and
weep
i
would
have
said
more
but
i
could
not
my
voice
broke
with
the
sweetness
and
youthful
gladness
of
it
and
there
was
such
bliss
in
my
heart
as
i
had
never
known
before
in
my
life
all
this
as
rational
and
edifying
said
my
antagonist
and
in
any
case
you
are
an
original
person
you
may
laugh
i
said
to
him
laughing
too
but
afterwards
you
will
approve
of
me
oh
i
am
ready
to
approve
of
you
now
said
he
will
you
shake
hands
for
i
believe
you
are
genuinely
sincere
no
i
said
not
now
later
on
when
i
have
grown
worthier
and
deserve
your
esteem
then
shake
hands
and
you
will
do
well
we
went
home
my
second
upbraiding
me
all
the
way
while
i
kissed
him
all
my
comrades
heard
of
the
affair
at
once
and
gathered
together
to
pass
judgment
on
me
the
same
day
he
has
disgraced
the
uniform
they
said
let
him
resign
his
commission
some
stood
up
for
me
he
faced
the
shot
they
said
yes
but
he
was
afraid
of
his
other
shot
and
begged
for
forgiveness
if
he
had
been
afraid
of
being
shot
he
would
have
shot
his
own
pistol
first
before
asking
forgiveness
while
he
flung
it
loaded
into
the
forest
no
theres
something
else
in
this
something
original
i
enjoyed
listening
and
looking
at
them
my
dear
friends
and
comrades
said
i
dont
worry
about
my
resigning
my
commission
for
i
have
done
so
already
i
have
sent
in
my
papers
this
morning
and
as
soon
as
i
get
my
discharge
i
shall
go
into
a
monasteryits
with
that
object
i
am
leaving
the
regiment
when
i
had
said
this
every
one
of
them
burst
out
laughing
you
should
have
told
us
of
that
first
that
explains
everything
we
cant
judge
a
monk
they
laughed
and
could
not
stop
themselves
and
not
scornfully
but
kindly
and
merrily
they
all
felt
friendly
to
me
at
once
even
those
who
had
been
sternest
in
their
censure
and
all
the
following
month
before
my
discharge
came
they
could
not
make
enough
of
me
ah
you
monk
they
would
say
and
every
one
said
something
kind
to
me
they
began
trying
to
dissuade
me
even
to
pity
me
what
are
you
doing
to
yourself
no
they
would
say
he
is
a
brave
fellow
he
faced
fire
and
could
have
fired
his
own
pistol
too
but
he
had
a
dream
the
night
before
that
he
should
become
a
monk
thats
why
he
did
it
it
was
the
same
thing
with
the
society
of
the
town
till
then
i
had
been
kindly
received
but
had
not
been
the
object
of
special
attention
and
now
all
came
to
know
me
at
once
and
invited
me
they
laughed
at
me
but
they
loved
me
i
may
mention
that
although
everybody
talked
openly
of
our
duel
the
authorities
took
no
notice
of
it
because
my
antagonist
was
a
near
relation
of
our
general
and
as
there
had
been
no
bloodshed
and
no
serious
consequences
and
as
i
resigned
my
commission
they
took
it
as
a
joke
and
i
began
then
to
speak
aloud
and
fearlessly
regardless
of
their
laughter
for
it
was
always
kindly
and
not
spiteful
laughter
these
conversations
mostly
took
place
in
the
evenings
in
the
company
of
ladies
women
particularly
liked
listening
to
me
then
and
they
made
the
men
listen
but
how
can
i
possibly
be
responsible
for
all
every
one
would
laugh
in
my
face
can
i
for
instance
be
responsible
for
you
you
may
well
not
know
it
i
would
answer
since
the
whole
world
has
long
been
going
on
a
different
line
since
we
consider
the
veriest
lies
as
truth
and
demand
the
same
lies
from
others
here
i
have
for
once
in
my
life
acted
sincerely
and
well
you
all
look
upon
me
as
a
madman
though
you
are
friendly
to
me
yet
you
see
you
all
laugh
at
me
but
how
can
we
help
being
friendly
to
you
said
my
hostess
laughing
the
room
was
full
of
people
all
of
a
sudden
the
young
lady
rose
on
whose
account
the
duel
had
been
fought
and
whom
only
lately
i
had
intended
to
be
my
future
wife
i
had
not
noticed
her
coming
into
the
room
she
got
up
came
to
me
and
held
out
her
hand
let
me
tell
you
she
said
that
i
am
the
first
not
to
laugh
at
you
but
on
the
contrary
i
thank
you
with
tears
and
express
my
respect
for
you
for
your
action
then
her
husband
too
came
up
and
then
they
all
approached
me
and
almost
kissed
me
my
heart
was
filled
with
joy
but
my
attention
was
especially
caught
by
a
middleaged
man
who
came
up
to
me
with
the
others
i
knew
him
by
name
already
but
had
never
made
his
acquaintance
nor
exchanged
a
word
with
him
till
that
evening
d
the
mysterious
visitor
he
had
long
been
an
official
in
the
town
he
was
in
a
prominent
position
respected
by
all
rich
and
had
a
reputation
for
benevolence
he
subscribed
considerable
sums
to
the
almshouse
and
the
orphan
asylum
he
was
very
charitable
too
in
secret
a
fact
which
only
became
known
after
his
death
he
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
almost
stern
in
appearance
and
not
much
given
to
conversation
he
had
been
married
about
ten
years
and
his
wife
who
was
still
young
had
borne
him
three
children
well
i
was
sitting
alone
in
my
room
the
following
evening
when
my
door
suddenly
opened
and
this
gentleman
walked
in
i
must
mention
by
the
way
that
i
was
no
longer
living
in
my
former
quarters
as
soon
as
i
resigned
my
commission
i
took
rooms
with
an
old
lady
the
widow
of
a
government
clerk
my
landladys
servant
waited
upon
me
for
i
had
moved
into
her
rooms
simply
because
on
my
return
from
the
duel
i
had
sent
afanasy
back
to
the
regiment
as
i
felt
ashamed
to
look
him
in
the
face
after
my
last
interview
with
him
so
prone
is
the
man
of
the
world
to
be
ashamed
of
any
righteous
action
i
have
said
my
visitor
with
great
interest
listened
to
you
speaking
in
different
houses
the
last
few
days
and
i
wanted
at
last
to
make
your
personal
acquaintance
so
as
to
talk
to
you
more
intimately
can
you
dear
sir
grant
me
this
favor
i
can
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
i
shall
look
upon
it
as
an
honor
i
said
this
though
i
felt
almost
dismayed
so
greatly
was
i
impressed
from
the
first
moment
by
the
appearance
of
this
man
for
though
other
people
had
listened
to
me
with
interest
and
attention
no
one
had
come
to
me
before
with
such
a
serious
stern
and
concentrated
expression
and
now
he
had
come
to
see
me
in
my
own
rooms
he
sat
down
you
are
i
see
a
man
of
great
strength
of
character
he
said
as
you
have
dared
to
serve
the
truth
even
when
by
doing
so
you
risked
incurring
the
contempt
of
all
your
praise
is
perhaps
excessive
i
replied
no
its
not
excessive
he
answered
believe
me
such
a
course
of
action
is
far
more
difficult
than
you
think
it
is
that
which
has
impressed
me
and
it
is
only
on
that
account
that
i
have
come
to
you
he
continued
tell
me
please
that
is
if
you
are
not
annoyed
by
my
perhaps
unseemly
curiosity
what
were
your
exact
sensations
if
you
can
recall
them
at
the
moment
when
you
made
up
your
mind
to
ask
forgiveness
at
the
duel
do
not
think
my
question
frivolous
on
the
contrary
i
have
in
asking
the
question
a
secret
motive
of
my
own
which
i
will
perhaps
explain
to
you
later
on
if
it
is
gods
will
that
we
should
become
more
intimately
acquainted
all
the
while
he
was
speaking
i
was
looking
at
him
straight
into
the
face
and
i
felt
all
at
once
a
complete
trust
in
him
and
great
curiosity
on
my
side
also
for
i
felt
that
there
was
some
strange
secret
in
his
soul
you
ask
what
were
my
exact
sensations
at
the
moment
when
i
asked
my
opponents
forgiveness
i
answered
but
i
had
better
tell
you
from
the
beginning
what
i
have
not
yet
told
any
one
else
and
i
described
all
that
had
passed
between
afanasy
and
me
and
how
i
had
bowed
down
to
the
ground
at
his
feet
from
that
you
can
see
for
yourself
i
concluded
that
at
the
time
of
the
duel
it
was
easier
for
me
for
i
had
made
a
beginning
already
at
home
and
when
once
i
had
started
on
that
road
to
go
farther
along
it
was
far
from
being
difficult
but
became
a
source
of
joy
and
happiness
i
liked
the
way
he
looked
at
me
as
he
listened
all
that
he
said
is
exceedingly
interesting
i
will
come
to
see
you
again
and
again
and
from
that
time
forth
he
came
to
see
me
nearly
every
evening
and
we
should
have
become
greater
friends
if
only
he
had
ever
talked
of
himself
but
about
himself
he
scarcely
ever
said
a
word
yet
continually
asked
me
about
myself
in
spite
of
that
i
became
very
fond
of
him
and
spoke
with
perfect
frankness
to
him
about
all
my
feelings
for
thought
i
what
need
have
i
to
know
his
secrets
since
i
can
see
without
that
that
he
is
a
good
man
moreover
though
he
is
such
a
serious
man
and
my
senior
he
comes
to
see
a
youngster
like
me
and
treats
me
as
his
equal
and
i
learned
a
great
deal
that
was
profitable
from
him
for
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
mind
that
life
is
heaven
he
said
to
me
suddenly
that
i
have
long
been
thinking
about
and
all
at
once
he
added
i
think
of
nothing
else
indeed
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
i
am
more
convinced
of
it
than
you
are
i
will
tell
you
later
why
i
listened
to
him
and
thought
that
he
evidently
wanted
to
tell
me
something
heaven
he
went
on
lies
hidden
within
all
of
ushere
it
lies
hidden
in
me
now
and
if
i
will
it
it
will
be
revealed
to
me
tomorrow
and
for
all
time
i
looked
at
him
he
was
speaking
with
great
emotion
and
gazing
mysteriously
at
me
as
if
he
were
questioning
me
and
that
we
are
all
responsible
to
all
for
all
apart
from
our
own
sins
you
were
quite
right
in
thinking
that
and
it
is
wonderful
how
you
could
comprehend
it
in
all
its
significance
at
once
and
in
very
truth
so
soon
as
men
understand
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
will
be
for
them
not
a
dream
but
a
living
reality
and
when
i
cried
out
to
him
bitterly
when
will
that
come
to
pass
and
will
it
ever
come
to
pass
is
not
it
simply
a
dream
of
ours
what
then
you
dont
believe
it
he
said
you
preach
it
and
dont
believe
it
yourself
believe
me
this
dream
as
you
call
it
will
come
to
pass
without
doubt
it
will
come
but
not
now
for
every
process
has
its
law
its
a
spiritual
psychological
process
to
transform
the
world
to
recreate
it
afresh
men
must
turn
into
another
path
psychologically
until
you
have
become
really
in
actual
fact
a
brother
to
every
one
brotherhood
will
not
come
to
pass
no
sort
of
scientific
teaching
no
kind
of
common
interest
will
ever
teach
men
to
share
property
and
privileges
with
equal
consideration
for
all
every
one
will
think
his
share
too
small
and
they
will
be
always
envying
complaining
and
attacking
one
another
you
ask
when
it
will
come
to
pass
it
will
come
to
pass
but
first
we
have
to
go
through
the
period
of
isolation
what
do
you
mean
by
isolation
i
asked
him
why
the
isolation
that
prevails
everywhere
above
all
in
our
ageit
has
not
fully
developed
it
has
not
reached
its
limit
yet
for
every
one
strives
to
keep
his
individuality
as
apart
as
possible
wishes
to
secure
the
greatest
possible
fullness
of
life
for
himself
but
meantime
all
his
efforts
result
not
in
attaining
fullness
of
life
but
selfdestruction
for
instead
of
selfrealization
he
ends
by
arriving
at
complete
solitude
all
mankind
in
our
age
have
split
up
into
units
they
all
keep
apart
each
in
his
own
groove
each
one
holds
aloof
hides
himself
and
hides
what
he
has
from
the
rest
and
he
ends
by
being
repelled
by
others
and
repelling
them
he
heaps
up
riches
by
himself
and
thinks
how
strong
i
am
now
and
how
secure
and
in
his
madness
he
does
not
understand
that
the
more
he
heaps
up
the
more
he
sinks
into
selfdestructive
impotence
for
he
is
accustomed
to
rely
upon
himself
alone
and
to
cut
himself
off
from
the
whole
he
has
trained
himself
not
to
believe
in
the
help
of
others
in
men
and
in
humanity
and
only
trembles
for
fear
he
should
lose
his
money
and
the
privileges
that
he
has
won
for
himself
everywhere
in
these
days
men
have
in
their
mockery
ceased
to
understand
that
the
true
security
is
to
be
found
in
social
solidarity
rather
than
in
isolated
individual
effort
but
this
terrible
individualism
must
inevitably
have
an
end
and
all
will
suddenly
understand
how
unnaturally
they
are
separated
from
one
another
it
will
be
the
spirit
of
the
time
and
people
will
marvel
that
they
have
sat
so
long
in
darkness
without
seeing
the
light
and
then
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
will
be
seen
in
the
heavens
but
until
then
we
must
keep
the
banner
flying
sometimes
even
if
he
has
to
do
it
alone
and
his
conduct
seems
to
be
crazy
a
man
must
set
an
example
and
so
draw
mens
souls
out
of
their
solitude
and
spur
them
to
some
act
of
brotherly
love
that
the
great
idea
may
not
die
our
evenings
one
after
another
were
spent
in
such
stirring
and
fervent
talk
i
gave
up
society
and
visited
my
neighbors
much
less
frequently
besides
my
vogue
was
somewhat
over
i
say
this
not
as
blame
for
they
still
loved
me
and
treated
me
goodhumoredly
but
theres
no
denying
that
fashion
is
a
great
power
in
society
i
began
to
regard
my
mysterious
visitor
with
admiration
for
besides
enjoying
his
intelligence
i
began
to
perceive
that
he
was
brooding
over
some
plan
in
his
heart
and
was
preparing
himself
perhaps
for
a
great
deed
perhaps
he
liked
my
not
showing
curiosity
about
his
secret
not
seeking
to
discover
it
by
direct
question
nor
by
insinuation
but
i
noticed
at
last
that
he
seemed
to
show
signs
of
wanting
to
tell
me
something
this
had
become
quite
evident
indeed
about
a
month
after
he
first
began
to
visit
me
do
you
know
he
said
to
me
once
that
people
are
very
inquisitive
about
us
in
the
town
and
wonder
why
i
come
to
see
you
so
often
but
let
them
wonder
for
soon
all
will
be
explained
sometimes
an
extraordinary
agitation
would
come
over
him
and
almost
always
on
such
occasions
he
would
get
up
and
go
away
sometimes
he
would
fix
a
long
piercing
look
upon
me
and
i
thought
he
will
say
something
directly
now
but
he
would
suddenly
begin
talking
of
something
ordinary
and
familiar
he
often
complained
of
headache
too
one
day
quite
unexpectedly
indeed
after
he
had
been
talking
with
great
fervor
a
long
time
i
saw
him
suddenly
turn
pale
and
his
face
worked
convulsively
while
he
stared
persistently
at
me
whats
the
matter
i
said
do
you
feel
illhe
had
just
been
complaining
of
headache
i

do
you
know

i
murdered
some
one
he
said
this
and
smiled
with
a
face
as
white
as
chalk
why
is
it
he
is
smiling
the
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
before
i
realized
anything
else
i
too
turned
pale
what
are
you
saying
i
cried
you
see
he
said
with
a
pale
smile
how
much
it
has
cost
me
to
say
the
first
word
now
i
have
said
it
i
feel
ive
taken
the
first
step
and
shall
go
on
for
a
long
while
i
could
not
believe
him
and
i
did
not
believe
him
at
that
time
but
only
after
he
had
been
to
see
me
three
days
running
and
told
me
all
about
it
i
thought
he
was
mad
but
ended
by
being
convinced
to
my
great
grief
and
amazement
his
crime
was
a
great
and
terrible
one
fourteen
years
before
he
had
murdered
the
widow
of
a
landowner
a
wealthy
and
handsome
young
woman
who
had
a
house
in
our
town
he
fell
passionately
in
love
with
her
declared
his
feeling
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
marry
him
but
she
had
already
given
her
heart
to
another
man
an
officer
of
noble
birth
and
high
rank
in
the
service
who
was
at
that
time
away
at
the
front
though
she
was
expecting
him
soon
to
return
she
refused
his
offer
and
begged
him
not
to
come
and
see
her
after
he
had
ceased
to
visit
her
he
took
advantage
of
his
knowledge
of
the
house
to
enter
at
night
through
the
garden
by
the
roof
at
great
risk
of
discovery
but
as
often
happens
a
crime
committed
with
extraordinary
audacity
is
more
successful
than
others
entering
the
garret
through
the
skylight
he
went
down
the
ladder
knowing
that
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
sometimes
through
the
negligence
of
the
servants
left
unlocked
he
hoped
to
find
it
so
and
so
it
was
he
made
his
way
in
the
dark
to
her
bedroom
where
a
light
was
burning
as
though
on
purpose
both
her
maids
had
gone
off
to
a
birthdayparty
in
the
same
street
without
asking
leave
the
other
servants
slept
in
the
servants
quarters
or
in
the
kitchen
on
the
groundfloor
his
passion
flamed
up
at
the
sight
of
her
asleep
and
then
vindictive
jealous
anger
took
possession
of
his
heart
and
like
a
drunken
man
beside
himself
he
thrust
a
knife
into
her
heart
so
that
she
did
not
even
cry
out
then
with
devilish
and
criminal
cunning
he
contrived
that
suspicion
should
fall
on
the
servants
he
was
so
base
as
to
take
her
purse
to
open
her
chest
with
keys
from
under
her
pillow
and
to
take
some
things
from
it
doing
it
all
as
it
might
have
been
done
by
an
ignorant
servant
leaving
valuable
papers
and
taking
only
money
he
took
some
of
the
larger
gold
things
but
left
smaller
articles
that
were
ten
times
as
valuable
he
took
with
him
too
some
things
for
himself
as
remembrances
but
of
that
later
having
done
this
awful
deed
he
returned
by
the
way
he
had
come
neither
the
next
day
when
the
alarm
was
raised
nor
at
any
time
after
in
his
life
did
any
one
dream
of
suspecting
that
he
was
the
criminal
no
one
indeed
knew
of
his
love
for
her
for
he
was
always
reserved
and
silent
and
had
no
friend
to
whom
he
would
have
opened
his
heart
he
was
looked
upon
simply
as
an
acquaintance
and
not
a
very
intimate
one
of
the
murdered
woman
as
for
the
previous
fortnight
he
had
not
even
visited
her
a
serf
of
hers
called
pyotr
was
at
once
suspected
and
every
circumstance
confirmed
the
suspicion
the
man
knewindeed
his
mistress
did
not
conceal
the
factthat
having
to
send
one
of
her
serfs
as
a
recruit
she
had
decided
to
send
him
as
he
had
no
relations
and
his
conduct
was
unsatisfactory
people
had
heard
him
angrily
threatening
to
murder
her
when
he
was
drunk
in
a
tavern
two
days
before
her
death
he
had
run
away
staying
no
one
knew
where
in
the
town
the
day
after
the
murder
he
was
found
on
the
road
leading
out
of
the
town
dead
drunk
with
a
knife
in
his
pocket
and
his
right
hand
happened
to
be
stained
with
blood
he
declared
that
his
nose
had
been
bleeding
but
no
one
believed
him
the
maids
confessed
that
they
had
gone
to
a
party
and
that
the
streetdoor
had
been
left
open
till
they
returned
and
a
number
of
similar
details
came
to
light
throwing
suspicion
on
the
innocent
servant
they
arrested
him
and
he
was
tried
for
the
murder
but
a
week
after
the
arrest
the
prisoner
fell
sick
of
a
fever
and
died
unconscious
in
the
hospital
there
the
matter
ended
and
the
judges
and
the
authorities
and
every
one
in
the
town
remained
convinced
that
the
crime
had
been
committed
by
no
one
but
the
servant
who
had
died
in
the
hospital
and
after
that
the
punishment
began
my
mysterious
visitor
now
my
friend
told
me
that
at
first
he
was
not
in
the
least
troubled
by
pangs
of
conscience
he
was
miserable
a
long
time
but
not
for
that
reason
only
from
regret
that
he
had
killed
the
woman
he
loved
that
she
was
no
more
that
in
killing
her
he
had
killed
his
love
while
the
fire
of
passion
was
still
in
his
veins
but
of
the
innocent
blood
he
had
shed
of
the
murder
of
a
fellow
creature
he
scarcely
thought
the
thought
that
his
victim
might
have
become
the
wife
of
another
man
was
insupportable
to
him
and
so
for
a
long
time
he
was
convinced
in
his
conscience
that
he
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
at
first
he
was
worried
at
the
arrest
of
the
servant
but
his
illness
and
death
soon
set
his
mind
at
rest
for
the
mans
death
was
apparently
so
he
reflected
at
the
time
not
owing
to
his
arrest
or
his
fright
but
a
chill
he
had
taken
on
the
day
he
ran
away
when
he
had
lain
all
night
dead
drunk
on
the
damp
ground
the
theft
of
the
money
and
other
things
troubled
him
little
for
he
argued
that
the
theft
had
not
been
committed
for
gain
but
to
avert
suspicion
the
sum
stolen
was
small
and
he
shortly
afterwards
subscribed
the
whole
of
it
and
much
more
towards
the
funds
for
maintaining
an
almshouse
in
the
town
he
did
this
on
purpose
to
set
his
conscience
at
rest
about
the
theft
and
its
a
remarkable
fact
that
for
a
long
time
he
really
was
at
peacehe
told
me
this
himself
he
entered
then
upon
a
career
of
great
activity
in
the
service
volunteered
for
a
difficult
and
laborious
duty
which
occupied
him
two
years
and
being
a
man
of
strong
will
almost
forgot
the
past
whenever
he
recalled
it
he
tried
not
to
think
of
it
at
all
he
became
active
in
philanthropy
too
founded
and
helped
to
maintain
many
institutions
in
the
town
did
a
good
deal
in
the
two
capitals
and
in
both
moscow
and
petersburg
was
elected
a
member
of
philanthropic
societies
at
last
however
he
began
brooding
over
the
past
and
the
strain
of
it
was
too
much
for
him
then
he
was
attracted
by
a
fine
and
intelligent
girl
and
soon
after
married
her
hoping
that
marriage
would
dispel
his
lonely
depression
and
that
by
entering
on
a
new
life
and
scrupulously
doing
his
duty
to
his
wife
and
children
he
would
escape
from
old
memories
altogether
but
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
expected
happened
he
began
even
in
the
first
month
of
his
marriage
to
be
continually
fretted
by
the
thought
my
wife
loves
mebut
what
if
she
knew
when
she
first
told
him
that
she
would
soon
bear
him
a
child
he
was
troubled
i
am
giving
life
but
i
have
taken
life
children
came
how
dare
i
love
them
teach
and
educate
them
how
can
i
talk
to
them
of
virtue
i
have
shed
blood
they
were
splendid
children
he
longed
to
caress
them
and
i
cant
look
at
their
innocent
candid
faces
i
am
unworthy
at
last
he
began
to
be
bitterly
and
ominously
haunted
by
the
blood
of
his
murdered
victim
by
the
young
life
he
had
destroyed
by
the
blood
that
cried
out
for
vengeance
he
had
begun
to
have
awful
dreams
but
being
a
man
of
fortitude
he
bore
his
suffering
a
long
time
thinking
i
shall
expiate
everything
by
this
secret
agony
but
that
hope
too
was
vain
the
longer
it
went
on
the
more
intense
was
his
suffering
he
was
respected
in
society
for
his
active
benevolence
though
every
one
was
overawed
by
his
stern
and
gloomy
character
but
the
more
he
was
respected
the
more
intolerable
it
was
for
him
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
thoughts
of
killing
himself
but
he
began
to
be
haunted
by
another
ideaan
idea
which
he
had
at
first
regarded
as
impossible
and
unthinkable
though
at
last
it
got
such
a
hold
on
his
heart
that
he
could
not
shake
it
off
he
dreamed
of
rising
up
going
out
and
confessing
in
the
face
of
all
men
that
he
had
committed
murder
for
three
years
this
dream
had
pursued
him
haunting
him
in
different
forms
at
last
he
believed
with
his
whole
heart
that
if
he
confessed
his
crime
he
would
heal
his
soul
and
would
be
at
peace
for
ever
but
this
belief
filled
his
heart
with
terror
for
how
could
he
carry
it
out
and
then
came
what
happened
at
my
duel
looking
at
you
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
looked
at
him
is
it
possible
i
cried
clasping
my
hands
that
such
a
trivial
incident
could
give
rise
to
such
a
resolution
in
you
my
resolution
has
been
growing
for
the
last
three
years
he
answered
and
your
story
only
gave
the
last
touch
to
it
looking
at
you
i
reproached
myself
and
envied
you
he
said
this
to
me
almost
sullenly
but
you
wont
be
believed
i
observed
its
fourteen
years
ago
i
have
proofs
great
proofs
i
shall
show
them
then
i
cried
and
kissed
him
tell
me
one
thing
one
thing
he
said
as
though
it
all
depended
upon
me
my
wife
my
children
my
wife
may
die
of
grief
and
though
my
children
wont
lose
their
rank
and
property
theyll
be
a
convicts
children
and
for
ever
and
what
a
memory
what
a
memory
of
me
i
shall
leave
in
their
hearts
i
said
nothing
and
to
part
from
them
to
leave
them
for
ever
its
for
ever
you
know
for
ever
i
sat
still
and
repeated
a
silent
prayer
i
got
up
at
last
i
felt
afraid
well
he
looked
at
me
go
said
i
confess
everything
passes
only
the
truth
remains
your
children
will
understand
when
they
grow
up
the
nobility
of
your
resolution
he
left
me
that
time
as
though
he
had
made
up
his
mind
yet
for
more
than
a
fortnight
afterwards
he
came
to
me
every
evening
still
preparing
himself
still
unable
to
bring
himself
to
the
point
he
made
my
heart
ache
one
day
he
would
come
determined
and
say
fervently
i
know
it
will
be
heaven
for
me
heaven
the
moment
i
confess
fourteen
years
ive
been
in
hell
i
want
to
suffer
i
will
take
my
punishment
and
begin
to
live
you
can
pass
through
the
world
doing
wrong
but
theres
no
turning
back
now
i
dare
not
love
my
neighbor
nor
even
my
own
children
good
god
my
children
will
understand
perhaps
what
my
punishment
has
cost
me
and
will
not
condemn
me
god
is
not
in
strength
but
in
truth
all
will
understand
your
sacrifice
i
said
to
him
if
not
at
once
they
will
understand
later
for
you
have
served
truth
the
higher
truth
not
of
the
earth
and
he
would
go
away
seeming
comforted
but
next
day
he
would
come
again
bitter
pale
sarcastic
every
time
i
come
to
you
you
look
at
me
so
inquisitively
as
though
to
say
he
has
still
not
confessed
wait
a
bit
dont
despise
me
too
much
its
not
such
an
easy
thing
to
do
as
you
would
think
perhaps
i
shall
not
do
it
at
all

wont
go
and
inform
against
me
then
will
you
and
far
from
looking
at
him
with
indiscreet
curiosity
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
him
at
all
i
was
quite
ill
from
anxiety
and
my
heart
was
full
of
tears
i
could
not
sleep
at
night
i
have
just
come
from
my
wife
he
went
on
do
you
understand
what
the
word
wife
means
when
i
went
out
the
children

magazine

us

you
dont
understand
that
no
one
is
wise
from
another
mans
woe
his
eyes
were
glittering
his
lips
were
twitching
suddenly
he
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
so
that
everything
on
it
dancedit
was
the
first
time
he
had
done
such
a
thing
he
was
such
a
mild
man
but
need
i
he
exclaimed
must
i
no
one
has
been
condemned
no
one
has
been
sent
to
siberia
in
my
place
the
man
died
of
fever
and
ive
been
punished
by
my
sufferings
for
the
blood
i
shed
and
i
shant
be
believed
they
wont
believe
my
proofs
need
i
confess
need
i
i
am
ready
to
go
on
suffering
all
my
life
for
the
blood
i
have
shed
if
only
my
wife
and
children

be
spared
will
it
be
just
to
ruin
them
with
me
arent
we
making
a
mistake
what
is
right
in
this
case
and
will
people
recognize
it
will
they
appreciate
it
will
they
respect
it
good
lord
i
thought
to
myself
he
is
thinking
of
other
peoples
respect
at
such
a
moment
and
i
felt
so
sorry
for
him
then
that
i
believe
i
would
have
shared
his
fate
if
it
could
have
comforted
him
i
saw
he
was
beside
himself
i
was
aghast
realizing
with
my
heart
as
well
as
my
mind
what
such
a
resolution
meant
decide
my
fate
he
exclaimed
again
go
and
confess
i
whispered
to
him
my
voice
failed
me
but
i
whispered
it
firmly
i
took
up
the
new
testament
from
the
table
the
russian
translation
and
showed
him
the
gospel
of
st
john
chapter
xii
verse
24
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
except
a
corn
of
wheat
fall
into
the
ground
and
die
it
abideth
alone
but
if
it
die
it
bringeth
forth
much
fruit
i
had
just
been
reading
that
verse
when
he
came
in
he
read
it
thats
true
he
said
but
he
smiled
bitterly
its
terrible
the
things
you
find
in
those
books
he
said
after
a
pause
its
easy
enough
to
thrust
them
upon
one
and
who
wrote
them
can
they
have
been
written
by
men
the
holy
spirit
wrote
them
said
i
its
easy
for
you
to
prate
he
smiled
again
this
time
almost
with
hatred
i
took
the
book
again
opened
it
in
another
place
and
showed
him
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
chapter
x
verse
31
he
read
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
god
he
read
it
and
simply
flung
down
the
book
he
was
trembling
all
over
an
awful
text
he
said
theres
no
denying
youve
picked
out
fitting
ones
he
rose
from
the
chair
well
he
said
goodby
perhaps
i
shant
come
again

we
shall
meet
in
heaven
so
i
have
been
for
fourteen
years
in
the
hands
of
the
living
god
thats
how
one
must
think
of
those
fourteen
years
tomorrow
i
will
beseech
those
hands
to
let
me
go
i
wanted
to
take
him
in
my
arms
and
kiss
him
but
i
did
not
darehis
face
was
contorted
and
somber
he
went
away
good
god
i
thought
what
has
he
gone
to
face
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
the
ikon
and
wept
for
him
before
the
holy
mother
of
god
our
swift
defender
and
helper
i
was
half
an
hour
praying
in
tears
and
it
was
late
about
midnight
suddenly
i
saw
the
door
open
and
he
came
in
again
i
was
surprised
where
have
you
been
i
asked
him
i
think
he
said
ive
forgotten
something

my
handkerchief
i
think
well
even
if
ive
not
forgotten
anything
let
me
stay
a
little
he
sat
down
i
stood
over
him
you
sit
down
too
said
he
i
sat
down
we
sat
still
for
two
minutes
he
looked
intently
at
me
and
suddenly
smiledi
remembered
thatthen
he
got
up
embraced
me
warmly
and
kissed
me
remember
he
said
how
i
came
to
you
a
second
time
do
you
hear
remember
it
and
he
went
out
tomorrow
i
thought
and
so
it
was
i
did
not
know
that
evening
that
the
next
day
was
his
birthday
i
had
not
been
out
for
the
last
few
days
so
i
had
no
chance
of
hearing
it
from
any
one
on
that
day
he
always
had
a
great
gathering
every
one
in
the
town
went
to
it
it
was
the
same
this
time
after
dinner
he
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
paper
in
his
handa
formal
declaration
to
the
chief
of
his
department
who
was
present
this
declaration
he
read
aloud
to
the
whole
assembly
it
contained
a
full
account
of
the
crime
in
every
detail
i
cut
myself
off
from
men
as
a
monster
god
has
visited
me
he
said
in
conclusion
i
want
to
suffer
for
my
sin
then
he
brought
out
and
laid
on
the
table
all
the
things
he
had
been
keeping
for
fourteen
years
that
he
thought
would
prove
his
crime
the
jewels
belonging
to
the
murdered
woman
which
he
had
stolen
to
divert
suspicion
a
cross
and
a
locket
taken
from
her
neck
with
a
portrait
of
her
betrothed
in
the
locket
her
notebook
and
two
letters
one
from
her
betrothed
telling
her
that
he
would
soon
be
with
her
and
her
unfinished
answer
left
on
the
table
to
be
sent
off
next
day
he
carried
off
these
two
letterswhat
for
why
had
he
kept
them
for
fourteen
years
afterwards
instead
of
destroying
them
as
evidence
against
him
and
this
is
what
happened
every
one
was
amazed
and
horrified
every
one
refused
to
believe
it
and
thought
that
he
was
deranged
though
all
listened
with
intense
curiosity
a
few
days
later
it
was
fully
decided
and
agreed
in
every
house
that
the
unhappy
man
was
mad
the
legal
authorities
could
not
refuse
to
take
the
case
up
but
they
too
dropped
it
though
the
trinkets
and
letters
made
them
ponder
they
decided
that
even
if
they
did
turn
out
to
be
authentic
no
charge
could
be
based
on
those
alone
besides
she
might
have
given
him
those
things
as
a
friend
or
asked
him
to
take
care
of
them
for
her
i
heard
afterwards
however
that
the
genuineness
of
the
things
was
proved
by
the
friends
and
relations
of
the
murdered
woman
and
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
them
yet
nothing
was
destined
to
come
of
it
after
all
five
days
later
all
had
heard
that
he
was
ill
and
that
his
life
was
in
danger
the
nature
of
his
illness
i
cant
explain
they
said
it
was
an
affection
of
the
heart
but
it
became
known
that
the
doctors
had
been
induced
by
his
wife
to
investigate
his
mental
condition
also
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
case
of
insanity
i
betrayed
nothing
though
people
ran
to
question
me
but
when
i
wanted
to
visit
him
i
was
for
a
long
while
forbidden
to
do
so
above
all
by
his
wife
its
you
who
have
caused
his
illness
she
said
to
me
he
was
always
gloomy
but
for
the
last
year
people
noticed
that
he
was
peculiarly
excited
and
did
strange
things
and
now
you
have
been
the
ruin
of
him
your
preaching
has
brought
him
to
this
for
the
last
month
he
was
always
with
you
indeed
not
only
his
wife
but
the
whole
town
were
down
upon
me
and
blamed
me
its
all
your
doing
they
said
i
was
silent
and
indeed
rejoiced
at
heart
for
i
saw
plainly
gods
mercy
to
the
man
who
had
turned
against
himself
and
punished
himself
i
could
not
believe
in
his
insanity
they
let
me
see
him
at
last
he
insisted
upon
saying
goodby
to
me
i
went
in
to
him
and
saw
at
once
that
not
only
his
days
but
his
hours
were
numbered
he
was
weak
yellow
his
hands
trembled
he
gasped
for
breath
but
his
face
was
full
of
tender
and
happy
feeling
it
is
done
he
said
ive
long
been
yearning
to
see
you
why
didnt
you
come
i
did
not
tell
him
that
they
would
not
let
me
see
him
god
has
had
pity
on
me
and
is
calling
me
to
himself
i
know
i
am
dying
but
i
feel
joy
and
peace
for
the
first
time
after
so
many
years
there
was
heaven
in
my
heart
from
the
moment
i
had
done
what
i
had
to
do
now
i
dare
to
love
my
children
and
to
kiss
them
neither
my
wife
nor
the
judges
nor
any
one
has
believed
it
my
children
will
never
believe
it
either
i
see
in
that
gods
mercy
to
them
i
shall
die
and
my
name
will
be
without
a
stain
for
them
and
now
i
feel
god
near
my
heart
rejoices
as
in
heaven

i
have
done
my
duty
he
could
not
speak
he
gasped
for
breath
he
pressed
my
hand
warmly
looking
fervently
at
me
we
did
not
talk
for
long
his
wife
kept
peeping
in
at
us
but
he
had
time
to
whisper
to
me
do
you
remember
how
i
came
back
to
you
that
second
time
at
midnight
i
told
you
to
remember
it
you
know
what
i
came
back
for
i
came
to
kill
you
i
started
i
went
out
from
you
then
into
the
darkness
i
wandered
about
the
streets
struggling
with
myself
and
suddenly
i
hated
you
so
that
i
could
hardly
bear
it
now
i
thought
he
is
all
that
binds
me
and
he
is
my
judge
i
cant
refuse
to
face
my
punishment
tomorrow
for
he
knows
all
it
was
not
that
i
was
afraid
you
would
betray
me
i
never
even
thought
of
that
but
i
thought
how
can
i
look
him
in
the
face
if
i
dont
confess
and
if
you
had
been
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
but
alive
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
the
thought
was
unendurable
that
you
were
alive
knowing
everything
and
condemning
me
i
hated
you
as
though
you
were
the
cause
as
though
you
were
to
blame
for
everything
i
came
back
to
you
then
remembering
that
you
had
a
dagger
lying
on
your
table
i
sat
down
and
asked
you
to
sit
down
and
for
a
whole
minute
i
pondered
if
i
had
killed
you
i
should
have
been
ruined
by
that
murder
even
if
i
had
not
confessed
the
other
but
i
didnt
think
about
that
at
all
and
i
didnt
want
to
think
of
it
at
that
moment
i
only
hated
you
and
longed
to
revenge
myself
on
you
for
everything
the
lord
vanquished
the
devil
in
my
heart
but
let
me
tell
you
you
were
never
nearer
death
a
week
later
he
died
the
whole
town
followed
him
to
the
grave
the
chief
priest
made
a
speech
full
of
feeling
all
lamented
the
terrible
illness
that
had
cut
short
his
days
but
all
the
town
was
up
in
arms
against
me
after
the
funeral
and
people
even
refused
to
see
me
some
at
first
a
few
and
afterwards
more
began
indeed
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
his
story
and
they
visited
me
and
questioned
me
with
great
interest
and
eagerness
for
man
loves
to
see
the
downfall
and
disgrace
of
the
righteous
but
i
held
my
tongue
and
very
shortly
after
i
left
the
town
and
five
months
later
by
gods
grace
i
entered
upon
the
safe
and
blessed
path
praising
the
unseen
finger
which
had
guided
me
so
clearly
to
it
but
i
remember
in
my
prayer
to
this
day
the
servant
of
god
mihail
who
suffered
so
greatly

of
father
zossima
e
the
russian
monk
and
his
possible
significance
fathers
and
teachers
what
is
the
monk
in
the
cultivated
world
the
word
is
nowadays
pronounced
by
some
people
with
a
jeer
and
by
others
it
is
used
as
a
term
of
abuse
and
this
contempt
for
the
monk
is
growing
it
is
true
alas
it
is
true
that
there
are
many
sluggards
gluttons
profligates
and
insolent
beggars
among
monks
educated
people
point
to
these
you
are
idlers
useless
members
of
society
you
live
on
the
labor
of
others
you
are
shameless
beggars
and
yet
how
many
meek
and
humble
monks
there
are
yearning
for
solitude
and
fervent
prayer
in
peace
these
are
less
noticed
or
passed
over
in
silence
and
how
surprised
men
would
be
if
i
were
to
say
that
from
these
meek
monks
who
yearn
for
solitary
prayer
the
salvation
of
russia
will
come
perhaps
once
more
for
they
are
in
truth
made
ready
in
peace
and
quiet
for
the
day
and
the
hour
the
month
and
the
year
meanwhile
in
their
solitude
they
keep
the
image
of
christ
fair
and
undefiled
in
the
purity
of
gods
truth
from
the
times
of
the
fathers
of
old
the
apostles
and
the
martyrs
and
when
the
time
comes
they
will
show
it
to
the
tottering
creeds
of
the
world
that
is
a
great
thought
that
star
will
rise
out
of
the
east
that
is
my
view
of
the
monk
and
is
it
false
is
it
too
proud
look
at
the
worldly
and
all
who
set
themselves
up
above
the
people
of
god
has
not
gods
image
and
his
truth
been
distorted
in
them
they
have
science
but
in
science
there
is
nothing
but
what
is
the
object
of
sense
the
spiritual
world
the
higher
part
of
mans
being
is
rejected
altogether
dismissed
with
a
sort
of
triumph
even
with
hatred
the
world
has
proclaimed
the
reign
of
freedom
especially
of
late
but
what
do
we
see
in
this
freedom
of
theirs
nothing
but
slavery
and
selfdestruction
for
the
world
says
you
have
desires
and
so
satisfy
them
for
you
have
the
same
rights
as
the
most
rich
and
powerful
dont
be
afraid
of
satisfying
them
and
even
multiply
your
desires
that
is
the
modern
doctrine
of
the
world
in
that
they
see
freedom
and
what
follows
from
this
right
of
multiplication
of
desires
in
the
rich
isolation
and
spiritual
suicide
in
the
poor
envy
and
murder
for
they
have
been
given
rights
but
have
not
been
shown
the
means
of
satisfying
their
wants
they
maintain
that
the
world
is
getting
more
and
more
united
more
and
more
bound
together
in
brotherly
community
as
it
overcomes
distance
and
sets
thoughts
flying
through
the
air
alas
put
no
faith
in
such
a
bond
of
union
interpreting
freedom
as
the
multiplication
and
rapid
satisfaction
of
desires
men
distort
their
own
nature
for
many
senseless
and
foolish
desires
and
habits
and
ridiculous
fancies
are
fostered
in
them
they
live
only
for
mutual
envy
for
luxury
and
ostentation
to
have
dinners
visits
carriages
rank
and
slaves
to
wait
on
one
is
looked
upon
as
a
necessity
for
which
life
honor
and
human
feeling
are
sacrificed
and
men
even
commit
suicide
if
they
are
unable
to
satisfy
it
we
see
the
same
thing
among
those
who
are
not
rich
while
the
poor
drown
their
unsatisfied
need
and
their
envy
in
drunkenness
but
soon
they
will
drink
blood
instead
of
wine
they
are
being
led
on
to
it
i
ask
you
is
such
a
man
free
i
knew
one
champion
of
freedom
who
told
me
himself
that
when
he
was
deprived
of
tobacco
in
prison
he
was
so
wretched
at
the
privation
that
he
almost
went
and
betrayed
his
cause
for
the
sake
of
getting
tobacco
again
and
such
a
man
says
i
am
fighting
for
the
cause
of
humanity
how
can
such
a
one
fight
what
is
he
fit
for
he
is
capable
perhaps
of
some
action
quickly
over
but
he
cannot
hold
out
long
and
its
no
wonder
that
instead
of
gaining
freedom
they
have
sunk
into
slavery
and
instead
of
serving
the
cause
of
brotherly
love
and
the
union
of
humanity
have
fallen
on
the
contrary
into
dissension
and
isolation
as
my
mysterious
visitor
and
teacher
said
to
me
in
my
youth
and
therefore
the
idea
of
the
service
of
humanity
of
brotherly
love
and
the
solidarity
of
mankind
is
more
and
more
dying
out
in
the
world
and
indeed
this
idea
is
sometimes
treated
with
derision
for
how
can
a
man
shake
off
his
habits
what
can
become
of
him
if
he
is
in
such
bondage
to
the
habit
of
satisfying
the
innumerable
desires
he
has
created
for
himself
he
is
isolated
and
what
concern
has
he
with
the
rest
of
humanity
they
have
succeeded
in
accumulating
a
greater
mass
of
objects
but
the
joy
in
the
world
has
grown
less
the
monastic
way
is
very
different
obedience
fasting
and
prayer
are
laughed
at
yet
only
through
them
lies
the
way
to
real
true
freedom
i
cut
off
my
superfluous
and
unnecessary
desires
i
subdue
my
proud
and
wanton
will
and
chastise
it
with
obedience
and
with
gods
help
i
attain
freedom
of
spirit
and
with
it
spiritual
joy
which
is
most
capable
of
conceiving
a
great
idea
and
serving
itthe
rich
man
in
his
isolation
or
the
man
who
has
freed
himself
from
the
tyranny
of
material
things
and
habits
the
monk
is
reproached
for
his
solitude
you
have
secluded
yourself
within
the
walls
of
the
monastery
for
your
own
salvation
and
have
forgotten
the
brotherly
service
of
humanity
but
we
shall
see
which
will
be
most
zealous
in
the
cause
of
brotherly
love
for
it
is
not
we
but
they
who
are
in
isolation
though
they
dont
see
that
of
old
leaders
of
the
people
came
from
among
us
and
why
should
they
not
again
the
same
meek
and
humble
ascetics
will
rise
up
and
go
out
to
work
for
the
great
cause
the
salvation
of
russia
comes
from
the
people
and
the
russian
monk
has
always
been
on
the
side
of
the
people
we
are
isolated
only
if
the
people
are
isolated
the
people
believe
as
we
do
and
an
unbelieving
reformer
will
never
do
anything
in
russia
even
if
he
is
sincere
in
heart
and
a
genius
remember
that
the
people
will
meet
the
atheist
and
overcome
him
and
russia
will
be
one
and
orthodox
take
care
of
the
peasant
and
guard
his
heart
go
on
educating
him
quietly
thats
your
duty
as
monks
for
the
peasant
has
god
in
his
heart
f
of
masters
and
servants
and
of
whether
it
is
possible
for
them
to
be
brothers
in
the
spirit
of
course
i
dont
deny
that
there
is
sin
in
the
peasants
too
and
the
fire
of
corruption
is
spreading
visibly
hourly
working
from
above
downwards
the
spirit
of
isolation
is
coming
upon
the
people
too
money
lenders
and
devourers
of
the
commune
are
rising
up
already
the
merchant
grows
more
and
more
eager
for
rank
and
strives
to
show
himself
cultured
though
he
has
not
a
trace
of
culture
and
to
this
end
meanly
despises
his
old
traditions
and
is
even
ashamed
of
the
faith
of
his
fathers
he
visits
princes
though
he
is
only
a
peasant
corrupted
the
peasants
are
rotting
in
drunkenness
and
cannot
shake
off
the
habit
and
what
cruelty
to
their
wives
to
their
children
even
all
from
drunkenness
ive
seen
in
the
factories
children
of
nine
years
old
frail
rickety
bent
and
already
depraved
the
stuffy
workshop
the
din
of
machinery
work
all
day
long
the
vile
language
and
the
drink
the
drinkis
that
what
a
little
childs
heart
needs
he
needs
sunshine
childish
play
good
examples
all
about
him
and
at
least
a
little
love
there
must
be
no
more
of
this
monks
no
more
torturing
of
children
rise
up
and
preach
that
make
haste
make
haste
but
god
will
save
russia
for
though
the
peasants
are
corrupted
and
cannot
renounce
their
filthy
sin
yet
they
know
it
is
cursed
by
god
and
that
they
do
wrong
in
sinning
so
that
our
people
still
believe
in
righteousness
have
faith
in
god
and
weep
tears
of
devotion
it
is
different
with
the
upper
classes
they
following
science
want
to
base
justice
on
reason
alone
but
not
with
christ
as
before
and
they
have
already
proclaimed
that
there
is
no
crime
that
there
is
no
sin
and
thats
consistent
for
if
you
have
no
god
what
is
the
meaning
of
crime
in
europe
the
people
are
already
rising
up
against
the
rich
with
violence
and
the
leaders
of
the
people
are
everywhere
leading
them
to
bloodshed
and
teaching
them
that
their
wrath
is
righteous
but
their
wrath
is
accursed
for
it
is
cruel
but
god
will
save
russia
as
he
has
saved
her
many
times
salvation
will
come
from
the
people
from
their
faith
and
their
meekness
fathers
and
teachers
watch
over
the
peoples
faith
and
this
will
not
be
a
dream
ive
been
struck
all
my
life
in
our
great
people
by
their
dignity
their
true
and
seemly
dignity
ive
seen
it
myself
i
can
testify
to
it
ive
seen
it
and
marveled
at
it
ive
seen
it
in
spite
of
the
degraded
sins
and
povertystricken
appearance
of
our
peasantry
they
are
not
servile
and
even
after
two
centuries
of
serfdom
they
are
free
in
manner
and
bearing
yet
without
insolence
and
not
revengeful
and
not
envious
you
are
rich
and
noble
you
are
clever
and
talented
well
be
so
god
bless
you
i
respect
you
but
i
know
that
i
too
am
a
man
by
the
very
fact
that
i
respect
you
without
envy
i
prove
my
dignity
as
a
man
in
truth
if
they
dont
say
this
for
they
dont
know
how
to
say
this
yet
that
is
how
they
act
i
have
seen
it
myself
i
have
known
it
myself
and
would
you
believe
it
the
poorer
our
russian
peasant
is
the
more
noticeable
is
that
serene
goodness
for
the
rich
among
them
are
for
the
most
part
corrupted
already
and
much
of
that
is
due
to
our
carelessness
and
indifference
but
god
will
save
his
people
for
russia
is
great
in
her
humility
i
dream
of
seeing
and
seem
to
see
clearly
already
our
future
it
will
come
to
pass
that
even
the
most
corrupt
of
our
rich
will
end
by
being
ashamed
of
his
riches
before
the
poor
and
the
poor
seeing
his
humility
will
understand
and
give
way
before
him
will
respond
joyfully
and
kindly
to
his
honorable
shame
believe
me
that
it
will
end
in
that
things
are
moving
to
that
equality
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
spiritual
dignity
of
man
and
that
will
only
be
understood
among
us
if
we
were
brothers
there
would
be
fraternity
but
before
that
they
will
never
agree
about
the
division
of
wealth
we
preserve
the
image
of
christ
and
it
will
shine
forth
like
a
precious
diamond
to
the
whole
world
so
may
it
be
so
may
it
be
fathers
and
teachers
a
touching
incident
befell
me
once
in
my
wanderings
i
met
in
the
town
of
k
my
old
orderly
afanasy
it
was
eight
years
since
i
had
parted
from
him
he
chanced
to
see
me
in
the
marketplace
recognized
me
ran
up
to
me
and
how
delighted
he
was
he
simply
pounced
on
me
master
dear
is
it
you
is
it
really
you
i
see
he
took
me
home
with
him
he
was
no
longer
in
the
army
he
was
married
and
already
had
two
little
children
he
and
his
wife
earned
their
living
as
costermongers
in
the
marketplace
his
room
was
poor
but
bright
and
clean
he
made
me
sit
down
set
the
samovar
sent
for
his
wife
as
though
my
appearance
were
a
festival
for
them
he
brought
me
his
children
bless
them
father
is
it
for
me
to
bless
them
i
am
only
a
humble
monk
i
will
pray
for
them
and
for
you
afanasy
pavlovitch
i
have
prayed
every
day
since
that
day
for
it
all
came
from
you
said
i
and
i
explained
that
to
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
what
do
you
think
the
man
kept
gazing
at
me
and
could
not
believe
that
i
his
former
master
an
officer
was
now
before
him
in
such
a
guise
and
position
it
made
him
shed
tears
why
are
you
weeping
said
i
better
rejoice
over
me
dear
friend
whom
i
can
never
forget
for
my
path
is
a
glad
and
joyful
one
he
did
not
say
much
but
kept
sighing
and
shaking
his
head
over
me
tenderly
what
has
became
of
your
fortune
he
asked
i
gave
it
to
the
monastery
i
answered
we
live
in
common
after
tea
i
began
saying
goodby
and
suddenly
he
brought
out
half
a
rouble
as
an
offering
to
the
monastery
and
another
halfrouble
i
saw
him
thrusting
hurriedly
into
my
hand
thats
for
you
in
your
wanderings
it
may
be
of
use
to
you
father
i
took
his
halfrouble
bowed
to
him
and
his
wife
and
went
out
rejoicing
and
on
my
way
i
thought
here
we
are
both
now
he
at
home
and
i
on
the
road
sighing
and
shaking
our
heads
no
doubt
and
yet
smiling
joyfully
in
the
gladness
of
our
hearts
remembering
how
god
brought
about
our
meeting
i
have
never
seen
him
again
since
then
i
had
been
his
master
and
he
my
servant
but
now
when
we
exchanged
a
loving
kiss
with
softened
hearts
there
was
a
great
human
bond
between
us
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
that
and
now
what
i
think
is
this
is
it
so
inconceivable
that
that
grand
and
simplehearted
unity
might
in
due
time
become
universal
among
the
russian
people
i
believe
that
it
will
come
to
pass
and
that
the
time
is
at
hand
and
of
servants
i
will
add
this
in
old
days
when
i
was
young
i
was
often
angry
with
servants
the
cook
had
served
something
too
hot
the
orderly
had
not
brushed
my
clothes
but
what
taught
me
better
then
was
a
thought
of
my
dear
brothers
which
i
had
heard
from
him
in
childhood
am
i
worth
it
that
another
should
serve
me
and
be
ordered
about
by
me
in
his
poverty
and
ignorance
and
i
wondered
at
the
time
that
such
simple
and
self
evident
ideas
should
be
so
slow
to
occur
to
our
minds
it
is
impossible
that
there
should
be
no
servants
in
the
world
but
act
so
that
your
servant
may
be
freer
in
spirit
than
if
he
were
not
a
servant
and
why
cannot
i
be
a
servant
to
my
servant
and
even
let
him
see
it
and
that
without
any
pride
on
my
part
or
any
mistrust
on
his
why
should
not
my
servant
be
like
my
own
kindred
so
that
i
may
take
him
into
my
family
and
rejoice
in
doing
so
even
now
this
can
be
done
but
it
will
lead
to
the
grand
unity
of
men
in
the
future
when
a
man
will
not
seek
servants
for
himself
or
desire
to
turn
his
fellow
creatures
into
servants
as
he
does
now
but
on
the
contrary
will
long
with
his
whole
heart
to
be
the
servant
of
all
as
the
gospel
teaches
and
can
it
be
a
dream
that
in
the
end
man
will
find
his
joy
only
in
deeds
of
light
and
mercy
and
not
in
cruel
pleasures
as
now
in
gluttony
fornication
ostentation
boasting
and
envious
rivalry
of
one
with
the
other
i
firmly
believe
that
it
is
not
and
that
the
time
is
at
hand
people
laugh
and
ask
when
will
that
time
come
and
does
it
look
like
coming
i
believe
that
with
christs
help
we
shall
accomplish
this
great
thing
and
how
many
ideas
there
have
been
on
earth
in
the
history
of
man
which
were
unthinkable
ten
years
before
they
appeared
yet
when
their
destined
hour
had
come
they
came
forth
and
spread
over
the
whole
earth
so
it
will
be
with
us
and
our
people
will
shine
forth
in
the
world
and
all
men
will
say
the
stone
which
the
builders
rejected
has
become
the
cornerstone
of
the
building
and
we
may
ask
the
scornful
themselves
if
our
hope
is
a
dream
when
will
you
build
up
your
edifice
and
order
things
justly
by
your
intellect
alone
without
christ
if
they
declare
that
it
is
they
who
are
advancing
towards
unity
only
the
most
simplehearted
among
them
believe
it
so
that
one
may
positively
marvel
at
such
simplicity
of
a
truth
they
have
more
fantastic
dreams
than
we
they
aim
at
justice
but
denying
christ
they
will
end
by
flooding
the
earth
with
blood
for
blood
cries
out
for
blood
and
he
that
taketh
up
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
sword
and
if
it
were
not
for
christs
covenant
they
would
slaughter
one
another
down
to
the
last
two
men
on
earth
and
those
two
last
men
would
not
be
able
to
restrain
each
other
in
their
pride
and
the
one
would
slay
the
other
and
then
himself
and
that
would
come
to
pass
were
it
not
for
the
promise
of
christ
that
for
the
sake
of
the
humble
and
meek
the
days
shall
be
shortened
while
i
was
still
wearing
an
officers
uniform
after
my
duel
i
talked
about
servants
in
general
society
and
i
remember
every
one
was
amazed
at
me
what
they
asked
are
we
to
make
our
servants
sit
down
on
the
sofa
and
offer
them
tea
and
i
answered
them
why
not
sometimes
at
least
every
one
laughed
their
question
was
frivolous
and
my
answer
was
not
clear
but
the
thought
in
it
was
to
some
extent
right
g
of
prayer
of
love
and
of
contact
with
other
worlds
young
man
be
not
forgetful
of
prayer
every
time
you
pray
if
your
prayer
is
sincere
there
will
be
new
feeling
and
new
meaning
in
it
which
will
give
you
fresh
courage
and
you
will
understand
that
prayer
is
an
education
remember
too
every
day
and
whenever
you
can
repeat
to
yourself
lord
have
mercy
on
all
who
appear
before
thee
today
for
every
hour
and
every
moment
thousands
of
men
leave
life
on
this
earth
and
their
souls
appear
before
god
and
how
many
of
them
depart
in
solitude
unknown
sad
dejected
that
no
one
mourns
for
them
or
even
knows
whether
they
have
lived
or
not
and
behold
from
the
other
end
of
the
earth
perhaps
your
prayer
for
their
rest
will
rise
up
to
god
though
you
knew
them
not
nor
they
you
how
touching
it
must
be
to
a
soul
standing
in
dread
before
the
lord
to
feel
at
that
instant
that
for
him
too
there
is
one
to
pray
that
there
is
a
fellow
creature
left
on
earth
to
love
him
too
and
god
will
look
on
you
both
more
graciously
for
if
you
have
had
so
much
pity
on
him
how
much
will
he
have
pity
who
is
infinitely
more
loving
and
merciful
than
you
and
he
will
forgive
him
for
your
sake

no

in
his

it
you
will
begin
to

the
traces

foulness

it
is
true
of
almost
every
one
of
us
love
children
especially
for
they
too
are
sinless
like
the
angels
they
live
to
soften
and
purify
our
hearts
and
as
it
were
to
guide
us

to
him
who
offends
a
child
father
anfim
taught
me
to
love
children
the
kind
silent
man
used
often
on
our
wanderings
to
spend
the
farthings
given
us
on
sweets
and
cakes
for
the
children
he
could
not
pass
by
a
child
without
emotion
thats
the
nature
of
the
man
at
some
thoughts
one
stands
perplexed
especially
at
the
sight
of
mens
sin
and
wonders
whether
one
should
use
force
or
humble
love
always
decide
to
use
humble
love
if
you
resolve
on
that
once
for
all
you
may
subdue
the
whole
world
loving
humility
is
marvelously
strong
the
strongest
of
all
things
and
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
every
day
and
every
hour
every
minute
walk
round
yourself
and
watch
yourself
and
see
that
your
image
is
a
seemly
one
you
pass
by
a
little
child
you
pass
by
spiteful
with
ugly
words
with
wrathful
heart
you
may
not
have
noticed
the
child
but
he
has
seen
you
and
your
image
unseemly
and
ignoble
may
remain
in
his
defenseless
heart
you
dont
know
it
but
you
may
have
sown
an
evil
seed
in
him
and
it
may
grow
and
all
because
you
were
not
careful
before
the
child
because
you
did
not
foster
in
yourself
a
careful
actively
benevolent
love
brothers
love
is
a
teacher
but
one
must
know
how
to
acquire
it
for
it
is
hard
to
acquire
it
is
dearly
bought
it
is
won
slowly
by
long
labor
for
we
must
love
not
only
occasionally
for
a
moment
but
for
ever
every
one
can
love
occasionally
even
the
wicked
can
my
brother
asked
the
birds
to
forgive
him
that
sounds
senseless
but
it
is
right
for
all
is
like
an
ocean
all
is
flowing
and
blending
a
touch
in
one
place
sets
up
movement
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
it
may
be
senseless
to
beg
forgiveness
of
the
birds
but
birds
would
be
happier
at
your
sidea
little
happier
anywayand
children
and
all
animals
if
you
were
nobler
than
you
are
now
its
all
like
an
ocean
i
tell
you
then
you
would
pray
to
the
birds
too
consumed
by
an
allembracing
love
in
a
sort
of
transport
and
pray
that
they
too
will
forgive
you
your
sin
treasure
this
ecstasy
however
senseless
it
may
seem
to
men
my
friends
pray
to
god
for
gladness
be
glad
as
children
as
the
birds
of
heaven
and
let
not
the
sin
of
men
confound
you
in
your
doings
fear
not
that
it
will
wear
away
your
work
and
hinder
its
being
accomplished
do
not
say
sin
is
mighty
wickedness
is
mighty
evil
environment
is
mighty
and
we
are
lonely
and
helpless
and
evil
environment
is
wearing
us
away
and
hindering
our
good
work
from
being
done
fly
from
that
dejection
children
there
is
only
one
means
of
salvation
then
take
yourself
and
make
yourself
responsible
for
all
mens
sins
that
is
the
truth
you
know
friends
for
as
soon
as
you
sincerely
make
yourself
responsible
for
everything
and
for
all
men
you
will
see
at
once
that
it
is
really
so
and
that
you
are
to
blame
for
every
one
and
for
all
things
but
throwing
your
own
indolence
and
impotence
on
others
you
will
end
by
sharing
the
pride
of
satan
and
murmuring
against
god
of
the
pride
of
satan
what
i
think
is
this
it
is
hard
for
us
on
earth
to
comprehend
it
and
therefore
it
is
so
easy
to
fall
into
error
and
to
share
it
even
imagining
that
we
are
doing
something
grand
and
fine
indeed
many
of
the
strongest
feelings
and
movements
of
our
nature
we
cannot
comprehend
on
earth
let
not
that
be
a
stumblingblock
and
think
not
that
it
may
serve
as
a
justification
to
you
for
anything
for
the
eternal
judge
asks
of
you
what
you
can
comprehend
and
not
what
you
cannot
you
will
know
that
yourself
hereafter
for
you
will
behold
all
things
truly
then
and
will
not
dispute
them
on
earth
indeed
we
are
as
it
were
astray
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
precious
image
of
christ
before
us
we
should
be
undone
and
altogether
lost
as
was
the
human
race
before
the
flood
much
on
earth
is
hidden
from
us
but
to
make
up
for
that
we
have
been
given
a
precious
mystic
sense
of
our
living
bond
with
the
other
world
with
the
higher
heavenly
world
and
the
roots
of
our
thoughts
and
feelings
are
not
here
but
in
other
worlds
that
is
why
the
philosophers
say
that
we
cannot
apprehend
the
reality
of
things
on
earth
god
took
seeds
from
different
worlds
and
sowed
them
on
this
earth
and
his
garden
grew
up
and
everything
came
up
that
could
come
up
but
what
grows
lives
and
is
alive
only
through
the
feeling
of
its
contact
with
other
mysterious
worlds
if
that
feeling
grows
weak
or
is
destroyed
in
you
the
heavenly
growth
will
die
away
in
you
then
you
will
be
indifferent
to
life
and
even
grow
to
hate
it
thats
what
i
think
h
can
a
man
judge
his
fellow
creatures
faith
to
the
end
remember
particularly
that
you
cannot
be
a
judge
of
any
one
for
no
one
can
judge
a
criminal
until
he
recognizes
that
he
is
just
such
a
criminal
as
the
man
standing
before
him
and
that
he
perhaps
is
more
than
all
men
to
blame
for
that
crime
when
he
understands
that
he
will
be
able
to
be
a
judge
though
that
sounds
absurd
it
is
true
if
i
had
been
righteous
myself
perhaps
there
would
have
been
no
criminal
standing
before
me
if
you
can
take
upon
yourself
the
crime
of
the
criminal
your
heart
is
judging
take
it
at
once
suffer
for
him
yourself
and
let
him
go
without
reproach
and
even
if
the
law
itself
makes
you
his
judge
act
in
the
same
spirit
so
far
as
possible
for
he
will
go
away
and
condemn
himself
more
bitterly
than
you
have
done
if
after
your
kiss
he
goes
away
untouched
mocking
at
you
do
not
let
that
be
a
stumblingblock
to
you
it
shows
his
time
has
not
yet
come
but
it
will
come
in
due
course
and
if
it
come
not
no
matter
if
not
he
then
another
in
his
place
will
understand
and
suffer
and
judge
and
condemn
himself
and
the
truth
will
be
fulfilled
believe
that
believe
it
without
doubt
for
in
that
lies
all
the
hope
and
faith
of
the
saints
work
without
ceasing
if
you
remember
in
the
night
as
you
go
to
sleep
i
have
not
done
what
i
ought
to
have
done
rise
up
at
once
and
do
it
if
the
people
around
you
are
spiteful
and
callous
and
will
not
hear
you
fall
down
before
them
and
beg
their
forgiveness
for
in
truth
you
are
to
blame
for
their
not
wanting
to
hear
you
and
if
you
cannot
speak
to
them
in
their
bitterness
serve
them
in
silence
and
in
humility
never
losing
hope
if
all
men
abandon
you
and
even
drive
you
away
by
force
then
when
you
are
left
alone
fall
on
the
earth
and
kiss
it
water
it
with
your
tears
and
it
will
bring
forth
fruit
even
though
no
one
has
seen
or
heard
you
in
your
solitude
believe
to
the
end
even
if
all
men
went
astray
and
you
were
left
the
only
one
faithful
bring
your
offering
even
then
and
praise
god
in
your
loneliness
and
if
two
of
you
are
gathered
togetherthen
there
is
a
whole
world
a
world
of
living
love
embrace
each
other
tenderly
and
praise
god
for
if
only
in
you
two
his
truth
has
been
fulfilled
if
you
sin
yourself
and
grieve
even
unto
death
for
your
sins
or
for
your
sudden
sin
then
rejoice
for
others
rejoice
for
the
righteous
man
rejoice
that
if
you
have
sinned
he
is
righteous
and
has
not
sinned
if
the
evildoing
of
men
moves
you
to
indignation
and
overwhelming
distress
even
to
a
desire
for
vengeance
on
the
evildoers

above
all
things
that
feeling

at
once

suffering
for
yourself
as
though
you
were
yourself
guilty
of
that
wrong
accept
that
suffering
and
bear
it
and
your
heart
will
find
comfort
and
you
will
understand
that
you
too
are
guilty
for
you
might
have
been
a
light
to
the
evildoers
even
as
the
one
man
sinless
and
you
were
not

them
if
you
had
been
a
light
you
would
have
lightened
the
path
for
others
too
and
the
evildoer
might
perhaps
have
been
saved
by
your
light
from
his
sin
and
even
though
your
light
was
shining
yet
you

it

firm
and
doubt
not
the
power
of
the
heavenly
light
believe
that
if
they
were
not

they
will
be

hereafter
and
if
they

hereafter
then
their

not

to
many
but
only
to
the
elect
i
of
hell
and
hell
fire
a
mystic
reflection
fathers
and
teachers
i
ponder
what
is
hell
i
maintain
that
it
is
the
suffering
of
being
unable
to
love
once
in
infinite
existence
immeasurable
in
time
and
space
a
spiritual
creature
was
given
on
his
coming
to
earth
the
power
of
saying
i
am
and
i
love
once
only
once
there
was
given
him
a
moment
of
active
living
love
and
for
that
was
earthly
life
given
him
and
with
it
times
and
seasons
and
that
happy
creature
rejected
the
priceless
gift
prized
it
and
loved
it
not
scorned
it
and
remained
callous
such
a
one
having
left
the
earth
sees
abrahams
bosom
and
talks
with
abraham
as
we
are
told
in
the
parable
of
the
rich
man
and
lazarus
and
beholds
heaven
and
can
go
up
to
the
lord
but
that
is
just
his
torment
to
rise
up
to
the
lord
without
ever
having
loved
to
be
brought
close
to
those
who
have
loved
when
he
has
despised
their
love
for
he
sees
clearly
and
says
to
himself
now
i
have
understanding
and
though
i
now
thirst
to
love
there
will
be
nothing
great
no
sacrifice
in
my
love
for
my
earthly
life
is
over
and
abraham
will
not
come
even
with
a
drop
of
living
water
that
is
the
gift
of
earthly
active
life
to
cool
the
fiery
thirst
of
spiritual
love
which
burns
in
me
now
though
i
despised
it
on
earth
there
is
no
more
life
for
me
and
will
be
no
more
time
even
though
i
would
gladly
give
my
life
for
others
it
can
never
be
for
that
life
is
passed
which
can
be
sacrificed
for
love
and
now
there
is
a
gulf
fixed
between
that
life
and
this
existence
they
talk
of
hell
fire
in
the
material
sense
i
dont
go
into
that
mystery
and
i
shun
it
but
i
think
if
there
were
fire
in
material
sense
they
would
be
glad
of
it
for
i
imagine
that
in
material
agony
their
still
greater
spiritual
agony
would
be
forgotten
for
a
moment
moreover
that
spiritual
agony
cannot
be
taken
from
them
for
that
suffering
is
not
external
but
within
them
and
if
it
could
be
taken
from
them
i
think
it
would
be
bitterer
still
for
the
unhappy
creatures
for
even
if
the
righteous
in
paradise
forgave
them
beholding
their
torments
and
called
them
up
to
heaven
in
their
infinite
love
they
would
only
multiply
their
torments
for
they
would
arouse
in
them
still
more
keenly
a
flaming
thirst
for
responsive
active
and
grateful
love
which
is
now
impossible
in
the
timidity
of
my
heart
i
imagine
however
that
the
very
recognition
of
this
impossibility
would
serve
at
last
to
console
them
for
accepting
the
love
of
the
righteous
together
with
the
impossibility
of
repaying
it
by
this
submissiveness
and
the
effect
of
this
humility
they
will
attain
at
last
as
it
were
to
a
certain
semblance
of
that
active
love
which
they
scorned
in
life
to
something
like
its
outward
expression
i
am
sorry
friends
and
brothers
that
i
cannot
express
this
clearly
but
woe
to
those
who
have
slain
themselves
on
earth
woe
to
the
suicides
i
believe
that
there
can
be
none
more
miserable
than
they
they
tell
us
that
it
is
a
sin
to
pray
for
them
and
outwardly
the
church
as
it
were
renounces
them
but
in
my
secret
heart
i
believe
that
we
may
pray
even
for
them
love
can
never
be
an
offense
to
christ
for
such
as
those
i
have
prayed
inwardly
all
my
life
i
confess
it
fathers
and
teachers
and
even
now
i
pray
for
them
every
day
oh
there
are
some
who
remain
proud
and
fierce
even
in
hell
in
spite
of
their
certain
knowledge
and
contemplation
of
the
absolute
truth
there
are
some
fearful
ones
who
have
given
themselves
over
to
satan
and
his
proud
spirit
entirely
for
such
hell
is
voluntary
and
ever
consuming
they
are
tortured
by
their
own
choice
for
they
have
cursed
themselves
cursing
god
and
life
they
live
upon
their
vindictive
pride
like
a
starving
man
in
the
desert
sucking
blood
out
of
his
own
body
but
they
are
never
satisfied
and
they
refuse
forgiveness
they
curse
god
who
calls
them
they
cannot
behold
the
living
god
without
hatred
and
they
cry
out
that
the
god
of
life
should
be
annihilated
that
god
should
destroy
himself
and
his
own
creation
and
they
will
burn
in
the
fire
of
their
own
wrath
for
ever
and
yearn
for
death
and
annihilation
but
they
will
not
attain
to
death

i
repeat
it
is
incomplete

fragmentary
biographical
details
for

only
father
zossimas
earliest
youth
of
his
teaching
and
opinions
we
find
brought
together
sayings
evidently
uttered
on
very
different
occasions
his
utterances
during
the
last
few
hours
have
not
been
kept
separate
from
the
rest
but
their
general
character
can
be
gathered
from
what
we
have
in
alexey
fyodorovitchs
manuscript
the
elders
death
came
in
the
end
quite
unexpectedly
for
although
those
who
were
gathered
about
him
that
last
evening
realized
that
his
death
was
approaching
yet
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
it
would
come
so
suddenly
on
the
contrary
his
friends
as
i
observed
already
seeing
him
that
night
apparently
so
cheerful
and
talkative
were
convinced
that
there
was
at
least
a
temporary
change
for
the
better
in
his
condition
even
five
minutes
before
his
death
they
said
afterwards
wonderingly
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
it
he
seemed
suddenly
to
feel
an
acute
pain
in
his
chest
he
turned
pale
and
pressed
his
hands
to
his
heart
all
rose
from
their
seats
and
hastened
to
him
but
though
suffering
he
still
looked
at
them
with
a
smile
sank
slowly
from
his
chair
on
to
his
knees
then
bowed
his
face
to
the
ground
stretched
out
his
arms
and
as
though
in
joyful
ecstasy
praying
and
kissing
the
ground
quietly
and
joyfully
gave
up
his
soul
to
god
the
news
of
his
death
spread
at
once
through
the
hermitage
and
reached
the
monastery
the
nearest
friends
of
the
deceased
and
those
whose
duty
it
was
from
their
position
began
to
lay
out
the
corpse
according
to
the
ancient
ritual
and
all
the
monks
gathered
together
in
the
church
and
before
dawn
the
news
of
the
death
reached
the
town
by
the
morning
all
the
town
was
talking
of
the
event
and
crowds
were
flocking
from
the
town
to
the
monastery
but
this
subject
will
be
treated
in
the
next
book
i
will
only
add
here
that
before
a
day
had
passed
something
happened
so
unexpected
so
strange
upsetting
and
bewildering
in
its
effect
on
the
monks
and
the
townspeople
that
after
all
these
years
that
day
of
general
suspense
is
still
vividly
remembered
in
the
town
part
iii
book
vii
alyosha
chapter
i
the
breath
of
corruption
the
body
of
father
zossima
was
prepared
for
burial
according
to
the
established
ritual
as
is
well
known
the
bodies
of
dead
monks
and
hermits
are
not
washed
in
the
words
of
the
church
ritual
if
any
one
of
the
monks
depart
in
the
lord
the
monk
designated
that
is
whose
office
it
is
shall
wipe
the
body
with
warm
water
making
first
the
sign
of
the
cross
with
a
sponge
on
the
forehead
of
the
deceased
on
the
breast
on
the
hands
and
feet
and
on
the
knees
and
that
is
enough
all
this
was
done
by
father
passy
who
then
clothed
the
deceased
in
his
monastic
garb
and
wrapped
him
in
his
cloak
which
was
according
to
custom
somewhat
slit
to
allow
of
its
being
folded
about
him
in
the
form
of
a
cross
on
his
head
he
put
a
hood
with
an
eightcornered
cross
the
hood
was
left
open
and
the
dead
mans
face
was
covered
with
black
gauze
in
his
hands
was
put
an
ikon
of
the
saviour
towards
morning
he
was
put
in
the
coffin
which
had
been
made
ready
long
before
it
was
decided
to
leave
the
coffin
all
day
in
the
cell
in
the
larger
room
in
which
the
elder
used
to
receive
his
visitors
and
fellow
monks
as
the
deceased
was
a
priest
and
monk
of
the
strictest
rule
the
gospel
not
the
psalter
had
to
be
read
over
his
body
by
monks
in
holy
orders
the
reading
was
begun
by
father
iosif
immediately
after
the
requiem
service
father
passy
desired
later
on
to
read
the
gospel
all
day
and
night
over
his
dead
friend
but
for
the
present
he
as
well
as
the
father
superintendent
of
the
hermitage
was
very
busy
and
occupied
for
something
extraordinary
an
unheardof
even
unseemly
excitement
and
impatient
expectation
began
to
be
apparent
in
the
monks
and
the
visitors
from
the
monastery
hostels
and
the
crowds
of
people
flocking
from
the
town
and
as
time
went
on
this
grew
more
and
more
marked
both
the
superintendent
and
father
passy
did
their
utmost
to
calm
the
general
bustle
and
agitation
when
it
was
fully
daylight
some
people
began
bringing
their
sick
in
most
cases
children
with
them
from
the
townas
though
they
had
been
waiting
expressly
for
this
moment
to
do
so
evidently
persuaded
that
the
dead
elders
remains
had
a
power
of
healing
which
would
be
immediately
made
manifest
in
accordance
with
their
faith
it
was
only
then
apparent
how
unquestionably
every
one
in
our
town
had
accepted
father
zossima
during
his
lifetime
as
a
great
saint
and
those
who
came
were
far
from
being
all
of
the
humbler
classes
this
intense
expectation
on
the
part
of
believers
displayed
with
such
haste
such
openness
even
with
impatience
and
almost
insistence
impressed
father
passy
as
unseemly
though
he
had
long
foreseen
something
of
the
sort
the
actual
manifestation
of
the
feeling
was
beyond
anything
he
had
looked
for
when
he
came
across
any
of
the
monks
who
displayed
this
excitement
father
passy
began
to
reprove
them
such
immediate
expectation
of
something
extraordinary
he
said
shows
a
levity
possible
to
worldly
people
but
unseemly
in
us
but
little
attention
was
paid
him
and
father
passy
noticed
it
uneasily
yet
he
himself
if
the
whole
truth
must
be
told
secretly
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
cherished
almost
the
same
hopes
and
could
not
but
be
aware
of
it
though
he
was
indignant
at
the
too
impatient
expectation
around
him
and
saw
in
it
lightmindedness
and
vanity
nevertheless
it
was
particularly
unpleasant
to
him
to
meet
certain
persons
whose
presence
aroused
in
him
great
misgivings
in
the
crowd
in
the
dead
mans
cell
he
noticed
with
inward
aversion
for
which
he
immediately
reproached
himself
the
presence
of
rakitin
and
of
the
monk
from
obdorsk
who
was
still
staying
in
the
monastery
of
both
of
them
father
passy
felt
for
some
reason
suddenly
suspiciousthough
indeed
he
might
well
have
felt
the
same
about
others
the
monk
from
obdorsk
was
conspicuous
as
the
most
fussy
in
the
excited
crowd
he
was
to
be
seen
everywhere
everywhere
he
was
asking
questions
everywhere
he
was
listening
on
all
sides
he
was
whispering
with
a
peculiar
mysterious
air
his
expression
showed
the
greatest
impatience
and
even
a
sort
of
irritation
as
for
rakitin
he
as
appeared
later
had
come
so
early
to
the
hermitage
at
the
special
request
of
madame
hohlakov
as
soon
as
that
goodhearted
but
weakminded
woman
who
could
not
herself
have
been
admitted
to
the
hermitage
waked
and
heard
of
the
death
of
father
zossima
she
was
overtaken
with
such
intense
curiosity
that
she
promptly
dispatched
rakitin
to
the
hermitage
to
keep
a
careful
look
out
and
report
to
her
by
letter
every
halfhour
or
so
everything
that
takes
place
she
regarded
rakitin
as
a
most
religious
and
devout
young
man
he
was
particularly
clever
in
getting
round
people
and
assuming
whatever
part
he
thought
most
to
their
taste
if
he
detected
the
slightest
advantage
to
himself
from
doing
so
it
was
a
bright
clear
day
and
many
of
the
visitors
were
thronging
about
the
tombs
which
were
particularly
numerous
round
the
church
and
scattered
here
and
there
about
the
hermitage
as
he
walked
round
the
hermitage
father
passy
remembered
alyosha
and
that
he
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
not
since
the
night
and
he
had
no
sooner
thought
of
him
than
he
at
once
noticed
him
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
hermitage
garden
sitting
on
the
tombstone
of
a
monk
who
had
been
famous
long
ago
for
his
saintliness
he
sat
with
his
back
to
the
hermitage
and
his
face
to
the
wall
and
seemed
to
be
hiding
behind
the
tombstone
going
up
to
him
father
passy
saw
that
he
was
weeping
quietly
but
bitterly
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
and
that
his
whole
frame
was
shaking
with
sobs
father
passy
stood
over
him
for
a
little
enough
dear
son
enough
dear
he
pronounced
with
feeling
at
last
why
do
you
weep
rejoice
and
weep
not
dont
you
know
that
this
is
the
greatest
of
his
days
think
only
where
he
is
now
at
this
moment
alyosha
glanced
at
him
uncovering
his
face
which
was
swollen
with
crying
like
a
childs
but
turned
away
at
once
without
uttering
a
word
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
again
maybe
it
is
well
said
father
passy
thoughtfully
weep
if
you
must
christ
has
sent
you
those
tears
your
touching
tears
are
but
a
relief
to
your
spirit
and
will
serve
to
gladden
your
dear
heart
he
added
to
himself
walking
away
from
alyosha
and
thinking
lovingly
of
him
he
moved
away
quickly
however
for
he
felt
that
he
too
might
weep
looking
at
him
meanwhile
the
time
was
passing
the
monastery
services
and
the
requiems
for
the
dead
followed
in
their
due
course
father
passy
again
took
father
iosifs
place
by
the
coffin
and
began
reading
the
gospel
but
before
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
that
something
took
place
to
which
i
alluded
at
the
end
of
the
last
book
something
so
unexpected
by
all
of
us
and
so
contrary
to
the
general
hope
that
i
repeat
this
trivial
incident
has
been
minutely
remembered
to
this
day
in
our
town
and
all
the
surrounding
neighborhood
i
may
add
here
for
myself
personally
that
i
feel
it
almost
repulsive
to
recall
that
event
which
caused
such
frivolous
agitation
and
was
such
a
stumblingblock
to
many
though
in
reality
it
was
the
most
natural
and
trivial
matter
i
should
of
course
have
omitted
all
mention
of
it
in
my
story
if
it
had
not
exerted
a
very
strong
influence
on
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
chief
though
future
hero
of
my
story
alyosha
forming
a
crisis
and
turningpoint
in
his
spiritual
development
giving
a
shock
to
his
intellect
which
finally
strengthened
it
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
gave
it
a
definite
aim
and
so
to
return
to
our
story
when
before
dawn
they
laid
father
zossimas
body
in
the
coffin
and
brought
it
into
the
front
room
the
question
of
opening
the
windows
was
raised
among
those
who
were
around
the
coffin
but
this
suggestion
made
casually
by
some
one
was
unanswered
and
almost
unnoticed
some
of
those
present
may
perhaps
have
inwardly
noticed
it
only
to
reflect
that
the
anticipation
of
decay
and
corruption
from
the
body
of
such
a
saint
was
an
actual
absurdity
calling
for
compassion
if
not
a
smile
for
the
lack
of
faith
and
the
frivolity
it
implied
for
they
expected
something
quite
different
and
behold
soon
after
midday
there
were
signs
of
something
at
first
only
observed
in
silence
by
those
who
came
in
and
out
and
were
evidently
each
afraid
to
communicate
the
thought
in
his
mind
but
by
three
oclock
those
signs
had
become
so
clear
and
unmistakable
that
the
news
swiftly
reached
all
the
monks
and
visitors
in
the
hermitage
promptly
penetrated
to
the
monastery
throwing
all
the
monks
into
amazement
and
finally
in
the
shortest
possible
time
spread
to
the
town
exciting
every
one
in
it
believers
and
unbelievers
alike
the
unbelievers
rejoiced
and
as
for
the
believers
some
of
them
rejoiced
even
more
than
the
unbelievers
for
men
love
the
downfall
and
disgrace
of
the
righteous
as
the
deceased
elder
had
said
in
one
of
his
exhortations
the
fact
is
that
a
smell
of
decomposition
began
to
come
from
the
coffin
growing
gradually
more
marked
and
by
three
oclock
it
was
quite
unmistakable
in
all
the
past
history
of
our
monastery
no
such
scandal
could
be
recalled
and
in
no
other
circumstances
could
such
a
scandal
have
been
possible
as
showed
itself
in
unseemly
disorder
immediately
after
this
discovery
among
the
very
monks
themselves
afterwards
even
many
years
afterwards
some
sensible
monks
were
amazed
and
horrified
when
they
recalled
that
day
that
the
scandal
could
have
reached
such
proportions
for
in
the
past
monks
of
very
holy
life
had
died
godfearing
old
men
whose
saintliness
was
acknowledged
by
all
yet
from
their
humble
coffins
too
the
breath
of
corruption
had
come
naturally
as
from
all
dead
bodies
but
that
had
caused
no
scandal
nor
even
the
slightest
excitement
of
course
there
had
been
in
former
times
saints
in
the
monastery
whose
memory
was
carefully
preserved
and
whose
relics
according
to
tradition
showed
no
signs
of
corruption
this
fact
was
regarded
by
the
monks
as
touching
and
mysterious
and
the
tradition
of
it
was
cherished
as
something
blessed
and
miraculous
and
as
a
promise
by
gods
grace
of
still
greater
glory
from
their
tombs
in
the
future
one
such
whose
memory
was
particularly
cherished
was
an
old
monk
job
who
had
died
seventy
years
before
at
the
age
of
a
hundred
and
five
he
had
been
a
celebrated
ascetic
rigid
in
fasting
and
silence
and
his
tomb
was
pointed
out
to
all
visitors
on
their
arrival
with
peculiar
respect
and
mysterious
hints
of
great
hopes
connected
with
it
that
was
the
very
tomb
on
which
father
passy
had
found
alyosha
sitting
in
the
morning
another
memory
cherished
in
the
monastery
was
that
of
the
famous
father
varsonofy
who
was
only
recently
dead
and
had
preceded
father
zossima
in
the
eldership
he
was
reverenced
during
his
lifetime
as
a
crazy
saint
by
all
the
pilgrims
to
the
monastery
there
was
a
tradition
that
both
of
these
had
lain
in
their
coffins
as
though
alive
that
they
had
shown
no
signs
of
decomposition
when
they
were
buried
and
that
there
had
been
a
holy
light
in
their
faces
and
some
people
even
insisted
that
a
sweet
fragrance
came
from
their
bodies
yet
in
spite
of
these
edifying
memories
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
the
frivolity
absurdity
and
malice
that
were
manifested
beside
the
coffin
of
father
zossima
it
is
my
private
opinion
that
several
different
causes
were
simultaneously
at
work
one
of
which
was
the
deeplyrooted
hostility
to
the
institution
of
elders
as
a
pernicious
innovation
an
antipathy
hidden
deep
in
the
hearts
of
many
of
the
monks
even
more
powerful
was
jealousy
of
the
dead
mans
saintliness
so
firmly
established
during
his
lifetime
that
it
was
almost
a
forbidden
thing
to
question
it
for
though
the
late
elder
had
won
over
many
hearts
more
by
love
than
by
miracles
and
had
gathered
round
him
a
mass
of
loving
adherents
none
the
less
in
fact
rather
the
more
on
that
account
he
had
awakened
jealousy
and
so
had
come
to
have
bitter
enemies
secret
and
open
not
only
in
the
monastery
but
in
the
world
outside
it
he
did
no
one
any
harm
but
why
do
they
think
him
so
saintly
and
that
question
alone
gradually
repeated
gave
rise
at
last
to
an
intense
insatiable
hatred
of
him
that
i
believe
was
why
many
people
were
extremely
delighted
at
the
smell
of
decomposition
which
came
so
quickly
for
not
a
day
had
passed
since
his
death
at
the
same
time
there
were
some
among
those
who
had
been
hitherto
reverently
devoted
to
the
elder
who
were
almost
mortified
and
personally
affronted
by
this
incident
this
was
how
the
thing
happened
as
soon
as
signs
of
decomposition
had
begun
to
appear
the
whole
aspect
of
the
monks
betrayed
their
secret
motives
in
entering
the
cell
they
went
in
stayed
a
little
while
and
hastened
out
to
confirm
the
news
to
the
crowd
of
other
monks
waiting
outside
some
of
the
latter
shook
their
heads
mournfully
but
others
did
not
even
care
to
conceal
the
delight
which
gleamed
unmistakably
in
their
malignant
eyes
and
now
no
one
reproached
them
for
it
no
one
raised
his
voice
in
protest
which
was
strange
for
the
majority
of
the
monks
had
been
devoted
to
the
dead
elder
but
it
seemed
as
though
god
had
in
this
case
let
the
minority
get
the
upper
hand
for
a
time
visitors
from
outside
particularly
of
the
educated
class
soon
went
into
the
cell
too
with
the
same
spying
intent
of
the
peasantry
few
went
into
the
cell
though
there
were
crowds
of
them
at
the
gates
of
the
hermitage
after
three
oclock
the
rush
of
worldly
visitors
was
greatly
increased
and
this
was
no
doubt
owing
to
the
shocking
news
people
were
attracted
who
would
not
otherwise
have
come
on
that
day
and
had
not
intended
to
come
and
among
them
were
some
personages
of
high
standing
but
external
decorum
was
still
preserved
and
father
passy
with
a
stern
face
continued
firmly
and
distinctly
reading
aloud
the
gospel
apparently
not
noticing
what
was
taking
place
around
him
though
he
had
in
fact
observed
something
unusual
long
before
but
at
last
the
murmurs
first
subdued
but
gradually
louder
and
more
confident
reached
even
him
it
shows
gods
judgment
is
not
as
mans
father
passy
heard
suddenly
the
first
to
give
utterance
to
this
sentiment
was
a
layman
an
elderly
official
from
the
town
known
to
be
a
man
of
great
piety
but
he
only
repeated
aloud
what
the
monks
had
long
been
whispering
they
had
long
before
formulated
this
damning
conclusion
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
a
sort
of
triumphant
satisfaction
at
that
conclusion
became
more
and
more
apparent
every
moment
soon
they
began
to
lay
aside
even
external
decorum
and
almost
seemed
to
feel
they
had
a
sort
of
right
to
discard
it
and
for
what
reason
can
this
have
happened
some
of
the
monks
said
at
first
with
a
show
of
regret
he
had
a
small
frame
and
his
flesh
was
dried
up
on
his
bones
what
was
there
to
decay
it
must
be
a
sign
from
heaven
others
hastened
to
add
and
their
opinion
was
adopted
at
once
without
protest
for
it
was
pointed
out
too
that
if
the
decomposition
had
been
natural
as
in
the
case
of
every
dead
sinner
it
would
have
been
apparent
later
after
a
lapse
of
at
least
twentyfour
hours
but
this
premature
corruption
was
in
excess
of
nature
and
so
the
finger
of
god
was
evident
it
was
meant
for
a
sign
this
conclusion
seemed
irresistible
gentle
father
iosif
the
librarian
a
great
favorite
of
the
dead
mans
tried
to
reply
to
some
of
the
evil
speakers
that
this
is
not
held
everywhere
alike
and
that
the
incorruptibility
of
the
bodies
of
the
just
was
not
a
dogma
of
the
orthodox
church
but
only
an
opinion
and
that
even
in
the
most
orthodox
regions
at
athos
for
instance
they
were
not
greatly
confounded
by
the
smell
of
corruption
and
there
the
chief
sign
of
the
glorification
of
the
saved
was
not
bodily
incorruptibility
but
the
color
of
the
bones
when
the
bodies
have
lain
many
years
in
the
earth
and
have
decayed
in
it
and
if
the
bones
are
yellow
as
wax
that
is
the
great
sign
that
the
lord
has
glorified
the
dead
saint
if
they
are
not
yellow
but
black
it
shows
that
god
has
not
deemed
him
worthy
of
such
glorythat
is
the
belief
in
athos
a
great
place
where
the
orthodox
doctrine
has
been
preserved
from
of
old
unbroken
and
in
its
greatest
purity
said
father
iosif
in
conclusion
but
the
meek
fathers
words
had
little
effect
and
even
provoked
a
mocking
retort
thats
all
pedantry
and
innovation
no
use
listening
to
it
the
monks
decided
we
stick
to
the
old
doctrine
there
are
all
sorts
of
innovations
nowadays
are
we
to
follow
them
all
added
others
we
have
had
as
many
holy
fathers
as
they
had
there
they
are
among
the
turks
they
have
forgotten
everything
their
doctrine
has
long
been
impure
and
they
have
no
bells
even
the
most
sneering
added
father
iosif
walked
away
grieving
the
more
since
he
had
put
forward
his
own
opinion
with
little
confidence
as
though
scarcely
believing
in
it
himself
he
foresaw
with
distress
that
something
very
unseemly
was
beginning
and
that
there
were
positive
signs
of
disobedience
little
by
little
all
the
sensible
monks
were
reduced
to
silence
like
father
iosif
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
all
who
loved
the
elder
and
had
accepted
with
devout
obedience
the
institution
of
the
eldership
were
all
at
once
terribly
cast
down
and
glanced
timidly
in
one
anothers
faces
when
they
met
those
who
were
hostile
to
the
institution
of
elders
as
a
novelty
held
up
their
heads
proudly
there
was
no
smell
of
corruption
from
the
late
elder
varsonofy
but
a
sweet
fragrance
they
recalled
malignantly
but
he
gained
that
glory
not
because
he
was
an
elder
but
because
he
was
a
holy
man
and
this
was
followed
by
a
shower
of
criticism
and
even
blame
of
father
zossima
his
teaching
was
false
he
taught
that
life
is
a
great
joy
and
not
a
vale
of
tears
said
some
of
the
more
unreasonable
he
followed
the
fashionable
belief
he
did
not
recognize
material
fire
in
hell
others
still
more
unreasonable
added
he
was
not
strict
in
fasting
allowed
himself
sweet
things
ate
cherry
jam
with
his
tea
ladies
used
to
send
it
to
him
is
it
for
a
monk
of
strict
rule
to
drink
tea
could
be
heard
among
some
of
the
envious
he
sat
in
pride
the
most
malignant
declared
vindictively
he
considered
himself
a
saint
and
he
took
it
as
his
due
when
people
knelt
before
him
he
abused
the
sacrament
of
confession
the
fiercest
opponents
of
the
institution
of
elders
added
in
a
malicious
whisper
and
among
these
were
some
of
the
oldest
monks
strictest
in
their
devotion
genuine
ascetics
who
had
kept
silent
during
the
life
of
the
deceased
elder
but
now
suddenly
unsealed
their
lips
and
this
was
terrible
for
their
words
had
great
influence
on
young
monks
who
were
not
yet
firm
in
their
convictions
the
monk
from
obdorsk
heard
all
this
attentively
heaving
deep
sighs
and
nodding
his
head
yes
clearly
father
ferapont
was
right
in
his
judgment
yesterday
and
at
that
moment
father
ferapont
himself
made
his
appearance
as
though
on
purpose
to
increase
the
confusion
i
have
mentioned
already
that
he
rarely
left
his
wooden
cell
by
the
apiary
he
was
seldom
even
seen
at
church
and
they
overlooked
this
neglect
on
the
ground
of
his
craziness
and
did
not
keep
him
to
the
rules
binding
on
all
the
rest
but
if
the
whole
truth
is
to
be
told
they
hardly
had
a
choice
about
it
for
it
would
have
been
discreditable
to
insist
on
burdening
with
the
common
regulations
so
great
an
ascetic
who
prayed
day
and
night
he
even
dropped
asleep
on
his
knees
if
they
had
insisted
the
monks
would
have
said
he
is
holier
than
all
of
us
and
he
follows
a
rule
harder
than
ours
and
if
he
does
not
go
to
church
its
because
he
knows
when
he
ought
to
he
has
his
own
rule
it
was
to
avoid
the
chance
of
these
sinful
murmurs
that
father
ferapont
was
left
in
peace
as
every
one
was
aware
father
ferapont
particularly
disliked
father
zossima
and
now
the
news
had
reached
him
in
his
hut
that
gods
judgment
is
not
the
same
as
mans
and
that
something
had
happened
which
was
in
excess
of
nature
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
among
the
first
to
run
to
him
with
the
news
was
the
monk
from
obdorsk
who
had
visited
him
the
evening
before
and
left
his
cell
terrorstricken
i
have
mentioned
above
that
though
father
passy
standing
firm
and
immovable
reading
the
gospel
over
the
coffin
could
not
hear
nor
see
what
was
passing
outside
the
cell
he
gauged
most
of
it
correctly
in
his
heart
for
he
knew
the
men
surrounding
him
well
he
was
not
shaken
by
it
but
awaited
what
would
come
next
without
fear
watching
with
penetration
and
insight
for
the
outcome
of
the
general
excitement
suddenly
an
extraordinary
uproar
in
the
passage
in
open
defiance
of
decorum
burst
on
his
ears
the
door
was
flung
open
and
father
ferapont
appeared
in
the
doorway
behind
him
there
could
be
seen
accompanying
him
a
crowd
of
monks
together
with
many
people
from
the
town
they
did
not
however
enter
the
cell
but
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
waiting
to
see
what
father
ferapont
would
say
or
do
for
they
felt
with
a
certain
awe
in
spite
of
their
audacity
that
he
had
not
come
for
nothing
standing
in
the
doorway
father
ferapont
raised
his
arms
and
under
his
right
arm
the
keen
inquisitive
little
eyes
of
the
monk
from
obdorsk
peeped
in
he
alone
in
his
intense
curiosity
could
not
resist
running
up
the
steps
after
father
ferapont
the
others
on
the
contrary
pressed
farther
back
in
sudden
alarm
when
the
door
was
noisily
flung
open
holding
his
hands
aloft
father
ferapont
suddenly
roared
casting
out
i
cast
out
and
turning
in
all
directions
he
began
at
once
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
at
each
of
the
four
walls
and
four
corners
of
the
cell
in
succession
all
who
accompanied
father
ferapont
immediately
understood
his
action
for
they
knew
he
always
did
this
wherever
he
went
and
that
he
would
not
sit
down
or
say
a
word
till
he
had
driven
out
the
evil
spirits
satan
go
hence
satan
go
hence
he
repeated
at
each
sign
of
the
cross
casting
out
i
cast
out
he
roared
again
he
was
wearing
his
coarse
gown
girt
with
a
rope
his
bare
chest
covered
with
gray
hair
could
be
seen
under
his
hempen
shirt
his
feet
were
bare
as
soon
as
he
began
waving
his
arms
the
cruel
irons
he
wore
under
his
gown
could
be
heard
clanking
father
passy
paused
in
his
reading
stepped
forward
and
stood
before
him
waiting
what
have
you
come
for
worthy
father
why
do
you
offend
against
good
order
why
do
you
disturb
the
peace
of
the
flock
he
said
at
last
looking
sternly
at
him
what
have
i
come
for
you
ask
why
what
is
your
faith
shouted
father
ferapont
crazily
ive
come
here
to
drive
out
your
visitors
the
unclean
devils
ive
come
to
see
how
many
have
gathered
here
while
i
have
been
away
i
want
to
sweep
them
out
with
a
birch
broom
you
cast
out
the
evil
spirit
but
perhaps
you
are
serving
him
yourself
father
passy
went
on
fearlessly
and
who
can
say
of
himself
i
am
holy
can
you
father
i
am
unclean
not
holy
i
would
not
sit
in
an
armchair
and
would
not
have
them
bow
down
to
me
as
an
idol
thundered
father
ferapont
nowadays
folk
destroy
the
true
faith
the
dead
man
your
saint
he
turned
to
the
crowd
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
coffin
did
not
believe
in
devils
he
gave
medicine
to
keep
off
the
devils
and
so
they
have
become
as
common
as
spiders
in
the
corners
and
now
he
has
begun
to
stink
himself
in
that
we
see
a
great
sign
from
god
the
incident
he
referred
to
was
this
one
of
the
monks
was
haunted
in
his
dreams
and
later
on
in
waking
moments
by
visions
of
evil
spirits
when
in
the
utmost
terror
he
confided
this
to
father
zossima
the
elder
had
advised
continual
prayer
and
rigid
fasting
but
when
that
was
of
no
use
he
advised
him
while
persisting
in
prayer
and
fasting
to
take
a
special
medicine
many
persons
were
shocked
at
the
time
and
wagged
their
heads
as
they
talked
over
itand
most
of
all
father
ferapont
to
whom
some
of
the
censorious
had
hastened
to
report
this
extraordinary
counsel
on
the
part
of
the
elder
go
away
father
said
father
passy
in
a
commanding
voice
its
not
for
man
to
judge
but
for
god
perhaps
we
see
here
a
sign
which
neither
you
nor
i
nor
any
one
of
us
is
able
to
comprehend
go
father
and
do
not
trouble
the
flock
he
repeated
impressively
he
did
not
keep
the
fasts
according
to
the
rule
and
therefore
the
sign
has
come
that
is
clear
and
its
a
sin
to
hide
it
the
fanatic
carried
away
by
a
zeal
that
outstripped
his
reason
would
not
be
quieted
he
was
seduced
by
sweetmeats
ladies
brought
them
to
him
in
their
pockets
he
sipped
tea
he
worshiped
his
belly
filling
it
with
sweet
things
and
his
mind
with
haughty
thoughts
and
for
this
he
is
put
to
shame
you
speak
lightly
father
father
passy
too
raised
his
voice
i
admire
your
fasting
and
severities
but
you
speak
lightly
like
some
frivolous
youth
fickle
and
childish
go
away
father
i
command
you
father
passy
thundered
in
conclusion
i
will
go
said
ferapont
seeming
somewhat
taken
aback
but
still
as
bitter
you
learned
men
you
are
so
clever
you
look
down
upon
my
humbleness
i
came
hither
with
little
learning
and
here
i
have
forgotten
what
i
did
know
god
himself
has
preserved
me
in
my
weakness
from
your
subtlety
father
passy
stood
over
him
waiting
resolutely
father
ferapont
paused
and
suddenly
leaning
his
cheek
on
his
hand
despondently
pronounced
in
a
singsong
voice
looking
at
the
coffin
of
the
dead
elder
tomorrow
they
will
sing
over
him
our
helper
and
defendera
splendid
anthemand
over
me
when
i
die
all
theyll
sing
will
be

earthly
joya
little
canticle6
he
added
with
tearful
regret
you
are
proud
and
puffed
up
this
is
a
vain
place
he
shouted
suddenly
like
a
madman
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
turned
quickly
and
quickly
descended
the
steps
the
crowd
awaiting
him
below
wavered
some
followed
him
at
once
and
some
lingered
for
the
cell
was
still
open
and
father
passy
following
father
ferapont
on
to
the
steps
stood
watching
him
but
the
excited
old
fanatic
was
not
completely
silenced
walking
twenty
steps
away
he
suddenly
turned
towards
the
setting
sun
raised
both
his
arms
and
as
though
some
one
had
cut
him
down
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
loud
scream
my
god
has
conquered
christ
has
conquered
the
setting
sun
he
shouted
frantically
stretching
up
his
hands
to
the
sun
and
falling
face
downwards
on
the
ground
he
sobbed
like
a
little
child
shaken
by
his
tears
and
spreading
out
his
arms
on
the
ground
then
all
rushed
up
to
him
there
were
exclamations
and
sympathetic
sobs

a
kind
of
frenzy
seemed
to
take
possession
of
them
all
this
is
the
one
who
is
a
saint
this
is
the
one
who
is
a
holy
man
some
cried
aloud
losing
their
fear
this
is
he
who
should
be
an
elder
others
added
malignantly
he
wouldnt
be
an
elder

he
would
refuse

he
wouldnt
serve
a
cursed
innovation

he
wouldnt
imitate
their
foolery
other
voices
chimed
in
at
once
and
it
is
hard
to
say
how
far
they
might
have
gone
but
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
summoning
them
to
service
all
began
crossing
themselves
at
once
father
ferapont
too
got
up
and
crossing
himself
went
back
to
his
cell
without
looking
round
still
uttering
exclamations
which
were
utterly
incoherent
a
few
followed
him
but
the
greater
number
dispersed
hastening
to
service
father
passy
let
father
iosif
read
in
his
place
and
went
down
the
frantic
outcries
of
bigots
could
not
shake
him
but
his
heart
was
suddenly
filled
with
melancholy
for
some
special
reason
and
he
felt
that
he
stood
still
and
suddenly
wondered
why
am
i
sad
even
to
dejection
and
immediately
grasped
with
surprise
that
his
sudden
sadness
was
due
to
a
very
small
and
special
cause
in
the
crowd
thronging
at
the
entrance
to
the
cell
he
had
noticed
alyosha
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
felt
at
once
a
pang
at
heart
on
seeing
him
can
that
boy
mean
so
much
to
my
heart
now
he
asked
himself
wondering
at
that
moment
alyosha
passed
him
hurrying
away
but
not
in
the
direction
of
the
church
their
eyes
met
alyosha
quickly
turned
away
his
eyes
and
dropped
them
to
the
ground
and
from
the
boys
look
alone
father
passy
guessed
what
a
great
change
was
taking
place
in
him
at
that
moment
have
you
too
fallen
into
temptation
cried
father
passy
can
you
be
with
those
of
little
faith
he
added
mournfully
alyosha
stood
still
and
gazed
vaguely
at
father
passy
but
quickly
turned
his
eyes
away
again
and
again
looked
on
the
ground
he
stood
sideways
and
did
not
turn
his
face
to
father
passy
who
watched
him
attentively
where
are
you
hastening
the
bell
calls
to
service
he
asked
again
but
again
alyosha
gave
no
answer
are
you
leaving
the
hermitage
what
without
asking
leave
without
asking
a
blessing
alyosha
suddenly
gave
a
wry
smile
cast
a
strange
very
strange
look
at
the
father
to
whom
his
former
guide
the
former
sovereign
of
his
heart
and
mind
his
beloved
elder
had
confided
him
as
he
lay
dying
and
suddenly
still
without
speaking
waved
his
hand
as
though
not
caring
even
to
be
respectful
and
with
rapid
steps
walked
towards
the
gates
away
from
the
hermitage
you
will
come
back
again
murmured
father
passy
looking
after
him
with
sorrowful
surprise
chapter
ii
a
critical
moment
father
passy
of
course
was
not
wrong
when
he
decided
that
his
dear
boy
would
come
back
again
perhaps
indeed
to
some
extent
he
penetrated
with
insight
into
the
true
meaning
of
alyoshas
spiritual
condition
yet
i
must
frankly
own
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
give
a
clear
account
of
that
strange
vague
moment
in
the
life
of
the
young
hero
i
love
so
much
to
father
passys
sorrowful
question
are
you
too
with
those
of
little
faith
i
could
of
course
confidently
answer
for
alyosha
no
he
is
not
with
those
of
little
faith
quite
the
contrary
indeed
all
his
trouble
came
from
the
fact
that
he
was
of
great
faith
but
still
the
trouble
was
there
and
was
so
agonizing
that
even
long
afterwards
alyosha
thought
of
that
sorrowful
day
as
one
of
the
bitterest
and
most
fatal
days
of
his
life
if
the
question
is
asked
could
all
his
grief
and
disturbance
have
been
only
due
to
the
fact
that
his
elders
body
had
shown
signs
of
premature
decomposition
instead
of
at
once
performing
miracles
i
must
answer
without
beating
about
the
bush
yes
it
certainly
was
i
would
only
beg
the
reader
not
to
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
laugh
at
my
young
heros
pure
heart
i
am
far
from
intending
to
apologize
for
him
or
to
justify
his
innocent
faith
on
the
ground
of
his
youth
or
the
little
progress
he
had
made
in
his
studies
or
any
such
reason
i
must
declare
on
the
contrary
that
i
have
genuine
respect
for
the
qualities
of
his
heart
no
doubt
a
youth
who
received
impressions
cautiously
whose
love
was
lukewarm
and
whose
mind
was
too
prudent
for
his
age
and
so
of
little
value
such
a
young
man
might
i
admit
have
avoided
what
happened
to
my
hero
but
in
some
cases
it
is
really
more
creditable
to
be
carried
away
by
an
emotion
however
unreasonable
which
springs
from
a
great
love
than
to
be
unmoved
and
this
is
even
truer
in
youth
for
a
young
man
who
is
always
sensible
is
to
be
suspected
and
is
of
little
worththats
my
opinion
but
reasonable
people
will
exclaim
perhaps
every
young
man
cannot
believe
in
such
a
superstition
and
your
hero
is
no
model
for
others
to
this
i
reply
again
yes
my
hero
had
faith
a
faith
holy
and
steadfast
but
still
i
am
not
going
to
apologize
for
him
though
i
declared
above
and
perhaps
too
hastily
that
i
should
not
explain
or
justify
my
hero
i
see
that
some
explanation
is
necessary
for
the
understanding
of
the
rest
of
my
story
let
me
say
then
it
was
not
a
question
of
miracles
there
was
no
frivolous
and
impatient
expectation
of
miracles
in
his
mind
and
alyosha
needed
no
miracles
at
the
time
for
the
triumph
of
some
preconceived
ideaoh
no
not
at
allwhat
he
saw
before
all
was
one
figurethe
figure
of
his
beloved
elder
the
figure
of
that
holy
man
whom
he
revered
with
such
adoration
the
fact
is
that
all
the
love
that
lay
concealed
in
his
pure
young
heart
for
every
one
and
everything
had
for
the
past
year
been
concentratedand
perhaps
wrongly
soon
one
being
his
beloved
elder
it
is
true
that
being
had
for
so
long
been
accepted
by
him
as
his
ideal
that
all
his
young
strength
and
energy
could
not
but
turn
towards
that
ideal
even
to
the
forgetting
at
the
moment
of
every
one
and
everything
he
remembered
afterwards
how
on
that
terrible
day
he
had
entirely
forgotten
his
brother
dmitri
about
whom
he
had
been
so
anxious
and
troubled
the
day
before
he
had
forgotten
too
to
take
the
two
hundred
roubles
to
ilushas
father
though
he
had
so
warmly
intended
to
do
so
the
preceding
evening
but
again
it
was
not
miracles
he
needed
but
only
the
higher
justice
which
had
been
in
his
belief
outraged
by
the
blow
that
had
so
suddenly
and
cruelly
wounded
his
heart
and
what
does
it
signify
that
this
justice
looked
for
by
alyosha
inevitably
took
the
shape
of
miracles
to
be
wrought
immediately
by
the
ashes
of
his
adored
teacher
why
every
one
in
the
monastery
cherished
the
same
thought
and
the
same
hope
even
those
whose
intellects
alyosha
revered
father
passy
himself
for
instance
and
so
alyosha
untroubled
by
doubts
clothed
his
dreams
too
in
the
same
form
as
all
the
rest
and
a
whole
year
of
life
in
the
monastery
had
formed
the
habit
of
this
expectation
in
his
heart
but
it
was
justice
justice
he
thirsted
for
not
simply
miracles
and
now
the
man
who
should
he
believed
have
been
exalted
above
every
one
in
the
whole
world
that
man
instead
of
receiving
the
glory
that
was
his
due
was
suddenly
degraded
and
dishonored
what
for
who
had
judged
him
who
could
have
decreed
this
those
were
the
questions
that
wrung
his
inexperienced
and
virginal
heart
he
could
not
endure
without
mortification
without
resentment
even
that
the
holiest
of
holy
men
should
have
been
exposed
to
the
jeering
and
spiteful
mockery
of
the
frivolous
crowd
so
inferior
to
him
even
had
there
been
no
miracles
had
there
been
nothing
marvelous
to
justify
his
hopes
why
this
indignity
why
this
humiliation
why
this
premature
decay
in
excess
of
nature
as
the
spiteful
monks
said
why
this
sign
from
heaven
which
they
so
triumphantly
acclaimed
in
company
with
father
ferapont
and
why
did
they
believe
they
had
gained
the
right
to
acclaim
it
where
is
the
finger
of
providence
why
did
providence
hide
its
face
at
the
most
critical
moment
so
alyosha
thought
it
as
though
voluntarily
submitting
to
the
blind
dumb
pitiless
laws
of
nature
that
was
why
alyoshas
heart
was
bleeding
and
of
course
as
i
have
said
already
the
sting
of
it
all
was
that
the
man
he
loved
above
everything
on
earth
should
be
put
to
shame
and
humiliated
this
murmuring
may
have
been
shallow
and
unreasonable
in
my
hero
but
i
repeat
again
for
the
third
timeand
am
prepared
to
admit
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
defend
my
feelingi
am
glad
that
my
hero
showed
himself
not
too
reasonable
at
that
moment
for
any
man
of
sense
will
always
come
back
to
reason
in
time
but
if
love
does
not
gain
the
upper
hand
in
a
boys
heart
at
such
an
exceptional
moment
when
will
it
i
will
not
however
omit
to
mention
something
strange
which
came
for
a
time
to
the
surface
of
alyoshas
mind
at
this
fatal
and
obscure
moment
this
new
something
was
the
harassing
impression
left
by
the
conversation
with
ivan
which
now
persistently
haunted
alyoshas
mind
at
this
moment
it
haunted
him
oh
it
was
not
that
something
of
the
fundamental
elemental
so
to
speak
faith
of
his
soul
had
been
shaken
he
loved
his
god
and
believed
in
him
steadfastly
though
he
was
suddenly
murmuring
against
him
yet
a
vague
but
tormenting
and
evil
impression
left
by
his
conversation
with
ivan
the
day
before
suddenly
revived
again
now
in
his
soul
and
seemed
forcing
its
way
to
the
surface
of
his
consciousness
it
had
begun
to
get
dusk
when
rakitin
crossing
the
pine
copse
from
the
hermitage
to
the
monastery
suddenly
noticed
alyosha
lying
face
downwards
on
the
ground
under
a
tree
not
moving
and
apparently
asleep
he
went
up
and
called
him
by
his
name
you
here
alexey
can
you
have
he
began
wondering
but
broke
off
he
had
meant
to
say
can
you
have
come
to
this
alyosha
did
not
look
at
him
but
from
a
slight
movement
rakitin
at
once
saw
that
he
heard
and
understood
him
whats
the
matter
he
went
on
but
the
surprise
in
his
face
gradually
passed
into
a
smile
that
became
more
and
more
ironical
i
say
ive
been
looking
for
you
for
the
last
two
hours
you
suddenly
disappeared
what
are
you
about
what
foolery
is
this
you
might
just
look
at
me
alyosha
raised
his
head
sat
up
and
leaned
his
back
against
the
tree
he
was
not
crying
but
there
was
a
look
of
suffering
and
irritability
in
his
face
he
did
not
look
at
rakitin
however
but
looked
away
to
one
side
of
him
do
you
know
your
face
is
quite
changed
theres
none
of
your
famous
mildness
to
be
seen
in
it
are
you
angry
with
some
one
have
they
been
illtreating
you
let
me
alone
said
alyosha
suddenly
with
a
weary
gesture
of
his
hand
still
looking
away
from
him
oho
so
thats
how
we
are
feeling
so
you
can
shout
at
people
like
other
mortals
that
is
a
comedown
from
the
angels
i
say
alyosha
you
have
surprised
me
do
you
hear
i
mean
it
its
long
since
ive
been
surprised
at
anything
here
i
always
took
you
for
an
educated
man
alyosha
at
last
looked
at
him
but
vaguely
as
though
scarcely
understanding
what
he
said
can
you
really
be
so
upset
simply
because
your
old
man
has
begun
to
stink
you
dont
mean
to
say
you
seriously
believed
that
he
was
going
to
work
miracles
exclaimed
rakitin
genuinely
surprised
again
i
believed
i
believe
i
want
to
believe
and
i
will
believe
what
more
do
you
want
cried
alyosha
irritably
nothing
at
all
my
boy
damn
it
all
why
no
schoolboy
of
thirteen
believes
in
that
now
but
there
so
now
you
are
in
a
temper
with
your
god
you
are
rebelling
against
him
he
hasnt
given
promotion
he
hasnt
bestowed
the
order
of
merit
eh
you
are
a
set
alyosha
gazed
a
long
while
with
his
eyes
half
closed
at
rakitin
and
there
was
a
sudden
gleam
in
his
eyes

but
not
of
anger
with
rakitin
i
am
not
rebelling
against
my
god
i
simply
dont
accept
his
world

alyosha
suddenly
smiled
a
forced
smile
how
do
you
mean
you
dont
accept
the
world
rakitin
thought
a
moment
over
his
answer
what
idiocy
is
this
alyosha
did
not
answer
come
enough
nonsense
now
to
business
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
to
day
i
dont
remember
i
think
i
have
you
need
keeping
up
to
judge
by
your
face
it
makes
one
sorry
to
look
at
you
you
didnt
sleep
all
night
either
i
hear
you
had
a
meeting
in
there
and
then
all
this
bobbery
afterwards
most
likely
youve
had
nothing
to
eat
but
a
mouthful
of
holy
bread
ive
got
some
sausage
in
my
pocket
ive
brought
it
from
the
town
in
case
of
need
only
you
wont
eat
sausage
give
me
some
i
say
you
are
going
it
why
its
a
regular
mutiny
with
barricades
well
my
boy
we
must
make
the
most
of
it
come
to
my
place
i
shouldnt
mind
a
drop
of
vodka
myself
i
am
tired
to
death
vodka
is
going
too
far
for
you
i
suppose

or
would
you
like
some
give
me
some
vodka
too
hullo
you
surprise
me
brother
rakitin
looked
at
him
in
amazement
well
one
way
or
another
vodka
or
sausage
this
is
a
jolly
fine
chance
and
mustnt
be
missed
come
along
alyosha
got
up
in
silence
and
followed
rakitin
if
your
little
brother
ivan
could
see
thiswouldnt
he
be
surprised
by
the
way
your
brother
ivan
set
off
to
moscow
this
morning
did
you
know
yes
answered
alyosha
listlessly
and
suddenly
the
image
of
his
brother
dmitri
rose
before
his
mind
but
only
for
a
minute
and
though
it
reminded
him
of
something
that
must
not
be
put
off
for
a
moment
some
duty
some
terrible
obligation
even
that
reminder
made
no
impression
on
him
did
not
reach
his
heart
and
instantly
faded
out
of
his
mind
and
was
forgotten
but
a
long
while
afterwards
alyosha
remembered
this
your
brother
ivan
declared
once
that
i
was
a
liberal
booby
with
no
talents
whatsoever
once
you
too
could
not
resist
letting
me
know
i
was
dishonorable
well
i
should
like
to
see
what
your
talents
and
sense
of
honor
will
do
for
you
now
this
phrase
rakitin
finished
to
himself
in
a
whisper
listen
he
said
aloud
lets
go
by
the
path
beyond
the
monastery
straight
to
the
town
hm
i
ought
to
go
to
madame
hohlakovs
by
the
way
only
fancy
ive
written
to
tell
her
everything
that
happened
and
would
you
believe
it
she
answered
me
instantly
in
pencil
the
lady
has
a
passion
for
writing
notes
that
she
would
never
have
expected
such
conduct
from
a
man
of
such
a
reverend
character
as
father
zossima
that
was
her
very
word
conduct
she
is
angry
too
eh
you
are
a
set
stay
he
cried
suddenly
again
he
suddenly
stopped
and
taking
alyosha
by
the
shoulder
made
him
stop
too
do
you
know
alyosha
he
peeped
inquisitively
into
his
eyes
absorbed
in
a
sudden
new
thought
which
had
dawned
on
him
and
though
he
was
laughing
outwardly
he
was
evidently
afraid
to
utter
that
new
idea
aloud
so
difficult
he
still
found
it
to
believe
in
the
strange
and
unexpected
mood
in
which
he
now
saw
alyosha
alyosha
do
you
know
where
we
had
better
go
he
brought
out
at
last
timidly
and
insinuatingly
i
dont
care

where
you
like
lets
go
to
grushenka
eh
will
you
come
pronounced
rakitin
at
last
trembling
with
timid
suspense
lets
go
to
grushenka
alyosha
answered
calmly
at
once
and
this
prompt
and
calm
agreement
was
such
a
surprise
to
rakitin
that
he
almost
started
back
well
i
say
he
cried
in
amazement
but
seizing
alyosha
firmly
by
the
arm
he
led
him
along
the
path
still
dreading
that
he
would
change
his
mind
they
walked
along
in
silence
rakitin
was
positively
afraid
to
talk
and
how
glad
she
will
be
how
delighted
he
muttered
but
lapsed
into
silence
again
and
indeed
it
was
not
to
please
grushenka
he
was
taking
alyosha
to
her
he
was
a
practical
person
and
never
undertook
anything
without
a
prospect
of
gain
for
himself
his
object
in
this
case
was
twofold
first
a
revengeful
desire
to
see
the
downfall
of
the
righteous
and
alyoshas
fall
from
the
saints
to
the
sinners
over
which
he
was
already
gloating
in
his
imagination
and
in
the
second
place
he
had
in
view
a
certain
material
gain
for
himself
of
which
more
will
be
said
later
so
the
critical
moment
has
come
he
thought
to
himself
with
spiteful
glee
and
we
shall
catch
it
on
the
hop
for
its
just
what
we
want
chapter
iii
an
onion
grushenka
lived
in
the
busiest
part
of
the
town
near
the
cathedral
square
in
a
small
wooden
lodge
in
the
courtyard
belonging
to
the
house
of
the
widow
morozov
the
house
was
a
large
stone
building
of
two
stories
old
and
very
ugly
the
widow
led
a
secluded
life
with
her
two
unmarried
nieces
who
were
also
elderly
women
she
had
no
need
to
let
her
lodge
but
every
one
knew
that
she
had
taken
in
grushenka
as
a
lodger
four
years
before
solely
to
please
her
kinsman
the
merchant
samsonov
who
was
known
to
be
the
girls
protector
it
was
said
that
the
jealous
old
mans
object
in
placing
his
favorite
with
the
widow
morozov
was
that
the
old
woman
should
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
her
new
lodgers
conduct
but
this
sharp
eye
soon
proved
to
be
unnecessary
and
in
the
end
the
widow
morozov
seldom
met
grushenka
and
did
not
worry
her
by
looking
after
her
in
any
way
it
is
true
that
four
years
had
passed
since
the
old
man
had
brought
the
slim
delicate
shy
timid
dreamy
and
sad
girl
of
eighteen
from
the
chief
town
of
the
province
and
much
had
happened
since
then
little
was
known
of
the
girls
history
in
the
town
and
that
little
was
vague
nothing
more
had
been
learnt
during
the
last
four
years
even
after
many
persons
had
become
interested
in
the
beautiful
young
woman
into
whom
agrafena
alexandrovna
had
meanwhile
developed
there
were
rumors
that
she
had
been
at
seventeen
betrayed
by
some
one
some
sort
of
officer
and
immediately
afterwards
abandoned
by
him
the
officer
had
gone
away
and
afterwards
married
while
grushenka
had
been
left
in
poverty
and
disgrace
it
was
said
however
that
though
grushenka
had
been
raised
from
destitution
by
the
old
man
samsonov
she
came
of
a
respectable
family
belonging
to
the
clerical
class
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
deacon
or
something
of
the
sort
and
now
after
four
years
the
sensitive
injured
and
pathetic
little
orphan
had
become
a
plump
rosy
beauty
of
the
russian
type
a
woman
of
bold
and
determined
character
proud
and
insolent
she
had
a
good
head
for
business
was
acquisitive
saving
and
careful
and
by
fair
means
or
foul
had
succeeded
it
was
said
in
amassing
a
little
fortune
there
was
only
one
point
on
which
all
were
agreed
grushenka
was
not
easily
to
be
approached
and
except
her
aged
protector
there
had
not
been
one
man
who
could
boast
of
her
favors
during
those
four
years
it
was
a
positive
fact
for
there
had
been
a
good
many
especially
during
the
last
two
years
who
had
attempted
to
obtain
those
favors
but
all
their
efforts
had
been
in
vain
and
some
of
these
suitors
had
been
forced
to
beat
an
undignified
and
even
comic
retreat
owing
to
the
firm
and
ironical
resistance
they
met
from
the
strongwilled
young
person
it
was
known
too
that
the
young
person
had
especially
of
late
been
given
to
what
is
called
speculation
and
that
she
had
shown
marked
abilities
in
that
direction
so
that
many
people
began
to
say
that
she
was
no
better
than
a
jew
it
was
not
that
she
lent
money
on
interest
but
it
was
known
for
instance
that
she
had
for
some
time
past
in
partnership
with
old
karamazov
actually
invested
in
the
purchase
of
bad
debts
for
a
trifle
a
tenth
of
their
nominal
value
and
afterwards
had
made
out
of
them
ten
times
their
value
the
old
widower
samsonov
a
man
of
large
fortune
was
stingy
and
merciless
he
tyrannized
over
his
grownup
sons
but
for
the
last
year
during
which
he
had
been
ill
and
lost
the
use
of
his
swollen
legs
he
had
fallen
greatly
under
the
influence
of
his
protge
whom
he
had
at
first
kept
strictly
and
in
humble
surroundings
on
lenten
fare
as
the
wits
said
at
the
time
but
grushenka
had
succeeded
in
emancipating
herself
while
she
established
in
him
a
boundless
belief
in
her
fidelity
the
old
man
now
long
since
dead
had
had
a
large
business
in
his
day
and
was
also
a
noteworthy
character
miserly
and
hard
as
flint
though
grushenkas
hold
upon
him
was
so
strong
that
he
could
not
live
without
her
it
had
been
so
especially
for
the
last
two
years
he
did
not
settle
any
considerable
fortune
on
her
and
would
not
have
been
moved
to
do
so
if
she
had
threatened
to
leave
him
but
he
had
presented
her
with
a
small
sum
and
even
that
was
a
surprise
to
every
one
when
it
became
known
you
are
a
wench
with
brains
he
said
to
her
when
he
gave
her
eight
thousand
roubles
and
you
must
look
after
yourself
but
let
me
tell
you
that
except
your
yearly
allowance
as
before
youll
get
nothing
more
from
me
to
the
day
of
my
death
and
ill
leave
you
nothing
in
my
will
either
and
he
kept
his
word
he
died
and
left
everything
to
his
sons
whom
with
their
wives
and
children
he
had
treated
all
his
life
as
servants
grushenka
was
not
even
mentioned
in
his
will
all
this
became
known
afterwards
he
helped
grushenka
with
his
advice
to
increase
her
capital
and
put
business
in
her
way
when
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
first
came
into
contact
with
grushenka
over
a
piece
of
speculation
ended
to
his
own
surprise
by
falling
madly
in
love
with
her
old
samsonov
gravely
ill
as
he
was
was
immensely
amused
it
is
remarkable
that
throughout
their
whole
acquaintance
grushenka
was
absolutely
and
spontaneously
open
with
the
old
man
and
he
seems
to
have
been
the
only
person
in
the
world
with
whom
she
was
so
of
late
when
dmitri
too
had
come
on
the
scene
with
his
love
the
old
man
left
off
laughing
on
the
contrary
he
once
gave
grushenka
a
stern
and
earnest
piece
of
advice
if
you
have
to
choose
between
the
two
father
or
son
youd
better
choose
the
old
man
if
only
you
make
sure
the
old
scoundrel
will
marry
you
and
settle
some
fortune
on
you
beforehand
but
dont
keep
on
with
the
captain
youll
get
no
good
out
of
that
these
were
the
very
words
of
the
old
profligate
who
felt
already
that
his
death
was
not
far
off
and
who
actually
died
five
months
later
i
will
note
too
in
passing
that
although
many
in
our
town
knew
of
the
grotesque
and
monstrous
rivalry
of
the
karamazovs
father
and
son
the
object
of
which
was
grushenka
scarcely
any
one
understood
what
really
underlay
her
attitude
to
both
of
them
even
grushenkas
two
servants
after
the
catastrophe
of
which
we
will
speak
later
testified
in
court
that
she
received
dmitri
fyodorovitch
simply
from
fear
because
he
threatened
to
murder
her
these
servants
were
an
old
cook
invalidish
and
almost
deaf
who
came
from
grushenkas
old
home
and
her
granddaughter
a
smart
young
girl
of
twenty
who
performed
the
duties
of
a
maid
grushenka
lived
very
economically
and
her
surroundings
were
anything
but
luxurious
her
lodge
consisted
of
three
rooms
furnished
with
mahogany
furniture
in
the
fashion
of
1820
belonging
to
her
landlady
it
was
quite
dark
when
rakitin
and
alyosha
entered
her
rooms
yet
they
were
not
lighted
up
grushenka
was
lying
down
in
her
drawingroom
on
the
big
hard
clumsy
sofa
with
a
mahogany
back
the
sofa
was
covered
with
shabby
and
ragged
leather
under
her
head
she
had
two
white
down
pillows
taken
from
her
bed
she
was
lying
stretched
out
motionless
on
her
back
with
her
hands
behind
her
head
she
was
dressed
as
though
expecting
some
one
in
a
black
silk
dress
with
a
dainty
lace
fichu
on
her
head
which
was
very
becoming
over
her
shoulders
was
thrown
a
lace
shawl
pinned
with
a
massive
gold
brooch
she
certainly
was
expecting
some
one
she
lay
as
though
impatient
and
weary
her
face
rather
pale
and
her
lips
and
eyes
hot
restlessly
tapping
the
arm
of
the
sofa
with
the
tip
of
her
right
foot
the
appearance
of
rakitin
and
alyosha
caused
a
slight
excitement
from
the
hall
they
could
hear
grushenka
leap
up
from
the
sofa
and
cry
out
in
a
frightened
voice
whos
there
but
the
maid
met
the
visitors
and
at
once
called
back
to
her
mistress
its
not
he
its
nothing
only
other
visitors
what
can
be
the
matter
muttered
rakitin
leading
alyosha
into
the
drawingroom
grushenka
was
standing
by
the
sofa
as
though
still
alarmed
a
thick
coil
of
her
dark
brown
hair
escaped
from
its
lace
covering
and
fell
on
her
right
shoulder
but
she
did
not
notice
it
and
did
not
put
it
back
till
she
had
gazed
at
her
visitors
and
recognized
them
ah
its
you
rakitin
you
quite
frightened
me
whom
have
you
brought
who
is

with
you
good
heavens
you
have
brought
him
she
exclaimed
recognizing
alyosha
do
send
for
candles
said
rakitin
with
the
freeandeasy
air
of
a
most
intimate
friend
who
is
privileged
to
give
orders
in
the
house

of
course
candles
fenya

him
a
candle
well

have
chosen
a
moment
to
bring
him
she
exclaimed
again
nodding
towards
alyosha
and
turning
to
the
lookingglass
she
began
quickly
fastening
up
her
hair
with
both
hands
she
seemed
displeased

i
managed
to
please

rakitin
instantly
almost
offended

frightened
me

with
a
smile
to
alyosha

my
dear
alyosha

i
told

a
lie
i
told
him
that

was
going
to
spend
the
evening
with
my
old
man
kuzma
kuzmitch
and

up
his

one
whole
evening
a
week
with
him
making
up
his
accounts
we
lock
ourselves
in
and
he
counts
on
the
reckoning
beads
while
i
sit
and
put
things
down
in
the
book
i
am
the
only
person
he
trusts

and

afraid
of
your
brother
mitya
today
alyosha
grushenka
spoke
aloud
and
though
she
was
alarmed
she
seemed
very
happy
about
something
why
are
you
so
afraid
of
mitya
today
inquired
rakitin
i
should

timid
with
him

twist
him
round
your
little
finger
i

feel

didnt
that
i
should

kuzmitchs

be
in
his
ambush

behind
fyodor
pavlovitchs
in
the
garden
watching
for
me
and

asked
him
to

sure
to
come
at
midnight
to
fetch
me
home
he
went
away
and
i
sat
ten
minutes
with
kuzma
kuzmitch
and
came
back
here
again

ive
never

up
as
if
you
were
going
to
a
ball
rakitin
looked
her
up
and
down
much
you
know
about
balls
and
do
you
know
much
about
them
i
have
seen
a
ball
the
year
before
last
kuzma
kuzmitchs
son
was
married
and
i
looked
on
from
the
gallery
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
be
talking
to
you
rakitin
while
a
prince
like
this
is
standing
here
such
a
visitor
alyosha
my
dear
boy
i
gaze
at
you
and
cant
believe
my
eyes
good
heavens
can
you
have
come
here
to
see
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
never
had
a
thought
of
seeing
you
and
i
didnt
think
that
you
would
ever
come
and
see
me
though
this
is
not
the
moment
now
i
am
awfully
glad
to
see
you
sit
down
on
the
sofa
here
thats
right
my
bright
young
moon
i
really
cant
take
it
in
even
now
eh
rakitin
if
only
you
had
brought
him
yesterday
or
the
day
before
but
i
am
glad
as
it
is
perhaps
its
better
he
has
come
now
at
such
a
moment
and
not
the
day
before
yesterday
she
gayly
sat
down
beside
alyosha
on
the
sofa
looking
at
him
with
positive
delight
and
she
really
was
glad
she
was
not
lying
when
she
said
so
her
eyes
glowed
her
lips
laughed
but
it
was
a
goodhearted
merry
laugh
alyosha
had
not
expected
to
see
such
a
kind
expression
in
her
face
he
had
hardly
met
her
till
the
day
before
he
had
formed
an
alarming
idea
of
her
and
had
been
horribly
distressed
the
day
before
by
the
spiteful
and
treacherous
trick
she
had
played
on
katerina
ivanovna
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
her
now
altogether
different
from
what
he
had
expected
and
crushed
as
he
was
by
his
own
sorrow
his
eyes
involuntarily
rested
on
her
with
attention
her
whole
manner
seemed
changed
for
the
better
since
yesterday
there
was
scarcely
any
trace
of
that
mawkish
sweetness
in
her
speech
of
that
voluptuous
softness
in
her
movements
everything
was
simple
and
goodnatured
her
gestures
were
rapid
direct
confiding
but
she
was
greatly
excited
dear
me
how
everything
comes
together
today
she
chattered
on
again
and
why
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
alyosha
i
couldnt
say
myself

pestering

object

suppose
i
had
a
different
object

but

not
the
moment

goodnatured
now

you
standing
youve
sat
down
already
theres
no
fear
of
rakitins
forgetting
to
look
after
himself
look
alyosha
hes
sitting
there
opposite
us
so
offended
that
i
didnt
ask
him
to
sit
down
before
you
ugh
rakitin
is
such
a
one
to
take
offense
laughed
grushenka
dont
be
angry
rakitin
im
kind
today
why
are
you
so
depressed
alyosha
are
you
afraid
of
me
she
peeped
into
his
eyes
with
merry
mockery
hes
sad
the
promotion
has
not
been
given
boomed
rakitin
what
promotion
his
elder
stinks
what
you
are
talking
some
nonsense
you
want
to
say
something
nasty
be
quiet
you
stupid
let
me
sit
on
your
knee
alyosha
like
this
she
suddenly
skipped
forward
and
jumped
laughing
on
his
knee
like
a
nestling
kitten
with
her
right
arm
about
his
neck
ill
cheer
you
up
my
pious
boy
yes
really
will
you
let
me
sit
on
your
knee
you
wont
be
angry
if
you
tell
me
ill
get
off
alyosha
did
not
speak
he
sat
afraid
to
move
he
heard
her
words
if
you
tell
me
ill
get
off
but
he
did
not
answer
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
heart
such
as
rakitin
for
instance
watching
him
malignantly
from
his
corner
might
have
expected
or
fancied
the
great
grief
in
his
heart
swallowed
up
every
sensation
that
might
have
been
aroused
and
if
only
he
could
have
thought
clearly
at
that
moment
he
would
have
realized
that
he
had
now
the
strongest
armor
to
protect
him
from
every
lust
and
temptation
yet
in
spite
of
the
vague
irresponsiveness
of
his
spiritual
condition
and
the
sorrow
that
overwhelmed
him
he
could
not
help
wondering
at
a
new
and
strange
sensation
in
his
heart
this
woman
this
dreadful
woman
had
no
terror
for
him
now
none
of
that
terror
that
had
stirred
in
his
soul
at
any
passing
thought
of
woman
on
the
contrary
this
woman
dreaded
above
all
women
sitting
now
on
his
knee
holding
him
in
her
arms
aroused
in
him
now
a
quite
different
unexpected
peculiar
feeling
a
feeling
of
the
intensest
and
purest
interest
without
a
trace
of
fear
of
his
former
terror
that
was
what
instinctively
surprised
him
youve
talked
nonsense
enough
cried
rakitin
youd
much
better

us
some
champagne

toadstool
but
he

different

message

ask
or

a
secret
rakitin
put
in
inquisitively
doing
his
best
to
pretend
not
to
notice
the
snubs
that
were
being
continually
aimed
at
him
ech
its
not
a
secret
and
you
know
it
too
grushenka
said
in
a
voice
suddenly
anxious
turning
her
head
towards
rakitin
and
drawing
a
little
away
from
alyosha
though
she
still
sat
on
his
knee
with
her
arm
round
his
neck

officer
is
coming

afraid
of
his
knife
be
quiet
rakitin
dont
remind
me
of
dmitri
fyodorovitch
he
has
bruised
my
heart
and
i
dont
want
to
think
of
that
at
this
moment
i
can
think
of
alyosha
here
i
can
look
at
alyosha

smile
at
me

foolishness

my
pleasure

smiling
how
kindly
he
looks
at
me
and
you

alyosha
ive
been
thinking
all
this
time
you
were
angry
with
me
because
of
the
day
before
yesterday
because
of
that
young
lady
i
was
a
cur
thats
the
truth
but
its
a
good
thing
it
happened
so
it
was
a
horrid
thing
but
a
good
thing
too
grushenka
smiled
dreamily
and
a
little
cruel
line
showed
in
her
smile
mitya
told
me
that
she
screamed
out
that
i
ought
to
be
flogged
i
did
insult
her
dreadfully
she
sent
for
me
she
wanted
to
make
a
conquest
of
me
to
win
me
over
with
her
chocolate
no
its
a
good
thing
it
did
end
like
that
she
smiled
again
but
i
am
still
afraid
of
your
being
angry
yes
thats
really
true
rakitin
put
in
suddenly
with
genuine
surprise
alyosha
she
is
really
afraid
of
a
chicken
like
you
he
is
a
chicken
to
you
rakitin

because
youve
no
conscience
thats
what
it
is
you
see
i
love
him
with
all
my
soul

declaration

the
priceless
message

a
womans
way
of
looking
at
it
dont
you
make
me
angry
rakitin
grushenka
caught
him
up
hotly
this
is
quite
different
i
love
alyosha
in
a
different
way
its
true
alyosha
i
had
sly
designs
on
you
before
for
i
am
a
horrid
violent
creature
but
at
other
times
ive
looked
upon
you
alyosha
as
my
conscience
ive
kept
thinking
how
any
one
like
that
must
despise
a
nasty
thing
like
me
i
thought
that
the
day
before
yesterday
as
i
ran
home
from
the
young
ladys
i
have
thought
of
you
a
long
time
in
that
way
alyosha
and
mitya
knows
ive
talked
to
him
about
it
mitya
understands
would
you
believe
it
i
sometimes
look
at
you
and
feel
ashamed
utterly
ashamed
of
myself
and
how
and
since
when
i
began
to
think
about
you
like
that
i
cant
say
i
dont
remember
fenya
came
in
and
put
a
tray
with
an
uncorked
bottle
and
three
glasses
of
champagne
on
the
table

glass
of
champagne

ready
to
dance

properly
he
added
looking
at
the
bottle
the
old
womans
poured
it
out
in
the
kitchen
and
the
bottles
been
brought
in
warm
and
without
a
cork
well
let
me
have
some
anyway
he
went
up
to
the
table
took
a
glass
emptied
it
at
one
gulp
and
poured
himself
out
another
one
doesnt
often
stumble
upon
champagne
he
said
licking
his
lips
now
alyosha

a
glass

what
you
can
do

took
a
glass
alyosha
took
his

it
and
put
it
back
no
id

he
smiled
gently
and
you
bragged
cried
rakitin
well

in
grushenka
i
really

whole
bottle
alone
rakitin
if
alyosha

some
i

touching
sentimentality
said
rakitin
tauntingly
and
shes
sitting
on
his
knee
too
hes
got
something
to
grieve
over
but
whats
the
matter
with
you
he
is
rebelling
against
his
god
and
ready
to
eat
sausage
how
so
his
elder
died
today
father
zossima
the
saint
so
father
zossima

dead
cried
grushenka
good
god
i
did
not
know
she
crossed
herself
devoutly
goodness
what
have
i
been
doing
sitting
on
his
knee
like
this
at
such
a
moment
she
started
up
as
though
in
dismay
instantly
slipped
off
his
knee
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
alyosha
bent
a
long
wondering
look
upon
her
and
a
light
seemed
to
dawn
in
his
face
rakitin
he
said
suddenly
in
a
firm
and
loud
voice
dont
taunt
me
with
having
rebelled
against
god
i
dont
want
to
feel
angry
with
you
so
you
must
be
kinder
too
ive
lost
a
treasure
such
as
you
have
never
had
and
you
cannot
judge
me
now
you
had
much
better
look
at
herdo
you
see
how
she
has
pity
on
me
i
came
here
to
find
a
wicked
souli
felt
drawn
to
evil
because
i
was
base
and
evil
myself
and
ive
found
a
true
sister
i
have
found
a
treasurea
loving
heart
she
had
pity
on
me
just
now
agrafena
alexandrovna
i
am
speaking
of
you
youve
raised
my
soul
from
the
depths
alyoshas
lips
were
quivering
and
he
caught
his
breath
she
has
saved
you
it
seems
laughed
rakitin
spitefully
and
she
meant
to
get
you
in
her
clutches
do
you
realize
that
stay
rakitin
grushenka
jumped
up
hush
both
of
you
now
ill
tell
you
all
about
it
hush
alyosha
your
words
make
me
ashamed
for
i
am
bad
and
not
goodthats
what
i
am
and
you
hush
rakitin
because
you
are
telling
lies
i
had
the
low
idea
of
trying
to
get
him
in
my
clutches
but
now
you
are
lying
now
its
all
different
and
dont
let
me
hear
anything
more
from
you
rakitin
all
this
grushenka
said
with
extreme
emotion
they
are
both
crazy
said
rakitin
looking
at
them
with
amazement
i
feel
as
though
i
were
in
a
madhouse
theyre
both
getting
so
feeble
theyll
begin
crying
in
a
minute
i
shall
begin
to
cry
i
shall
repeated
grushenka
he
called
me
his
sister
and
i
shall
never
forget
that
only
let
me
tell
you
rakitin
though
i
am
bad
i
did
give
away
an
onion
an
onion
hang
it
all
you
really
are
crazy
rakitin
wondered
at
their
enthusiasm
he
was
aggrieved
and
annoyed
though
he
might
have
reflected
that
each
of
them
was
just
passing
through
a
spiritual
crisis
such
as
does
not
come
often
in
a
lifetime
but
though
rakitin
was
very
sensitive
about
everything
that
concerned
himself
he
was
very
obtuse
as
regards
the
feelings
and
sensations
of
otherspartly
from
his
youth
and
inexperience
partly
from
his
intense
egoism
you
see
alyosha
grushenka
turned
to
him
with
a
nervous
laugh
i
was
boasting
when
i
told
rakitin
i
had
given
away
an
onion
but
its
not
to
boast
i
tell
you
about
it
its
only
a
story
but
its
a
nice
story
i
used
to
hear
it
when
i
was
a
child
from
matryona
my
cook
who
is
still
with
me
its
like
this
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
peasant
woman
and
a
very
wicked
woman
she
was
and
she
died
and
did
not
leave
a
single
good
deed
behind
the
devils
caught
her
and
plunged
her
into
the
lake
of
fire
so
her
guardian
angel
stood
and
wondered
what
good
deed
of
hers
he
could
remember
to
tell
to
god
she
once
pulled
up
an
onion
in
her
garden
said
he
and
gave
it
to
a
beggar
woman
and
god
answered
you
take
that
onion
then
hold
it
out
to
her
in
the
lake
and
let
her
take
hold
and
be
pulled
out
and
if
you
can
pull
her
out
of
the
lake
let
her
come
to
paradise
but
if
the
onion
breaks
then
the
woman
must
stay
where
she
is
the
angel
ran
to
the
woman
and
held
out
the
onion
to
her
come
said
he
catch
hold
and
ill
pull
you
out
and
he
began
cautiously
pulling
her
out
he
had
just
pulled
her
right
out
when
the
other
sinners
in
the
lake
seeing
how
she
was
being
drawn
out
began
catching
hold
of
her
so
as
to
be
pulled
out
with
her
but
she
was
a
very
wicked
woman
and
she
began
kicking
them
im
to
be
pulled
out
not
you
its
my
onion
not
yours
as
soon
as
she
said
that
the
onion
broke
and
the
woman
fell
into
the
lake
and
she
is
burning
there
to
this
day
so
the
angel
wept
and
went
away
so
thats
the
story
alyosha
i
know
it
by
heart
for
i
am
that
wicked
woman
myself
i
boasted
to
rakitin
that
i
had
given
away
an
onion
but
to
you
ill
say
ive
done
nothing
but
give
away
one
onion
all
my
life
thats
the
only
good
deed
ive
done
so
dont
praise
me
alyosha
dont
think
me
good
i
am
bad
i
am
a
wicked
woman
and
you
make
me
ashamed
if
you
praise
me
eh
i
must
confess
everything
listen
alyosha
i
was
so
anxious
to
get
hold
of
you
that
i
promised
rakitin
twentyfive
roubles
if
he
would
bring
you
to
me
stay
rakitin
wait
she
went
with
rapid
steps
to
the
table
opened
a
drawer
pulled
out
a
purse
and
took
from
it
a
twentyfive
rouble
note
what
nonsense
what
nonsense
cried
rakitin
disconcerted
take
it
rakitin
i
owe
it
you
theres
no
fear
of
your
refusing
it
you
asked
for
it
yourself
and
she
threw
the
note
to
him
likely
i
should
refuse
it
boomed
rakitin
obviously
abashed
but
carrying
off
his
confusion
with
a
swagger
that
will
come
in
very
handy
fools
are
made
for
wise
mens
profit
and
now
hold
your
tongue
rakitin
what
i
am
going
to
say
now
is
not
for
your
ears
sit
down
in
that
corner
and
keep
quiet
you
dont
like
us
so
hold
your
tongue
what
should
i
like
you
for
rakitin
snarled
not
concealing
his
ill
humor
he
put
the
twentyfive
rouble
note
in
his
pocket
and
he
felt
ashamed
at
alyoshas
seeing
it
he
had
reckoned
on
receiving
his
payment
later
without
alyoshas
knowing
of
it
and
now
feeling
ashamed
he
lost
his
temper
till
that
moment
he
had
thought
it
discreet
not
to
contradict
grushenka
too
flatly
in
spite
of
her
snubbing
since
he
had
something
to
get
out
of
her
but
now
he
too
was
angry
one
loves
people
for
some
reason
but
what
have
either
of
you
done
for
me
you
should
love
people
without
a
reason
as
alyosha
does
how
does
he
love
you
how
has
he
shown
it
that
you
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
grushenka
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
spoke
with
heat
and
there
were
hysterical
notes
in
her
voice
hush
rakitin
you
know
nothing
about
us
and
dont
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
again
how
dare
you
be
so
familiar
sit
in
that
corner
and
be
quiet
as
though
you
were
my
footman
and
now
alyosha
ill
tell
you
the
whole
truth
that
you
may
see
what
a
wretch
i
am
i
am
not
talking
to
rakitin
but
to
you
i
wanted
to
ruin
you
alyosha
thats
the
holy
truth
i
quite
meant
to
i
wanted
to
so
much
that
i
bribed
rakitin
to
bring
you
and
why
did
i
want
to
do
such
a
thing
you
knew
nothing
about
it
alyosha
you
turned
away
from
me
if
you
passed
me
you
dropped
your
eyes
and
ive
looked
at
you
a
hundred
times
before
today
i
began
asking
every
one
about
you
your
face
haunted
my
heart
he
despises
me
i
thought
he
wont
even
look
at
me
and
i
felt
it
so
much
at
last
that
i
wondered
at
myself
for
being
so
frightened
of
a
boy
ill
get
him
in
my
clutches
and
laugh
at
him
i
was
full
of
spite
and
anger
would
you
believe
it
nobody
here
dares
talk
or
think
of
coming
to
agrafena
alexandrovna
with
any
evil
purpose
old
kuzma
is
the
only
man
i
have
anything
to
do
with
here
i
was
bound
and
sold
to
him
satan
brought
us
together
but
there
has
been
no
one
else
but
looking
at
you
i
thought
ill
get
him
in
my
clutches
and
laugh
at
him
you
see
what
a
spiteful
cur
i
am
and
you
called
me
your
sister
and
now
that
man
who
wronged
me
has
come
i
sit
here
waiting
for
a
message
from
him
and
do
you
know
what
that
man
has
been
to
me
five
years
ago
when
kuzma
brought
me
here
i
used
to
shut
myself
up
that
no
one
might
have
sight
or
sound
of
me
i
was
a
silly
slip
of
a
girl
i
used
to
sit
here
sobbing
i
used
to
lie
awake
all
night
thinking
where
is
he
now
the
man
who
wronged
me
he
is
laughing
at
me
with
another
woman
most
likely
if
only
i
could
see
him
if
i
could
meet
him
again
id
pay
him
out
id
pay
him
out
at
night
i
used
to
lie
sobbing
into
my
pillow
in
the
dark
and
i
used
to
brood
over
it
i
used
to
tear
my
heart
on
purpose
and
gloat
over
my
anger
ill
pay
him
out
ill
pay
him
out
thats
what
i
used
to
cry
out
in
the
dark
and
when
i
suddenly
thought
that
i
should
really
do
nothing
to
him
and
that
he
was
laughing
at
me
then
or
perhaps
had
utterly
forgotten
me
i
would
fling
myself
on
the
floor
melt
into
helpless
tears
and
lie
there
shaking
till
dawn
in
the
morning
i
would
get
up
more
spiteful
than
a
dog
ready
to
tear
the
whole
world
to
pieces
and
then
what
do
you
think
i
began
saving
money
i
became
hardhearted
grew
stoutgrew
wiser
would
you
say
no
no
one
in
the
whole
world
sees
it
no
one
knows
it
but
when
night
comes
on
i
sometimes
lie
as
i
did
five
years
ago
when
i
was
a
silly
girl
clenching
my
teeth
and
crying
all
night
thinking
ill
pay
him
out
ill
pay
him
out
do
you
hear
well
then
now
you
understand
me
a
month
ago
a
letter
came
to
mehe
was
coming
he
was
a
widower
he
wanted
to
see
me
it
took
my
breath
away
then
i
suddenly
thought
if
he
comes
and
whistles
to
call
me
i
shall
creep
back
to
him
like
a
beaten
dog
i
couldnt
believe
myself
am
i
so
abject
shall
i
run
to
him
or
not
and
ive
been
in
such
a
rage
with
myself
all
this
month
that
i
am
worse
than
i
was
five
years
ago
do
you
see
now
alyosha
what
a
violent
vindictive
creature
i
am
i
have
shown
you
the
whole
truth
i
played
with
mitya
to
keep
me
from
running
to
that
other
hush
rakitin
its
not
for
you
to
judge
me
i
am
not
speaking
to
you
before
you
came
in
i
was
lying
here
waiting
brooding
deciding
my
whole
future
life
and
you
can
never
know
what
was
in
my
heart
yes
alyosha
tell
your
young
lady
not
to
be
angry
with
me
for
what
happened
the
day
before
yesterday
nobody
in
the
whole
world
knows
what
i
am
going
through
now
and
no
one
ever
can
know
for
perhaps
i
shall
take
a
knife
with
me
today
i
cant
make
up
my
mind

and
at
this
tragic
phrase
grushenka
broke
down
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
flung
herself
on
the
sofa
pillows
and
sobbed
like
a
little
child
alyosha
got
up
and
went
to
rakitin
misha
he
said
dont
be
angry
she
wounded
you
but
dont
be
angry
you
heard
what
she
said
just
now
you
mustnt
ask
too
much
of
human
endurance
one
must
be
merciful
alyosha
said
this
at
the
instinctive
prompting
of
his
heart
he
felt
obliged
to
speak
and
he
turned
to
rakitin
if
rakitin
had
not
been
there
he
would
have
spoken
to
the
air
but
rakitin
looked
at
him
ironically
and
alyosha
stopped
short
you
were
so
primed
up
with
your
elders
teaching
last
night
that
now
you
have
to
let
it
off
on
me
alexey
man
of
god
said
rakitin
with
a
smile
of
hatred
dont
laugh
rakitin
dont
smile
dont
talk
of
the
deadhe
was
better
than
any
one
in
the
world
cried
alyosha
with
tears
in
his
voice
i
didnt
speak
to
you
as
a
judge
but
as
the
lowest
of
the
judged
what
am
i
beside
her
i
came
here
seeking
my
ruin
and
said
to
myself
what
does
it
matter
in
my
cowardliness
but
she
after
five
years
in
torment
as
soon
as
any
one
says
a
word
from
the
heart
to
herit
makes
her
forget
everything
forgive
everything
in
her
tears
the
man
who
has
wronged
her
has
come
back
he
sends
for
her
and
she
forgives
him
everything
and
hastens
joyfully
to
meet
him
and
she
wont
take
a
knife
with
her
she
wont
no
i
am
not
like
that
i
dont
know
whether
you
are
misha
but
i
am
not
like
that
its
a
lesson
to
me
she
is
more
loving
than
we
have
you
heard
her
speak
before
of
what
she
has
just
told
us
no
you
havent
if
you
had
youd
have
understood
her
long
ago

and
the
person
insulted
the
day
before
yesterday
must
forgive
her
too
she
will
when
she
knows

and
she
shall
know
this
soul
is
not
yet
at
peace
with
itself
one
must
be
tender
with
it

there
may
be
a
treasure
in
that
soul
alyosha
stopped
because
he
caught
his
breath
in
spite
of
his
illhumor
rakitin
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
he
had
never
expected
such
a
tirade
from
the
gentle
alyosha
shes
found
some
one
to
plead
her
cause
why
are
you
in
love
with
her
agrafena
alexandrovna
our
monks
really
in
love
with
you
youve
made
a
conquest
he
cried
with
a
coarse
laugh
grushenka
lifted
her
head
from
the
pillow
and
looked
at
alyosha
with
a
tender
smile
shining
on
her
tearstained
face
let
him
alone
alyosha
my
cherub
you
see
what
he
is
he
is
not
a
person
for
you
to
speak
to
mihail
osipovitch
she
turned
to
rakitin
i
meant
to
beg
your
pardon
for
being
rude
to
you
but
now
i
dont
want
to
alyosha
come
to
me
sit
down
here
she
beckoned
to
him
with
a
happy
smile
thats
right
sit
here
tell
me
she
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
peeped
into
his
face
smiling
tell
me
do
i
love
that
man
or
not
the
man
who
wronged
me
do
i
love
him
or
not
before
you
came
i
lay
here
in
the
dark
asking
my
heart
whether

decide
for

the
time

said
alyosha
smiling
yes

forgiven
him
grushenka
murmured
thoughtfully
what
an
abject
heart
to
my
abject
heart
she
snatched
up
a
glass
from
the
table
emptied
it
at
a
gulp
lifted
it
in
the
air
and
flung
it
on
the
floor
the
glass
broke
with
a
crash
a
little
cruel
line
came
into
her
smile
perhaps
i
havent
forgiven
him
though
she
said
with
a
sort
of
menace
in
her
voice
and
she
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
ground
as
though
she
were
talking
to
herself
perhaps
my
heart
is
only
getting
ready
to
forgive
i
shall
struggle
with
my
heart
you
see
alyosha

grown
to
love

a
resonant
voice

she
uttered
the
last
words
in
an
hysterical
scream
but
broke
down
again
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
buried
it
in
the
pillow
and
shook
with
sobs
rakitin
got
up
its
time
we
were
off
he
said
its
late
we
shall
be
shut
out
of
the
monastery
grushenka
leapt
up
from
her
place
surely
you
dont
want
to
go
alyosha
she
cried
in
mournful
surprise
what
are
you
doing
to
me
youve
stirred
up
my
feeling
tortured
me
and
now
youll
leave
me
to
face
this
night
alone
he
can
hardly
spend
the
night
with
you
though
if
he
wants
to
let
him
ill
go
alone
rakitin
scoffed
jeeringly
hush
evil
tongue
grushenka
cried
angrily
at
him
you
never
said
such
words
to
me
as
he
has
come
to
say
what
has
he
said
to
you
so
special
asked
rakitin
irritably
i
cant
say
i
dont
know
i
dont
know
what
he
said
to
me
it
went
straight
to
my
heart
he
has
wrung
my
heart
he
is
the
first
the
only
one
who
has
pitied
me
thats
what
it
is
why
did
you
not
come
before
you
angel
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
as
though
in
a
sudden
frenzy
ive
been
waiting
all
my
life
for
some
one
like
you
i
knew
that
some
one
like
you
would
come
and
forgive
me
i
believed
that
nasty
as
i
am
some
one
would
really
love
me
not
only
with
a
shameful
love
what
have
i
done
to
you
answered
alyosha
bending
over
her
with
a
tender
smile
and
gently
taking
her
by
the
hands
i
only
gave
you
an
onion
nothing
but
a
tiny
little
onion
that
was
all
he
was
moved
to
tears
himself
as
he
said
it
at
that
moment
there
was
a
sudden
noise
in
the
passage
some
one
came
into
the
hall
grushenka
jumped
up
seeming
greatly
alarmed
fenya
ran
noisily
into
the
room
crying
out
mistress
mistress
darling
a
messenger
has
galloped
up
she
cried
breathless
and
joyful
a
carriage
from
mokroe
for
you
timofey
the
driver
with
three
horses
they
are
just
putting
in
fresh
horses
a
letter
heres
the
letter
mistress
a
letter
was
in
her
hand
and
she
waved
it
in
the
air
all
the
while
she
talked
grushenka
snatched
the
letter
from
her
and
carried
it
to
the
candle
it
was
only
a
note
a
few
lines
she
read
it
in
one
instant
he
has
sent
for
me
she
cried
her
face
white
and
distorted
with
a
wan
smile
he
whistles
crawl
back
little
dog
but
only
for
one
instant
she
stood
as
though
hesitating
suddenly
the
blood
rushed
to
her
head
and
sent
a
glow
to
her
cheeks
i
will
go
she
cried
five
years
of
my
life
goodby
goodby
alyosha
my
fate
is
sealed
go
go
leave
me
all
of
you
dont
let
me
see
you
again
grushenka
is
flying
to
a
new
life
dont
you
remember
evil
against
me
either
rakitin
i
may
be
going
to
my
death
ugh
i
feel
as
though
i
were
drunk
she
suddenly
left
them
and
ran
into
her
bedroom
well
she
has
no
thoughts
for
us
now
grumbled
rakitin
lets
go
or
we
may
hear
that
feminine
shriek
again
i
am
sick
of
all
these
tears
and
cries
alyosha
mechanically
let
himself
be
led
out
in
the
yard
stood
a
covered
cart
horses
were
being
taken
out
of
the
shafts
men
were
running
to
and
fro
with
a
lantern
three
fresh
horses
were
being
led
in
at
the
open
gate
but
when
alyosha
and
rakitin
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
grushenkas
bedroom
window
was
suddenly
opened
and
she
called
in
a
ringing
voice
after
alyosha
alyosha
give
my
greetings
to
your
brother
mitya
and
tell
him
not
to
remember
evil
against
me
though
i
have
brought
him
misery
and
tell
him
too
in
my
words
grushenka
has
fallen
to
a
scoundrel
and
not
to
you
noble
heart
and
add
too
that
grushenka
loved
him
only
one
hour
only
one
short
hour
she
loved
himso
let
him
remember
that
hour
all
his
lifesay
grushenka
tells
you
to

she
ended
in
a
voice
full
of
sobs
the
window
was
shut
with
a
slam
hm
hm
growled
rakitin
laughing
she
murders
your
brother
mitya
and
then
tells
him
to
remember
it
all
his
life
what
ferocity
alyosha
made
no
reply
he
seemed
not
to
have
heard
he
walked
fast
beside
rakitin
as
though
in
a
terrible
hurry
he
was
lost
in
thought
and
moved
mechanically
rakitin
felt
a
sudden
twinge
as
though
he
had
been
touched
on
an
open
wound
he
had
expected
something
quite
different
by
bringing
grushenka
and
alyosha
together
something
very
different
from
what
he
had
hoped
for
had
happened
he
is
a
pole
that
officer
of
hers
he
began
again
restraining
himself
and
indeed
he
is
not
an
officer
at
all
now
he
served
in
the
customs
in
siberia
somewhere
on
the
chinese
frontier
some
puny
little
beggar
of
a
pole
i
expect
lost
his
job
they
say
hes
heard
now
that
grushenkas
saved
a
little
money
so
hes
turned
up
againthats
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
again
alyosha
seemed
not
to
hear
rakitin
could
not
control
himself
well
so
youve
saved
the
sinner
he
laughed
spitefully
have
you
turned
the
magdalene
into
the
true
path
driven
out
the
seven
devils
eh
so
you
see
the
miracles
you
were
looking
out
for
just
now
have
come
to
pass
hush
rakitin
alyosha
answered
with
an
aching
heart
so
you
despise
me
now
for
those
twentyfive
roubles
ive
sold
my
friend
you
think
but
you
are
not
christ
you
know
and
i
am
not
judas
oh
rakitin
i
assure
you
id
forgotten
about
it
cried
alyosha
you
remind
me
of
it
yourself
but
this
was
the
last
straw
for
rakitin
damnation
take
you
all
and
each
of
you
he
cried
suddenly
why
the
devil
did
i
take
you
up
i
dont
want
to
know
you
from
this
time
forward
go
alone
theres
your
road
and
he
turned
abruptly
into
another
street
leaving
alyosha
alone
in
the
dark
alyosha
came
out
of
the
town
and
walked
across
the
fields
to
the
monastery
chapter
iv
cana
of
galilee
it
was
very
late
according
to
the
monastery
ideas
when
alyosha
returned
to
the
hermitage
the
doorkeeper
let
him
in
by
a
special
entrance
it
had
struck
nine
oclockthe
hour
of
rest
and
repose
after
a
day
of
such
agitation
for
all
alyosha
timidly
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
elders
cell
where
his
coffin
was
now
standing
there
was
no
one
in
the
cell
but
father
passy
reading
the
gospel
in
solitude
over
the
coffin
and
the
young
novice
porfiry
who
exhausted
by
the
previous
nights
conversation
and
the
disturbing
incidents
of
the
day
was
sleeping
the
deep
sound
sleep
of
youth
on
the
floor
of
the
other
room
though
father
passy
heard
alyosha
come
in
he
did
not
even
look
in
his
direction
alyosha
turned
to
the
right
from
the
door
to
the
corner
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
to
pray
his
soul
was
overflowing
but
with
mingled
feelings
no
single
sensation
stood
out
distinctly
on
the
contrary
one
drove
out
another
in
a
slow
continual
rotation
but
there
was
a
sweetness
in
his
heart
and
strange
to
say
alyosha
was
not
surprised
at
it
again
he
saw
that
coffin
before
him
the
hidden
dead
figure
so
precious
to
him
but
the
weeping
and
poignant
grief
of
the
morning
was
no
longer
aching
in
his
soul
as
soon
as
he
came
in
he
fell
down
before
the
coffin
as
before
a
holy
shrine
but
joy
joy
was
glowing
in
his
mind
and
in
his
heart
the
one
window
of
the
cell
was
open
the
air
was
fresh
and
cool
so
the
smell
must
have
become
stronger
if
they
opened
the
window
thought
alyosha
but
even
this
thought
of
the
smell
of
corruption
which
had
seemed
to
him
so
awful
and
humiliating
a
few
hours
before
no
longer
made
him
feel
miserable
or
indignant
he
began
quietly
praying
but
he
soon
felt
that
he
was
praying
almost
mechanically
fragments
of
thought
floated
through
his
soul
flashed
like
stars
and
went
out
again
at
once
to
be
succeeded
by
others
but
yet
there
was
reigning
in
his
soul
a
sense
of
the
wholeness
of
thingssomething
steadfast
and
comfortingand
he
was
aware
of
it
himself
sometimes
he
began
praying
ardently
he
longed
to
pour
out
his
thankfulness
and
love
but
when
he
had
begun
to
pray
he
passed
suddenly
to
something
else
and
sank
into
thought
forgetting
both
the
prayer
and
what
had
interrupted
it
he
began
listening
to
what
father
passy
was
reading
but
worn
out
with
exhaustion
he
gradually
began
to
doze
and
the
third
day
there
was
a
marriage
in
cana
of
galilee
read
father
passy
and
the
mother
of
jesus
was
there
and
both
jesus
was
called
and
his
disciples
to
the
marriage
marriage
whats
that
a
marriage
floated
whirling
through
alyoshas
mind
there
is
happiness
for
her
too
she
has
gone
to
the
feast
no
she
has
not
taken
the
knife
that
was
only
a
tragic
phrase
well

tragic
phrases
should
be
forgiven

first
miracle
to
help
mens
gladness
he
who
loves
men

their
gladness

was

jesus
saith
unto
her

what

it
to
do
with

his
mother
saith
unto
the
servants
whatsoever
he
saith
unto
you
do
it

do
it
gladness
the
gladness
of
some
poor
very
poor
people
of
course
they
were
poor
since
they
hadnt
wine
enough
even
at
a
wedding
the
historians
write
that
in
those
days
the
people
living
about
the
lake
of
gennesaret
were
the
poorest
that
can
possibly
be
imagined

and
another
great
heart
that
other
great
being
his
mother
knew
that
he
had
come
not
only
to
make
his
great
terrible
sacrifice
she
knew
that
his
heart
was
open
even
to
the
simple
artless
merrymaking
of
some
obscure
and
unlearned
people
who
had
warmly
bidden
him
to
their
poor
wedding
mine
hour
is
not
yet
come
he
said
with
a
soft
smile
he
must
have
smiled
gently
to
her
and
indeed
was
it
to
make
wine
abundant
at
poor
weddings
he
had
come
down
to
earth
and
yet
he
went
and
did
as
she
asked
him
ah
he
is
reading
again
jesus
saith
unto
them
fill
the
waterpots
with
water
and
they
filled
them
up
to
the
brim
and
he
saith
unto
them
draw
out
now
and
bear
unto
the
governor
of
the
feast
and
they
bare
it
when
the
ruler
of
the
feast
had
tasted
the
water
that
was
made
wine
and
knew
not
whence
it
was
but
the
servants
which
drew
the
water
knew
the
governor
of
the
feast
called
the
bridegroom
and
saith
unto
him
every
man
at
the
beginning
doth
set
forth
good
wine
and
when
men
have
well
drunk
that
which
is
worse
but
thou
hast
kept
the
good
wine
until
now

up
there
from
the

the
little
thin
old
man
with
tiny
wrinkles
on
his
face
joyful
and
laughing
softly
there
was
no
coffin
now
and
he
was
in
the
same
dress
as
he
had
worn
yesterday
sitting
with
them
when
the
visitors
had
gathered
about
him
his
face
was
uncovered
his
eyes
were
shining
how
was
this
then
he
too
had
been
called
to
the
feast

too
at

called
and
bidden
he
heard
a
soft
voice
saying
over
him
why
have
you
hidden
yourself
here
out
of
sight
you
come
and
join
us
too
it
was
his
voice
the
voice
of
father
zossima
and
it
must
be
he
since
he
called
him
the
elder
raised
alyosha
by
the
hand
and
he
rose
from
his
knees

rejoicing

him
he
is
terrible
in
his
greatness
awful
in
his
sublimity
but
infinitely
merciful
he
has
made
himself
like
unto
us
from
love
and
rejoices
with
us
he
is
changing
the
water
into
wine
that
the
gladness
of
the
guests
may
not
be
cut
short
he

ones
unceasingly

and
ever
there
they
are
bringing
new
wine
do
you
see
they
are
bringing
the
vessels
something
glowed
in
alyoshas
heart
something
filled
it
till
it
ached
tears
of
rapture
rose
from
his
soul
he
stretched
out
his
hands
uttered
a
cry
and
waked
up
again
the
coffin
the
open
window
and
the
soft
solemn
distinct
reading
of
the
gospel
but
alyosha
did
not
listen
to
the
reading
it
was
strange
he
had
fallen
asleep
on
his
knees
but
now
he
was
on
his
feet
and
suddenly
as
though
thrown
forward
with
three
firm
rapid
steps
he
went
right
up
to
the
coffin
his
shoulder
brushed
against
father
passy
without
his
noticing
it
father
passy
raised
his
eyes
for
an
instant
from
his
book
but
looked
away
again
at
once
seeing
that
something
strange
was
happening
to
the
boy
alyosha
gazed
for
half
a
minute
at
the
coffin
at
the
covered
motionless
dead
man
that
lay
in
the
coffin
with
the
ikon
on
his
breast
and
the
peaked
cap
with
the
octangular
cross
on
his
head
he
had
only
just
been
hearing
his
voice
and
that
voice
was
still
ringing
in
his
ears
he
was
listening
still
expecting
other
words
but
suddenly
he
turned
sharply
and
went
out
of
the
cell
he
did
not
stop
on
the
steps
either
but
went
quickly
down
his
soul
overflowing
with
rapture
yearned
for
freedom
space
openness
the
vault
of
heaven
full
of
soft
shining
stars
stretched
vast
and
fathomless
above
him
the
milky
way
ran
in
two
pale
streams
from
the
zenith
to
the
horizon
the
fresh
motionless
still
night
enfolded
the
earth
the
white
towers
and
golden
domes
of
the
cathedral
gleamed
out
against
the
sapphire
sky
the
gorgeous
autumn
flowers
in
the
beds
round
the
house
were
slumbering
till
morning
the
silence
of
earth
seemed
to
melt
into
the
silence
of
the
heavens
the
mystery
of
earth
was
one
with
the
mystery
of
the
stars
alyosha
stood
gazed
and
suddenly
threw
himself
down
on
the
earth
he
did
not
know
why
he
embraced
it
he
could
not
have
told
why
he
longed
so
irresistibly
to
kiss
it
to
kiss
it
all
but
he
kissed
it
weeping
sobbing
and
watering
it
with
his
tears
and
vowed
passionately
to
love
it
to
love
it
for
ever
and
ever
water
the
earth
with
the
tears
of
your
joy
and
love
those
tears
echoed
in
his
soul
what
was
he
weeping
over
oh
in
his
rapture
he
was
weeping
even
over
those
stars
which
were
shining
to
him
from
the
abyss
of
space
and
he
was
not
ashamed
of
that
ecstasy
there
seemed
to
be
threads
from
all
those
innumerable
worlds
of
god
linking
his
soul
to
them
and
it
was
trembling
all
over
in
contact
with
other
worlds
he
longed
to
forgive
every
one
and
for
everything
and
to
beg
forgiveness
oh
not
for
himself
but
for
all
men
for
all
and
for
everything
and
others
are
praying
for
me
too
echoed
again
in
his
soul
but
with
every
instant
he
felt
clearly
and
as
it
were
tangibly
that
something
firm
and
unshakable
as
that
vault
of
heaven
had
entered
into
his
soul
it
was
as
though
some
idea
had
seized
the
sovereignty
of
his
mindand
it
was
for
all
his
life
and
for
ever
and
ever
he
had
fallen
on
the
earth
a
weak
boy
but
he
rose
up
a
resolute
champion
and
he
knew
and
felt
it
suddenly
at
the
very
moment
of
his
ecstasy
and
never
never
all
his
life
long
could
alyosha
forget
that
minute
some
one
visited
my
soul
in
that
hour
he
used
to
say
afterwards
with
implicit
faith
in
his
words
within
three
days
he
left
the
monastery
in
accordance
with
the
words
of
his
elder
who
had
bidden
him
sojourn
in
the
world
book

i
kuzma
samsonov
but
dmitri
to
whom
grushenka
flying
away
to
a
new
life
had
left
her
last
greetings
bidding
him
remember
the
hour
of
her
love
for
ever
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
to
her
and
was
at
that
moment
in
a
condition
of
feverish
agitation
and
activity
for
the
last
two
days
he
had
been
in
such
an
inconceivable
state
of
mind
that
he
might
easily
have
fallen
ill
with
brain
fever
as
he
said
himself
afterwards
alyosha
had
not
been
able
to
find
him
the
morning
before
and
ivan
had
not
succeeded
in
meeting
him
at
the
tavern
on
the
same
day
the
people
at
his
lodgings
by
his
orders
concealed
his
movements
he
had
spent
those
two
days
literally
rushing
in
all
directions
struggling
with
his
destiny
and
trying
to
save
himself
as
he
expressed
it
himself
afterwards
and
for
some
hours
he
even
made
a
dash
out
of
the
town
on
urgent
business
terrible
as
it
was
to
him
to
lose
sight
of
grushenka
for
a
moment
all
this
was
explained
afterwards
in
detail
and
confirmed
by
documentary
evidence
but
for
the
present
we
will
only
note
the
most
essential
incidents
of
those
two
terrible
days
immediately
preceding
the
awful
catastrophe
that
broke
so
suddenly
upon
him
though
grushenka
had
it
is
true
loved
him
for
an
hour
genuinely
and
sincerely
yet
she
tortured
him
sometimes
cruelly
and
mercilessly
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
never
tell
what
she
meant
to
do
to
prevail
upon
her
by
force
or
kindness
was
also
impossible
she
would
yield
to
nothing
she
would
only
have
become
angry
and
turned
away
from
him
altogether
he
knew
that
well
already
he
suspected
quite
correctly
that
she
too
was
passing
through
an
inward
struggle
and
was
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
indecision
that
she
was
making
up
her
mind
to
something
and
unable
to
determine
upon
it
and
so
not
without
good
reason
he
divined
with
a
sinking
heart
that
at
moments
she
must
simply
hate
him
and
his
passion
and
so
perhaps
it
was
but
what
was
distressing
grushenka
he
did
not
understand
for
him
the
whole
tormenting
question
lay
between
him
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
here
we
must
note
by
the
way
one
certain
fact
he
was
firmly
persuaded
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
would
offer
or
perhaps
had
offered
grushenka
lawful
wedlock
and
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
the
old
voluptuary
hoped
to
gain
his
object
for
three
thousand
roubles
mitya
had
reached
this
conclusion
from
his
knowledge
of
grushenka
and
her
character
that
was
how
it
was
that
he
could
believe
at
times
that
all
grushenkas
uneasiness
rose
from
not
knowing
which
of
them
to
choose
which
was
most
to
her
advantage
strange
to
say
during
those
days
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
think
of
the
approaching
return
of
the
officer
that
is
of
the
man
who
had
been
such
a
fatal
influence
in
grushenkas
life
and
whose
arrival
she
was
expecting
with
such
emotion
and
dread
it
is
true
that
of
late
grushenka
had
been
very
silent
about
it
yet
he
was
perfectly
aware
of
a
letter
she
had
received
a
month
ago
from
her
seducer
and
had
heard
of
it
from
her
own
lips
he
partly
knew
too
what
the
letter
contained
in
a
moment
of
spite
grushenka
had
shown
him
that
letter
but
to
her
astonishment
he
attached
hardly
any
consequence
to
it
it
would
be
hard
to
say
why
this
was
perhaps
weighed
down
by
all
the
hideous
horror
of
his
struggle
with
his
own
father
for
this
woman
he
was
incapable
of
imagining
any
danger
more
terrible
at
any
rate
for
the
time
he
simply
did
not
believe
in
a
suitor
who
suddenly
turned
up
again
after
five
years
disappearance
still
less
in
his
speedy
arrival
moreover
in
the
officers
first
letter
which
had
been
shown
to
mitya
the
possibility
of
his
new
rivals
visit
was
very
vaguely
suggested
the
letter
was
very
indefinite
highflown
and
full
of
sentimentality
it
must
be
noted
that
grushenka
had
concealed
from
him
the
last
lines
of
the
letter
in
which
his
return
was
alluded
to
more
definitely
he
had
besides
noticed
at
that
moment
he
remembered
afterwards
a
certain
involuntary
proud
contempt
for
this
missive
from
siberia
on
grushenkas
face
grushenka
told
him
nothing
of
what
had
passed
later
between
her
and
this
rival
so
that
by
degrees
he
had
completely
forgotten
the
officers
existence
he
felt
that
whatever
might
come
later
whatever
turn
things
might
take
his
final
conflict
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
close
upon
him
and
must
be
decided
before
anything
else
with
a
sinking
heart
he
was
expecting
every
moment
grushenkas
decision
always
believing
that
it
would
come
suddenly
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
all
of
a
sudden
she
would
say
to
him
take
me
im
yours
for
ever
and
it
would
all
be
over
he
would
seize
her
and
bear
her
away
at
once
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
oh
then
he
would
bear
her
away
at
once
as
far
far
away
as
possible
to
the
farthest
end
of
russia
if
not
of
the
earth
then
he
would
marry
her
and
settle
down
with
her
incognito
so
that
no
one
would
know
anything
about
them
there
here
or
anywhere
then
oh
then
a
new
life
would
begin
at
once
of
this
different
reformed
and
virtuous
life
it
must
it
must
be
virtuous
he
dreamed
feverishly
at
every
moment
he
thirsted
for
that
reformation
and
renewal
the
filthy
morass
in
which
he
had
sunk
of
his
own
free
will
was
too
revolting
to
him
and
like
very
many
men
in
such
cases
he
put
faith
above
all
in
change
of
place
if
only
it
were
not
for
these
people
if
only
it
were
not
for
these
circumstances
if
only
he
could
fly
away
from
this
accursed
placehe
would
be
altogether
regenerated
would
enter
on
a
new
path
that
was
what
he
believed
in
and
what
he
was
yearning
for
but
all
this
could
only
be
on
condition
of
the
first
the
happy
solution
of
the
question
there
was
another
possibility
a
different
and
awful
ending
suddenly
she
might
say
to
him
go
away
i
have
just
come
to
terms
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
i
am
going
to
marry
him
and
dont
want
youand
then

but
then
but
mitya
did
not
know
what
would
happen
then
up
to
the
last
hour
he
didnt
know
that
must
be
said
to
his
credit
he
had
no
definite
intentions
had
planned
no
crime
he
was
simply
watching
and
spying
in
agony
while
he
prepared
himself
for
the
first
happy
solution
of
his
destiny
he
drove
away
any
other
idea
in
fact
but
for
that
ending
a
quite
different
anxiety
arose
a
new
incidental
but
yet
fatal
and
insoluble
difficulty
presented
itself
if
she
were
to
say
to
him
im
yours
take
me
away
how
could
he
take
her
away
where
had
he
the
means
the
money
to
do
it
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
all
sources
of
revenue
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
doles
which
had
gone
on
without
interruption
for
so
many
years
ceased
grushenka
had
money
of
course
but
with
regard
to
this
mitya
suddenly
evinced
extraordinary
pride
he
wanted
to
carry
her
away
and
begin
the
new
life
with
her
himself
at
his
own
expense
not
at
hers
he
could
not
conceive
of
taking
her
money
and
the
very
idea
caused
him
a
pang
of
intense
repulsion
i
wont
enlarge
on
this
fact
or
analyze
it
here
but
confine
myself
to
remarking
that
this
was
his
attitude
at
the
moment
all
this
may
have
arisen
indirectly
and
unconsciously
from
the
secret
stings
of
his
conscience
for
the
money
of
katerina
ivanovna
that
he
had
dishonestly
appropriated
ive
been
a
scoundrel
to
one
of
them
and
i
shall
be
a
scoundrel
again
to
the
other
directly
was
his
feeling
then
as
he
explained
after
and
when
grushenka
knows
she
wont
care
for
such
a
scoundrel
where
then
was
he
to
get
the
means
where
was
he
to
get
the
fateful
money
without
it
all
would
be
lost
and
nothing
could
be
done
and
only
because
i
hadnt
the
money
oh
the
shame
of
it
to
anticipate
things
he
did
perhaps
know
where
to
get
the
money
knew
perhaps
where
it
lay
at
that
moment
i
will
say
no
more
of
this
here
as
it
will
all
be
clear
later
but
his
chief
trouble
i
must
explain
however
obscurely
lay
in
the
fact
that
to
have
that
sum
he
knew
of
to
have
the
right
to
take
it
he
must
first
restore
katerina
ivanovnas
three
thousandif
not
im
a
common
pickpocket
im
a
scoundrel
and
i
dont
want
to
begin
a
new
life
as
a
scoundrel
mitya
decided
and
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
move
heaven
and
earth
to
return
katerina
ivanovna
that
three
thousand
and
that
first
of
all
the
final
stage
of
this
decision
so
to
say
had
been
reached
only
during
the
last
hours
that
is
after
his
last
interview
with
alyosha
two
days
before
on
the
highroad
on
the
evening
when
grushenka
had
insulted
katerina
ivanovna
and
mitya
after
hearing
alyoshas
account
of
it
had
admitted
that
he
was
a
scoundrel
and
told
him
to
tell
katerina
ivanovna
so
if
it
could
be
any
comfort
to
her
after
parting
from
his
brother
on
that
night
he
had
felt
in
his
frenzy
that
it
would
be
better
to
murder
and
rob
some
one
than
fail
to
pay
my
debt
to
katya
id
rather
every
one
thought
me
a
robber
and
a
murderer
id
rather
go
to
siberia
than
that
katya
should
have
the
right
to
say
that
i
deceived
her
and
stole
her
money
and
used
her
money
to
run
away
with
grushenka
and
begin
a
new
life
that
i
cant
do
so
mitya
decided
grinding
his
teeth
and
he
might
well
fancy
at
times
that
his
brain
would
give
way
but
meanwhile
he
went
on
struggling
strange
to
say
though
one
would
have
supposed
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
despairfor
what
chance
had
he
with
nothing
in
the
world
to
raise
such
a
sumyet
to
the
very
end
he
persisted
in
hoping
that
he
would
get
that
three
thousand
that
the
money
would
somehow
come
to
him
of
itself
as
though
it
might
drop
from
heaven
that
is
just
how
it
is
with
people
who
like
dmitri
have
never
had
anything
to
do
with
money
except
to
squander
what
has
come
to
them
by
inheritance
without
any
effort
of
their
own
and
have
no
notion
how
money
is
obtained
a
whirl
of
the
most
fantastic
notions
took
possession
of
his
brain
immediately
after
he
had
parted
with
alyosha
two
days
before
and
threw
his
thoughts
into
a
tangle
of
confusion
this
is
how
it
was
he
pitched
first
on
a
perfectly
wild
enterprise
and
perhaps
to
men
of
that
kind
in
such
circumstances
the
most
impossible
fantastic
schemes
occur
first
and
seem
most
practical
he
suddenly
determined
to
go
to
samsonov
the
merchant
who
was
grushenkas
protector
and
to
propose
a
scheme
to
him
and
by
means
of
it
to
obtain
from
him
at
once
the
whole
of
the
sum
required
of
the
commercial
value
of
his
scheme
he
had
no
doubt
not
the
slightest
and
was
only
uncertain
how
samsonov
would
look
upon
his
freak
supposing
he
were
to
consider
it
from
any
but
the
commercial
point
of
view
though
mitya
knew
the
merchant
by
sight
he
was
not
acquainted
with
him
and
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
him
but
for
some
unknown
reason
he
had
long
entertained
the
conviction
that
the
old
reprobate
who
was
lying
at
deaths
door
would
perhaps
not
at
all
object
now
to
grushenkas
securing
a
respectable
position
and
marrying
a
man
to
be
depended
upon
and
he
believed
not
only
that
he
would
not
object
but
that
this
was
what
he
desired
and
if
opportunity
arose
that
he
would
be
ready
to
help
from
some
rumor
or
perhaps
from
some
stray
word
of
grushenkas
he
had
gathered
further
that
the
old
man
would
perhaps
prefer
him
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
grushenka
possibly
many
of
the
readers
of
my
novel
will
feel
that
in
reckoning
on
such
assistance
and
being
ready
to
take
his
bride
so
to
speak
from
the
hands
of
her
protector
dmitri
showed
great
coarseness
and
want
of
delicacy
i
will
only
observe
that
mitya
looked
upon
grushenkas
past
as
something
completely
over
he
looked
on
that
past
with
infinite
pity
and
resolved
with
all
the
fervor
of
his
passion
that
when
once
grushenka
told
him
she
loved
him
and
would
marry
him
it
would
mean
the
beginning
of
a
new
grushenka
and
a
new
dmitri
free
from
every
vice
they
would
forgive
one
another
and
would
begin
their
lives
afresh
as
for
kuzma
samsonov
dmitri
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
who
had
exercised
a
fateful
influence
in
that
remote
past
of
grushenkas
though
she
had
never
loved
him
and
who
was
now
himself
a
thing
of
the
past
completely
done
with
and
so
to
say
nonexistent
besides
mitya
hardly
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
at
all
for
it
was
known
to
every
one
in
the
town
that
he
was
only
a
shattered
wreck
whose
relations
with
grushenka
had
changed
their
character
and
were
now
simply
paternal
and
that
this
had
been
so
for
a
long
time
in
any
case
there
was
much
simplicity
on
mityas
part
in
all
this
for
in
spite
of
all
his
vices
he
was
a
very
simplehearted
man
it
was
an
instance
of
this
simplicity
that
mitya
was
seriously
persuaded
that
being
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
for
the
next
world
old
kuzma
must
sincerely
repent
of
his
past
relations
with
grushenka
and
that
she
had
no
more
devoted
friend
and
protector
in
the
world
than
this
now
harmless
old
man
after
his
conversation
with
alyosha
at
the
crossroads
he
hardly
slept
all
night
and
at
ten
oclock
next
morning
he
was
at
the
house
of
samsonov
and
telling
the
servant
to
announce
him
it
was
a
very
large
and
gloomy
old
house
of
two
stories
with
a
lodge
and
outhouses
in
the
lower
story
lived
samsonovs
two
married
sons
with
their
families
his
old
sister
and
his
unmarried
daughter
in
the
lodge
lived
two
of
his
clerks
one
of
whom
also
had
a
large
family
both
the
lodge
and
the
lower
story
were
overcrowded
but
the
old
man
kept
the
upper
floor
to
himself
and
would
not
even
let
the
daughter
live
there
with
him
though
she
waited
upon
him
and
in
spite
of
her
asthma
was
obliged
at
certain
fixed
hours
and
at
any
time
he
might
call
her
to
run
upstairs
to
him
from
below
this
upper
floor
contained
a
number
of
large
rooms
kept
purely
for
show
furnished
in
the
oldfashioned
merchant
style
with
long
monotonous
rows
of
clumsy
mahogany
chairs
along
the
walls
with
glass
chandeliers
under
shades
and
gloomy
mirrors
on
the
walls
all
these
rooms
were
entirely
empty
and
unused
for
the
old
man
kept
to
one
room
a
small
remote
bedroom
where
he
was
waited
upon
by
an
old
servant
with
a
kerchief
on
her
head
and
by
a
lad
who
used
to
sit
on
the
locker
in
the
passage
owing
to
his
swollen
legs
the
old
man
could
hardly
walk
at
all
and
was
only
rarely
lifted
from
his
leather
armchair
when
the
old
woman
supporting
him
led
him
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
he
was
morose
and
taciturn
even
with
this
old
woman
when
he
was
informed
of
the
arrival
of
the
captain
he
at
once
refused
to
see
him
but
mitya
persisted
and
sent
his
name
up
again
samsonov
questioned
the
lad
minutely
what
he
looked
like
whether
he
was
drunk
was
he
going
to
make
a
row
the
answer
he
received
was
that
he
was
sober
but
wouldnt
go
away
the
old
man
again
refused
to
see
him
then
mitya
who
had
foreseen
this
and
purposely
brought
pencil
and
paper
with
him
wrote
clearly
on
the
piece
of
paper
the
words
on
most
important
business
closely
concerning
agrafena
alexandrovna
and
sent
it
up
to
the
old
man
after
thinking
a
little
samsonov
told
the
lad
to
take
the
visitor
to
the
drawingroom
and
sent
the
old
woman
downstairs
with
a
summons
to
his
younger
son
to
come
upstairs
to
him
at
once
this
younger
son
a
man
over
six
foot
and
of
exceptional
physical
strength
who
was
closelyshaven
and
dressed
in
the
european
style
though
his
father
still
wore
a
kaftan
and
a
beard
came
at
once
without
a
comment
all
the
family
trembled
before
the
father
the
old
man
had
sent
for
this
giant
not
because
he
was
afraid
of
the
captain
he
was
by
no
means
of
a
timorous
temper
but
in
order
to
have
a
witness
in
case
of
any
emergency
supported
by
his
son
and
the
servantlad
he
waddled
at
last
into
the
drawingroom
it
may
be
assumed
that
he
felt
considerable
curiosity
the
drawingroom
in
which
mitya
was
awaiting
him
was
a
vast
dreary
room
that
laid
a
weight
of
depression
on
the
heart
it
had
a
double
row
of
windows
a
gallery
marbled
walls
and
three
immense
chandeliers
with
glass
lusters
covered
with
shades
mitya
was
sitting
on
a
little
chair
at
the
entrance
awaiting
his
fate
with
nervous
impatience
when
the
old
man
appeared
at
the
opposite
door
seventy
feet
away
mitya
jumped
up
at
once
and
with
his
long
military
stride
walked
to
meet
him
mitya
was
well
dressed
in
a
frockcoat
buttoned
up
with
a
round
hat
and
black
gloves
in
his
hands
just
as
he
had
been
three
days
before
at
the
elders
at
the
family
meeting
with
his
father
and
brothers
the
old
man
waited
for
him
standing
dignified
and
unbending
and
mitya
felt
at
once
that
he
had
looked
him
through
and
through
as
he
advanced
mitya
was
greatly
impressed
too
with
samsonovs
immensely
swollen
face
his
lower
lip
which
had
always
been
thick
hung
down
now
looking
like
a
bun
he
bowed
to
his
guest
in
dignified
silence
motioned
him
to
a
low
chair
by
the
sofa
and
leaning
on
his
sons
arm
he
began
lowering
himself
on
to
the
sofa
opposite
groaning
painfully
so
that
mitya
seeing
his
painful
exertions
immediately
felt
remorseful
and
sensitively
conscious
of
his
insignificance
in
the
presence
of
the
dignified
person
he
had
ventured
to
disturb
what
is
it
you
want
of
me
sir
said
the
old
man
deliberately
distinctly
severely
but
courteously
when
he
was
at
last
seated
mitya
started
leapt
up
but
sat
down
again
then
he
began
at
once
speaking
with
loud
nervous
haste
gesticulating
and
in
a
positive
frenzy
he
was
unmistakably
a
man
driven
into
a
corner
on
the
brink
of
ruin
catching
at
the
last
straw
ready
to
sink
if
he
failed
old
samsonov
probably
grasped
all
this
in
an
instant
though
his
face
remained
cold
and
immovable
as
a
statues
most
honored
sir
kuzma
kuzmitch
you
have
no
doubt
heard
more
than
once
of
my
disputes
with
my
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
karamazov
who
robbed
me
of
my
inheritance
from
my
mother

seeing
the
whole
town
is
gossiping
about
it

for
here
every
ones
gossiping
of
what
they
shouldnt

and
besides
it
might
have
reached
you
through
grushenka

i
beg
your
pardon
through
agrafena
alexandrovna

agrafena
alexandrovna
the
lady
for
whom
i
have
the
highest
respect
and
esteem

so
mitya
began
and
broke
down
at
the
first
sentence
we
will
not
reproduce
his
speech
word
for
word
but
will
only
summarize
the
gist
of
it
three
months
ago
he
said
he
had
of
express
intention
mitya
purposely
used
these
words
instead
of
intentionally
consulted
a
lawyer
in
the
chief
town
of
the
province
a
distinguished
lawyer
kuzma
kuzmitch
pavel
pavlovitch
korneplodov
you
have
perhaps
heard
of
him
a
man
of
vast
intellect
the
mind
of
a
statesman

he
knows
you
too

spoke
of
you
in
the
highest
terms

mitya
broke
down
again
but
these
breaks
did
not
deter
him
he
leapt
instantly
over
the
gaps
and
struggled
on
and
on
this
korneplodov
after
questioning
him
minutely
and
inspecting
the
documents
he
was
able
to
bring
him
mitya
alluded
somewhat
vaguely
to
these
documents
and
slurred
over
the
subject
with
special
haste
reported
that
they
certainly
might
take
proceedings
concerning
the
village
of
tchermashnya
which
ought
he
said
to
have
come
to
him
mitya
from
his
mother
and
so
checkmate
the
old
villain
his
father

because
every
door
was
not
closed
and
justice
might
still
find
a
loophole
in
fact
he
might
reckon
on
an
additional
sum
of
six
or
even
seven
thousand
roubles
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
tchermashnya
was
worth
at
least
twentyfive
thousand
he
might
say
twentyeight
thousand
in
fact
thirty
thirty
kuzma
kuzmitch
and
would
you
believe
it
i
didnt
get
seventeen
from
that
heartless
man
so
he
mitya
had
thrown
the
business
up
for
the
time
knowing
nothing
about
the
law
but
on
coming
here
was
struck
dumb
by
a
crossclaim
made
upon
him
here
mitya
went
adrift
again
and
again
took
a
flying
leap
forward
so
will
not
you
excellent
and
honored
kuzma
kuzmitch
be
willing
to
take
up
all
my
claims
against
that
unnatural
monster
and
pay
me
a
sum
down
of
only
three
thousand
you
see
you
cannot
in
any
case
lose
over
it
on
my
honor
my
honor
i
swear
that
quite
the
contrary
you
may
make
six
or
seven
thousand
instead
of
three
above
all
he
wanted
this
concluded
that
very
day
ill
do
the
business
with
you
at
a
notarys
or
whatever
it
is

in
fact
im
ready
to
do
anything
ill
hand
over
all
the
deeds

whatever
you
want
sign
anything

and
we
could
draw
up
the
agreement
at
once

and
if
it
were
possible
if
it
were
only
possible
that
very
morning
you
could
pay
me
that
three
thousand
for
there
isnt
a
capitalist
in
this
town
to
compare
with
you
and
so
would
save
me
from

would
save
me
in
fact

for
a
good
i
might
say
an
honorable
action
for
i
cherish
the
most
honorable
feelings
for
a
certain
person
whom
you
know
well
and
care
for
as
a
father
i
would
not
have
come
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
as
a
father
and
indeed
its
a
struggle
of
three
in
this
business
for
its
fatethats
a
fearful
thing
kuzma
kuzmitch
a
tragedy
kuzma
kuzmitch
a
tragedy
and
as
youve
dropped
out
long
ago
its
a
tug
ofwar
between
two
im
expressing
it
awkwardly
perhaps
but
im
not
a
literary
man
you
see
im
on
the
one
side
and
that
monster
on
the
other
so
you
must
choose
its
either
i
or
the
monster
it
all
lies
in
your
handsthe
fate
of
three
lives
and
the
happiness
of
two
excuse
me
im
making
a
mess
of
it
but
you
understand

i
see
from
your
venerable
eyes
that
you
understand

and
if
you
dont
understand
im
done
for

so
you
see
mitya
broke
off
his
clumsy
speech
with
that
so
you
see
and
jumping
up
from
his
seat
awaited
the
answer
to
his
foolish
proposal
at
the
last
phrase
he
had
suddenly
become
hopelessly
aware
that
it
had
all
fallen
flat
above
all
that
he
had
been
talking
utter
nonsense
how
strange
it
is
on
the
way
here
it
seemed
all
right
and
now
its
nothing
but
nonsense
the
idea
suddenly
dawned
on
his
despairing
mind
all
the
while
he
had
been
talking
the
old
man
sat
motionless
watching
him
with
an
icy
expression
in
his
eyes
after
keeping
him
for
a
moment
in
suspense
kuzma
kuzmitch
pronounced
at
last
in
the
most
positive
and
chilling
tone
excuse
me
we
dont
undertake
such
business
mitya
suddenly
felt
his
legs
growing
weak
under
him
what
am
i
to
do
now
kuzma
kuzmitch
he
muttered
with
a
pale
smile
i
suppose
its
all
up
with
mewhat
do
you
think
excuse
me
mitya
remained
standing
staring
motionless
he
suddenly
noticed
a
movement
in
the
old
mans
face
he
started
you
see
sir
business
of
that
sorts
not
in
our
line
said
the
old
man
slowly
theres
the
court
and
the
lawyersits
a
perfect
misery
but
if
you
like
there
is
a
man
here
you
might
apply
to
good
heavens
who
is
it
youre
my
salvation
kuzma
kuzmitch
faltered
mitya
he
doesnt
live
here
and
hes
not
here
just
now
he
is
a
peasant
he
does
business
in
timber
his
name
is
lyagavy
hes
been
haggling
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
the
last
year
over
your
copse
at
tchermashnya
they
cant
agree
on
the
price
maybe
youve
heard
now
hes
come
back
again
and
is
staying
with
the
priest
at
ilyinskoe
about
twelve
versts
from
the
volovya
station
he
wrote
to
me
too
about
the
business
of
the
copse
asking
my
advice
fyodor
pavlovitch
means
to
go
and
see
him
himself
so
if
you
were
to
be
beforehand
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
to
make
lyagavy
the
offer
youve
made
me
he
might
possibly
a
brilliant
idea
mitya
interrupted
ecstatically
hes
the
very
man
it
would
just
suit
him
hes
haggling
with
him
for
it
being
asked
too
much
and
here
he
would
have
all
the
documents
entitling
him
to
the
property
itself
ha
ha
ha
and
mitya
suddenly
went
off
into
his
short
wooden
laugh
startling
samsonov
how
can
i
thank
you
kuzma
kuzmitch
cried
mitya
effusively
dont
mention
it
said
samsonov
inclining
his
head
but
you
dont
know
youve
saved
me
oh
it
was
a
true
presentiment
brought
me
to
you
so
now
to
this
priest
no
need
of
thanks
ill
make
haste
and
fly
there
im
afraid
ive
overtaxed
your
strength
i
shall
never
forget
it
its
a
russian
says
that
kuzma
kuzmitch
a
rr
russian
to
be
sure
mitya
seized
his
hand
to
press
it
but
there
was
a
malignant
gleam
in
the
old
mans
eye
mitya
drew
back
his
hand
but
at
once
blamed
himself
for
his
mistrustfulness
its
because
hes
tired
he
thought
for
her
sake
for
her
sake
kuzma
kuzmitch
you
understand
that
its
for
her
he
cried
his
voice
ringing
through
the
room
he
bowed
turned
sharply
round
and
with
the
same
long
stride
walked
to
the
door
without
looking
back
he
was
trembling
with
delight
everything
was
on
the
verge
of
ruin
and
my
guardian
angel
saved
me
was
the
thought
in
his
mind
and
if
such
a
business
man
as
samsonov
a
most
worthy
old
man
and
what
dignity
had
suggested
this
course
then

then
success
was
assured
he
would
fly
off
immediately
i
will
be
back
before
night
i
shall
be
back
at
night
and
the
thing
is
done
could
the
old
man
have
been
laughing
at
me
exclaimed
mitya
as
he
strode
towards
his
lodging
he
could
of
course
imagine
nothing
but
that
the
advice
was
practical
from
such
a
business
man
with
an
understanding
of
the
business
with
an
understanding
of
this
lyagavy
curious
surname
orthe
old
man
was
laughing
at
him
alas
the
second
alternative
was
the
correct
one
long
afterwards
when
the
catastrophe
had
happened
old
samsonov
himself
confessed
laughing
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
the
captain
he
was
a
cold
spiteful
and
sarcastic
man
liable
to
violent
antipathies
whether
it
was
the
captains
excited
face
or
the
foolish
conviction
of
the
rake
and
spendthrift
that
he
samsonov
could
be
taken
in
by
such
a
cockandbull
story
as
his
scheme
or
his
jealousy
of
grushenka
in
whose
name
this
scapegrace
had
rushed
in
on
him
with
such
a
tale
to
get
money
which
worked
on
the
old
man
i
cant
tell
but
at
the
instant
when
mitya
stood
before
him
feeling
his
legs
grow
weak
under
him
and
frantically
exclaiming
that
he
was
ruined
at
that
moment
the
old
man
looked
at
him
with
intense
spite
and
resolved
to
make
a
laughingstock
of
him
when
mitya
had
gone
kuzma
kuzmitch
white
with
rage
turned
to
his
son
and
bade
him
see
to
it
that
that
beggar
be
never
seen
again
and
never
admitted
even
into
the
yard
or
else
hed
he
did
not
utter
his
threat
but
even
his
son
who
often
saw
him
enraged
trembled
with
fear
for
a
whole
hour
afterwards
the
old
man
was
shaking
with
anger
and
by
evening
he
was
worse
and
sent
for
the
doctor
chapter
ii
lyagavy
so
he
must
drive
at
full
speed
and
he
had
not
the
money
for
horses
he
had
forty
kopecks
and
that
was
all
all
that
was
left
after
so
many
years
of
prosperity
but
he
had
at
home
an
old
silver
watch
which
had
long
ceased
to
go
he
snatched
it
up
and
carried
it
to
a
jewish
watchmaker
who
had
a
shop
in
the
marketplace
the
jew
gave
him
six
roubles
for
it
and
i
didnt
expect
that
cried
mitya
ecstatically
he
was
still
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
he
seized
his
six
roubles
and
ran
home
at
home
he
borrowed
three
roubles
from
the
people
of
the
house
who
loved
him
so
much
that
they
were
pleased
to
give
it
him
though
it
was
all
they
had
mitya
in
his
excitement
told
them
on
the
spot
that
his
fate
would
be
decided
that
day
and
he
described
in
desperate
haste
the
whole
scheme
he
had
put
before
samsonov
the
latters
decision
his
own
hopes
for
the
future
and
so
on
these
people
had
been
told
many
of
their
lodgers
secrets
before
and
so
looked
upon
him
as
a
gentleman
who
was
not
at
all
proud
and
almost
one
of
themselves
having
thus
collected
nine
roubles
mitya
sent
for
postinghorses
to
take
him
to
the
volovya
station
this
was
how
the
fact
came
to
be
remembered
and
established
that
at
midday
on
the
day
before
the
event
mitya
had
not
a
farthing
and
that
he
had
sold
his
watch
to
get
money
and
had
borrowed
three
roubles
from
his
landlord
all
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
i
note
this
fact
later
on
it
will
be
apparent
why
i
do
so
though
he
was
radiant
with
the
joyful
anticipation
that
he
would
at
last
solve
all
his
difficulties
yet
as
he
drew
near
volovya
station
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
what
grushenka
might
be
doing
in
his
absence
what
if
she
made
up
her
mind
today
to
go
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
this
was
why
he
had
gone
off
without
telling
her
and
why
he
left
orders
with
his
landlady
not
to
let
out
where
he
had
gone
if
any
one
came
to
inquire
for
him
i
must
i
must
get
back
tonight
he
repeated
as
he
was
jolted
along
in
the
cart
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
have
to
bring
this
lyagavy
back
here

to
draw
up
the
deed
so
mused
mitya
with
a
throbbing
heart
but
alas
his
dreams
were
not
fated
to
be
carried
out
to
begin
with
he
was
late
taking
a
short
cut
from
volovya
station
which
turned
out
to
be
eighteen
versts
instead
of
twelve
secondly
he
did
not
find
the
priest
at
home
at
ilyinskoe
he
had
gone
off
to
a
neighboring
village
while
mitya
setting
off
there
with
the
same
exhausted
horses
was
looking
for
him
it
was
almost
dark
the
priest
a
shy
and
amiable
looking
little
man
informed
him
at
once
that
though
lyagavy
had
been
staying
with
him
at
first
he
was
now
at
suhoy
possyolok
that
he
was
staying
the
night
in
the
foresters
cottage
as
he
was
buying
timber
there
too
at
mityas
urgent
request
that
he
would
take
him
to
lyagavy
at
once
and
by
so
doing
save
him
so
to
speak
the
priest
agreed
after
some
demur
to
conduct
him
to
suhoy
possyolok
his
curiosity
was
obviously
aroused
but
unluckily
he
advised
their
going
on
foot
as
it
would
not
be
much
over
a
verst
mitya
of
course
agreed
and
marched
off
with
his
yardlong
strides
so
that
the
poor
priest
almost
ran
after
him
he
was
a
very
cautious
man
though
not
old
mitya
at
once
began
talking
to
him
too
of
his
plans
nervously
and
excitedly
asking
advice
in
regard
to
lyagavy
and
talking
all
the
way
the
priest
listened
attentively
but
gave
little
advice
he
turned
off
mityas
questions
with
i
dont
know
ah
i
cant
say
how
can
i
tell
and
so
on
when
mitya
began
to
speak
of
his
quarrel
with
his
father
over
his
inheritance
the
priest
was
positively
alarmed
as
he
was
in
some
way
dependent
on
fyodor
pavlovitch
he
inquired
however
with
surprise
why
he
called
the
peasanttrader
gorstkin
lyagavy
and
obligingly
explained
to
mitya
that
though
the
mans
name
really
was
lyagavy
he
was
never
called
so
as
he
would
be
grievously
offended
at
the
name
and
that
he
must
be
sure
to
call
him
gorstkin
or
youll
do
nothing
with
him
he
wont
even
listen
to
you
said
the
priest
in
conclusion
mitya
was
somewhat
surprised
for
a
moment
and
explained
that
that
was
what
samsonov
had
called
him
on
hearing
this
fact
the
priest
dropped
the
subject
though
he
would
have
done
well
to
put
into
words
his
doubt
whether
if
samsonov
had
sent
him
to
that
peasant
calling
him
lyagavy
there
was
not
something
wrong
about
it
and
he
was
turning
him
into
ridicule
but
mitya
had
no
time
to
pause
over
such
trifles
he
hurried
striding
along
and
only
when
he
reached
suhoy
possyolok
did
he
realize
that
they
had
come
not
one
verst
nor
one
and
a
half
but
at
least
three
this
annoyed
him
but
he
controlled
himself
they
went
into
the
hut
the
forester
lived
in
one
half
of
the
hut
and
gorstkin
was
lodging
in
the
other
the
better
room
the
other
side
of
the
passage
they
went
into
that
room
and
lighted
a
tallow
candle
the
hut
was
extremely
overheated
on
the
table
there
was
a
samovar
that
had
gone
out
a
tray
with
cups
an
empty
rum
bottle
a
bottle
of
vodka
partly
full
and
some
halfeaten
crusts
of
wheaten
bread
the
visitor
himself
lay
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
bench
with
his
coat
crushed
up
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
snoring
heavily
mitya
stood
in
perplexity
of
course
i
must
wake
him
my
business
is
too
important
ive
come
in
such
haste
im
in
a
hurry
to
get
back
today
he
said
in
great
agitation
but
the
priest
and
the
forester
stood
in
silence
not
giving
their
opinion
mitya
went
up
and
began
trying
to
wake
him
himself
he
tried
vigorously
but
the
sleeper
did
not
wake
hes
drunk
mitya
decided
good
lord
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
do
and
terribly
impatient
he
began
pulling
him
by
the
arms
by
the
legs
shaking
his
head
lifting
him
up
and
making
him
sit
on
the
bench
yet
after
prolonged
exertions
he
could
only
succeed
in
getting
the
drunken
man
to
utter
absurd
grunts
and
violent
but
inarticulate
oaths
no
youd
better
wait
a
little
the
priest
pronounced
at
last
for
hes
obviously
not
in
a
fit
state
hes
been
drinking
the
whole
day
the
forester
chimed
in
good
heavens
cried
mitya
if
only
you
knew
how
important
it
is
to
me
and
how
desperate
i
am
no
youd
better
wait
till
morning
the
priest
repeated
till
morning
mercy
thats
impossible
and
in
his
despair
he
was
on
the
point
of
attacking
the
sleeping
man
again
but
stopped
short
at
once
realizing
the
uselessness
of
his
efforts
the
priest
said
nothing
the
sleepy
forester
looked
gloomy
what
terrible
tragedies
real
life
contrives
for
people
said
mitya
in
complete
despair
the
perspiration
was
streaming
down
his
face
the
priest
seized
the
moment
to
put
before
him
very
reasonably
that
even
if
he
succeeded
in
wakening
the
man
he
would
still
be
drunk
and
incapable
of
conversation
and
your
business
is
important
he
said
so
youd
certainly
better
put
it
off
till
morning
with
a
gesture
of
despair
mitya
agreed
father
i
will
stay
here
with
a
light
and
seize
the
favorable
moment
as
soon
as
he
wakes
ill
begin
ill
pay
you
for
the
light
he
said
to
the
forester
for
the
nights
lodging
too
youll
remember
dmitri
karamazov
only
father
i
dont
know
what
were
to
do
with
you
where
will
you
sleep
no
im
going
home
ill
take
his
horse
and
get
home
he
said
indicating
the
forester
and
now
ill
say
goodby
i
wish
you
all
success
so
it
was
settled
the
priest
rode
off
on
the
foresters
horse
delighted
to
escape
though
he
shook
his
head
uneasily
wondering
whether
he
ought
not
next
day
to
inform
his
benefactor
fyodor
pavlovitch
of
this
curious
incident
or
he
may
in
an
unlucky
hour
hear
of
it
be
angry
and
withdraw
his
favor
the
forester
scratching
himself
went
back
to
his
room
without
a
word
and
mitya
sat
on
the
bench
to
catch
the
favorable
moment
as
he
expressed
it
profound
dejection
clung
about
his
soul
like
a
heavy
mist
a
profound
intense
dejection
he
sat
thinking
but
could
reach
no
conclusion
the
candle
burnt
dimly
a
cricket
chirped
it
became
insufferably
close
in
the
overheated
room
he
suddenly
pictured
the
garden
the
path
behind
the
garden
the
door
of
his
fathers
house
mysteriously
opening
and
grushenka
running
in
he
leapt
up
from
the
bench
its
a
tragedy
he
said
grinding
his
teeth
mechanically
he
went
up
to
the
sleeping
man
and
looked
in
his
face
he
was
a
lean
middleaged
peasant
with
a
very
long
face
flaxen
curls
and
a
long
thin
reddish
beard
wearing
a
blue
cotton
shirt
and
a
black
waistcoat
from
the
pocket
of
which
peeped
the
chain
of
a
silver
watch
mitya
looked
at
his
face
with
intense
hatred
and
for
some
unknown
reason
his
curly
hair
particularly
irritated
him
what
was
insufferably
humiliating
was
that
after
leaving
things
of
such
importance
and
making
such
sacrifices
he
mitya
utterly
worn
out
should
with
business
of
such
urgency
be
standing
over
this
dolt
on
whom
his
whole
fate
depended
while
he
snored
as
though
there
were
nothing
the
matter
as
though
hed
dropped
from
another
planet
oh
the
irony
of
fate
cried
mitya
and
quite
losing
his
head
he
fell
again
to
rousing
the
tipsy
peasant
he
roused
him
with
a
sort
of
ferocity
pulled
at
him
pushed
him
even
beat
him
but
after
five
minutes
of
vain
exertions
he
returned
to
his
bench
in
helpless
despair
and
sat
down
stupid
stupid
cried
mitya
and
how
dishonorable
it
all
is
something
made
him
add
his
head
began
to
ache
horribly
should
he
fling
it
up
and
go
away
altogether
he
wondered
no
wait
till
tomorrow
now
ill
stay
on
purpose
what
else
did
i
come
for
besides
ive
no
means
of
going
how
am
i
to
get
away
from
here
now
oh
the
idiocy
of
it
but
his
head
ached
more
and
more
he
sat
without
moving
and
unconsciously
dozed
off
and
fell
asleep
as
he
sat
he
seemed
to
have
slept
for
two
hours
or
more
he
was
waked
up
by
his
head
aching
so
unbearably
that
he
could
have
screamed
there
was
a
hammering
in
his
temples
and
the
top
of
his
head
ached
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
could
wake
up
fully
and
understand
what
had
happened
to
him
at
last
he
realized
that
the
room
was
full
of
charcoal
fumes
from
the
stove
and
that
he
might
die
of
suffocation
and
the
drunken
peasant
still
lay
snoring
the
candle
guttered
and
was
about
to
go
out
mitya
cried
out
and
ran
staggering
across
the
passage
into
the
foresters
room
the
forester
waked
up
at
once
but
hearing
that
the
other
room
was
full
of
fumes
to
mityas
surprise
and
annoyance
accepted
the
fact
with
strange
unconcern
though
he
did
go
to
see
to
it
but
hes
dead
hes
dead
and

what
am
i
to
do
then
cried
mitya
frantically
they
threw
open
the
doors
opened
a
window
and
the
chimney
mitya
brought
a
pail
of
water
from
the
passage
first
he
wetted
his
own
head
then
finding
a
rag
of
some
sort
dipped
it
into
the
water
and
put
it
on
lyagavys
head
the
forester
still
treated
the
matter
contemptuously
and
when
he
opened
the
window
said
grumpily
itll
be
all
right
now
he
went
back
to
sleep
leaving
mitya
a
lighted
lantern
mitya
fussed
about
the
drunken
peasant
for
half
an
hour
wetting
his
head
and
gravely
resolved
not
to
sleep
all
night
but
he
was
so
worn
out
that
when
he
sat
down
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
he
closed
his
eyes
unconsciously
stretched
himself
full
length
on
the
bench
and
slept
like
the
dead
it
was
dreadfully
late
when
he
waked
it
was
somewhere
about
nine
oclock
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
in
the
two
little
windows
of
the
hut
the
curlyheaded
peasant
was
sitting
on
the
bench
and
had
his
coat
on
he
had
another
samovar
and
another
bottle
in
front
of
him
yesterdays
bottle
had
already
been
finished
and
the
new
one
was
more
than
half
empty
mitya
jumped
up
and
saw
at
once
that
the
cursed
peasant
was
drunk
again
hopelessly
and
incurably
he
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
with
wide
opened
eyes
the
peasant
was
silently
and
slyly
watching
him
with
insulting
composure
and
even
a
sort
of
contemptuous
condescension
so
mitya
fancied
he
rushed
up
to
him
excuse
me
you
see

i

youve
most
likely
heard
from
the
forester

hut

the
old

whose
copse

said
the
peasant
calmly
and
confidently
a
lie
you
know
fyodor
pavlovitch
i
dont
know
any
of
your

the
peasant
speaking
thickly

copse

and

gasped
breathlessly
youre
llying
lyagavy
blurted
out
again
mityas
legs
went
cold
for
mercys
sake
it
isnt
a
joke

drunk
perhaps

the
peasant
stroked
his
beard
importantly
no

contracted
for
the
job
and
turned
out
a
scamp
youre
a
scoundrel
i
assure
you
youre
mistaken
cried
mitya
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
the
peasant
still
stroked
his
beard
and
suddenly
screwed
up
his
eyes
cunningly
no
you
show
me
this
you
tell
me
the
law
that
allows
roguery
dyou
hear
youre
a
scoundrel
do
you
understand
that
mitya
stepped
back
gloomily
and
suddenly
something
seemed
to
hit
him
on
the
head
as
he
said
afterwards
in
an
instant
a
light
seemed
to
dawn
in
his
mind
a
light
was
kindled
and
i
grasped
it
all
he
stood
stupefied
wondering
how
he
after
all
a
man
of
intelligence
could
have
yielded
to
such
folly
have
been
led
into
such
an
adventure
and
have
kept
it
up
for
almost
twentyfour
hours
fussing
round
this
lyagavy
wetting
his
head
why
the
mans
drunk
dead
drunk
and
hell
go
on
drinking
now
for
a
week
whats
the
use
of
waiting
here
and
what
if
samsonov
sent
me
here
on
purpose
what
if
she
oh
god
what
have
i
done
the
peasant
sat
watching
him
and
grinning
another
time
mitya
might
have
killed
the
fool
in
a
fury
but
now
he
felt
as
weak
as
a
child
he
went
quietly
to
the
bench
took
up
his
overcoat
put
it
on
without
a
word
and
went
out
of
the
hut
he
did
not
find
the
forester
in
the
next
room
there
was
no
one
there
he
took
fifty
kopecks
in
small
change
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
them
on
the
table
for
his
nights
lodging
the
candle
and
the
trouble
he
had
given
coming
out
of
the
hut
he
saw
nothing
but
forest
all
round
he
walked
at
hazard
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
out
of
the
hut
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
hurrying
there
the
evening
before
with
the
priest
he
had
not
noticed
the
road
he
had
no
revengeful
feeling
for
anybody
even
for
samsonov
in
his
heart
he
strode
along
a
narrow
forest
path
aimless
dazed
without
heeding
where
he
was
going
a
child
could
have
knocked
him
down
so
weak
was
he
in
body
and
soul
he
got
out
of
the
forest
somehow
however
and
a
vista
of
fields
bare
after
the
harvest
stretched
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
what
despair
what
death
all
round
he
repeated
striding
on
and
on
he
was
saved
by
meeting
an
old
merchant
who
was
being
driven
across
country
in
a
hired
trap
when
he
overtook
him
mitya
asked
the
way
and
it
turned
out
that
the
old
merchant
too
was
going
to
volovya
after
some
discussion
mitya
got
into
the
trap
three
hours
later
they
arrived
at
volovya
mitya
at
once
ordered
postinghorses
to
drive
to
the
town
and
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
appallingly
hungry
while
the
horses
were
being
harnessed
an
omelette
was
prepared
for
him
he
ate
it
all
in
an
instant
ate
a
huge
hunk
of
bread
ate
a
sausage
and
swallowed
three
glasses
of
vodka
after
eating
his
spirits
and
his
heart
grew
lighter
he
flew
towards
the
town
urged
on
the
driver
and
suddenly
made
a
new
and
unalterable
plan
to
procure
that
accursed
money
before
evening
and
to
think
only
to
think
that
a
mans
life
should
be
ruined
for
the
sake
of
that
paltry
three
thousand
he
cried
contemptuously
ill
settle
it
to
day
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
thought
of
grushenka
and
of
what
might
have
happened
to
her
which
never
left
him
he
would
perhaps
have
become
quite
cheerful
again
but
the
thought
of
her
was
stabbing
him
to
the
heart
every
moment
like
a
sharp
knife
at
last
they
arrived
and
mitya
at
once
ran
to
grushenka
chapter
iii
goldmines
this
was
the
visit
of
mitya
of
which
grushenka
had
spoken
to
rakitin
with
such
horror
she
was
just
then
expecting
the
message
and
was
much
relieved
that
mitya
had
not
been
to
see
her
that
day
or
the
day
before
she
hoped
that
please
god
he
wont
come
till
im
gone
away
and
he
suddenly
burst
in
on
her
the
rest
we
know
already
to
get
him
off
her
hands
she
suggested
at
once
that
he
should
walk
with
her
to
samsonovs
where
she
said
she
absolutely
must
go
to
settle
his
accounts
and
when
mitya
accompanied
her
at
once
she
said
goodby
to
him
at
the
gate
making
him
promise
to
come
at
twelve
oclock
to
take
her
home
again
mitya
too
was
delighted
at
this
arrangement
if
she
was
sitting
at
samsonovs
she
could
not
be
going
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
if
only
shes
not
lying
he
added
at
once
but
he
thought
she
was
not
lying
from
what
he
saw
he
was
that
sort
of
jealous
man
who
in
the
absence
of
the
beloved
woman
at
once
invents
all
sorts
of
awful
fancies
of
what
may
be
happening
to
her
and
how
she
may
be
betraying
him
but
when
shaken
heartbroken
convinced
of
her
faithlessness
he
runs
back
to
her
at
the
first
glance
at
her
face
her
gay
laughing
affectionate
face
he
revives
at
once
lays
aside
all
suspicion
and
with
joyful
shame
abuses
himself
for
his
jealousy
after
leaving
grushenka
at
the
gate
he
rushed
home
oh
he
had
so
much
still
to
do
that
day
but
a
load
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
anyway
now
i
must
only
make
haste
and
find
out
from
smerdyakov
whether
anything
happened
there
last
night
whether
by
any
chance
she
went
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
ough
floated
through
his
mind
before
he
had
time
to
reach
his
lodging
jealousy
had
surged
up
again
in
his
restless
heart
jealousy
othello
was
not
jealous
he
was
trustful
observed
pushkin
and
that
remark
alone
is
enough
to
show
the
deep
insight
of
our
great
poet
othellos
soul
was
shattered
and
his
whole
outlook
clouded
simply
because
his
ideal
was
destroyed
but
othello
did
not
begin
hiding
spying
peeping
he
was
trustful
on
the
contrary
he
had
to
be
led
up
pushed
on
excited
with
great
difficulty
before
he
could
entertain
the
idea
of
deceit
the
truly
jealous
man
is
not
like
that
it
is
impossible
to
picture
to
oneself
the
shame
and
moral
degradation
to
which
the
jealous
man
can
descend
without
a
qualm
of
conscience
and
yet
its
not
as
though
the
jealous
were
all
vulgar
and
base
souls
on
the
contrary
a
man
of
lofty
feelings
whose
love
is
pure
and
full
of
selfsacrifice
may
yet
hide
under
tables
bribe
the
vilest
people
and
be
familiar
with
the
lowest
ignominy
of
spying
and
eavesdropping
othello
was
incapable
of
making
up
his
mind
to
faithlessnessnot
incapable
of
forgiving
it
but
of
making
up
his
mind
to
itthough
his
soul
was
as
innocent
and
free
from
malice
as
a
babes
it
is
not
so
with
the
really
jealous
man
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
some
jealous
men
can
make
up
their
mind
to
and
overlook
and
what
they
can
forgive
the
jealous
are
the
readiest
of
all
to
forgive
and
all
women
know
it
the
jealous
man
can
forgive
extraordinarily
quickly
though
of
course
after
a
violent
scene
and
he
is
able
to
forgive
infidelity
almost
conclusively
proved
the
very
kisses
and
embraces
he
has
seen
if
only
he
can
somehow
be
convinced
that
it
has
all
been
for
the
last
time
and
that
his
rival
will
vanish
from
that
day
forward
will
depart
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
or
that
he
himself
will
carry
her
away
somewhere
where
that
dreaded
rival
will
not
get
near
her
of
course
the
reconciliation
is
only
for
an
hour
for
even
if
the
rival
did
disappear
next
day
he
would
invent
another
one
and
would
be
jealous
of
him
and
one
might
wonder
what
there
was
in
a
love
that
had
to
be
so
watched
over
what
a
love
could
be
worth
that
needed
such
strenuous
guarding
but
that
the
jealous
will
never
understand
and
yet
among
them
are
men
of
noble
hearts
it
is
remarkable
too
that
those
very
men
of
noble
hearts
standing
hidden
in
some
cupboard
listening
and
spying
never
feel
the
stings
of
conscience
at
that
moment
anyway
though
they
understand
clearly
enough
with
their
noble
hearts
the
shameful
depths
to
which
they
have
voluntarily
sunk
at
the
sight
of
grushenka
mityas
jealousy
vanished
and
for
an
instant
he
became
trustful
and
generous
and
positively
despised
himself
for
his
evil
feelings
but
it
only
proved
that
in
his
love
for
the
woman
there
was
an
element
of
something
far
higher
than
he
himself
imagined
that
it
was
not
only
a
sensual
passion
not
only
the
curve
of
her
body
of
which
he
had
talked
to
alyosha
but
as
soon
as
grushenka
had
gone
mitya
began
to
suspect
her
of
all
the
low
cunning
of
faithlessness
and
he
felt
no
sting
of
conscience
at
it
and
so
jealousy
surged
up
in
him
again
he
had
in
any
case
to
make
haste
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
hold
of
at
least
a
small
temporary
loan
of
money
the
nine
roubles
had
almost
all
gone
on
his
expedition
and
as
we
all
know
one
cant
take
a
step
without
money
but
he
had
thought
over
in
the
cart
where
he
could
get
a
loan
he
had
a
brace
of
fine
dueling
pistols
in
a
case
which
he
had
not
pawned
till
then
because
he
prized
them
above
all
his
possessions
in
the
metropolis
tavern
he
had
some
time
since
made
acquaintance
with
a
young
official
and
had
learnt
that
this
very
opulent
bachelor
was
passionately
fond
of
weapons
he
used
to
buy
pistols
revolvers
daggers
hang
them
on
his
wall
and
show
them
to
acquaintances
he
prided
himself
on
them
and
was
quite
a
specialist
on
the
mechanism
of
the
revolver
mitya
without
stopping
to
think
went
straight
to
him
and
offered
to
pawn
his
pistols
to
him
for
ten
roubles
the
official
delighted
began
trying
to
persuade
him
to
sell
them
outright
but
mitya
would
not
consent
so
the
young
man
gave
him
ten
roubles
protesting
that
nothing
would
induce
him
to
take
interest
they
parted
friends
mitya
was
in
haste
he
rushed
towards
fyodor
pavlovitchs
by
the
back
way
to
his
arbor
to
get
hold
of
smerdyakov
as
soon
as
possible
in
this
way
the
fact
was
established
that
three
or
four
hours
before
a
certain
event
of
which
i
shall
speak
later
on
mitya
had
not
a
farthing
and
pawned
for
ten
roubles
a
possession
he
valued
though
three
hours
later
he
was
in
possession
of
thousands
but
i
am
anticipating
from
marya
kondratyevna
the
woman
living
near
fyodor
pavlovitchs
he
learned
the
very
disturbing
fact
of
smerdyakovs
illness
he
heard
the
story
of
his
fall
in
the
cellar
his
fit
the
doctors
visit
fyodor
pavlovitchs
anxiety
he
heard
with
interest
too
that
his
brother
ivan
had
set
off
that
morning
for
moscow
then
he
must
have
driven
through
volovya
before
me
thought
dmitri
but
he
was
terribly
distressed
about
smerdyakov
what
will
happen
now
wholl
keep
watch
for
me
wholl
bring
me
word
he
thought
he
began
greedily
questioning
the
women
whether
they
had
seen
anything
the
evening
before
they
quite
understood
what
he
was
trying
to
find
out
and
completely
reassured
him
no
one
had
been
there
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
been
there
the
night
everything
had
been
perfectly
as
usual
mitya
grew
thoughtful
he
would
certainly
have
to
keep
watch
today
but
where
here
or
at
samsonovs
gate
he
decided
that
he
must
be
on
the
look
out
both
here
and
there
and
meanwhile

meanwhile
the
difficulty
was
that
he
had
to
carry
out
the
new
plan
that
he
had
made
on
the
journey
back
he
was
sure
of
its
success
but
he
must
not
delay
acting
upon
it
mitya
resolved
to
sacrifice
an
hour
to
it
in
an
hour
i
shall
know
everything
i
shall
settle
everything
and
then
then
first
of
all
to
samsonovs
ill
inquire
whether
grushenkas
there
and
instantly
be
back
here
again
stay
till
eleven
and
then
to
samsonovs
again
to
bring
her
home
this
was
what
he
decided
he
flew
home
washed
combed
his
hair
brushed
his
clothes
dressed
and
went
to
madame
hohlakovs
alas
he
had
built
his
hopes
on
her
he
had
resolved
to
borrow
three
thousand
from
that
lady
and
what
was
more
he
felt
suddenly
convinced
that
she
would
not
refuse
to
lend
it
to
him
it
may
be
wondered
why
if
he
felt
so
certain
he
had
not
gone
to
her
at
first
one
of
his
own
sort
so
to
speak
instead
of
to
samsonov
a
man
he
did
not
know
who
was
not
of
his
own
class
and
to
whom
he
hardly
knew
how
to
speak
but
the
fact
was
that
he
had
never
known
madame
hohlakov
well
and
had
seen
nothing
of
her
for
the
last
month
and
that
he
knew
she
could
not
endure
him
she
had
detested
him
from
the
first
because
he
was
engaged
to
katerina
ivanovna
while
she
had
for
some
reason
suddenly
conceived
the
desire
that
katerina
ivanovna
should
throw
him
over
and
marry
the
charming
chivalrously
refined
ivan
who
had
such
excellent
manners
mityas
manners
she
detested
mitya
positively
laughed
at
her
and
had
once
said
about
her
that
she
was
just
as
lively
and
at
her
ease
as
she
was
uncultivated
but
that
morning
in
the
cart
a
brilliant
idea
had
struck
him
if
she
is
so
anxious
i
should
not
marry
katerina
ivanovna
and
he
knew
she
was
positively
hysterical
upon
the
subject
why
should
she
refuse
me
now
that
three
thousand
just
to
enable
me
to
leave
katya
and
get
away
from
her
for
ever
these
spoilt
fine
ladies
if
they
set
their
hearts
on
anything
will
spare
no
expense
to
satisfy
their
caprice
besides
shes
so
rich
mitya
argued
as
for
his
plan
it
was
just
the
same
as
before
it
consisted
of
the
offer
of
his
rights
to
tchermashnyabut
not
with
a
commercial
object
as
it
had
been
with
samsonov
not
trying
to
allure
the
lady
with
the
possibility
of
making
a
profit
of
six
or
seven
thousandbut
simply
as
a
security
for
the
debt
as
he
worked
out
this
new
idea
mitya
was
enchanted
with
it
but
so
it
always
was
with
him
in
all
his
undertakings
in
all
his
sudden
decisions
he
gave
himself
up
to
every
new
idea
with
passionate
enthusiasm
yet
when
he
mounted
the
steps
of
madame
hohlakovs
house
he
felt
a
shiver
of
fear
run
down
his
spine
at
that
moment
he
saw
fully
as
a
mathematical
certainty
that
this
was
his
last
hope
that
if
this
broke
down
nothing
else
was
left
him
in
the
world
but
to
rob
and
murder
some
one
for
the
three
thousand
it
was
halfpast
seven
when
he
rang
at
the
bell
at
first
fortune
seemed
to
smile
upon
him
as
soon
as
he
was
announced
he
was
received
with
extraordinary
rapidity
as
though
she
were
waiting
for
me
thought
mitya
and
as
soon
as
he
had
been
led
to
the
drawingroom
the
lady
of
the
house
herself
ran
in
and
declared
at
once
that
she
was
expecting
him
i
was
expecting
you
i
was
expecting
you
though
id
no
reason
to
suppose
you
would
come
to
see
me
as
you
will
admit
yourself
yet
i
did
expect
you
you
may
marvel
at
my
instinct
dmitri
fyodorovitch
but
i
was
convinced
all
the
morning
that
you
would
come
that
is
certainly
wonderful
madam
observed
mitya
sitting
down
limply
but
i
have
come
to
you
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
on
a
matter
of
supreme
importance
for
me
that
is
madam

for
me
alone

and
i
hasten
i
know
youve
come
on
most
important
business
dmitri
fyodorovitch
its
not
a
case
of
presentiment
no
reactionary
harking
back
to
the
miraculous
have
you
heard
about
father
zossima
this
is
a
case
of
mathematics
you
couldnt
help
coming
after
all
that
has
passed
with
katerina
ivanovna
you
couldnt
you
couldnt
thats
a
mathematical
certainty
the
realism
of
actual
life
madam
thats
what
it
is
but
allow
me
to
explain
realism
indeed
dmitri
fyodorovitch
im
all
for
realism
now
ive
seen
too
much
of
miracles
youve
heard
that
father
zossima
is
dead
no
madam
its
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
it
mitya
was
a
little
surprised
the
image
of
alyosha
rose
to
his
mind
last
night
and
only
imagine
madam
said
mitya
i
can
imagine
nothing
except
that
im
in
a
desperate
position
and
that
if
you
dont
help
me
everything
will
come
to
grief
and
i
first
of
all
excuse
me
for
the
triviality
of
the
expression
but
im
in
a
fever
i
know
i
know
that
youre
in
a
fever
you
could
hardly
fail
to
be
and
whatever
you
may
say
to
me
i
know
beforehand
i
have
long
been
thinking
over
your
destiny
dmitri
fyodorovitch
i
am
watching
over
it
and
studying
it
oh
believe
me
im
an
experienced
doctor
of
the
soul
dmitri
fyodorovitch
madam
if
you
are
an
experienced
doctor
im
certainly
an
experienced
patient
said
mitya
with
an
effort
to
be
polite
and
i
feel
that
if
you
are
watching
over
my
destiny
in
this
way
you
will
come
to
my
help
in
my
ruin
and
so
allow
me
at
least
to
explain
to
you
the
plan
with
which
i
have
ventured
to
come
to
you

and
what
i
am
hoping
of
you
i
have
come
madam
dont
explain
it
its
of
secondary
importance
but
as
for
help
youre
not
the
first
i
have
helped
dmitri
fyodorovitch
you
have
most
likely
heard
of
my
cousin
madame
belmesov
her
husband
was
ruined
had
come
to
grief
as
you
characteristically
express
it
dmitri
fyodorovitch
i
recommended
him
to
take
to
horsebreeding
and
now
hes
doing
well
have
you
any
idea
of
horsebreeding
dmitri
fyodorovitch
not
the
faintest
madam
ah
madam
not
the
faintest
cried
mitya
in
nervous
impatience
positively
starting
from
his
seat
i
simply
implore
you
madam
to
listen
to
me
only
give
me
two
minutes
of
free
speech
that
i
may
just
explain
to
you
everything
the
whole
plan
with
which
i
have
come
besides
i
am
short
of
time
im
in
a
fearful
hurry
mitya
cried
hysterically
feeling
that
she
was
just
going
to
begin
talking
again
and
hoping
to
cut
her
short
i
have
come
in
despair

in
the
last
gasp
of
despair
to
beg
you
to
lend
me
the
sum
of
three
thousand
a
loan
but
on
safe
most
safe
security
madam
with
the
most
trustworthy
guarantees
only
let
me
explain
you
must
tell
me
all
that
afterwards
afterwards
madame
hohlakov
with
a
gesture
demanded
silence
in
her
turn
and
whatever
you
may
tell
me
i
know
it
all
beforehand
ive
told
you
so
already
you
ask
for
a
certain
sum
for
three
thousand
but
i
can
give
you
more
immeasurably
more
i
will
save
you
dmitri
fyodorovitch
but
you
must
listen
to
me
mitya
started
from
his
seat
again
madam
will
you
really
be
so
good
he
cried
with
strong
feeling
good
god
youve
saved
me
you
have
saved
a
man
from
a
violent
death
from
a
bullet
my
eternal
gratitude
i
will
give
you
more
infinitely
more
than
three
thousand
cried
madame
hohlakov
looking
with
a
radiant
smile
at
mityas
ecstasy
infinitely
but
i
dont
need
so
much
i
only
need
that
fatal
three
thousand
and
on
my
part
i
can
give
security
for
that
sum
with
infinite
gratitude
and
i
propose
a
plan
which
enough
dmitri
fyodorovitch
its
said
and
done
madame
hohlakov
cut
him
short
with
the
modest
triumph
of
beneficence
i
have
promised
to
save
you
and
i
will
save
you
i
will
save
you
as
i
did
belmesov
what
do
you
think
of
the
goldmines
dmitri
fyodorovitch
of
the
goldmines
madam
i
have
never
thought
anything
about
them
but
i
have
thought
of
them
for
you
thought
of
them
over
and
over
again
i
have
been
watching
you
for
the
last
month
ive
watched
you
a
hundred
times
as
youve
walked
past
saying
to

a
man
of
energy
who
ought
to
be
at
the
goldmines
ive
studied
your
gait
and
come
to
the
conclusion
thats
a
man
who
would
find
gold
from
my
gait
madam
said
mitya
smiling
yes
from
your
gait
you
surely
dont
deny
that
character
can
be
told
from
the
gait

fyodorovitch
science
supports
the
idea
im
all
for
science
and
realism
now
after
all
this
business
with
father
zossima
which
has
so
upset
me
from
this
very
day

a
realist
and
i
want
to
devote
myself
to
practical
usefulness
im
cured
enough
as
turgenev
says
but
madam

three
thousand

generously

to
lend
me

is
yours
dmitri
fyodorovitch
madame
hohlakov
cut
in
at
once
the
money
is
as
good
as
in
your
pocket
not
three
thousand
but
three
million
dmitri
fyodorovitch
in
less
than
no
time
ill
make
you
a
present
of
the
idea

millions

and
become
a
leading
man
and
wake
us
up
and
lead
us
to
better
things
are
we
to
leave
it
all
to
the
jews
you
will
found
institutions
and
enterprises
of
all
sorts
you
will
help
the
poor
and
they
will
bless
you
this
is
the
age
of
railways
dmitri
fyodorovitch
youll
become
famous
and
indispensable
to
the
department
of
finance
which
is
so
badly
off
at
present
the
depreciation
of
the
rouble
keeps
me
awake
at
night
dmitri
fyodorovitch
people
dont
know
that
side
of
me
madam
madam
dmitri
interrupted
with
an
uneasy
presentiment
i
shall
indeed
perhaps
follow
your
advice
your
wise
advice
madam
i
shall
perhaps
set
off

to
the
goldmines
ill
come
and
see
you
again
about
it

many
times
indeed

but
now
that
three
thousand
you
so
generously

oh
that
would
set
me
free
and
if
you
could
today

you
see
i
havent
a
minute
a
minute
to
lose
today
enough
dmitri
fyodorovitch
enough
madame
hohlakov
interrupted
emphatically
the
question
is
will
you
go
to
the
goldmines
or
not
have
you
quite
made
up
your
mind
answer
yes
or
no
i
will
go
madam
afterwards
ill
go
where
you
like

but
now
wait
cried
madame
hohlakov
and
jumping
up
and
running
to
a
handsome
bureau
with
numerous
little
drawers
she
began
pulling
out
one
drawer
after
another
looking
for
something
with
desperate
haste
the
three
thousand
thought
mitya
his
heart
almost
stopping
and
at
the
instant

without
any
papers
or
formalities

thats
doing
things
in
gentlemanly
style
shes
a
splendid
woman
if
only
she
didnt
talk
so
much
here
cried
madame
hohlakov
running
back
joyfully
to
mitya
here
is
what
i
was
looking
for
it
was
a
tiny
silver
ikon
on
a
cord
such
as
is
sometimes
worn
next
the
skin
with
a
cross
this
is
from
kiev
dmitri
fyodorovitch
she
went
on
reverently
from
the
relics
of
the
holy
martyr
varvara
let
me
put
it
on
your
neck
myself
and
with
it
dedicate
you
to
a
new
life
to
a
new
career
and
she
actually
put
the
cord
round
his
neck
and
began
arranging
it
in
extreme
embarrassment
mitya
bent
down
and
helped
her
and
at
last
he
got
it
under
his
necktie
and
collar
through
his
shirt
to
his
chest
now
you
can
set
off
madame
hohlakov
pronounced
sitting
down
triumphantly
in
her
place
again
madam
i
am
so
touched
i
dont
know
how
to
thank
you
indeed

for
such
kindness
but

if
only
you
knew
how
precious
time
is
to
me
that
sum
of
money
for
which
i
shall
be
indebted
to
your
generosity
oh
madam
since
you
are
so
kind
so
touchingly
generous
to
me
mitya
exclaimed
impulsively
then
let
me
reveal
to
you

though
of
course
youve
known
it
a
long
time

that
i
love
somebody
here
i
have
been
false
to
katya

katerina
ivanovna
i
should
say
oh
ive
behaved
inhumanly
dishonorably
to
her
but
i
fell
in
love
here
with
another
woman

a
woman
whom
you
madam
perhaps
despise
for
you
know
everything
already
but
whom
i
cannot
leave
on
any
account
and
therefore
that
three
thousand
now
leave
everything
dmitri
fyodorovitch
madame
hohlakov
interrupted
in
the
most
decisive
tone
leave
everything
especially
women
goldmines
are
your
goal
and
theres
no
place
for
women
there
afterwards
when
you
come
back
rich
and
famous
you
will
find
the
girl
of
your
heart
in
the
highest
society
that
will
be
a
modern
girl
a
girl
of
education
and
advanced
ideas
by
that
time
the
dawning
woman
question
will
have
gained
ground
and
the
new
woman
will
have
appeared
madam
thats
not
the
point
not
at
all
mitya
clasped
his
hands
in
entreaty
yes
it
is
dmitri
fyodorovitch
just
what
you
need
the
very
thing
youre
yearning
for
though
you
dont
realize
it
yourself
i
am
not
at
all
opposed
to
the
present
woman
movement
dmitri
fyodorovitch
the
development
of
woman
and
even
the
political
emancipation
of
woman
in
the
near
futurethats
my
ideal
ive
a
daughter
myself
dmitri
fyodorovitch
people
dont
know
that
side
of
me
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
author
shtchedrin
on
that
subject
he
has
taught
me
so
much
so
much
about
the
vocation
of
woman
so
last
year
i
sent
him
an
anonymous
letter
of
two
lines
i
kiss
and
embrace
you
my
teacher
for
the
modern
woman
persevere
and
i
signed
myself
a
mother
i
thought
of
signing
myself
a
contemporary
mother
and
hesitated
but
i
stuck
to
the
simple
mother
theres
more
moral
beauty
in
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
and
the
word
contemporary
might
have
reminded
him
of
the
contemporarya
painful
recollection
owing
to
the
censorship
good
heavens
what
is
the
matter
madam
cried
mitya
jumping
up
at
last
clasping
his
hands
before
her
in
helpless
entreaty
you
will
make
me
weep
if
you
delay
what
you
have
so
generously
oh
do
weep
dmitri
fyodorovitch
do
weep
thats
a
noble
feeling

such
a
path
lies
open
before
you
tears
will
ease
your
heart
and
later
on
you
will
return
rejoicing
you
will
hasten
to
me
from
siberia
on
purpose
to
share
your
joy
with
me
but
allow
me
too
mitya
cried
suddenly
for
the
last
time
i
entreat
you
tell
me
can
i
have
the
sum
you
promised
me
today
if
not
when
may
i
come
for
it
what
sum
dmitri
fyodorovitch
the
three
thousand
you
promised
me

that
you
so
generously
three
thousand
roubles
oh
no
i
havent
got
three
thousand
madame
hohlakov
announced
with
serene
amazement
mitya
was
stupefied
why
you
said
just
now

you
said

you
said
it
was
as
good
as
in
my
hands
oh
no
you
misunderstood
me
dmitri
fyodorovitch
in
that
case
you
misunderstood
me
i
was
talking
of
the
goldmines
its
true
i
promised
you
more
infinitely
more
than
three
thousand
i
remember
it
all
now
but
i
was
referring
to
the
goldmines
but
the
money
the
three
thousand
mitya
exclaimed
awkwardly
oh
if
you
meant
money
i
havent
any
i
havent
a
penny
dmitri
fyodorovitch
im
quarreling
with
my
steward
about
it
and
ive
just
borrowed
five
hundred
roubles
from
misov
myself
no
no
ive
no
money
and
do
you
know
dmitri
fyodorovitch
if
i
had
i
wouldnt
give
it
to
you
in
the
first
place
i
never
lend
money
lending
money
means
losing
friends
and
i
wouldnt
give
it
to
you
particularly
i
wouldnt
give
it
you
because
i
like
you
and
want
to
save
you
for
all
you
need
is
the
goldmines
the
goldmines
the
goldmines
oh
the
devil
roared
mitya
and
with
all
his
might
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
aie
aie
cried
madame
hohlakov
alarmed
and
she
flew
to
the
other
end
of
the
drawingroom
mitya
spat
on
the
ground
and
strode
rapidly
out
of
the
room
out
of
the
house
into
the
street
into
the
darkness
he
walked
like
one
possessed
and
beating
himself
on
the
breast
on
the
spot
where
he
had
struck
himself
two
days
previously
before
alyosha
the
last
time
he
saw
him
in
the
dark
on
the
road
what
those
blows
upon
his
breast
signified
on
that
spot
and
what
he
meant
by
itthat
was
for
the
time
a
secret
which
was
known
to
no
one
in
the
world
and
had
not
been
told
even
to
alyosha
but
that
secret
meant
for
him
more
than
disgrace
it
meant
ruin
suicide
so
he
had
determined
if
he
did
not
get
hold
of
the
three
thousand
that
would
pay
his
debt
to
katerina
ivanovna
and
so
remove
from
his
breast
from
that
spot
on
his
breast
the
shame
he
carried
upon
it
that
weighed
on
his
conscience
all
this
will
be
fully
explained
to
the
reader
later
on
but
now
that
his
last
hope
had
vanished
this
man
so
strong
in
appearance
burst
out
crying
like
a
little
child
a
few
steps
from
the
hohlakovs
house
he
walked
on
and
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
wiped
away
his
tears
with
his
fist
in
this
way
he
reached
the
square
and
suddenly
became
aware
that
he
had
stumbled
against
something
he
heard
a
piercing
wail
from
an
old
woman
whom
he
had
almost
knocked
down
good
lord
youve
nearly
killed
me
why
dont
you
look
where
youre
going
scapegrace
why
its
you
cried
mitya
recognizing
the
old
woman
in
the
dark
it
was
the
old
servant
who
waited
on
samsonov
whom
mitya
had
particularly
noticed
the
day
before
and
who
are
you
my
good
sir
said
the
old
woman
in
quite
a
different
voice
i
dont
know
you
in
the
dark
you
live
at
kuzma
kuzmitchs
youre
the
servant
there
just
so
sir
i
was
only
running
out
to
prohoritchs
but
i
dont
know
you
now
tell
me
my
good
woman
is
agrafena
alexandrovna
there
now
said
mitya
beside
himself
with
suspense
i
saw
her
to
the
house
some
time
ago
she
has
been
there
sir
she
stayed
a
little
while
and
went
off
again
what
went
away
cried
mitya
when
did
she
go
why
as
soon
as
she
came
she
only
stayed
a
minute
she
only
told
kuzma
kuzmitch
a
tale
that
made
him
laugh
and
then
she
ran
away
youre
lying
damn
you
roared
mitya
aie
aie
shrieked
the
old
woman
but
mitya
had
vanished
he
ran
with
all
his
might
to
the
house
where
grushenka
lived
at
the
moment
he
reached
it
grushenka
was
on
her
way
to
mokroe
it
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
her
departure
fenya
was
sitting
with
her
grandmother
the
old
cook
matryona
in
the
kitchen
when
the
captain
ran
in
fenya
uttered
a
piercing
shriek
on
seeing
him
you
scream
roared
mitya
where
is
she
but
without
giving
the
terrorstricken
fenya
time
to
utter
a
word
he
fell
all
of
a
heap
at
her
feet
fenya
for
christs
sake
tell
me
where
is
she
i
dont
know
dmitri
fyodorovitch
my
dear
i
dont
know
you
may
kill
me
but
i
cant
tell
you
fenya
swore
and
protested
you
went
out
with
her
yourself
not
long
ago
she
came
back
indeed
she
didnt
by
god
i
swear
she
didnt
come
back
youre
lying
shouted
mitya
from
your
terror
i
know
where
she
is
he
rushed
away
fenya
in
her
fright
was
glad
she
had
got
off
so
easily
but
she
knew
very
well
that
it
was
only
that
he
was
in
such
haste
or
she
might
not
have
fared
so
well
but
as
he
ran
he
surprised
both
fenya
and
old
matryona
by
an
unexpected
action
on
the
table
stood
a
brass
mortar
with
a
pestle
in
it
a
small
brass
pestle
not
much
more
than
six
inches
long
mitya
already
had
opened
the
door
with
one
hand
when
with
the
other
he
snatched
up
the
pestle
and
thrust
it
in
his
sidepocket
oh
lord
hes
going
to
murder
some
one
cried
fenya
flinging
up
her
hands

the
dark
where
was
he
running
where
could
she
be
except
at
fyodor
pavlovitchs
she
must
have
run
straight
to
him
from
samsonovs
that
was
clear
now
the
whole
intrigue
the
whole
deceit
was
evident

it
all
rushed
whirling
through
his
mind
he
did
not
run
to
marya
kondratyevnas
there
was
no
need
to
go
there

not
the
slightest
need

he
must
raise
no
alarm

they
would
run
and
tell
directly
marya
kondratyevna
was
clearly
in
the
plot
smerdyakov
too
he
too
all
had
been
bought
over
he
formed
another
plan
of
action
he
ran
a
long
way
round
fyodor
pavlovitchs
house
crossing
the
lane
running
down
dmitrovsky
street
then
over
the
little
bridge
and
so
came
straight
to
the
deserted
alley
at
the
back
which
was
empty
and
uninhabited
with
on
one
side
the
hurdle
fence
of
a
neighbors
kitchengarden
on
the
other
the
strong
high
fence
that
ran
all
round
fyodor
pavlovitchs
garden
here
he
chose
a
spot
apparently
the
very
place
where
according
to
the
tradition
he
knew
lizaveta
had
once
climbed
over
it
if
she
could
climb
over
it
the
thought
god
knows
why
occurred
to
him
surely
i
can
he
did
in
fact
jump
up
and
instantly
contrived
to
catch
hold
of
the
top
of
the
fence
then
he
vigorously
pulled
himself
up
and
sat
astride
on
it
close
by
in
the
garden
stood
the
bathhouse
but
from
the
fence
he
could
see
the
lighted
windows
of
the
house
too
yes
the
old
mans
bedroom
is
lighted
up
shes
there
and
he
leapt
from
the
fence
into
the
garden
though
he
knew
grigory
was
ill
and
very
likely
smerdyakov
too
and
that
there
was
no
one
to
hear
him
he
instinctively
hid
himself
stood
still
and
began
to
listen
but
there
was
dead
silence
on
all
sides
and
as
though
of
design
complete
stillness
not
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
and
naught
but
the
whispering
silence
the
line
for
some
reason
rose
to
his
mind
if
only
no
one
heard
me
jump
over
the
fence
i
think
not
standing
still
for
a
minute
he
walked
softly
over
the
grass
in
the
garden
avoiding
the
trees
and
shrubs
he
walked
slowly
creeping
stealthily
at
every
step
listening
to
his
own
footsteps
it
took
him
five
minutes
to
reach
the
lighted
window
he
remembered
that
just
under
the
window
there
were
several
thick
and
high
bushes
of
elder
and
whitebeam
the
door
from
the
house
into
the
garden
on
the
lefthand
side
was
shut
he
had
carefully
looked
on
purpose
to
see
in
passing
at
last
he
reached
the
bushes
and
hid
behind
them
he
held
his
breath
i
must
wait
now
he
thought
to
reassure
them
in
case
they
heard
my
footsteps
and
are
listening

if
only
i
dont
cough
or
sneeze
he
waited
two
minutes
his
heart
was
beating
violently
and
at
moments
he
could
scarcely
breathe
no
this
throbbing
at
my
heart
wont
stop
he
thought
i
cant
wait
any
longer
he
was
standing
behind
a
bush
in
the
shadow
the
light
of
the
window
fell
on
the
front
part
of
the
bush
how
red
the
whitebeam
berries
are
he
murmured
not
knowing
why
softly
and
noiselessly
step
by
step
he
approached
the
window
and
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
all
fyodor
pavlovitchs
bedroom
lay
open
before
him
it
was
not
a
large
room
and
was
divided
in
two
parts
by
a
red
screen
chinese
as
fyodor
pavlovitch
used
to
call
it
the
word
chinese
flashed
into
mityas
mind
and
behind
the
screen
is
grushenka
thought
mitya
he
began
watching
fyodor
pavlovitch
who
was
wearing
his
new
stripedsilk
dressinggown
which
mitya
had
never
seen
and
a
silk
cord
with
tassels
round
the
waist
a
clean
dandified
shirt
of
fine
linen
with
gold
studs
peeped
out
under
the
collar
of
the
dressinggown
on
his
head
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
the
same
red
bandage
which
alyosha
had
seen
he
has
got
himself
up
thought
mitya
his
father
was
standing
near
the
window
apparently
lost
in
thought
suddenly
he
jerked
up
his
head
listened
a
moment
and
hearing
nothing
went
up
to
the
table
poured
out
half
a
glass
of
brandy
from
a
decanter
and
drank
it
off
then
he
uttered
a
deep
sigh
again
stood
still
a
moment
walked
carelessly
up
to
the
lookingglass
on
the
wall
with
his
right
hand
raised
the
red
bandage
on
his
forehead
a
little
and
began
examining
his
bruises
and
scars
which
had
not
yet
disappeared
hes
alone
thought
mitya
in
all
probability
hes
alone
fyodor
pavlovitch
moved
away
from
the
lookingglass
turned
suddenly
to
the
window
and
looked
out
mitya
instantly
slipped
away
into
the
shadow
she
may
be
there
behind
the
screen
perhaps
shes
asleep
by
now
he
thought
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
fyodor
pavlovitch
moved
away
from
the
window
hes
looking
for
her
out
of
the
window
so
shes
not
there
why
should
he
stare
out
into
the
dark
hes
wild
with
impatience

mitya
slipped
back
at
once
and
fell
to
gazing
in
at
the
window
again
the
old
man
was
sitting
down
at
the
table
apparently
disappointed
at
last
he
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
laid
his
right
cheek
against
his
hand
mitya
watched
him
eagerly
hes
alone
hes
alone
he
repeated
again
if
she
were
here
his
face
would
be
different
strange
to
say
a
queer
irrational
vexation
rose
up
in
his
heart
that
she
was
not
here
its
not
that
shes
not
here
he
explained
to
himself
immediately
but
that
i
cant
tell
for
certain
whether
she
is
or
not
mitya
remembered
afterwards
that
his
mind
was
at
that
moment
exceptionally
clear
that
he
took
in
everything
to
the
slightest
detail
and
missed
no
point
but
a
feeling
of
misery
the
misery
of
uncertainty
and
indecision
was
growing
in
his
heart
with
every
instant
is
she
here
or
not
the
angry
doubt
filled
his
heart
and
suddenly
making
up
his
mind
he
put
out
his
hand
and
softly
knocked
on
the
window
frame
he
knocked
the
signal
the
old
man
had
agreed
upon
with
smerdyakov
twice
slowly
and
then
three
times
more
quickly
the
signal
that
meant
grushenka
is
here
the
old
man
started
jerked
up
his
head
and
jumping
up
quickly
ran
to
the
window
mitya
slipped
away
into
the
shadow
fyodor
pavlovitch
opened
the
window
and
thrust
his
whole
head
out
grushenka
is
it
you
is
it
you
he
said
in
a
sort
of
trembling
half
whisper
where
are
you
my
angel
where
are
you
he
was
fearfully
agitated
and
breathless
hes
alone
mitya
decided
where
are
you
cried
the
old
man
again
and
he
thrust
his
head
out
farther
thrust
it
out
to
the
shoulders
gazing
in
all
directions
right
and
left
come
here
ive
a
little
present
for
you
come
ill
show
you
he
means
the
three
thousand
thought
mitya
but
where
are
you
are
you
at
the
door
ill
open
it
directly
and
the
old
man
almost
climbed
out
of
the
window
peering
out
to
the
right
where
there
was
a
door
into
the
garden
trying
to
see
into
the
darkness
in
another
second
he
would
certainly
have
run
out
to
open
the
door
without
waiting
for
grushenkas
answer
mitya
looked
at
him
from
the
side
without
stirring
the
old
mans
profile
that
he
loathed
so
his
pendent
adams
apple
his
hooked
nose
his
lips
that
smiled
in
greedy
expectation
were
all
brightly
lighted
up
by
the
slanting
lamplight
falling
on
the
left
from
the
room
a
horrible
fury
of
hatred
suddenly
surged
up
in
mityas
heart
there
he
was
his
rival
the
man
who
had
tormented
him
had
ruined
his
life
it
was
a
rush
of
that
sudden
furious
revengeful
anger
of
which
he
had
spoken
as
though
foreseeing
it
to
alyosha
four
days
ago
in
the
arbor
when
in
answer
to
alyoshas
question
how
can
you
say
youll
kill
our
father
i
dont
know
i
dont
know
he
had
said
then
perhaps
i
shall
not
kill
him
perhaps
i
shall
im
afraid
hell
suddenly
be
so
loathsome
to
me
at
that
moment
i
hate
his
double
chin
his
nose
his
eyes
his
shameless
grin
i
feel
a
personal
repulsion
thats
what
im
afraid
of
thats
what
may
be
too
much
for
me

this
personal
repulsion
was
growing
unendurable
mitya
was
beside
himself
he
suddenly
pulled
the
brass
pestle
out
of
his
pocket
god
was
watching
over
me
then
mitya
himself
said
afterwards
at
that
very
moment
grigory
waked
up
on
his
bed
of
sickness
earlier
in
the
evening
he
had
undergone
the
treatment
which
smerdyakov
had
described
to
ivan
he
had
rubbed
himself
all
over
with
vodka
mixed
with
a
secret
very
strong
decoction
had
drunk
what
was
left
of
the
mixture
while
his
wife
repeated
a
certain
prayer
over
him
after
which
he
had
gone
to
bed
marfa
ignatyevna
had
tasted
the
stuff
too
and
being
unused
to
strong
drink
slept
like
the
dead
beside
her
husband
but
grigory
waked
up
in
the
night
quite
suddenly
and
after
a
moments
reflection
though
he
immediately
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
back
he
sat
up
in
bed
then
he
deliberated
again
got
up
and
dressed
hurriedly
perhaps
his
conscience
was
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
sleeping
while
the
house
was
unguarded
in
such
perilous
times
smerdyakov
exhausted
by
his
fit
lay
motionless
in
the
next
room
marfa
ignatyevna
did
not
stir
the
stuffs
been
too
much
for
the
woman
grigory
thought
glancing
at
her
and
groaning
he
went
out
on
the
steps
no
doubt
he
only
intended
to
look
out
from
the
steps
for
he
was
hardly
able
to
walk
the
pain
in
his
back
and
his
right
leg
was
intolerable
but
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
not
locked
the
little
gate
into
the
garden
that
evening
he
was
the
most
punctual
and
precise
of
men
a
man
who
adhered
to
an
unchangeable
routine
and
habits
that
lasted
for
years
limping
and
writhing
with
pain
he
went
down
the
steps
and
towards
the
garden
yes
the
gate
stood
wide
open
mechanically
he
stepped
into
the
garden
perhaps
he
fancied
something
perhaps
caught
some
sound
and
glancing
to
the
left
he
saw
his
masters
window
open
no
one
was
looking
out
of
it
then
whats
it
open
for
its
not
summer
now
thought
grigory
and
suddenly
at
that
very
instant
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
extraordinary
before
him
in
the
garden
forty
paces
in
front
of
him
a
man
seemed
to
be
running
in
the
dark
a
sort
of
shadow
was
moving
very
fast
good
lord
cried
grigory
beside
himself
and
forgetting
the
pain
in
his
back
he
hurried
to
intercept
the
running
figure
he
took
a
short
cut
evidently
he
knew
the
garden
better
the
flying
figure
went
towards
the
bathhouse
ran
behind
it
and
rushed
to
the
garden
fence
grigory
followed
not
losing
sight
of
him
and
ran
forgetting
everything
he
reached
the
fence
at
the
very
moment
the
man
was
climbing
over
it
grigory
cried
out
beside
himself
pounced
on
him
and
clutched
his
leg
in
his
two
hands
yes
his
foreboding
had
not
deceived
him
he
recognized
him
it
was
he
the
monster
the
parricide
parricide
the
old
man
shouted
so
that
the
whole
neighborhood
could
hear
but
he
had
not
time
to
shout
more
he
fell
at
once
as
though
struck
by
lightning
mitya
jumped
back
into
the
garden
and
bent
over
the
fallen
man
in
mityas
hands
was
a
brass
pestle
and
he
flung
it
mechanically
in
the
grass
the
pestle
fell
two
paces
from
grigory
not
in
the
grass
but
on
the
path
in
a
most
conspicuous
place
for
some
seconds
he
examined
the
prostrate
figure
before
him
the
old
mans
head
was
covered
with
blood
mitya
put
out
his
hand
and
began
feeling
it
he
remembered
afterwards
clearly
that
he
had
been
awfully
anxious
to
make
sure
whether
he
had
broken
the
old
mans
skull
or
simply
stunned
him
with
the
pestle
but
the
blood
was
flowing
horribly
and
in
a
moment
mityas
fingers
were
drenched
with
the
hot
stream
he
remembered
taking
out
of
his
pocket
the
clean
white
handkerchief
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
for
his
visit
to
madame
hohlakov
and
putting
it
to
the
old
mans
head
senselessly
trying
to
wipe
the
blood
from
his
face
and
temples
but
the
handkerchief
was
instantly
soaked
with
blood
good
heavens
what
am
i
doing
it
for
thought
mitya
suddenly
pulling
himself
together
if
i
have
broken
his
skull
how
can
i
find
out
now
and
what
difference
does
it
make
now
he
added
hopelessly
if
ive
killed
him
ive
killed
him
youve
come
to
grief
old
man
so
there
you
must
lie
he
said
aloud
and
suddenly
turning
to
the
fence
he
vaulted
over
it
into
the
lane
and
fell
to
runningthe
handkerchief
soaked
with
blood
he
held
crushed
up
in
his
right
fist
and
as
he
ran
he
thrust
it
into
the
back
pocket
of
his
coat
he
ran
headlong
and
the
few
passersby
who
met
him
in
the
dark
in
the
streets
remembered
afterwards
that
they
had
met
a
man
running
that
night
he
flew
back
again
to
the
widow
morozovs
house
immediately
after
he
had
left
it
that
evening
fenya
had
rushed
to
the
chief
porter
nazar
ivanovitch
and
besought
him
for
christs
sake
not
to
let
the
captain
in
again
today
or
tomorrow
nazar
ivanovitch
promised
but
went
upstairs
to
his
mistress
who
had
suddenly
sent
for
him
and
meeting
his
nephew
a
boy
of
twenty
who
had
recently
come
from
the
country
on
the
way
up
told
him
to
take
his
place
but
forgot
to
mention
the
captain
mitya
running
up
to
the
gate
knocked
the
lad
instantly
recognized
him
for
mitya
had
more
than
once
tipped
him
opening
the
gate
at
once
he
let
him
in
and
hastened
to
inform
him
with
a
goodhumored
smile
that
agrafena
alexandrovna
is
not
at
home
now
you
know
where
is
she
then
prohor
asked
mitya
stopping
short
she
set
off
this
evening
some
two
hours
ago
with
timofey
to
mokroe
what
for
cried
mitya
that
i
cant
say
to
see
some
officer
some
one
invited
her
and
horses
were
sent
to
fetch
her
mitya
left
him
and
ran
like
a
madman
to
fenya
chapter
v
a
sudden
resolution
she
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
with
her
grandmother
they
were
both
just
going
to
bed
relying
on
nazar
ivanovitch
they
had
not
locked
themselves
in
mitya
ran
in
pounced
on
fenya
and
seized
her
by
the
throat
speak
at
once
where
is
she
with
whom
is
she
now
at
mokroe
he
roared
furiously
both
the
women
squealed
aie
ill
tell
you
aie
dmitri
fyodorovitch
darling
ill
tell
you
everything
directly
i
wont
hide
anything
gabbled
fenya
frightened
to
death
shes
gone
to
mokroe
to
her
officer
what
officer
roared
mitya
to
her
officer
the
same
one
she
used
to
know
the
one
who
threw
her
over
five
years
ago
cackled
fenya
as
fast
as
she
could
speak
mitya
withdrew
the
hands
with
which
he
was
squeezing
her
throat
he
stood
facing
her
pale
as
death
unable
to
utter
a
word
but
his
eyes
showed
that
he
realized
it
all
all
from
the
first
word
and
guessed
the
whole
position
poor
fenya
was
not
in
a
condition
at
that
moment
to
observe
whether
he
understood
or
not
she
remained
sitting
on
the
trunk
as
she
had
been
when
he
ran
into
the
room
trembling
all
over
holding
her
hands
out
before
her
as
though
trying
to
defend
herself
she
seemed
to
have
grown
rigid
in
that
position
her
wideopened
scared
eyes
were
fixed
immovably
upon
him
and
to
make
matters
worse
both
his
hands
were
smeared
with
blood
on
the
way
as
he
ran
he
must
have
touched
his
forehead
with
them
wiping
off
the
perspiration
so
that
on
his
forehead
and
his
right
cheek
were
bloodstained
patches
fenya
was
on
the
verge
of
hysterics
the
old
cook
had
jumped
up
and
was
staring
at
him
like
a
mad
woman
almost
unconscious
with
terror
mitya
stood
for
a
moment
then
mechanically
sank
on
to
a
chair
next
to
fenya
he
sat
not
reflecting
but
as
it
were
terrorstricken
benumbed
yet
everything
was
clear
as
day
that
officer
he
knew
about
him
he
knew
everything
perfectly
he
had
known
it
from
grushenka
herself
had
known
that
a
letter
had
come
from
him
a
month
before
so
that
for
a
month
for
a
whole
month
this
had
been
going
on
a
secret
from
him
till
the
very
arrival
of
this
new
man
and
he
had
never
thought
of
him
but
how
could
he
how
could
he
not
have
thought
of
him
why
was
it
he
had
forgotten
this
officer
like
that
forgotten
him
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
him
that
was
the
question
that
faced
him
like
some
monstrous
thing
and
he
looked
at
this
monstrous
thing
with
horror
growing
cold
with
horror
but
suddenly
as
gently
and
mildly
as
a
gentle
and
affectionate
child
he
began
speaking
to
fenya
as
though
he
had
utterly
forgotten
how
he
had
scared
and
hurt
her
just
now
he
fell
to
questioning
fenya
with
an
extreme
preciseness
astonishing
in
his
position
and
though
the
girl
looked
wildly
at
his
bloodstained
hands
she
too
with
wonderful
readiness
and
rapidity
answered
every
question
as
though
eager
to
put
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
before
him
little
by
little
even
with
a
sort
of
enjoyment
she
began
explaining
every
detail
not
wanting
to
torment
him
but
as
it
were
eager
to
be
of
the
utmost
service
to
him
she
described
the
whole
of
that
day
in
great
detail
the
visit
of
rakitin
and
alyosha
how
she
fenya
had
stood
on
the
watch
how
the
mistress
had
set
off
and
how
she
had
called
out
of
the
window
to
alyosha
to
give
him
mitya
her
greetings
and
to
tell
him
to
remember
for
ever
how
she
had
loved
him
for
an
hour
hearing
of
the
message
mitya
suddenly
smiled
and
there
was
a
flush
of
color
on
his
pale
cheeks
at
the
same
moment
fenya
said
to
him
not
a
bit
afraid
now
to
be
inquisitive
look
at
your
hands
dmitri
fyodorovitch
theyre
all
over
blood
yes
answered
mitya
mechanically
he
looked
carelessly
at
his
hands
and
at
once
forgot
them
and
fenyas
question
he
sank
into
silence
again
twenty
minutes
had
passed
since
he
had
run
in
his
first
horror
was
over
but
evidently
some
new
fixed
determination
had
taken
possession
of
him
he
suddenly
stood
up
smiling
dreamily
what
has
happened
to
you
sir
said
fenya
pointing
to
his
hands
again
she
spoke
compassionately
as
though
she
felt
very
near
to
him
now
in
his
grief
mitya
looked
at
his
hands
again
thats
blood
fenya
he
said
looking
at
her
with
a
strange
expression
thats
human
blood
and
my
god
why
was
it
shed
but

fenya

theres
a
fence
here
he
looked
at
her
as
though
setting
her
a
riddle
a
high
fence
and
terrible
to
look
at
but
at
dawn
tomorrow
when
the
sun
rises
mitya
will
leap
over
that
fence
you
dont
understand
what
fence

and
never
mind
youll
hear
tomorrow
and
understand

and
now
goodby
i
wont

in
her
way

how
to

aside

joy

for
an
hour

mityenka
karamazov
so
for
ever
she
always
used
to
call
me
mityenka
do
you
remember
and
with
those
words
he
went
suddenly
out
of
the
kitchen
fenya
was
almost
more
frightened
at
this
sudden
departure
than
she
had
been
when
he
ran
in
and
attacked
her
just
ten
minutes
later
dmitri
went
in
to
pyotr
ilyitch
perhotin
the
young
official
with
whom
he
had
pawned
his
pistols
it
was
by
now
halfpast
eight
and
pyotr
ilyitch
had
finished
his
evening
tea
and
had
just
put
his
coat
on
again
to
go
to
the
metropolis
to
play
billiards
mitya
caught
him
coming
out
seeing
him
with
his
face
all
smeared
with
blood
the
young
man
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
good
heavens
what
is
the
matter
ive
come
for
my
pistols
said
mitya
and
brought
you
the
money
and
thanks
very
much
im
in
a
hurry
pyotr
ilyitch
please
make
haste
pyotr
ilyitch
grew
more
and
more
surprised
he
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
bundle
of
banknotes
in
mityas
hand
and
what
was
more
he
had
walked
in
holding
the
notes
as
no
one
walks
in
and
no
one
carries
money
he
had
them
in
his
right
hand
and
held
them
outstretched
as
if
to
show
them
perhotins
servantboy
who
met
mitya
in
the
passage
said
afterwards
that
he
walked
into
the
passage
in
the
same
way
with
the
money
outstretched
in
his
hand
so
he
must
have
been
carrying
them
like
that
even
in
the
streets
they
were
all
rainbowcolored
hundredrouble
notes
and
the
fingers
holding
them
were
covered
with
blood
when
pyotr
ilyitch
was
questioned
later
on
as
to
the
sum
of
money
he
said
that
it
was
difficult
to
judge
at
a
glance
but
that
it
might
have
been
two
thousand
or
perhaps
three
but
it
was
a
big
fat
bundle
dmitri
fyodorovitch
so
he
testified
afterwards
seemed
unlike
himself
too
not
drunk
but
as
it
were
exalted
lost
to
everything
but
at
the
same
time
as
it
were
absorbed
as
though
pondering
and
searching
for
something
and
unable
to
come
to
a
decision
he
was
in
great
haste
answered
abruptly
and
very
strangely
and
at
moments
seemed
not
at
all
dejected
but
quite
cheerful
but
what
is
the
matter
with
you
whats
wrong
cried
pyotr
ilyitch
looking
wildly
at
his
guest
how
is
it
that
youre
all
covered
with
blood
have
you
had
a
fall
look
at
yourself
he
took
him
by
the
elbow
and
led
him
to
the
glass
seeing
his
bloodstained
face
mitya
started
and
scowled
wrathfully
damnation
thats
the
last
straw
he
muttered
angrily
hurriedly
changing
the
notes
from
his
right
hand
to
the
left
and
impulsively
jerked
the
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
but
the
handkerchief
turned
out
to
be
soaked
with
blood
too
it
was
the
handkerchief
he
had
used
to
wipe
grigorys
face
there
was
scarcely
a
white
spot
on
it
and
it
had
not
merely
begun
to
dry
but
had
stiffened
into
a
crumpled
ball
and
could
not
be
pulled
apart
mitya
threw
it
angrily
on
the
floor
oh
damn
it
he
said
havent
you
a
rag
of
some
sort

to
wipe
my
face
so
youre
only
stained

wounded

pyotr
ilyitch

washstand
thats
all
right

but
where

i
to
put
this
with
the
strangest
perplexity
he
indicated
his
bundle
of
hundredrouble
notes
looking
inquiringly
at
pyotr
ilyitch
as
though
it
were
for
him
to
decide
what
he
mitya
was
to
do
with
his
own
money
in
your
pocket
or
on
the
table
here
they
wont
be
lost
in
my
pocket
yes
in
my
pocket
all
right
but
i
say
thats
all
nonsense
he
cried
as
though
suddenly
coming
out
of
his
absorption
look
here
lets
first
settle
that
business
of
the
pistols
give
them
back
to
me
heres
your
money

because
i
am
in
great
need
of
them

and
i
havent
a
minute
a
minute
to
spare
and
taking
the
topmost
note
from
the
bundle
he
held
it
out
to
pyotr
ilyitch
but
i
shant
have
change
enough
havent
you
less
no
said
mitya
looking
again
at
the
bundle
and
as
though
not
trusting
his
own
words
he
turned
over
two
or
three
of
the
topmost
ones
no
theyre
all
alike
he
added
and
again
he
looked
inquiringly
at
pyotr
ilyitch
how
have
you
grown
so
rich
the
latter
asked

pyotr

interrupted

some
impatience
i

simply
run
and
change
the
money
and
tell
them

your
best
leg
forward
pyotr
ilyitch
seemed
to
hurry
misha
off
on
purpose
because
the
boy
remained
standing
with
his
mouth
and
eyes
wide
open
apparently
understanding
little
of
mityas
orders
gazing
up
with
amazement
and
terror
at
his
bloodstained
face
and
the
trembling
bloodstained
fingers
that
held
the
notes
well
now
come
and
wash
said
pyotr
ilyitch
sternly
put
the
money
on
the
table
or
else
in
your
pocket
thats
right
come
along
but
take
off
your
coat
and
beginning
to
help
him
off
with
his
coat
he
cried
out
again
look
your
coats
covered
with
blood
too
that

its
not
the
coat
its
only
a
little
here
on
the
sleeve
and
thats
only
here
where
the
handkerchief
lay
it
must
have
soaked
through
i
must
have
sat
on
the
handkerchief
at
fenyas
and
the
bloods
come
through
mitya
explained
at
once
with
a
childlike
unconsciousness
that
was
astounding
pyotr
ilyitch
listened
frowning
well
you
must
have
been
up
to
something
you
must
have
been
fighting
with
some
one
he
muttered
they
began
to
wash
pyotr
ilyitch
held
the
jug
and
poured
out
the
water
mitya
in
desperate
haste
scarcely
soaped
his
hands
they
were
trembling
and
pyotr
ilyitch
remembered
it
afterwards
but
the
young
official
insisted
on
his
soaping
them
thoroughly
and
rubbing
them
more
he
seemed
to
exercise
more
and
more
sway
over
mitya
as
time
went
on
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
sturdy
character
look
you
havent
got
your
nails
clean
now

your
face
here

shirt
i
havent
time
you

mitya
went
on
with
the
same
confiding
ingenuousness
drying
his
face
and
hands
on
the
towel
and
putting
on
his
coat
ill
turn
it

bottled
by
the
brothers
eliseyev
fruits
cigars
tea
coffee
sugar
and
so
on
there
were
three
shopassistants
and
two
errand
boys
always
employed
though
our
part
of
the
country
had
grown
poorer
the
landowners
had
gone
away
and
trade
had
got
worse
yet
the
grocery
stores
flourished
as
before
every
year
with
increasing
prosperity
there
were
plenty
of
purchasers
for
their
goods
they
were
awaiting
mitya
with
impatience
in
the
shop
they
had
vivid
recollections
of
how
he
had
bought
three
or
four
weeks
ago
wine
and
goods
of
all
sorts
to
the
value
of
several
hundred
roubles
paid
for
in
cash
they
would
never
have
let
him
have
anything
on
credit
of
course
they
remembered
that
then
as
now
he
had
had
a
bundle
of
hundredrouble
notes
in
his
hand
and
had
scattered
them
at
random
without
bargaining
without
reflecting
or
caring
to
reflect
what
use
so
much
wine
and
provisions
would
be
to
him
the
story
was
told
all
over
the
town
that
driving
off
then
with
grushenka
to
mokroe
he
had
spent
three
thousand
in
one
night
and
the
following
day
and
had
come
back
from
the
spree
without
a
penny
he
had
picked
up
a
whole
troop
of
gypsies
encamped
in
our
neighborhood
at
the
time
who
for
two
days
got
money
without
stint
out
of
him
while
he
was
drunk
and
drank
expensive
wine
without
stint
people
used
to
tell
laughing
at
mitya
how
he
had
given
champagne
to
grimy
handed
peasants
and
feasted
the
village
women
and
girls
on
sweets
and
strasburg
pies
though
to
laugh
at
mitya
to
his
face
was
rather
a
risky
proceeding
there
was
much
laughter
behind
his
back
especially
in
the
tavern
at
his
own
ingenuous
public
avowal
that
all
he
had
got
out
of
grushenka
by
this
escapade
was
permission
to
kiss
her
foot
and
that
was
the
utmost
she
had
allowed
him
by
the
time
mitya
and
pyotr
ilyitch
reached
the
shop
they
found
a
cart
with
three
horses
harnessed
abreast
with
bells
and
with
andrey
the
driver
ready
waiting
for
mitya
at
the
entrance
in
the
shop
they
had
almost
entirely
finished
packing
one
box
of
provisions
and
were
only
waiting
for
mityas
arrival
to
nail
it
down
and
put
it
in
the
cart
pyotr
ilyitch
was
astounded
where
did
this
cart
come
from
in
such
a
hurry
he
asked
mitya
i
met
andrey
as
i
ran
to
you
and
told
him
to
drive
straight
here
to
the
shop
theres
no
time
to
lose
last
time
i
drove
with
timofey
but
timofey
now
has
gone
on
before
me
with
the
witch
shall
we
be
very
late
andrey
theyll
only
get
there
an
hour
at
most
before
us
not
even
that
maybe
i
got
timofey
ready
to
start
i
know
how
hell
go
their
pace
wont
be
ours
dmitri
fyodorovitch
how
could
it
be
they
wont
get
there
an
hour
earlier
andrey
a
lanky
redhaired
middleaged
driver
wearing
a
full
skirted
coat
and
with
a
kaftan
on
his
arm
replied
warmly
fifty
roubles
for
vodka
if
were
only
an
hour
behind
them
i
warrant
the
time
dmitri
fyodorovitch
ech
they
wont
be
half
an
hour
before
us
let
alone
an
hour
though
mitya
bustled
about
seeing
after
things
he
gave
his
orders
strangely
as
it
were
disconnectedly
and
inconsecutively
he
began
a
sentence
and
forgot
the
end
of
it
pyotr
ilyitch
found
himself
obliged
to
come
to
the
rescue
four
hundred
roubles
worth
not
less
than
four
hundred
roubles
worth
just
as
it
was
then
commanded
mitya
four
dozen
champagne
not
a
bottle
less
what
do
you
want
with
so
much
whats
it
for
stay
cried
pyotr
ilyitch
whats
this
box
whats
in
it
surely
there
isnt
four
hundred
roubles
worth
here
the
officious
shopmen
began
explaining
with
oily
politeness
that
the
first
box
contained
only
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
champagne
and
only
the
most
indispensable
articles
such
as
savories
sweets
toffee
etc
but
the
main
part
of
the
goods
ordered
would
be
packed
and
sent
off
as
on
the
previous
occasion
in
a
special
cart
also
with
three
horses
traveling
at
full
speed
so
that
it
would
arrive
not
more
than
an
hour
later
than
dmitri
fyodorovitch
himself
not
more
than
an
hour
not
more
than
an
hour
and
put
in
more
toffee
and
fondants
the
girls
there
are
so
fond
of
it
mitya
insisted
hotly
the
fondants
are
all
right
but
what
do
you
want
with
four
dozen
of
champagne
one
would
be
enough
said
pyotr
ilyitch
almost
angry
he
began
bargaining
asking
for
a
bill
of
the
goods
and
refused
to
be
satisfied
but
he
only
succeeded
in
saving
a
hundred
roubles
in
the
end
it
was
agreed
that
only
three
hundred
roubles
worth
should
be
sent
well
you
may
go
to
the
devil
cried
pyotr
ilyitch
on
second
thoughts

do
with
me

your
money

economist

him
into
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop

with

dirty
dinnernapkin
pyotr
ilyitch

down
opposite

the
champagne

lunatic

ilyitch
thought
as
he
watched
him
go
he
had
half
a
mind
to
stay
and
see
the
cart
packed
with
the
remaining
wines
and
provisions
knowing
that
they
would
deceive
and
defraud
mitya
but
suddenly
feeling
vexed
with
himself
he
turned
away
with
a
curse
and
went
to
the
tavern
to
play
billiards
hes
a
fool
though
hes
a
good
fellow
he
muttered
as
he
went

of
that
officer

flame

phrases

times
drunk
in
the
taverns
but
now
hes
not
drunk
drunk
in
spirittheyre
fond
of
fine
phrases
the
villains
am
i
his
nurse
he
must
have
been
fighting
his
face
was
all
over
blood
with
whom
i
shall
find
out
at
the
metropolis
and
his
handkerchief
was
soaked
in
blood
its
still
lying
on
my
floor
hang
it
he
reached
the
tavern
in
a
bad
humor
and
at
once
made
up
a
game
the
game
cheered
him
he
played
a
second
game
and
suddenly
began
telling
one
of
his
partners
that
dmitri
karamazov
had
come
in
for
some
cash
againsomething
like
three
thousand
roubles
and
had
gone
to
mokroe
again
to
spend
it
with
grushenka
this
news
roused
singular
interest
in
his
listeners
they
all
spoke
of
it
not
laughing
but
with
a
strange
gravity
they
left
off
playing
three
thousand
but
where
can
he
have
got
three
thousand
questions
were
asked
the
story
of
madame
hohlakovs
present
was
received
with
skepticism
hasnt
he
robbed
his
old
fatherthats
the
question
three
thousand
theres
something
odd
about
it
he
boasted
aloud
that
he
would
kill
his
father
we
all
heard
him
here
and
it
was
three
thousand
he
talked
about

pyotr
ilyitch
listened
all
at
once
he
became
short
and
dry
in
his
answers
he
said
not
a
word
about
the
blood
on
mityas
face
and
hands
though
he
had
meant
to
speak
of
it
at
first
they
began
a
third
game
and
by
degrees
the
talk
about
mitya
died
away
but
by
the
end
of
the
third
game
pyotr
ilyitch
felt
no
more
desire
for
billiards
he
laid
down
the
cue
and
without
having
supper
as
he
had
intended
he
walked
out
of
the
tavern
when
he
reached
the
marketplace
he
stood
still
in
perplexity
wondering
at
himself
he
realized
that
what
he
wanted
was
to
go
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
and
find
out
if
anything
had
happened
there
on
account
of
some
stupid
nonsenseas
its
sure
to
turn
outam
i
going
to
wake
up
the
household
and
make
a
scandal
fooh
damn
it
is
it
my
business
to
look
after
them
in
a
very
bad
humor
he
went
straight
home
and
suddenly
remembered
fenya
damn
it
all
i
ought
to
have
questioned
her
just
now
he
thought
with
vexation
i
should
have
heard
everything
and
the
desire
to
speak
to
her
and
so
find
out
became
so
pressing
and
importunate
that
when
he
was
halfway
home
he
turned
abruptly
and
went
towards
the
house
where
grushenka
lodged
going
up
to
the
gate
he
knocked
the
sound
of
the
knock
in
the
silence
of
the
night
sobered
him
and
made
him
feel
annoyed
and
no
one
answered
him
every
one
in
the
house
was
asleep
and
i
shall
be
making
a
fuss
he
thought
with
a
feeling
of
positive
discomfort
but
instead
of
going
away
altogether
he
fell
to
knocking
again
with
all
his
might
filling
the
street
with
clamor
not
coming
well
i
will
knock
them
up
i
will
he
muttered
at
each
knock
fuming
at
himself
but
at
the
same
time
he
redoubled
his
knocks
on
the
gate
chapter
vi
i
am
coming
too
but
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
speeding
along
the
road
it
was
a
little
more
than
twenty
versts
to
mokroe
but
andreys
three
horses
galloped
at
such
a
pace
that
the
distance
might
be
covered
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
the
swift
motion
revived
mitya
the
air
was
fresh
and
cool
there
were
big
stars
shining
in
the
sky
it
was
the
very
night
and
perhaps
the
very
hour
in
which
alyosha
fell
on
the
earth
and
rapturously
swore
to
love
it
for
ever
and
ever
all
was
confusion
confusion
in
mityas
soul
but
although
many
things
were
goading
his
heart
at
that
moment
his
whole
being
was
yearning
for
her
his
queen
to
whom
he
was
flying
to
look
on
her
for
the
last
time
one
thing
i
can
say
for
certain
his
heart
did
not
waver
for
one
instant
i
shall
perhaps
not
be
believed
when
i
say
that
this
jealous
lover
felt
not
the
slightest
jealousy
of
this
new
rival
who
seemed
to
have
sprung
out
of
the
earth
if
any
other
had
appeared
on
the
scene
he
would
have
been
jealous
at
once
and
would
perhaps
have
stained
his
fierce
hands
with
blood
again
but
as
he
flew
through
the
night
he
felt
no
envy
no
hostility
even
for
the
man
who
had
been
her
first
lover
it
is
true
he
had
not
yet
seen
him
here
there
was
no
room
for
dispute
it
was
her
right
and
his
this
was
her
first
love
which
after
five
years
she
had
not
forgotten
so
she
had
loved
him
only
for
those
five
years
and
i
how
do
i
come
in
what
right
have
i
step
aside
mitya
and
make
way
what
am
i
now
now
everything
is
over
apart
from
the
officereven
if
he
had
not
appeared
everything
would
be
over

these
words
would
roughly
have
expressed
his
feelings
if
he
had
been
capable
of
reasoning
but
he
could
not
reason
at
that
moment
his
present
plan
of
action
had
arisen
without
reasoning
at
fenyas
first
words
it
had
sprung
from
feeling
and
been
adopted
in
a
flash
with
all
its
consequences
and
yet
in
spite
of
his
resolution
there
was
confusion
in
his
soul
an
agonizing
confusion
his
resolution
did
not
give
him
peace
there
was
so
much
behind
that
tortured
him
and
it
seemed
strange
to
him
at
moments
to
think
that
he
had
written
his
own
sentence
of
death
with
pen
and
paper
i
punish
myself
and
the
paper
was
lying
there
in
his
pocket
ready
the
pistol
was
loaded
he
had
already
resolved
how
next
morning
he
would
meet
the
first
warm
ray
of
goldenhaired
phbus
and
yet
he
could
not
be
quit
of
the
past
of
all
that
he
had
left
behind
and
that
tortured
him
he
felt
that
miserably
and
the
thought
of
it
sank
into
his
heart
with
despair
there
was
one
moment
when
he
felt
an
impulse
to
stop
andrey
to
jump
out
of
the
cart
to
pull
out
his
loaded
pistol
and
to
make
an
end
of
everything
without
waiting
for
the
dawn
but
that
moment
flew
by
like
a
spark
the
horses
galloped
on
devouring
space
and
as
he
drew
near
his
goal
again
the
thought
of
her
of
her
alone
took
more
and
more
complete
possession
of
his
soul
chasing
away
the
fearful
images
that
had
been
haunting
it
oh
how
he
longed
to
look
upon
her
if
only
for
a
moment
if
only
from
a
distance
shes
now
with
him
he
thought
now
i
shall
see
what
she
looks
like
with
him
her
first
love
and
thats
all
i
want
never
had
this
woman
who
was
such
a
fateful
influence
in
his
life
aroused
such
love
in
his
breast
such
new
and
unknown
feeling
surprising
even
to
himself
a
feeling
tender
to
devoutness
to
selfeffacement
before
her
i
will
efface
myself
he
said
in
a
rush
of
almost
hysterical
ecstasy
they
had
been
galloping
nearly
an
hour
mitya
was
silent
and
though
andrey
was
as
a
rule
a
talkative
peasant
he
did
not
utter
a
word
either
he
seemed
afraid
to
talk
he
only
whipped
up
smartly
his
three
lean
but
mettlesome
bay
horses
suddenly
mitya
cried
out
in
horrible
anxiety
andrey
what
if
theyre
asleep
this
thought
fell
upon
him
like
a
blow
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
it
may
well
be
that
theyre
gone
to
bed
by
now
dmitri
fyodorovitch
mitya
frowned
as
though
in
pain
yes
indeed

he
was
rushing
there

with
such
feelings

while
they
were
asleep

she
was
asleep
perhaps
there
too
an
angry
feeling
surged
up
in
his
heart
drive
on
andrey
whip
them
up
look
alive
he
cried
beside
himself
but
maybe
theyre
not
in
bed
andrey
went
on
after
a
pause
timofey
said
they
were
a
lot
of
them
there
at
the
station
not
at
the
postingstation
but
at
plastunovs
at
the
inn
where
they
let
out
horses
too
i
know
so
you
say
there
are
a
lot
of
them
hows
that
who
are
they
cried
mitya
greatly
dismayed
at
this
unexpected
news
well
timofey
was
saying
theyre
all
gentlefolk
two
from
our
townwho
they
are
i
cant
sayand
there
are
two
others
strangers
maybe
more
besides
i
didnt
ask
particularly
theyve
set
to
playing
cards
so
timofey
said
cards
so
maybe
theyre
not
in
bed
if
theyre
at
cards
its
most
likely
not
more
than
eleven
quicker
andrey
quicker
mitya
cried
again
nervously
may
i
ask
you
something
sir
said
andrey
after
a
pause
only
im
afraid
of
angering
you
sir
what
is
it
why
fenya
threw
herself
at
your
feet
just
now
and
begged
you
not
to
harm
her
mistress
and
some
one
else
too

so
you
see
sir
its
i
am
taking
you
there

forgive
me
sir
its
my
conscience

maybe
its
stupid
of
me
to
speak
of
it
mitya
suddenly
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
from
behind
are
you
a
driver
he
asked
frantically
yes
sir
then
you
know
that
one
has
to
make
way
what
would
you
say
to
a
driver
who
wouldnt
make
way
for
any
one
but
would
just
drive
on
and
crush
people
no
a
driver
mustnt
run
over
people
one
cant
run
over
a
man
one
cant
spoil
peoples
lives
and
if
you
have
spoilt
a
lifepunish
yourself
if
only
youve
spoilt
if
only
youve
ruined
any
ones
lifepunish
yourself
and
go
away
these
phrases
burst
from
mitya
almost
hysterically
though
andrey
was
surprised
at
him
he
kept
up
the
conversation
thats
right
dmitri
fyodorovitch
youre
quite
right
one
mustnt
crush
or
torment
a
man
or
any
kind
of
creature
for
every
creature
is
created
by
god
take
a
horse
for
instance
for
some
folks
even
among
us
drivers
drive
anyhow
nothing
will
restrain
them
they
just
force
it
along
to
hell
mitya
interrupted
and
went
off
into
his
abrupt
short
laugh
andrey
simple
soul
he
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
again
tell
me
will
dmitri
fyodorovitch
karamazov
go
to
hell
or

sir
when
the
son
of
god
was
nailed
on
the
cross
and
died
he
went
straight
down
to
hell
from
the
cross
and
set
free
all
sinners
that
were
in
agony
and
the
devil
groaned
because
he
thought
that
he
would
get
no
more
sinners
in
hell
and
god
said
to
him
then
dont
groan
for
you
shall
have
all
the
mighty
of
the
earth

very
words

a
peasant
legend

left
andrey
so

the
left
horse
but

little
child

mokroe
cried
andrey
pointing
ahead
with
his
whip
through
the
pale
darkness
of
the
night
loomed
a
solid
black
mass
of
buildings
flung
down
as
it
were
in
the
vast
plain
the
village
of
mokroe
numbered
two
thousand
inhabitants
but
at
that
hour
all

andrey
again
pointing
with
his
whip
to
the
plastunovs
inn
which
was
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
the
six
windows
looking
on
the
street
were
all
brightly
lighted

lashed
his
exhausted
team
into
a
gallop
drove
with
a
dash
and
pulled
up
his
steaming
panting
horses
at
the
high
flight
of
steps
mitya
jumped
out
of
the
cart
just
as
the
innkeeper
on
his
way
to
bed
peeped
out
from
the
steps
curious
to
see
who
had
arrived
trifon
borissovitch
is
that
you
the
innkeeper
bent
down
looked
intently
ran
down
the
steps
and
rushed
up
to
the
guest
with
obsequious
delight
dmitri
fyodorovitch
your
honor
do
i
see
you
again
trifon
borissovitch
was
a
thickset
healthy
peasant
of
middle
height
with
a
rather
fat
face
his
expression
was
severe
and
uncompromising
especially
with
the
peasants
of
mokroe
but
he
had
the
power
of
assuming
the
most
obsequious
countenance
when
he
had
an
inkling
that
it
was
to
his
interest
he
dressed
in
russian
style
with
a
shirt
buttoning
down
on
one
side
and
a
fullskirted
coat
he
had
saved
a
good
sum
of
money
but
was
for
ever
dreaming
of
improving
his
position
more
than
half
the
peasants
were
in
his
clutches
every
one
in
the
neighborhood
was
in
debt
to
him
from
the
neighboring
landowners
he
bought
and
rented
lands
which
were
worked
by
the
peasants
in
payment
of
debts
which
they
could
never
shake
off
he
was
a
widower
with
four
grownup
daughters
one
of
them
was
already
a
widow
and
lived
in
the
inn
with
her
two
children
his
grandchildren
and
worked
for
him
like
a
charwoman
another
of
his
daughters
was
married
to
a
petty
official
and
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
inn
on
the
wall
could
be
seen
among
the
family
photographs
a
miniature
photograph
of
this
official
in
uniform
and
official
epaulettes
the
two
younger
daughters
used
to
wear
fashionable
blue
or
green
dresses
fitting
tight
at
the
back
and
with
trains
a
yard
long
on
church
holidays
or
when
they
went
to
pay
visits
but
next
morning
they
would
get
up
at
dawn
as
usual
sweep
out
the
rooms
with
a
birchbroom
empty
the
slops
and
clean
up
after
lodgers
in
spite
of
the
thousands
of
roubles
he
had
saved
trifon
borissovitch
was
very
fond
of
emptying
the
pockets
of
a
drunken
guest
and
remembering
that
not
a
month
ago
he
had
in
twentyfour
hours
made
two
if
not
three
hundred
roubles
out
of
dmitri
when
he
had
come
on
his
escapade

eager
welcome

five
roubles
now
trifon
borissovitch
take
me
up
quietly
and
let
me
first
get
a
look
at
them
so
that
they
dont
see
me
where
are
they
in
the
blue
room
trifon
borissovitch
looked
apprehensively
at
mitya
but
at
once
obediently
did
his
bidding
leading
him
into
the
passage
he
went
himself
into
the
first
large
room
adjoining
that
in
which
the
visitors
were
sitting
and
took
the
light
away
then
he
stealthily
led
mitya
in
and
put
him
in
a
corner
in
the
dark
whence
he
could
freely
watch
the
company
without
being
seen
but
mitya
did
not
look
long
and
indeed
he
could
not
see
them
he
saw
her
his
heart
throbbed
violently
and
all
was
dark
before
his
eyes
she
was
sitting
sideways
to
the
table
in
a
low
chair
and
beside
her
on
the
sofa
was
the
pretty
youth
kalganov
she
was
holding
his
hand
and
seemed
to
be
laughing
while
he
seeming
vexed
and
not
looking
at
her
was
saying
something
in
a
loud
voice
to
maximov
who
sat
the
other
side
of
the
table
facing
grushenka
maximov
was
laughing
violently
at
something
on
the
sofa
sat
he
and
on
a
chair
by
the
sofa
there
was
another
stranger
the
one
on
the
sofa
was
lolling
backwards
smoking
a
pipe
and
mitya
had
an
impression
of
a
stoutish
broadfaced
short
little
man
who
was
apparently
angry
about
something
his
friend
the
other
stranger
struck
mitya
as
extraordinarily
tall
but
he
could
make
out
nothing
more
he
caught
his
breath
he
could
not
bear
it
for
a
minute
he
put
the
pistol
case
on
a
chest
and
with
a
throbbing
heart
he
walked
feeling
cold
all
over
straight
into
the
blue
room
to
face
the
company
aie
shrieked
grushenka
the
first
to
notice
him
chapter
vii
the
first
and
rightful
lover
with
his
long
rapid
strides
mitya
walked
straight
up
to
the
table
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
almost
shouting
yet
stammering
at
every
word

all
right

be
afraid
he
exclaimed
itheres
nothing
the
matter
he
turned
suddenly
to
grushenka
who
had
shrunk
back
in
her
chair
towards
kalganov
and
clasped
his
hand
tightly

last
time

this
same
room
so
he
finished
turning
to
the
fat
little
man
with
the
pipe
sitting
on
the
sofa
the
latter
removed
his
pipe
from
his
lips
with
dignity
and
observed
severely

responded
joyfully
and
eagerly
at
once
holding
out
his
hand
across
the
table
aie
how
tight
you
squeeze

quite
broken

kalganov

always

in
gayly
with
a
timid
smile
seeming
suddenly
convinced
from
mityas
face
that
he
was
not
going
to
make
a
scene
she
was
watching
him
with
intense
curiosity
and
still
some
uneasiness
she
was
impressed
by
something
about
him
and
indeed
the
last
thing
she
expected
of
him
was
that
he
would
come
in
and
speak
like
this
at
such
a
moment
good
evening
maximov
ventured
blandly
on
the
left
mitya
rushed
up
to
him
too
good
evening

here
too
how
glad
i
am
to
find
you
here
too
gentlemen
gentlemen
i
he
addressed
the
polish
gentleman
with
the
pipe
again
evidently
taking
him
for
the
most
important
person
present
i
flew
here
i
wanted
to
spend
my
last
day
my
last
hour
in
this
room
in
this
very
room

where
i
too
adored

my
queen
forgive
me
panie
he
cried
wildly
i
flew
here
and
vowed
oh
dont
be
afraid
its
my
last
night
lets
drink
to
our
good
understanding
theyll
bring
the
wine
at
once
i
brought
this
with
me
something
made
him
pull
out
his
bundle
of
notes
allow
me
panie
i
want
to
have
music
singing
a
revel
as
we
had
before
but
the
worm
the
unnecessary
worm
will
crawl
away
and
therell
be
no
more
of
him
i
will
commemorate
my
day
of
joy
on
my
last
night
he
was
almost
choking
there
was
so
much
so
much
he
wanted
to
say
but
strange
exclamations
were
all
that
came
from
his
lips
the
pole
gazed
fixedly
at
him
at
the
bundle
of
notes
in
his
hand
looked
at
grushenka
and
was
in
evident
perplexity
if
my
suverin
lady
is
permitting
he
was
beginning
what
does
suverin
mean
sovereign
i
suppose
interrupted
grushenka
i
cant
help
laughing
at
you
the
way
you
talk
sit
down
mitya
what
are
you
talking
about
dont
frighten
us
please
you
wont
frighten
us
will
you
if
you
wont
i
am
glad
to
see
you

me
me
frighten
you
cried
mitya
flinging
up
his
hands
oh
pass
me
by
go
your
way
i
wont
hinder
you
and
suddenly
he
surprised
them
all
and
no
doubt
himself
as
well
by
flinging
himself
on
a
chair
and
bursting
into
tears
turning
his
head
away
to
the
opposite
wall
while
his
arms
clasped
the
back
of
the
chair
tight
as
though
embracing
it
come
come
what
a
fellow
you
are
cried
grushenka
reproachfully
thats
just
how
he
comes
to
see
mehe
begins
talking
and
i
cant
make
out
what
he
means
he
cried
like
that
once
before
and
now
hes
crying
again
its
shameful
why
are
you
crying
as
though
you
had
anything
to
cry
for
she
added
enigmatically
emphasizing
each
word
with
some
irritability
i

im
not
crying
well
good
evening
he
instantly
turned
round
in
his
chair
and
suddenly
laughed
not
his
abrupt
wooden
laugh
but
a
long
quivering
inaudible
nervous
laugh
well
there
you
are
again
come
cheer
up
cheer
up
grushenka
said
to
him
persuasively
im
very
glad
youve
come
very
glad
mitya
do
you
hear
im
very
glad
i
want
him
to
stay
here
with
us
she
said
peremptorily
addressing
the
whole
company
though
her
words
were
obviously
meant
for
the
man
sitting
on
the
sofa
i
wish
it
i
wish
it
and
if
he
goes
away
i
shall
go
too
she
added
with
flashing
eyes
what
my
queen
commands
is
law
pronounced
the
pole
gallantly
kissing
grushenkas
hand
i
beg
you
panie
to
join
our
company
he
added
politely
addressing
mitya
mitya
was
jumping
up
with
the
obvious
intention
of
delivering
another
tirade
but
the
words
did
not
come
lets
drink
panie
he
blurted
out
instead
of
making
a
speech
every
one
laughed
good
heavens
i
thought
he
was
going
to
begin
again
grushenka
exclaimed
nervously
do
you
hear
mitya
she
went
on
insistently
dont
prance
about
but
its
nice
youve
brought
the
champagne
i
want
some
myself
and
i
cant
bear
liqueurs
and
best
of
all
youve
come
yourself
we
were
fearfully
dull
here
youve
come
for
a
spree
again
i
suppose
but
put
your
money
in
your
pocket
where
did
you
get
such
a
lot
mitya
had
been
all
this
time
holding
in
his
hand
the
crumpled
bundle
of
notes
on
which
the
eyes
of
all
especially
of
the
poles
were
fixed
in
confusion
he
thrust
them
hurriedly
into
his
pocket
he
flushed
at
that
moment
the
innkeeper
brought
in
an
uncorked
bottle
of
champagne
and
glasses
on
a
tray
mitya
snatched
up
the
bottle
but
he
was
so
bewildered
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
kalganov
took
it
from
him
and
poured
out
the
champagne
another
another
bottle
mitya
cried
to
the
innkeeper
and
forgetting
to
clink
glasses
with
the
pole
whom
he
had
so
solemnly
invited
to
drink
to
their
good
understanding
he
drank
off
his
glass
without
waiting
for
any
one
else
his
whole
countenance
suddenly
changed
the
solemn
and
tragic
expression
with
which
he
had
entered
vanished
completely
and
a
look
of
something
childlike
came
into
his
face
he
seemed
to
have
become
suddenly
gentle
and
subdued
he
looked
shyly
and
happily
at
every
one
with
a
continual
nervous
little
laugh
and
the
blissful
expression
of
a
dog
who
has
done
wrong
been
punished
and
forgiven
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
everything
and
was
looking
round
at
every
one
with
a
childlike
smile
of
delight
he
looked
at
grushenka
laughing
continually
and
bringing
his
chair
close
up
to
her
by
degrees
he
had
gained
some
idea
of
the
two
poles
though
he
had
formed
no
definite
conception
of
them
yet
the
pole
on
the
sofa
struck
him
by
his
dignified
demeanor
and
his
polish
accent
and
above
all
by
his
pipe
well
what
of
it
its
a
good
thing
hes
smoking
a
pipe
he
reflected
the
poles
puffy
middleaged
face
with
its
tiny
nose
and
two
very
thin
pointed
dyed
and
impudentlooking
mustaches
had
not
so
far
roused
the
faintest
doubts
in
mitya
he
was
not
even
particularly
struck
by
the
poles
absurd
wig
made
in
siberia
with
lovelocks
foolishly
combed
forward
over
the
temples
i
suppose
its
all
right
since
he
wears
a
wig
he
went
on
musing
blissfully
the
other
younger
pole
who
was
staring
insolently
and
defiantly
at
the
company
and
listening
to
the
conversation
with
silent
contempt
still
only
impressed
mitya
by
his
great
height
which
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
pole
on
the
sofa
if
he
stood
up
hed
be
six
foot
three
the
thought
flitted
through
mityas
mind
it
occurred
to
him
too
that
this
pole
must
be
the
friend
of
the
other
as
it
were
a
bodyguard
and
no
doubt
the
big
pole
was
at
the
disposal
of
the
little
pole
with
the
pipe
but
this
all
seemed
to
mitya
perfectly
right
and
not
to
be
questioned
in
his
mood
of
doglike
submissiveness
all
feeling
of
rivalry
had
died
away
grushenkas
mood
and
the
enigmatic
tone
of
some
of
her
words
he
completely
failed
to
grasp
all
he
understood
with
thrilling
heart
was
that
she
was
kind
to
him
that
she
had
forgiven
him
and
made
him
sit
by
her
he
was
beside
himself
with
delight
watching
her
sip
her
glass
of
champagne
the
silence
of
the
company
seemed
somehow
to
strike
him
however
and
he
looked
round
at
every
one
with
expectant
eyes
why
are
we
sitting
here
though
gentlemen
why
dont
you
begin
doing
something
his
smiling
eyes
seemed
to
ask
he
keeps
talking
nonsense
and
we
were
all
laughing
kalganov
began
suddenly
as
though
divining
his
thought
and
pointing
to
maximov
mitya
immediately
stared
at
kalganov
and
then
at
maximov
hes
talking
nonsense
he
laughed
his
short
wooden
laugh
seeming
suddenly
delighted
at
somethingha
ha
yes
would
you
believe
it
he
will
have
it
that
all
our
cavalry
officers
in
the
twenties
married
polish
women
thats
awful
rot
isnt
it
polish
women
repeated
mitya
perfectly
ecstatic
kalganov
was
well
aware
of
mityas
attitude
to
grushenka
and
he
guessed
about
the
pole
too
but
that
did
not
so
much
interest
him
perhaps
did
not
interest
him
at
all
what
he
was
interested
in
was
maximov
he
had
come
here
with
maximov
by
chance
and
he
met
the
poles
here
at
the
inn
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
grushenka
he
knew
before
and
had
once
been
with
some
one
to
see
her
but
she
had
not
taken
to
him
but
here
she
looked
at
him
very
affectionately
before
mityas
arrival
she
had
been
making
much
of
him
but
he
seemed
somehow
to
be
unmoved
by
it
he
was
a
boy
not
over
twenty
dressed
like
a
dandy
with
a
very
charming
fair
skinned
face
and
splendid
thick
fair
hair
from
his
fair
face
looked
out
beautiful
pale
blue
eyes
with
an
intelligent
and
sometimes
even
deep
expression
beyond
his
age
indeed
although
the
young
man
sometimes
looked
and
talked
quite
like
a
child
and
was
not
at
all
ashamed
of
it
even
when
he
was
aware
of
it
himself
as
a
rule
he
was
very
willful
even
capricious
though
always
friendly
sometimes
there
was
something
fixed
and
obstinate
in
his
expression
he
would
look
at
you
and
listen
seeming
all
the
while
to
be
persistently
dreaming
over
something
else
often
he
was
listless
and
lazy
at
other
times
he
would
grow
excited
sometimes
apparently
over
the
most
trivial
matters
only
imagine
ive
been
taking
him
about
with
me
for
the
last
four
days
he
went
on
indolently
drawling
his
words
quite
naturally
though
without
the
slightest
affectation
ever
since
your
brother
do
you
remember
shoved
him
off
the
carriage
and
sent
him
flying
that
made
me
take
an
interest
in
him
at
the
time
and
i
took
him
into
the
country
but
he
keeps
talking
such
rot
im
ashamed
to
be
with
him
im
taking
him
back
the
gentleman
has
not
seen
polish
ladies
and
says
what
is
impossible
the
pole
with
the
pipe
observed
to
maximov
he
spoke
russian
fairly
well
much
better
anyway
than
he
pretended
if
he
used
russian
words
he
always
distorted
them
into
a
polish
form
but
i
was
married
to
a
polish
lady
myself
tittered
maximov
but
did
you
serve
in
the
cavalry
you
were
talking
about
the
cavalry
were
you
a
cavalry
officer
put
in
kalganov
at
once
was
he
a
cavalry
officer
indeed
ha
ha
cried
mitya
listening
eagerly
and
turning
his
inquiring
eyes
to
each
as
he
spoke
as
though
there
were
no
knowing
what
he
might
hear
from
each
no
you
see
maximov
turned
to
him
what
i
mean
is
that
those
pretty
polish
ladies

when
they
danced
the
mazurka
with
our
uhlans

when
one
of
them
dances
a
mazurka
with
a
uhlan
she
jumps
on
his
knee
like
a
kitten

a
little
white
one

and
the
panfather
and
panmother
look
on
and
allow
it
they
allow
it

and
next
day
the
uhlan
comes
and
offers
her
his
hand
thats
how
it
is

offers
her
his
hand
he
he
maximov
ended
tittering
the
pan
is
a
lajdak
the
tall
pole
on
the
chair
growled
suddenly
and
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
mityas
eye
was
caught
by
his
huge
greased
boot
with
its
thick
dirty
sole
the
dress
of
both
the
poles
looked
rather
greasy
well
now
its
lajdak
whats
he
scolding
about
said
grushenka
suddenly
vexed
pani
agrippina
what
the
gentleman
saw
in
poland
were
servant
girls
and
not
ladies
of
good
birth
the
pole
with
the
pipe
observed
to
grushenka
you
can
reckon
on
that
the
tall
pole
snapped
contemptuously
what
next
let
him
talk
people
talk
why
hinder
them
it
makes
it
cheerful
grushenka
said
crossly
im
not
hindering
them
pani
said
the
pole
in
the
wig
with
a
long
look
at
grushenka
and
relapsing
into
dignified
silence
he
sucked
his
pipe
again
no
no
the
polish
gentleman
spoke
the
truth
kalganov
got
excited
again
as
though
it
were
a
question
of
vast
import
hes
never
been
in
poland
so
how
can
he
talk
about
it
i
suppose
you
werent
married
in
poland
were
you
no
in
the
province
of
smolensk
only
a
uhlan
had
brought
her
to
russia
before
that
my
future
wife
with
her
mamma
and
her
aunt
and
another
female
relation
with
a
grownup
son
he
brought
her
straight
from
poland
and
gave
her
up
to
me
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
our
regiment
a
very
nice
young
man
at
first
he
meant
to
marry
her
himself
but
he
didnt
marry
her
because
she
turned
out
to
be
lame
so
you
married
a
lame
woman
cried
kalganov
yes
they
both
deceived
me
a
little
bit
at
the
time
and
concealed
it
i
thought
she
was
hopping
she
kept
hopping
i
thought
it
was
for
fun
so
pleased
she
was
going
to
marry
you
yelled
kalganov
in
a
ringing
childish
voice
yes
so
pleased
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
a
different
cause
afterwards
when
we
were
married
after
the
wedding
that
very
evening
she
confessed
and
very
touchingly
asked
forgiveness
i
once
jumped
over
a
puddle
when
i
was
a
child
she
said
and
injured
my
leg
he
he
kalganov
went
off
into
the
most
childish
laughter
almost
falling
on
the
sofa
grushenka
too
laughed
mitya
was
at
the
pinnacle
of
happiness
do
you
know
thats
the
truth
hes
not
lying
now
exclaimed
kalganov
turning
to
mitya
and
do
you
know
hes
been
married
twice
its
his
first
wife
hes
talking
about
but
his
second
wife
do
you
know
ran
away
and
is
alive
now
is
it
possible
said
mitya
turning
quickly
to
maximov
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
astonishment
yes
she
did
run
away
ive
had
that
unpleasant
experience
maximov
modestly
assented
with
a
monsieur
and
what
was
worse
shed
had
all
my
little
property
transferred
to
her
beforehand
youre
an
educated
man
she
said
to
me
you
can
always
get
your
living
she
settled
my
business
with
that
a
venerable
bishop
once
said
to
me
one
of
your
wives
was
lame
but
the
other
was
too
lightfooted
he
he
listen
listen
cried
kalganov
bubbling
over
if
hes
telling
liesand
he
often
ishes
only
doing
it
to
amuse
us
all
theres
no
harm
in
that
is
there
you
know
i
sometimes
like
him
hes
awfully
low
but
its
natural
to
him
eh
dont
you
think
so
some
people
are
low
from
self
interest
but
hes
simply
so
from
nature
only
fancy
he
claims
he
was
arguing
about
it
all
the
way
yesterday
that
gogol
wrote
dead
souls
about
him
do
you
remember
theres
a
landowner
called
maximov
in
it
whom
nozdryov
thrashed
he
was
charged
do
you
remember
for
inflicting
bodily
injury
with
rods
on
the
landowner
maximov
in
a
drunken
condition
would
you
believe
it
he
claims
that
he
was
that
maximov
and
that
he
was
beaten
now
can
it
be
so
tchitchikov
made
his
journey
at
the
very
latest
at
the
beginning
of
the
twenties
so
that
the
dates
dont
fit
he
couldnt
have
been
thrashed
then
he
couldnt
could
he
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
what
kalganov
was
excited
about
but
his
excitement
was
genuine
mitya
followed
his
lead
without
protest
well
but
if
they
did
thrash
him
he
cried
laughing
its
not
that
they
thrashed
me
exactly
but
what
i
mean
is
put
in
maximov
what
do
you
mean
either
they
thrashed
you
or
they
didnt
what
oclock
is
it
panie
the
pole
with
the
pipe
asked
his
tall
friend
with
a
bored
expression
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
reply
neither
of
them
had
a
watch
why
not
talk
let
other
people
talk
mustnt
other
people
talk
because
youre
bored
grushenka
flew
at
him
with
evident
intention
of
finding
fault
something
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
flash
upon
mityas
mind
this
time
the
pole
answered
with
unmistakable
irritability
pani
i
didnt
oppose
it
i
didnt
say
anything
all
right
then
come
tell
us
your
story
grushenka
cried
to
maximov
why
are
you
all
silent
theres
nothing
to
tell
its
all
so
foolish
answered
maximov
at
once
with
evident
satisfaction
mincing
a
little
besides
all
thats
by
way
of
allegory
in
gogol
for
hes
made
all
the
names
have
a
meaning
nozdryov
was
really
called
nosov
and
kuvshinikov
had
quite
a
different
name
he
was
called
shkvornev
fenardi
really
was
called
fenardi
only
he
wasnt
an
italian
but
a
russian
and
mamsel
fenardi
was
a
pretty
girl
with
her
pretty
little
legs
in
tights
and
she
had
a
little
short
skirt
with
spangles
and
she
kept
turning
round
and
round
only
not
for
four
hours
but
for
four
minutes
only
and
she
bewitched
every
one
but
what
were
you
beaten
for
cried
kalganov
for
piron
answered
maximov
what
piron
cried
mitya
the
famous
french
writer
piron
we
were
all
drinking
then
a
big
party
of
us
in
a
tavern
at
that
very
fair
theyd
invited
me
and
first
of
all
i
began
quoting
epigrams
is
that
you
boileau
what
a
funny
getup
and
boileau
answers
that
hes
going
to
a
masquerade
that
is
to
the
baths
he
he
and
they
took
it
to
themselves
so
i
made
haste
to
repeat
another
very
sarcastic
well
known
to
all
educated
people
yes
sappho
and
phaon
are
we
but
one
grief
is
weighing
on
me
you
dont
know
your
way
to
the
sea
they
were
still
more
offended
and
began
abusing
me
in
the
most
unseemly
way
for
it
and
as
illluck
would
have
it
to
set
things
right
i
began
telling
a
very
cultivated
anecdote
about
piron
how
he
was
not
accepted
into
the
french
academy
and
to
revenge
himself
wrote
his
own
epitaph
cigt
piron
qui
ne
fut
rien
pas
mme
acadmicien
they
seized
me
and
thrashed
me
but
what
for
what
for
for
my
education
people
can
thrash
a
man
for
anything
maximov
concluded
briefly
and
sententiously
eh
thats
enough
thats
all
stupid
i
dont
want
to
listen
i
thought
it
would
be
amusing
grushenka
cut
them
short
suddenly
mitya
started
and
at
once
left
off
laughing
the
tall
pole
rose
upon
his
feet
and
with
the
haughty
air
of
a
man
bored
and
out
of
his
element
began
pacing
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
his
hands
behind
his
back
ah
he
cant
sit
still
said
grushenka
looking
at
him
contemptuously
mitya
began
to
feel
anxious
he
noticed
besides
that
the
pole
on
the
sofa
was
looking
at
him
with
an
irritable
expression
panie
cried
mitya

the
other
pan

a

eyes
were
shining

a
new
unopened

and
informed
mitya
that
the

that

the
cart
with

not

mitya
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
ran
into
the
next
room
to
give
orders
but
only
three
girls
had
arrived
and
marya
was
not
there
yet
and
he
did
not
know
himself
what
orders
to
give
and
why
he
had
run
out
he
only
told
them
to
take
out
of
the
box

on
the

lighted
another

and
pulling
his
money
out
of
his
pocket
mitya
was
about
to
fling
two
hundred
roubles
on
the
queen

kalganov
covered

with
his
hand

shouted
in
his
ringing
voice

mitya

may
be
right
youve
lost
a

said
grushenka
with
a
curious
note
in
her
voice
both
the
poles
rose
from
their
seats
with
a
deeply
offended
air
are

joking

said
the
short
man
looking
severely
at
kalganov
how
dare
you

growled
at
kalganov
dont
dare
to

cried
grushenka
ah
you
turkeycocks
mitya
looked
at
each
of
them
in
turn
but
something
in
grushenkas
face
suddenly
struck
him
and
at
the
same
instant
something
new
flashed
into
his
minda
strange
new
thought
pani
agrippina
the
little
pole
was
beginning
crimson
with
anger
when
mitya
suddenly
went
up
to
him
and
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
most
illustrious
two
words
with
you

be
glad
to

the
little
pan
was
taken
aback
and
looked
apprehensively
at
mitya
he
agreed
at
once
however
on
condition
that
pan
vrublevsky
went
with
them

bodyguard

asked
grushenka
anxiously
well
be
back
in
one
moment
answered
mitya
there
was
a
sort
of
boldness
a
sudden
confidence
shining
in
his
eyes
his
face
had
looked
very
different
when
he
entered
the
room
an
hour
before
he
led
the
poles
not
into
the
large
room
where
the
chorus
of
girls
was
assembling
and
the
table
was
being
laid
but
into
the
bedroom
on
the
right
where
the
trunks
and
packages
were
kept
and
there
were
two
large
beds
with
pyramids
of
cotton
pillows
on
each
there
was
a
lighted
candle
on
a
small
deal
table
in
the
corner
the
small
man
and
mitya
sat
down
to
this
table
facing
each
other
while
the
huge
vrublevsky
stood
beside
them
his
hands
behind
his
back
the
poles
looked
severe
but

had

short
mans
face
looked
more
forbidding
seven

not
five

faltered
mitya
his
spirit
sinking
at
every
word
he
uttered
upon
my
word
the
moneys
there
hidden
in
an
instant
an
extraordinary
sense
of
personal
dignity
showed
itself
in
the
little
mans
face
what
next
he
asked
ironically
for
shame
and
he
spat
on
the
floor
pan
vrublevsky
spat
too
you
do
that
panie
said
mitya
recognizing
with
despair
that
all
was
over
because
you
hope
to
make
more
out
of
grushenka
youre
a
couple
of
capons
thats
what
you
are
this
is
a
mortal
insult
the
little
pole
turned
as
red
as
a
crab
and
he
went
out
of
the
room
briskly
as
though
unwilling
to
hear
another
word
vrublevsky
swung
out
after
him
and
mitya
followed
confused
and
crestfallen
he
was
afraid
of
grushenka
afraid
that
the
pan
would
at
once
raise
an
outcry
and
so
indeed
he
did
the
pole
walked
into
the
room
and
threw
himself
in
a
theatrical
attitude
before
grushenka
pani
agrippina
i
have
received
a
mortal
insult
he
exclaimed
but
grushenka
suddenly
lost
all
patience
as
though
they
had
wounded
her
in
the
tenderest
spot

with
offended
dignity
and
quickly
and
pompously
delivered
himself
in
broken
russian
pani
agrafena
i
came
here

in
her
hands
at
that
instant
the
chorus
of
mokroe
began
singing
in
the

on
the
lefta
rollicking
dance
song
a
regular
sodom
vrublevsky

inquisitively
peeping
in
at

hearing
shouts
and
guessing
that

were
quarreling
at
once
entered
the
room
what

thrust
his
fingers

and
the
cushion
and
pulled
out
an
unopened
pack
of

as
good
as
stolen
from

kalganov
declared
suddenly
i
dont
want
my
two
hundred
either
cried
mitya
i
wouldnt
take
it
for
anything
let
him
keep
it
as
a
consolation
bravo
mitya
youre
a
trump
mitya
cried
grushenka
and
there
was
a
note
of
fierce
anger
in
the
exclamation
the
little
pan
crimson
with
fury
but
still
mindful
of
his
dignity
was
making
for
the
door
but
he
stopped
short
and
said
suddenly
addressing
grushenka
pani
if
you
want
to
come
with
me
come
if
not
goodby
and
swelling
with
indignation
and
importance
he
went
to
the
door
this
was
a
man
of
character
he
had
so
good
an
opinion
of
himself
that
after
all
that
had
passed
he
still
expected
that
she
would
marry
him
mitya
slammed
the
door
after
him
lock
it
said
kalganov
but
the
key
clicked
on
the
other
side
they
had
locked
it
from
within
thats
capital
exclaimed
grushenka
relentlessly
serve
them
right
chapter
viii
delirium
what
followed
was
almost
an
orgy
a
feast
to
which
all
were
welcome
grushenka
was
the
first
to
call
for
wine
i
want
to
drink
i
want
to
be
quite
drunk
as
we
were
before
do
you
remember
mitya
do
you
remember
how
we
made
friends
here
last
time
mitya
himself
was
almost
delirious
feeling
that
his
happiness
was
at
hand
but
grushenka
was
continually
sending
him
away
from
her
go
and
enjoy
yourself
tell
them
to
dance
to
make
merry
let
the
stove
and
cottage
dance
as
we
had
it
last
time
she
kept
exclaiming
she
was
tremendously
excited
and
mitya
hastened
to
obey
her
the
chorus
were
in
the
next
room
the
room
in
which
they
had
been
sitting
till
that
moment
was
too
small
and
was
divided
in
two
by
cotton
curtains
behind
which
was
a
huge
bed
with
a
puffy
feather
mattress
and
a
pyramid
of
cotton
pillows
in
the
four
rooms
for
visitors
there
were
beds
grushenka
settled
herself
just
at
the
door
mitya
set
an
easy
chair
for
her
she
had
sat
in
the
same
place
to
watch
the
dancing
and
singing
the
time
before
when
they
had
made
merry
there
all
the
girls
who
had
come
had
been
there
then
the
jewish
band
with
fiddles
and
zithers
had
come
too
and
at
last
the
long
expected
cart
had
arrived
with
the
wines
and
provisions
mitya
bustled
about
all
sorts
of
people
began
coming
into
the
room
to
look
on
peasants
and
their
women
who
had
been
roused
from
sleep
and
attracted
by
the
hopes
of
another
marvelous
entertainment
such
as
they
had
enjoyed
a
month
before
mitya
remembered
their
faces
greeting
and
embracing
every
one
he
knew
he
uncorked
bottles
and
poured
out
wine
for
every
one
who
presented
himself
only
the
girls
were
very
eager
for
the
champagne
the
men
preferred
rum
brandy
and
above
all
hot
punch
mitya
had
chocolate
made
for
all
the
girls
and
ordered
that
three
samovars
should
be
kept
boiling
all
night
to
provide
tea
and
punch
for
everyone
to
help
himself
an
absurd
chaotic
confusion
followed
but
mitya
was
in
his
natural
element
and
the
more
foolish
it
became
the
more
his
spirits
rose
if
the
peasants
had
asked
him
for
money
at
that
moment
he
would
have
pulled
out
his
notes
and
given
them
away
right
and
left
this
was
probably
why
the
landlord
trifon
borissovitch
kept
hovering
about
mitya
to
protect
him
he
seemed
to
have
given
up
all
idea
of
going
to
bed
that
night
but
he
drank
little
only
one
glass
of
punch
and
kept
a
sharp
lookout
on
mityas
interests
after
his
own
fashion
he
intervened
in
the
nick
of
time
civilly
and
obsequiously
persuading
mitya
not
to
give
away
cigars
and
rhine
wine
and
above
all
money
to
the
peasants
as
he
had
done
before
he
was
very
indignant
too
at
the
peasant
girls
drinking
liqueur
and
eating
sweets
theyre
a
lousy
lot
dmitri
fyodorovitch
he
said
id
give
them
a
kick
every
one
of
them
and
theyd
take
it
as
an
honorthats
all
theyre
worth
mitya
remembered
andrey
again
and
ordered
punch
to
be
sent
out
to
him
i
was
rude
to
him
just
now
he
repeated
with
a
sinking
softened
voice
kalganov
did
not
want
to
drink
and
at
first
did
not
care
for
the
girls
singing
but
after
he
had
drunk
a
couple
of
glasses
of
champagne
he
became
extraordinarily
lively
strolling
about
the
room
laughing
and
praising
the
music
and
the
songs
admiring
every
one
and
everything
maximov
blissfully
drunk
never
left
his
side
grushenka
too
was
beginning
to
get
drunk
pointing
to
kalganov
she
said
to
mitya
what
a
dear
charming
boy
he
is
and
mitya
delighted
ran
to
kiss
kalganov
and
maximov
oh
great
were
his
hopes
she
had
said
nothing
yet
and
seemed
indeed
purposely
to
refrain
from
speaking
but
she
looked
at
him
from
time
to
time
with
caressing
and
passionate
eyes
at
last
she
suddenly
gripped
his
hand
and
drew
him
vigorously
to
her
she
was
sitting
at
the
moment
in
the
low
chair
by
the
door
how
was
it
you
came
just
now
eh
have
you
walked
in
i
was
frightened
so
you
wanted
to
give
me
up
to
him
did
you
did
you
really
want
to
i
didnt
want
to
spoil
your
happiness
mitya
faltered
blissfully
but
she
did
not
need
his
answer
well
go
and
enjoy
yourself

she
sent
him
away
once
more
dont
cry
ill
call
you
back
again
he
would
run
away
and
she
listened
to
the
singing
and
looked
at
the
dancing
though
her
eyes
followed
him
wherever
he
went
but
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
she
would
call
him
once
more
and
again
he
would
run
back
to
her
come
sit
beside
me
tell
me
how
did
you
hear
about
me
and
my
coming
here
yesterday
from
whom
did
you
first
hear
it
and
mitya
began
telling
her
all
about
it
disconnectedly
incoherently
feverishly
he
spoke
strangely
often
frowning
and
stopping
abruptly
what
are
you
frowning
at
she
asked
nothing
i
left
a
man
ill
there
id
give
ten
years
of
my
life
for
him
to
get
well
to
know
he
was
all
right
well
never
mind
him
if
hes
ill
so
you
meant
to
shoot
yourself
to
morrow
what
a
silly
boy
what
for
i
like
such
reckless
fellows
as
you
she
lisped
with
a
rather
halting
tongue
so
you
would
go
any
length
for
me
eh
did
you
really
mean
to
shoot
yourself
tomorrow
you
stupid
no
wait
a
little
tomorrow
i
may
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
wont
say
it
today
but
tomorrow
youd
like
it
to
be
today
no
i
dont
want
to
today
come
go
along
now
go
and
amuse
yourself
once
however
she
called
him
as
it
were
puzzled
and
uneasy
why
are
you
sad
i
see
youre
sad
yes
i
see
it
she
added
looking
intently
into
his
eyes
though
you
keep
kissing
the
peasants
and
shouting
i
see
something
no
be
merry
im
merry
you
be
merry
too
i
love
somebody
here
guess
who
it
is
ah
look
my
boy
has
fallen
asleep
poor
dear
hes
drunk
she
meant
kalganov
he
was
in
fact
drunk
and
had
dropped
asleep
for
a
moment
sitting
on
the
sofa
but
he
was
not
merely
drowsy
from
drink
he
felt
suddenly
dejected
or
as
he
said
bored
he
was
intensely
depressed
by
the
girls
songs
which
as
the
drinking
went
on
gradually
became
coarse
and
more
reckless
and
the
dances
were
as
bad
two
girls
dressed
up
as
bears
and
a
lively
girl
called
stepanida
with
a
stick
in
her
hand
acted
the
part
of
keeper
and
began
to
show
them
look
alive
marya
or
youll
get
the
stick
the
bears
rolled
on
the
ground
at
last
in
the
most
unseemly
fashion
amid
roars
of
laughter
from
the
closelypacked
crowd
of
men
and
women
well
let
them
let
them
said
grushenka
sententiously
with
an
ecstatic
expression
on
her
face
when
they
do
get
a
day
to
enjoy
themselves
why
shouldnt
folks
be
happy
kalganov
looked
as
though
he
had
been
besmirched
with
dirt
its
swinish
all
this
peasant
foolery
he
murmured
moving
away
its
the
game
they
play
when
its
light
all
night
in
summer
he
particularly
disliked
one
new
song
to
a
jaunty
dancetune
it
described
how
a
gentleman
came
and
tried
his
luck
with
the
girls
to
see
whether
they
would
love
him
the
master
came
to
try
the
girls
would
they
love
him
would
they
not
but
the
girls
could
not
love
the
master
he
would
beat
me
cruelly
and
such
love
wont
do
for
me
then
a
gypsy
comes
along
and
he
too
tries
the
gypsy
came
to
try
the
girls
would
they
love
him
would
they
not
but
they
couldnt
love
the
gypsy
either
he
would
be
a
thief
i
fear
and
would
cause
me
many
a
tear
and
many
more
men
come
to
try
their
luck
among
them
a
soldier
the
soldier
came
to
try
the
girls
would
they
love
him
would
they
not
but
the
soldier
is
rejected
with
contempt
in
two
indecent
lines
sung
with
absolute
frankness
and
producing
a
furore
in
the
audience
the
song
ends
with
a
merchant
the
merchant
came
to
try
the
girls
would
they
love
him
would
they
not
and
it
appears
that
he
wins
their
love
because
the
merchant
will
make
gold
for
me
and
his
queen
ill
gladly
be
kalvanov
was
positively
indignant
thats
just
a
song
of
yesterday
he
said
aloud
who
writes
such
things
for
them
they
might
just
as
well
have
had
a
railwayman
or
a
jew
come
to
try
his
luck
with
the
girls
theyd
have
carried
all
before
them
and
almost
as
though
it
were
a
personal
affront
he
declared
on
the
spot
that
he
was
bored
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
immediately
fell
asleep
his
pretty
little
face
looked
rather
pale
as
it
fell
back
on
the
sofa
cushion
look
how
pretty
he
is
said
grushenka
taking
mitya
up
to
him
i
was
combing
his
hair
just
now
his
hairs
like
flax
and
so
thick
and
bending
over
him
tenderly
she
kissed
his
forehead
kalganov
instantly
opened
his
eyes
looked
at
her
stood
up
and
with
the
most
anxious
air
inquired
where
was
maximov
so
thats
who
it
is

want
grushenka
laughed
stay
with
me
a
minute
mitya
run
and
find
his
maximov
maximov
it
appeared
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
the
girls
only
running
away
from
time
to
time
to
pour
himself
out
a
glass
of
liqueur
he
had
drunk
two
cups
of
chocolate
his
face
was
red
and
his
nose
was
crimson
his
eyes
were
moist
and
mawkishly
sweet
he
ran
up
and
announced
that
he
was
going
to
dance
the
sabotire
they
taught
me
all
those
wellbred
aristocratic
dances
when
i
was
little
go

grushenka

exclaimed
kalganov
brushing
aside
in
the
most
nave
way
grushenkas
offer
to
sit
with
him
they
all
went
to
look
on
maximov
danced
his
dance
but
it
roused
no
great
admiration
in
any
one
but
mitya
it
consisted
of
nothing
but
skipping
and
hopping
kicking
up
the
feet
and
at
every
skip
maximov
slapped
the
upturned
sole
of
his
foot
kalganov
did
not
like
it
at
all
but
mitya
kissed
the
dancer

smiled
maximov
all
right
all
right
mityas
head
was
burning
he
went
outside
to
the
wooden
balcony
which
ran
round
the
whole
building
on
the
inner
side
overlooking
the
courtyard
the
fresh
air
revived
him
he
stood
alone
in
a
dark
corner
and
suddenly
clutched
his
head
in
both
hands
his
scattered
thoughts
came
together
his
sensations
blended
into
a
whole
and
threw
a
sudden
light
into
his
mind
a
fearful
and
terrible
light
if
im
to
shoot
myself
why
not
now
passed
through
his
mind
why
not
go
for
the
pistols
bring
them
here
and
here
in
this
dark
dirty
corner
make
an
end
almost
a
minute
he
stood
undecided
a
few
hours
earlier
when
he
had
been
dashing
here
he
was
pursued
by
disgrace
by
the
theft
he
had
committed
and
that
blood
that
blood
but
yet
it
was
easier
for
him
then
then
everything
was
over
he
had
lost
her
given
her
up
she
was
gone
for
himoh
then
his
death
sentence
had
been
easier
for
him
at
least
it
had
seemed
necessary
inevitable
for
what
had
he
to
stay
on
earth
for
but
now
was
it
the
same
as
then
now
one
phantom
one
terror
at
least
was
at
an
end
that
first
rightful
lover
that
fateful
figure
had
vanished
leaving
no
trace
the
terrible
phantom
had
turned
into
something
so
small
so
comic
it
had
been
carried
into
the
bedroom
and
locked
in
it
would
never
return
she
was
ashamed
and
from
her
eyes
he
could
see
now
whom
she
loved
now
he
had
everything
to
make
life
happy

but
he
could
not
go
on
living
he
could
not
oh
damnation
o
god
restore
to
life
the
man
i
knocked
down
at
the
fence
let
this
fearful
cup
pass
from
me
lord
thou
hast
wrought
miracles
for
such
sinners
as
me
but
what
what
if
the
old
mans
alive
oh
then
the
shame
of
the
other
disgrace
i
would
wipe
away
i
would
restore
the
stolen
money
id
give
it
back
id
get
it
somehow
no
trace
of
that
shame
will
remain
except
in
my
heart
for
ever
but
no
no
oh
impossible
cowardly
dreams
oh
damnation
yet
there
was
a
ray
of
light
and
hope
in
his
darkness
he
jumped
up
and
ran
back
to
the
roomto
her
to
her
his
queen
for
ever
was
not
one
moment
of
her
love
worth
all
the
rest
of
life
even
in
the
agonies
of
disgrace
this
wild
question
clutched
at
his
heart
to
her
to
her
alone
to
see
her
to
hear
her
to
think
of
nothing
to
forget
everything
if
only
for
that
night
for
an
hour
for
a
moment
just
as
he
turned
from
the
balcony
into
the
passage
he
came
upon
the
landlord
trifon
borissovitch
he
thought
he
looked
gloomy
and
worried
and
fancied
he
had
come
to
find
him
what
is
it
trifon
borissovitch
are

looking
for

landlord

disconcerted
why

with

mitya
wondered
for
an
instant
and
he
ran
back
to
the
room
where
the
girls
were
dancing
but
she
was
not
there
she
was
not
in
the
blue
room
either
there
was
no
one
but
kalganov
asleep
on
the
sofa
mitya
peeped
behind
the
curtainshe
was
there
she
was
sitting
in
the
corner
on
a
trunk
bent
forward
with
her
head
and
arms
on
the
bed
close
by
she
was
crying
bitterly
doing
her
utmost
to
stifle
her
sobs
that
she
might
not
be
heard
seeing
mitya
she
beckoned
him
to
her
and
when
he
ran
to
her
she
grasped
his
hand
tightly
mitya
mitya
i
loved
him
you
know
how
i
have
loved
him
these
five
years
all
that
time
did
i
love
him
or
only
my
own
anger
no
him
him
its
a
lie
that
it
was
my
anger
i
loved
and
not
him
mitya
i
was
only
seventeen
then
he
was
so
kind
to
me
so
merry
he
used
to
sing
to
me
or
so
it
seemed
to
a
silly
girl
like
me
and
now
o
lord
its
not
the
same
man
even
his
face
is
not
the
same
hes
different
altogether
i
shouldnt
have
known
him
i
drove
here
with
timofey
and
all
the
way
i
was
thinking
how
i
should
meet
him
what
i
should
say
to
him
how
we
should
look
at
one
another
my
soul
was
faint
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
just
as
though
he
had
emptied
a
pail
of
dirty
water
over
me
he
talked
to
me
like
a
schoolmaster
all
so
grave
and
learned
he
met
me
so
solemnly
that
i
was
struck
dumb
i
couldnt
get
a
word
in
at
first
i
thought
he
was
ashamed
to
talk
before
his
great
big
pole
i
sat
staring
at
him
and
wondering
why
i
couldnt
say
a
word
to
him
now
it
must
have
been
his
wife
that
ruined
him
you
know
he
threw
me
up
to
get
married
she
must
have
changed
him
like
that
mitya
how
shameful
it
is
oh
mitya
im
ashamed
im
ashamed
for
all
my
life
curse
it
curse
it
curse
those
five
years
and
again
she
burst
into
tears
but
clung
tight
to
mityas
hand
and
did
not
let
it
go
mitya
darling
stay
dont
go
away
i
want
to
say
one
word
to
you
she
whispered
and
suddenly
raised
her
face
to
him
listen
tell
me
who
it
is
i
love
i
love
one
man
here
who
is
that
man
thats
what
you
must
tell
me
a
smile
lighted
up
her
face
that
was
swollen
with
weeping
and
her
eyes
shone
in
the
half
darkness
a
falcon
flew
in
and
my
heart
sank
fool
thats
the
man
you
love
that
was
what
my
heart
whispered
to
me
at
once
you
came
in
and
all
grew
bright
whats

she
jumped
up
and
held
him
with
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
mitya
dumb
with
rapture
gazed
into
her
eyes
at
her
face
at
her
smile
and
suddenly
clasped
her
tightly
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
passionately

of
his

at
my
house

and

to
my
vile
heart
mitya
my
falcon
why

and

she
tore
herself
away
from
him
and
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
mitya
followed
like
a
drunken
man
yes
come
what
maywhatever
may
happen
now
for
one
minute
id

whole

he
thought
grushenka
did
in
fact
toss
off
a
whole
glass
of
champagne
at
one
gulp
and
became
at
once
very
tipsy
she
sat
down
in
the
same
chair
as
before
with
a
blissful
smile
on
her
face
her
cheeks
were
glowing
her
lips
were
burning
her
flashing
eyes
were
moist
there
was
passionate
appeal
in
her
eyes
even
kalganov
felt
a
stir
at
the
heart
and
went
up
to
her
did
you
feel
how
i
kissed
you
when
you
were
asleep
just
now
she
said
thickly
im
drunk
now
thats
what
it
is
and
arent
you
drunk
and
why
isnt
mitya

and
now
ill

drunk
with

too
he
drank
off
another
glass
andhe
thought
it
strange
himselfthat
glass
made
him
completely
drunk
he
was
suddenly
drunk
although
till
that
moment
he
had
been
quite
sober
he
remembered
that
from
that
moment
everything
whirled
about
him
as
though
he
were
delirious
he
walked
laughed
talked
to
everybody
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
only
one
persistent
burning
sensation
made
itself
felt
continually
like
a
redhot
coal
in
his
heart
he
said
afterwards
he
went
up
to
her
sat
beside
her
gazed
at
her
listened
to
her
she
became
very
talkative
kept
calling
every
one
to
her
and
beckoned
to
different
girls
out
of
the
chorus
when
the
girl
came
up
she
either
kissed
her
or
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
her
in
another
minute
she
might
have
cried
she
was
greatly
amused
by
the
little
old
man
as
she
called
maximov
he
ran
up
every
minute
to
kiss
her
hands
each
little
finger
and
finally
he
danced
another
dance
to
an
old
song
which
he
sang
himself
he
danced
with
special
vigor
to
the
refrain

she
really
meant

she
pulled
a
white
cambric
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
and
took
it
by
one
corner
in
her
right
hand
to
wave
it
in
the
dance
mitya
ran
to
and
fro
the
girls
were
quiet
and
got
ready
to
break
into
a
dancing
song
at
the
first
signal
maximov
hearing
that
grushenka
wanted
to
dance
squealed
with
delight
and
ran
skipping
about
in
front
of
her
humming
with
legs
so
slim
and
sides
so
trim
and
its
little
tail
curled
tight
but
grushenka
waved
her
handkerchief
at
him
and
drove
him
away

mitya
walked
with
a
drunken
swagger
to
the
locked
door
and
began
knocking
to
the
poles
with
his
fist

grushenka
and
went
forward
to
dance
the
chorus
broke
into
ah
my
porch
my
new
porch
grushenka
flung
back
her
head
half
opened
her
lips
smiled
waved
her
handkerchief
and
suddenly
with
a
violent
lurch
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
bewildered
im
weak
she
said
in
an
exhausted
voice

me
im
weak
i
cant

sorry
she
bowed
to
the
chorus
and
then
began
bowing
in
all
directions
im
sorry
forgive
me
the

said
grushenka
helplessly
mitya
pounced
on
her
snatched
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
the
precious
burden
through
the
curtains
well
now
ill
go
thought
kalganov
and
walking
out
of
the
blue
room
he
closed
the
two
halves
of
the
door
after
him
but
the
orgy
in
the
larger
room
went
on
and
grew
louder
and
louder
mitya
laid
grushenka
on
the
bed
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
dont
touch
me
she
faltered
in
an
imploring
voice

still
holding

in
his

he
sank
on

by
the
bedside
i

there
are
people
coming
now
its
stopped
she
closed
her
eyes
exhausted
and
suddenly
fell
asleep
for
an
instant
there
had
certainly
been
the
sound
of
a
bell
in
the
distance
but
the
ringing
had
ceased
mitya
let
his
head
sink
on
her
breast
he
did
not
notice
that
the
bell
had
ceased
ringing
nor
did
he
notice
that
the
songs
had
ceased
and
that
instead
of
singing
and
drunken
clamor
there
was
absolute
stillness
in
the
house
grushenka
opened
her
eyes
whats
the
matter
was
i
asleep
yes

a
bell

ive
been
asleep
and
dreamt
i
was
driving
over
the
snow
with
bells
and
i
dozed
i
was
with
some
one
i
loved
with
you
and
far
far
away
i
was
holding
you
and
kissing
you
nestling
close
to
you
i
was
cold
and
the
snow
glistened
you
know
how
the
snow
glistens
at
night
when
the
moon
shines
it
was
as
though
i
was
not
on
earth
i
woke
up
and
my
dear
one
is
close
to
me
how
sweet
that
is
close
to
you
murmured
mitya
kissing
her
dress
her
bosom
her
hands
and
suddenly
he
had
a
strange
fancy
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
looking
straight
before
her
not
at
him
not
into
his
face
but
over
his
head
with
an
intent
almost
uncanny
fixity
an
expression
of
wonder
almost
of
alarm
came
suddenly
into
her
face
mitya
who
is
that
looking
at
us
she
whispered
mitya
turned
and
saw
that
some
one
had
in
fact
parted
the
curtains
and
seemed
to
be
watching
them
and
not
one
person
alone
it
seemed
he
jumped
up
and
walked
quickly
to
the
intruder
here
come
to
us
come
here
said
a
voice
speaking
not
loudly
but
firmly
and
peremptorily
mitya
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
curtain
and
stood
stock
still
the
room
was
filled
with
people
but
not
those
who
had
been
there
before
an
instantaneous
shiver
ran
down
his
back
and
he
shuddered
he
recognized
all
those
people
instantly
that
tall
stout
old
man
in
the
overcoat
and
foragecap
with
a
cockadewas
the
police
captain
mihail
makarovitch
and
that
consumptivelooking
trim
dandy
who
always
has
such
polished
bootsthat
was
the
deputy
prosecutor
he
has
a
chronometer
worth
four
hundred
roubles
he
showed
it
to
me
and
that
small
young
man
in
spectacles
mitya
forgot
his
surname
though
he
knew
him
had
seen
him
he
was
the
investigating
lawyer
from
the
school
of
jurisprudence
who
had
only
lately
come
to
the
town
and
this
manthe
inspector
of
police
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
a
man
he
knew
well
and
those
fellows
with
the
brass
plates
on
why
are
they
here
and
those
other
two

peasants
and
there
at
the
door
kalganov
with
trifon
borissovitch
gentlemen
whats
this
for
gentlemen
began
mitya
but
suddenly
as
though
beside
himself
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
cried
aloud
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
understand
the
young
man
in
spectacles
moved
forward
suddenly
and
stepping
up
to
mitya
began
with
dignity
though
hurriedly
we
have
to
make

in
brief
i
beg
you
to
come
this
way
this
way
to
the
sofa
it
is
absolutely
imperative
that
you
should
give
an
explanation
the
old
man
cried
mitya
frantically
the
old
man
and
his
blood
i
understand
and
he
sank
almost
fell
on
a
chair
close
by
as
though
he
had
been
mown
down
by
a
scythe
you
understand
he
understands
it
monster
and
parricide
your
fathers
blood
cries
out
against
you
the
old
captain
of
police
roared
suddenly
stepping
up
to
mitya
he
was
beside
himself
crimson
in
the
face
and
quivering
all
over
this
is
impossible
cried
the
small
young
man
mihail
makarovitch
mihail
makarovitch
this
wont
do
i
beg
youll
allow
me
to
speak
i
should
never
have
expected
such
behavior
from
you
this
is
delirium
gentlemen
raving
delirium
cried
the
captain
of
police
look
at
him
drunk
at
this
time
of
night
in
the
company
of
a
disreputable
woman
with
the
blood
of
his
father
on
his
hands
its
delirium
i
beg
you
most
earnestly
dear
mihail
makarovitch
to
restrain
your
feelings
the
prosecutor
said
in
a
rapid
whisper
to
the
old
police
captain
or
i
shall
be
forced
to
resort
to
but
the
little
lawyer
did
not
allow
him
to
finish
he
turned
to
mitya
and
delivered
himself
in
a
loud
firm
dignified
voice
exlieutenant
karamazov
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
you
are
charged
with
the
murder
of
your
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
karamazov
perpetrated
this
night
he
said
something
more
and
the
prosecutor
too
put
in
something
but
though
mitya
heard
them
he
did
not
understand
them
he
stared
at
them
all
with
wild
eyes
book
ix
the
preliminary
investigation
chapter
i
the
beginning
of
perhotins
official
career
pyotr
ilyitch
perhotin
whom
we
left
knocking
at
the
strong
locked
gates
of
the
widow
morozovs
house
ended
of
course
by
making
himself
heard
fenya
who
was
still
excited
by
the
fright
she
had
had
two
hours
before
and
too
much
upset
to
go
to
bed
was
almost
frightened
into
hysterics
on
hearing
the
furious
knocking
at
the
gate
though
she
had
herself
seen
him
drive
away
she
fancied
that
it
must
be
dmitri
fyodorovitch
knocking
again
no
one
else
could
knock
so
savagely
she
ran
to
the
houseporter
who
had
already
waked
up
and
gone
out
to
the
gate
and
began
imploring
him
not
to
open
it
but
having
questioned
pyotr
ilyitch
and
learned
that
he
wanted
to
see
fenya
on
very
important
business
the
man
made
up
his
mind
at
last
to
open
pyotr
ilyitch
was
admitted
into
fenyas
kitchen
but
the
girl
begged
him
to
allow
the
houseporter
to
be
present
because
of
her
misgivings
he
began
questioning
her
and
at
once
learnt
the
most
vital
fact
that
is
that
when
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
run
out
to
look
for
grushenka
he
had
snatched
up
a
pestle
from
the
mortar
and
that
when
he
returned
the
pestle
was
not
with
him
and
his
hands
were
smeared
with
blood
and
the
blood
was
simply
flowing
dripping
from
him
dripping
fenya
kept
exclaiming
this
horrible
detail
was
simply
the
product
of
her
disordered
imagination
but
although
not
dripping
pyotr
ilyitch
had
himself
seen
those
hands
stained
with
blood
and
had
helped
to
wash
them
moreover
the
question
he
had
to
decide
was
not
how
soon
the
blood
had
dried
but
where
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
run
with
the
pestle
or
rather
whether
it
really
was
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
and
how
he
could
satisfactorily
ascertain
pyotr
ilyitch
persisted
in
returning
to
this
point
and
though
he
found
out
nothing
conclusive
yet
he
carried
away
a
conviction
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
could
have
gone
nowhere
but
to
his
fathers
house
and
that
therefore
something
must
have
happened
there
and
when
he
came
back
fenya
added
with
excitement
i
told
him
the
whole
story
and
then
i
began
asking
him
why
have
you
got
blood
on
your
hands
dmitri
fyodorovitch
and
he
answered
that
that
was
human
blood
and
that
he
had
just
killed
some
one
he
confessed
it
all
to
me
and
suddenly
ran
off
like
a
madman
i
sat
down
and
began
thinking
wheres
he
run
off
to
now
like
a
madman
hell
go
to
mokroe
i
thought
and
kill
my
mistress
there
i
ran
out
to
beg
him
not
to
kill
her
i
was
running
to
his
lodgings
but
i
looked
at
plotnikovs
shop
and
saw
him
just
setting
off
and
there
was
no
blood
on
his
hands
then
fenya
had
noticed
this
and
remembered
it
fenyas
old
grandmother
confirmed
her
evidence
as
far
as
she
was
capable
after
asking
some
further
questions
pyotr
ilyitch
left
the
house
even
more
upset
and
uneasy
than
he
had
been
when
he
entered
it
the
most
direct
and
the
easiest
thing
for
him
to
do
would
have
been
to
go
straight
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
to
find
out
whether
anything
had
happened
there
and
if
so
what
and
only
to
go
to
the
police
captain
as
pyotr
ilyitch
firmly
intended
doing
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
of
the
fact
but
the
night
was
dark
fyodor
pavlovitchs
gates
were
strong
and
he
would
have
to
knock
again
his
acquaintance
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
of
the
slightest
and
what
if
after
he
had
been
knocking
they
opened
to
him
and
nothing
had
happened
then
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
his
jeering
way
would
go
telling
the
story
all
over
the
town
how
a
stranger
called
perhotin
had
broken
in
upon
him
at
midnight
to
ask
if
any
one
had
killed
him
it
would
make
a
scandal
and
scandal
was
what
pyotr
ilyitch
dreaded
more
than
anything
in
the
world
yet
the
feeling
that
possessed
him
was
so
strong
that
though
he
stamped
his
foot
angrily
and
swore
at
himself
he
set
off
again
not
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
but
to
madame
hohlakovs
he
decided
that
if
she
denied
having
just
given
dmitri
fyodorovitch
three
thousand
roubles
he
would
go
straight
to
the
police
captain
but
if
she
admitted
having
given
him
the
money
he
would
go
home
and
let
the
matter
rest
till
next
morning
it
is
of
course
perfectly
evident
that
there
was
even
more
likelihood
of
causing
scandal
by
going
at
eleven
oclock
at
night
to
a
fashionable
lady
a
complete
stranger
and
perhaps
rousing
her
from
her
bed
to
ask
her
an
amazing
question
than
by
going
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
but
that
is
just
how
it
is
sometimes
especially
in
cases
like
the
present
one
with
the
decisions
of
the
most
precise
and
phlegmatic
people
pyotr
ilyitch
was
by
no
means
phlegmatic
at
that
moment
he
remembered
all
his
life
how
a
haunting
uneasiness
gradually
gained
possession
of
him
growing
more
and
more
painful
and
driving
him
on
against
his
will
yet
he
kept
cursing
himself
of
course
all
the
way
for
going
to
this
lady
but
i
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
i
will
he
repeated
for
the
tenth
time
grinding
his
teeth
and
he
carried
out
his
intention
it
was
exactly
eleven
oclock
when
he
entered
madame
hohlakovs
house
he
was
admitted
into
the
yard
pretty
quickly
but
in
response
to
his
inquiry
whether
the
lady
was
still
up
the
porter
could
give
no
answer
except
that
she
was
usually
in
bed
by
that
time
ask
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
if
the
lady
wants
to
receive
you
shell
receive
you
if
she
wont
she
wont
pyotr
ilyitch
went
up
but
did
not
find
things
so
easy
here
the
footman
was
unwilling
to
take
in
his
name
but
finally
called
a
maid
pyotr
ilyitch
politely
but
insistently
begged
her
to
inform
her
lady
that
an
official
living
in
the
town
called
perhotin
had
called
on
particular
business
and
that
if
it
were
not
of
the
greatest
importance
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
come
tell
her
in
those
words
in
those
words
exactly
he
asked
the
girl
she
went
away
he
remained
waiting
in
the
entry
madame
hohlakov
herself
was
already
in
her
bedroom
though
not
yet
asleep
she
had
felt
upset
ever
since
mityas
visit
and
had
a
presentiment
that
she
would
not
get
through
the
night
without
the
sick
headache
which
always
with
her
followed
such
excitement
she
was
surprised
on
hearing
the
announcement
from
the
maid
she
irritably
declined
to
see
him
however
though
the
unexpected
visit
at
such
an
hour
of
an
official
living
in
the
town
who
was
a
total
stranger
roused
her
feminine
curiosity
intensely
but
this
time
pyotr
ilyitch
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
he
begged
the
maid
most
earnestly
to
take
another
message
in
these
very
words
that
he
had
come
on
business
of
the
greatest
importance
and
that
madame
hohlakov
might
have
cause
to
regret
it
later
if
she
refused
to
see
him
now
i
plunged
headlong
he
described
it
afterwards
the
maid
gazing
at
him
in
amazement
went
to
take
his
message
again
madame
hohlakov
was
impressed
she
thought
a
little
asked
what
he
looked
like
and
learned
that
he
was
very
well
dressed
young
and
so
polite
we
may
note
parenthetically
that
pyotr
ilyitch
was
a
rather
goodlooking
young
man
and
well
aware
of
the
fact
madame
hohlakov
made
up
her
mind
to
see
him
she
was
in
her
dressinggown
and
slippers
but
she
flung
a
black
shawl
over
her
shoulders
the
official
was
asked
to
walk
into
the
drawingroom
the
very
room
in
which
mitya
had
been
received
shortly
before
the
lady
came
to
meet
her
visitor
with
a
sternly
inquiring
countenance
and
without
asking
him
to
sit
down
began
at
once
with
the
question
what
do
you
want
i
have
ventured
to
disturb
you
madam
on
a
matter
concerning
our
common
acquaintance
dmitri
fyodorovitch
karamazov
perhotin
began
but
he
had
hardly
uttered
the
name
when
the
ladys
face
showed
signs
of
acute
irritation
she
almost
shrieked
and
interrupted
him
in
a
fury
how
much
longer
am
i
to
be
worried
by
that
awful
man
she
cried
hysterically
how
dare
you
sir
how
could
you
venture
to
disturb
a
lady
who
is
a
stranger
to
you
in
her
own
house
at
such
an
hour
and
to
force
yourself
upon
her
to
talk
of
a
man
who
came
here
to
this
very
drawingroom
only
three
hours
ago
to
murder
me
and
went
stamping
out
of
the
room
as
no
one
would
go
out
of
a
decent
house
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
i
shall
lodge
a
complaint
against
you
that
i
will
not
let
it
pass
kindly
leave
me
at
once
i
am
a
mother
i

i
murder
then
he
tried
to
murder
you
too
why
has
he
killed
somebody
else
madame
hohlakov
asked
impulsively
if
you
would
kindly
listen
madam
for
half
a
moment
ill
explain
it
all
in
a
couple
of
words
answered
perhotin
firmly
at
five
oclock
this
afternoon
dmitri
fyodorovitch
borrowed
ten
roubles
from
me
and
i
know
for
a
fact
he
had
no
money
yet
at
nine
oclock
he
came
to
see
me
with
a
bundle
of
hundredrouble
notes
in
his
hand
about
two
or
three
thousand
roubles
his
hands
and
face
were
all
covered
with
blood
and
he
looked
like
a
madman
when
i
asked
him
where
he
had
got
so
much
money
he
answered
that
he
had
just
received
it
from
you
that
you
had
given
him
a
sum
of
three
thousand
to
go
to
the
goldmines
madame
hohlakovs
face
assumed
an
expression
of
intense
and
painful
excitement
good
god
he
must
have
killed
his
old
father
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
i
have
never
given
him
money
never
oh
run
run
dont
say
another
word
save
the
old
man

run
to
his
father

run
excuse
me
madam
then
you
did
not
give
him
money
you
remember
for
a
fact
that
you
did
not
give
him
any
money
no
i
didnt
i
didnt
i
refused
to
give
it
him
for
he
could
not
appreciate
it
he
ran
out
in
a
fury
stamping
he
rushed
at
me
but
i
slipped
away
and
let
me
tell
you
as
i
wish
to
hide
nothing
from
you
now
that
he
positively
spat
at
me
can
you
fancy
that
but
why
are
we
standing
ah
sit
down
excuse
me
i
or
better
run
run
you
must
run
and
save
the
poor
old
man
from
an
awful
death
but
if
he
has
killed
him
already
ah
good
heavens
yes
then
what
are
we
to
do
now
what
do
you
think
we
must
do
now
meantime
she
had
made
pyotr
ilyitch
sit
down
and
sat
down
herself
facing
him
briefly
but
fairly
clearly
pyotr
ilyitch
told
her
the
history
of
the
affair
that
part
of
it
at
least
which
he
had
himself
witnessed
he
described
too
his
visit
to
fenya
and
told
her
about
the
pestle
all
these
details
produced
an
overwhelming
effect
on
the
distracted
lady
who
kept
uttering
shrieks
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
would
you
believe
it
i
foresaw
all
this
i
have
that
special
faculty
whatever
i
imagine
comes
to
pass
and
how
often
ive
looked
at
that
awful
man
and
always
thought
that
man
will
end
by
murdering
me
and
now
its
happened

that
is
if
he
hasnt
murdered
me
but
only
his
own
father
its
only
because
the
finger
of
god
preserved
me
and
whats
more
he
was
ashamed
to
murder
me
because
in
this
very
place
i
put
the
holy
ikon
from
the
relics
of
the
holy
martyr
saint
varvara
on
his
neck
and
to
think
how
near
i
was
to
death
at
that
minute
i
went
close
up
to
him
and
he
stretched
out
his
neck
to
me
do
you
know
pyotr
ilyitch
i
think
you
said
your
name
was
pyotr
ilyitch
i
dont
believe
in
miracles
but
that
ikon
and
this
unmistakable
miracle
with
me
nowthat
shakes
me
and
im
ready
to
believe
in
anything
you
like
have
you
heard
about
father
zossima
but
i
dont
know
what
im
saying

and
only
fancy
with
the
ikon
on
his
neck
he
spat
at
me
he
only
spat
its
true
he
didnt
murder
me
and

he
dashed
away
but
what
shall
we
do
what
must
we
do
now
what
do
you
think
pyotr
ilyitch
got
up
and
announced
that
he
was
going
straight
to
the
police
captain
to
tell
him
all
about
it
and
leave
him
to
do
what
he
thought
fit
oh
hes
an
excellent
man
excellent
mihail
makarovitch
i
know
him
of
course
hes
the
person
to
go
to
how
practical
you
are
pyotr
ilyitch
how
well
youve
thought
of
everything
i
should
never
have
thought
of
it
in
your
place
especially
as
i
know
the
police
captain
very
well
too
observed
pyotr
ilyitch
who
still
continued
to
stand
and
was
obviously
anxious
to
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
impulsive
lady
who
would
not
let
him
say
goodby
and
go
away
and
be
sure
be
sure
she
prattled
on
to
come
back
and
tell
me
what
you
see
there
and
what
you
find
out

what
comes
to
light

how
theyll
try
him

and
what
hes
condemned
to
tell
me
we
have
no
capital
punishment
have
we
but
be
sure

shant
sleep
but
wait
hadnt
i
better

with
you

but
if
you
would
write
three
lines
with
your
own
hand
stating
that
you
did
not
give
dmitri
fyodorovitch
money
it
might
perhaps
be
of
use

in
case
its
needed
to
be
sure
madame
hohlakov
skipped
delighted
to
her
bureau
and
you
know
im
simply
struck
amazed
at
your
resourcefulness
your
good
sense
in
such
affairs

you
in
the
service
here
im
delighted
to
think
that
youre
in
the
service
here
and
still
speaking
she
scribbled
on
half
a
sheet
of
notepaper
the
following
lines
ive
never
in
my
life
lent
to
that
unhappy
man
dmitri
fyodorovitch
karamazov
for

spite
of
all
he
is
unhappy

thousand
roubles
today
ive
never
given
him
money
never
that
i
swear
by
all
thats
holy
k
hohlakov
heres
the
note
she
turned
quickly
to
pyotr
ilyitch
go
save
him
its
a
noble
deed
on
your
part
and
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
three
times
over
him
she
ran
out
to
accompany
him
to
the
passage
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
you
cant
think
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
having
come
to
me
first
how
is
it
i
havent
met
you
before
i
shall
feel
flattered
at
seeing
you
at
my
house
in
the
future
how
delightful
it
is
that
you
are
living
here
such
precision
such
practical
ability
they
must
appreciate
you
they
must
understand
you
if
theres
anything
i
can
do
believe
me

oh
i
love
young
people
im
in
love
with
young
people
the
younger
generation
are
the
one
prop
of
our
suffering
country
her
one
hope
oh
go
go
but
pyotr
ilyitch
had
already
run
away
or
she
would
not
have
let
him
go
so
soon
yet
madame
hohlakov
had
made
a
rather
agreeable
impression
on
him
which
had
somewhat
softened
his
anxiety
at
being
drawn
into
such
an
unpleasant
affair
tastes
differ
as
we
all
know
shes
by
no
means
so
elderly
he
thought
feeling
pleased
on
the
contrary
i
should
have
taken
her
for
her
daughter
as
for
madame
hohlakov
she
was
simply
enchanted
by
the
young
man
such
sense
such
exactness
in
so
young
a
man
in
our
day
and
all
that
with
such
manners
and
appearance
people
say
the
young
people
of
today
are
no
good
for
anything
but
heres
an
example
etc
so
she
simply
forgot
this
dreadful
affair
and
it
was
only
as
she
was
getting
into
bed
that
suddenly
recalling
how
near
death
she
had
been
she
exclaimed
ah
it
is
awful
awful
but
she
fell
at
once
into
a
sound
sweet
sleep
i
would
not
however
have
dwelt
on
such
trivial
and
irrelevant
details
if
this
eccentric
meeting
of
the
young
official
with
the
by
no
means
elderly
widow
had
not
subsequently
turned
out
to
be
the
foundation
of
the
whole
career
of
that
practical
and
precise
young
man
his
story
is
remembered
to
this
day
with
amazement
in
our
town
and
i
shall
perhaps
have
something
to
say
about
it
when
i
have
finished
my
long
history
of
the
brothers
karamazov
chapter
ii
the
alarm
our
police
captain
mihail
makarovitch
makarov
a
retired
lieutenant
colonel
was
a
widower
and
an
excellent
man
he
had
only
come
to
us
three
years
previously
but
had
won
general
esteem
chiefly
because
he
knew
how
to
keep
society
together
he
was
never
without
visitors
and
could
not
have
got
on
without
them
some
one
or
other
was
always
dining
with
him
he
never
sat
down
to
table
without
guests
he
gave
regular
dinners
too
on
all
sorts
of
occasions
sometimes
most
surprising
ones
though
the
fare
was
not
recherch
it
was
abundant
the
fishpies
were
excellent
and
the
wine
made
up
in
quantity
for
what
it
lacked
in
quality
the
first
room
his
guests
entered
was
a
wellfitted
billiardroom
with
pictures
of
english
racehorses
in
black
frames
on
the
walls
an
essential
decoration
as
we
all
know
for
a
bachelors
billiardroom
there
was
cardplaying
every
evening
at
his
house
if
only
at
one
table
but
at
frequent
intervals
all
the
society
of
our
town
with
the
mammas
and
young
ladies
assembled
at
his
house
to
dance
though
mihail
makarovitch
was
a
widower
he
did
not
live
alone
his
widowed
daughter
lived
with
him
with
her
two
unmarried
daughters
grownup
girls
who
had
finished
their
education
they
were
of
agreeable
appearance
and
lively
character
and
though
every
one
knew
they
would
have
no
dowry
they
attracted
all
the
young
men
of
fashion
to
their
grandfathers
house
mihail
makarovitch
was
by
no
means
very
efficient
in
his
work
though
he
performed
his
duties
no
worse
than
many
others
to
speak
plainly
he
was
a
man
of
rather
narrow
education
his
understanding
of
the
limits
of
his
administrative
power
could
not
always
be
relied
upon
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
failed
to
grasp
certain
reforms
enacted
during
the
present
reign
as
that
he
made
conspicuous
blunders
in
his
interpretation
of
them
this
was
not
from
any
special
lack
of
intelligence
but
from
carelessness
for
he
was
always
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
go
into
the
subject
i
have
the
heart
of
a
soldier
rather
than
of
a
civilian
he
used
to
say
of
himself
he
had
not
even
formed
a
definite
idea
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
reforms
connected
with
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
and
only
picked
it
up
so
to
speak
from
year
to
year
involuntarily
increasing
his
knowledge
by
practice
and
yet
he
was
himself
a
landowner
pyotr
ilyitch
knew
for
certain
that
he
would
meet
some
of
mihail
makarovitchs
visitors
there
that
evening
but
he
didnt
know
which
as
it
happened
at
that
moment
the
prosecutor
and
varvinsky
our
district
doctor
a
young
man
who
had
only
just
come
to
us
from
petersburg
after
taking
a
brilliant
degree
at
the
academy
of
medicine
were
playing
whist
at
the
police
captains
ippolit
kirillovitch
the
prosecutor
he
was
really
the
deputy
prosecutor
but
we
always
called
him
the
prosecutor
was
rather
a
peculiar
man
of
about
five
and
thirty
inclined
to
be
consumptive
and
married
to
a
fat
and
childless
woman
he
was
vain
and
irritable
though
he
had
a
good
intellect
and
even
a
kind
heart
it
seemed
that
all
that
was
wrong
with
him
was
that
he
had
a
better
opinion
of
himself
than
his
ability
warranted
and
that
made
him
seem
constantly
uneasy
he
had
moreover
certain
higher
even
artistic
leanings
towards
psychology
for
instance
a
special
study
of
the
human
heart
a
special
knowledge
of
the
criminal
and
his
crime
he
cherished
a
grievance
on
this
ground
considering
that
he
had
been
passed
over
in
the
service
and
being
firmly
persuaded
that
in
higher
spheres
he
had
not
been
properly
appreciated
and
had
enemies
in
gloomy
moments
he
even
threatened
to
give
up
his
post
and
practice
as
a
barrister
in
criminal
cases
the
unexpected
karamazov
case
agitated
him
profoundly
it
was
a
case
that
might
well
be
talked
about
all
over
russia
but
i
am
anticipating
nikolay
parfenovitch
nelyudov
the
young
investigating
lawyer
who
had
only
come
from
petersburg
two
months
before
was
sitting
in
the
next
room
with
the
young
ladies
people
talked
about
it
afterwards
and
wondered
that
all
the
gentlemen
should
as
though
intentionally
on
the
evening
of
the
crime
have
been
gathered
together
at
the
house
of
the
executive
authority
yet
it
was
perfectly
simple
and
happened
quite
naturally
ippolit
kirillovitchs
wife
had
had
toothache
for
the
last
two
days
and
he
was
obliged
to
go
out
to
escape
from
her
groans
the
doctor
from
the
very
nature
of
his
being
could
not
spend
an
evening
except
at
cards
nikolay
parfenovitch
nelyudov
had
been
intending
for
three
days
past
to
drop
in
that
evening
at
mihail
makarovitchs
so
to
speak
casually
so
as
slyly
to
startle
the
eldest
granddaughter
olga
mihailovna
by
showing
that
he
knew
her
secret
that
he
knew
it
was
her
birthday
and
that
she
was
trying
to
conceal
it
on
purpose
so
as
not
to
be
obliged
to
give
a
dance
he
anticipated
a
great
deal
of
merriment
many
playful
jests
about
her
age
and
her
being
afraid
to
reveal
it
about
his
knowing
her
secret
and
telling
everybody
and
so
on
the
charming
young
man
was
a
great
adept
at
such
teasing
the
ladies
had
christened
him
the
naughty
man
and
he
seemed
to
be
delighted
at
the
name
he
was
extremely
wellbred
however
of
good
family
education
and
feelings
and
though
leading
a
life
of
pleasure
his
sallies
were
always
innocent
and
in
good
taste
he
was
short
and
delicatelooking
on
his
white
slender
little
fingers
he
always
wore
a
number
of
big
glittering
rings
when
he
was
engaged
in
his
official
duties
he
always
became
extraordinarily
grave
as
though
realizing
his
position
and
the
sanctity
of
the
obligations
laid
upon
him
he
had
a
special
gift
for
mystifying
murderers
and
other
criminals
of
the
peasant
class
during
interrogation
and
if
he
did
not
win
their
respect
he
certainly
succeeded
in
arousing
their
wonder
pyotr
ilyitch
was
simply
dumbfounded
when
he
went
into
the
police
captains
he
saw
instantly
that
every
one
knew
they
had
positively
thrown
down
their
cards
all
were
standing
up
and
talking
even
nikolay
parfenovitch
had
left
the
young
ladies
and
run
in
looking
strenuous
and
ready
for
action
pyotr
ilyitch
was
met
with
the
astounding
news
that
old
fyodor
pavlovitch
really
had
been
murdered
that
evening
in
his
own
house
murdered
and
robbed
the
news
had
only
just
reached
them
in
the
following
manner
marfa
ignatyevna
the
wife
of
old
grigory
who
had
been
knocked
senseless
near
the
fence
was
sleeping
soundly
in
her
bed
and
might
well
have
slept
till
morning
after
the
draught
she
had
taken
but
all
of
a
sudden
she
waked
up
no
doubt
roused
by
a
fearful
epileptic
scream
from
smerdyakov
who
was
lying
in
the
next
room
unconscious
that
scream
always
preceded
his
fits
and
always
terrified
and
upset
marfa
ignatyevna
she
could
never
get
accustomed
to
it
she
jumped
up
and
ran
halfawake
to
smerdyakovs
room
but
it
was
dark
there
and
she
could
only
hear
the
invalid
beginning
to
gasp
and
struggle
then
marfa
ignatyevna
herself
screamed
out
and
was
going
to
call
her
husband
but
suddenly
realized
that
when
she
had
got
up
he
was
not
beside
her
in
bed
she
ran
back
to
the
bedstead
and
began
groping
with
her
hands
but
the
bed
was
really
empty
then
he
must
have
gone
outwhere
she
ran
to
the
steps
and
timidly
called
him
she
got
no
answer
of
course
but
she
caught
the
sound
of
groans
far
away
in
the
garden
in
the
darkness
she
listened
the
groans
were
repeated
and
it
was
evident
they
came
from
the
garden
good
lord
just
as
it
was
with
lizaveta
smerdyastchaya
she
thought
distractedly
she
went
timidly
down
the
steps
and
saw
that
the
gate
into
the
garden
was
open
he
must
be
out
there
poor
dear
she
thought
she
went
up
to
the
gate
and
all
at
once
she
distinctly
heard
grigory
calling
her
by
name
marfa
marfa
in
a
weak
moaning
dreadful
voice
lord
preserve
us
from
harm
marfa
ignatyevna
murmured
and
ran
towards
the
voice
and
that
was
how
she
found
grigory
but
she
found
him
not
by
the
fence
where
he
had
been
knocked
down
but
about
twenty
paces
off
it
appeared
later
that
he
had
crawled
away
on
coming
to
himself
and
probably
had
been
a
long
time
getting
so
far
losing
consciousness
several
times
she
noticed
at
once
that
he
was
covered
with
blood
and
screamed
at
the
top
of
her
voice
grigory
was
muttering
incoherently
he
has
murdered

his
father
murdered
why
scream
silly

run

fetch
some
one
but
marfa
continued
screaming
and
seeing
that
her
masters
window
was
open
and
that
there
was
a
candle
alight
in
the
window
she
ran
there
and
began
calling
fyodor
pavlovitch
but
peeping
in
at
the
window
she
saw
a
fearful
sight
her
master
was
lying
on
his
back
motionless
on
the
floor
his
lightcolored
dressinggown
and
white
shirt
were
soaked
with
blood
the
candle
on
the
table
brightly
lighted
up
the
blood
and
the
motionless
dead
face
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
terrorstricken
marfa
rushed
away
from
the
window
ran
out
of
the
garden
drew
the
bolt
of
the
big
gate
and
ran
headlong
by
the
back
way
to
the
neighbor
marya
kondratyevna
both
mother
and
daughter
were
asleep
but
they
waked
up
at
marfas
desperate
and
persistent
screaming
and
knocking
at
the
shutter
marfa
shrieking
and
screaming
incoherently
managed
to
tell
them
the
main
fact
and
to
beg
for
assistance
it
happened
that
foma
had
come
back
from
his
wanderings
and
was
staying
the
night
with
them
they
got
him
up
immediately
and
all
three
ran
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
on
the
way
marya
kondratyevna
remembered
that
at
about
eight
oclock
she
heard
a
dreadful
scream
from
their
garden
and
this
was
no
doubt
grigorys
scream
parricide
uttered
when
he
caught
hold
of
mityas
leg
some
one
person
screamed
out
and
then
was
silent
marya
kondratyevna
explained
as
she
ran
running
to
the
place
where
grigory
lay
the
two
women
with
the
help
of
foma
carried
him
to
the
lodge
they
lighted
a
candle
and
saw
that
smerdyakov
was
no
better
that
he
was
writhing
in
convulsions
his
eyes
fixed
in
a
squint
and
that
foam
was
flowing
from
his
lips
they
moistened
grigorys
forehead
with
water
mixed
with
vinegar
and
the
water
revived
him
at
once
he
asked
immediately
is
the
master
murdered
then
foma
and
both
the
women
ran
to
the
house
and
saw
this
time
that
not
only
the
window
but
also
the
door
into
the
garden
was
wide
open
though
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
for
the
last
week
locked
himself
in
every
night
and
did
not
allow
even
grigory
to
come
in
on
any
pretext
seeing
that
door
open
they
were
afraid
to
go
in
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
fear
anything
should
happen
afterwards
and
when
they
returned
to
grigory
the
old
man
told
them
to
go
straight
to
the
police
captain
marya
kondratyevna
ran
there
and
gave
the
alarm
to
the
whole
party
at
the
police
captains
she
arrived
only
five
minutes
before
pyotr
ilyitch
so
that
his
story
came
not
as
his
own
surmise
and
theory
but
as
the
direct
confirmation
by
a
witness
of
the
theory
held
by
all
as
to
the
identity
of
the
criminal
a
theory
he
had
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
refused
to
believe
till
that
moment
it
was
resolved
to
act
with
energy
the
deputy
police
inspector
of
the
town
was
commissioned
to
take
four
witnesses
to
enter
fyodor
pavlovitchs
house
and
there
to
open
an
inquiry
on
the
spot
according
to
the
regular
forms
which
i
will
not
go
into
here
the
district
doctor
a
zealous
man
new
to
his
work
almost
insisted
on
accompanying
the
police
captain
the
prosecutor
and
the
investigating
lawyer
i
will
note
briefly
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
found
to
be
quite
dead
with
his
skull
battered
in
but
with
what
most
likely
with
the
same
weapon
with
which
grigory
had
been
attacked
and
immediately
that
weapon
was
found
grigory
to
whom
all
possible
medical
assistance
was
at
once
given
described
in
a
weak
and
breaking
voice
how
he
had
been
knocked
down
they
began
looking
with
a
lantern
by
the
fence
and
found
the
brass
pestle
dropped
in
a
most
conspicuous
place
on
the
garden
path
there
were
no
signs
of
disturbance
in
the
room
where
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
lying
but
by
the
bed
behind
the
screen
they
picked
up
from
the
floor
a
big
and
thick
envelope
with
the
inscription
a
present
of
three
thousand
roubles
for
my
angel
grushenka
if
she
is
willing
to
come
and
below
had
been
added
by
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
my
little
chicken
there
were
three
seals
of
red
sealingwax
on
the
envelope
but
it
had
been
torn
open
and
was
empty
the
money
had
been
removed
they
found
also
on
the
floor
a
piece
of
narrow
pink
ribbon
with
which
the
envelope
had
been
tied
up
one
piece
of
pyotr
ilyitchs
evidence
made
a
great
impression
on
the
prosecutor
and
the
investigating
magistrate
namely
his
idea
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
would
shoot
himself
before
daybreak
that
he
had
resolved
to
do
so
had
spoken
of
it
to
ilyitch
had
taken
the
pistols
loaded
them
before
him
written
a
letter
put
it
in
his
pocket
etc
when
pyotr
ilyitch
though
still
unwilling
to
believe
in
it
threatened
to
tell
some
one
so
as
to
prevent
the
suicide
mitya
had
answered
grinning
youll
be
too
late
so
they
must
make
haste
to
mokroe
to
find
the
criminal
before
he
really
did
shoot
himself
thats
clear
thats
clear
repeated
the
prosecutor
in
great
excitement
thats
just
the
way
with
mad
fellows
like
that
i
shall
kill
myself
to
morrow
so
ill
make
merry
till
i
die

the
story
of
how
he
had
bought
the
wine
and
provisions
excited
the
prosecutor
more
than
ever
do
you
remember
the
fellow
that
murdered
a
merchant
called
olsufyev
gentlemen
he
stole
fifteen
hundred
went
at
once
to
have
his
hair
curled
and
then
without
even
hiding
the
money
carrying
it
almost
in
his
hand
in
the
same
way
he
went
off
to
the
girls
all
were
delayed
however
by
the
inquiry
the
search
and
the
formalities
etc
in
the
house
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
it
all
took
time
and
so
two
hours
before
starting
they
sent
on
ahead
to
mokroe
the
officer
of
the
rural
police
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
schmertsov
who
had
arrived
in
the
town
the
morning
before
to
get
his
pay
he
was
instructed
to
avoid
raising
the
alarm
when
he
reached
mokroe
but
to
keep
constant
watch
over
the
criminal
till
the
arrival
of
the
proper
authorities
to
procure
also
witnesses
for
the
arrest
police
constables
and
so
on
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
did
as
he
was
told
preserving
his
incognito
and
giving
no
one
but
his
old
acquaintance
trifon
borissovitch
the
slightest
hint
of
his
secret
business
he
had
spoken
to
him
just
before
mitya
met
the
landlord
in
the
balcony
looking
for
him
in
the
dark
and
noticed
at
once
a
change
in
trifon
borissovitchs
face
and
voice
so
neither
mitya
nor
any
one
else
knew
that
he
was
being
watched
the
box
with
the
pistols
had
been
carried
off
by
trifon
borissovitch
and
put
in
a
suitable
place
only
after
four
oclock
almost
at
sunrise
all
the
officials
the
police
captain
the
prosecutor
the
investigating
lawyer
drove
up
in
two
carriages
each
drawn
by
three
horses
the
doctor
remained
at
fyodor
pavlovitchs
to
make
a
postmortem
next
day
on
the
body
but
he
was
particularly
interested
in
the
condition
of
the
servant
smerdyakov
such
violent
and
protracted
epileptic
fits
recurring
continually
for
twentyfour
hours
are
rarely
to
be
met
with
and
are
of
interest
to
science
he
declared
enthusiastically
to
his
companions
and
as
they
left
they
laughingly
congratulated
him
on
his
find
the
prosecutor
and
the
investigating
lawyer
distinctly
remembered
the
doctors
saying
that
smerdyakov
could
not
outlive
the
night
after
these
long
but
i
think
necessary
explanations
we
will
return
to
that
moment
of
our
tale
at
which
we
broke
off
chapter
iii
the
sufferings
of
a
soul
the
first
ordeal
and
so
mitya
sat
looking
wildly
at
the
people
round
him
not
understanding
what
was
said
to
him
suddenly
he
got
up
flung
up
his
hands
and
shouted
aloud
im
not
guilty
im
not
guilty
of
that
blood
im
not
guilty
of
my
fathers
blood
i
meant
to
kill
him
but
im
not
guilty
not
i
but
he
had
hardly
said
this
before
grushenka
rushed
from
behind
the
curtain
and
flung
herself
at
the
police
captains
feet
it
was
my
fault
mine
my
wickedness
she
cried
in
a
heartrending
voice
bathed
in
tears
stretching
out
her
clasped
hands
towards
them
he
did
it
through
me
i
tortured
him
and
drove
him
to
it
i
tortured
that
poor
old
man
thats
dead
too
in
my
wickedness
and
brought
him
to
this
its
my
fault
mine
first
mine
most
my
fault
yes
its
your
fault
youre
the
chief
criminal
you
fury
you
harlot
youre
the
most
to
blame
shouted
the
police
captain
threatening
her
with
his
hand
but
he
was
quickly
and
resolutely
suppressed
the
prosecutor
positively
seized
hold
of
him
this
is
absolutely
irregular
mihail
makarovitch
he
cried
you
are
positively
hindering
the
inquiry
youre
ruining
the
case
he
almost
gasped
follow
the
regular
course
follow
the
regular
course
cried
nikolay
parfenovitch
fearfully
excited
too
otherwise
its
absolutely
impossible
judge
us
together
grushenka
cried
frantically
still
kneeling
punish
us
together
i
will
go
with
him
now
if
its
to
death
grusha
my
life
my
blood
my
holy
one
mitya
fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
and
held
her
tight
in
his
arms
dont
believe
her
he
cried
shes
not
guilty
of
anything
of
any
blood
of
anything
he
remembered
afterwards
that
he
was
forcibly
dragged
away
from
her
by
several
men
and
that
she
was
led
out
and
that
when
he
recovered
himself
he
was
sitting
at
the
table
beside
him
and
behind
him
stood
the
men
with
metal
plates
facing
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
sat
nikolay
parfenovitch
the
investigating
lawyer
he
kept
persuading
him
to
drink
a
little
water
out
of
a
glass
that
stood
on
the
table
that
will
refresh
you
that
will
calm
you
be
calm
dont
be
frightened
he
added
extremely
politely
mitya
he
remembered
it
afterwards
became
suddenly
intensely
interested
in
his
big
rings
one
with
an
amethyst
and
another
with
a
transparent
bright
yellow
stone
of
great
brilliance
and
long
afterwards
he
remembered
with
wonder
how
those
rings
had
riveted
his
attention
through
all
those
terrible
hours
of
interrogation
so
that
he
was
utterly
unable
to
tear
himself
away
from
them
and
dismiss
them
as
things
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
position
on
mityas
left
side
in
the
place
where
maximov
had
been
sitting
at
the
beginning
of
the
evening
the
prosecutor
was
now
seated
and
on
mityas
right
hand
where
grushenka
had
been
was
a
rosycheeked
young
man
in
a
sort
of
shabby
huntingjacket
with
ink
and
paper
before
him
this
was
the
secretary
of
the
investigating
lawyer
who
had
brought
him
with
him
the
police
captain
was
now
standing
by
the
window
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
beside
kalganov
who
was
sitting
there
drink
some
water
said
the
investigating
lawyer
softly
for
the
tenth
time
i
have
drunk
it

i
have

but

come
gentlemen

fate
cried
mitya
staring
with
terribly
fixed
wide
open
eyes
at
the
investigating
lawyer
so
you
positively
declare
that
you
are
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
your
father
fyodor

asked
the
investigating
lawyer
softly
but
insistently
i
am
not
guilty
i
am
guilty
of
the
blood
of
another
old
man
but

i
weep
for
it
i
killed
i
killed
the
old
man
and
knocked
him
down
but
its
hard
to
have
to
answer
for
that
murder
with
another
a
terrible
murder
of
which
i
am
not
guilty

a
terrible
accusation
gentlemen
a
knockdown
blow
but

killed
him
the
investigating
lawyer
was
beginning
but
ippolit
kirillovitch
the
prosecutor
glancing
at
him
addressed
mitya
you
need
not
worry
yourself
about
the
old
servant
grigory
vassilyevitch
he
is
alive
he
has
recovered
and
in
spite
of
the
terrible
blows
inflicted
according
to
his
own
and
your
evidence
by
you
there
seems
no
doubt
that
he
will
live
so
the
doctor
says
at
least
alive
hes
alive
cried
mitya
flinging
up
his
hands
his
face
beamed
lord
i
thank
thee
for
the
miracle
thou
has
wrought
for
me
a
sinner
and
evildoer

answer
to
my
prayer
ive
been
praying
all
night
and
he
crossed
himself
three
times
he
was
almost
breathless
so
from
this
grigory
we
have
received
such
important
evidence
concerning
you
that
the
prosecutor
would
have
continued
but
mitya
suddenly
jumped
up
from
his
chair
one
minute
gentlemen
for
gods
sake
one
minute
i
will
run
to
her
excuse
me
at
this
moment
its
quite
impossible
nikolay
parfenovitch
almost
shrieked
he
too
leapt
to
his
feet
mitya
was
seized
by
the
men
with
the
metal
plates
but
he
sat
down
of
his
own
accord
gentlemen
what
a
pity
i
wanted
to
see
her
for
one
minute
only
i
wanted
to
tell
her
that
it
has
been
washed
away
it
has
gone
that
blood
that
was
weighing
on
my
heart
all
night
and
that
i
am
not
a
murderer
now
gentlemen
she
is
my
betrothed
he
said
ecstatically
and
reverently
looking
round
at
them
all
oh
thank
you
gentlemen
oh
in
one
minute
you
have
given
me
new
life
new
heart
that
old
man
used
to
carry
me
in
his
arms
gentlemen
he
used
to
wash
me
in
the
tub
when
i
was
a
baby
three
years
old
abandoned
by
every
one
he
was
like
a
father
to
me
and
so
you
the
investigating
lawyer
began
allow
me
gentlemen
allow
me
one
minute
more
interposed
mitya
putting
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
let
me
have
a
moment
to
think
let
me
breathe
gentlemen
all
this
is
horribly
upsetting
horribly
a
man
is
not
a
drum
gentlemen
drink
a
little
more
water
murmured
nikolay
parfenovitch
mitya
took
his
hands
from
his
face
and
laughed
his
eyes
were
confident
he
seemed
completely
transformed
in
a
moment
his
whole
bearing
was
changed
he
was
once
more
the
equal
of
these
men
with
all
of
whom
he
was
acquainted
as
though
they
had
all
met
the
day
before
when
nothing
had
happened
at
some
social
gathering
we
may
note
in
passing
that
on
his
first
arrival
mitya
had
been
made
very
welcome
at
the
police
captains
but
later
during
the
last
month
especially
mitya
had
hardly
called
at
all
and
when
the
police
captain
met
him
in
the
street
for
instance
mitya
noticed
that
he
frowned
and
only
bowed
out
of
politeness
his
acquaintance
with
the
prosecutor
was
less
intimate
though
he
sometimes
paid
his
wife
a
nervous
and
fanciful
lady
visits
of
politeness
without
quite
knowing
why
and
she
always
received
him
graciously
and
had
for
some
reason
taken
an
interest
in
him
up
to
the
last
he
had
not
had
time
to
get
to
know
the
investigating
lawyer
though
he
had
met
him
and
talked
to
him
twice
each
time
about
the
fair
sex
youre
a
most
skillful
lawyer
i
see
nikolay
parfenovitch
cried
mitya
laughing
gayly
but
i
can
help
you
now
oh

like
a
new
man

and
directly

rather
drunk
too
ill
tell
you
that

and

my
kinsman

before

we
can
put
an
end
to
it
in
a
minute
cant
we
cant
we
mitya
spoke
much
and
quickly
nervously
and
effusively
as
though
he
positively
took
his
listeners
to
be
his
best
friends
so
for
the
present
we
will
write
that
you
absolutely
deny
the
charge
brought
against
you
said
nikolay
parfenovitch
impressively
and
bending
down
to
the
secretary
he
dictated
to
him
in
an
undertone
what
to
write

it
down

to
write
that
down

and

bottom
of
my
heart
of
which
i
am
guilty
toobut
that

he
turned
suddenly
to
the
secretary
thats
my
personal
life

that
doesnt
concern
you
the
bottom
of
my

that
and

your
suspicion

calm
dmitri
fyodorovitch
said
the
investigating
lawyer
evidently
trying
to
allay
mityas
excitement
by
his
own
composure
before
we
go
on
with
our
inquiry
i
should
like
if
you
will
consent
to
answer
to
hear
you
confirm
the
statement
that
you
disliked
your
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
that
you
were
involved
in
continual
disputes
with
him
here
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
you
exclaimed
that
you
wanted
to
kill
him
i
didnt
kill
him
you
said
but
i
wanted
to
kill
him

did
i
exclaim
that
ach
that
may
be
so
gentlemen
yes
unhappily
i
did
want
to
kill
him

many
times
i
wanted
to

unhappily
unhappily
you
wanted
to
would
you
consent
to
explain
what
motives
precisely
led
you
to
such
a
sentiment
of
hatred
for
your
parent
what
is
there
to
explain
gentlemen
mitya
shrugged
his
shoulders
sullenly
looking
down
i
have
never
concealed
my
feelings
all
the
town
knows
about
itevery
one
knows
in
the
tavern
only
lately
i
declared
them
in
father
zossimas
cell
and
the
very
same
day
in
the
evening
i
beat
my
father
i
nearly
killed
him
and
i
swore
id
come
again
and
kill
him
before
witnesses
oh
a
thousand
witnesses
ive
been
shouting
it
aloud
for
the
last
month
any
one
can
tell
you
that
the
fact
stares
you
in
the
face
it
speaks
for
itself
it
cries
aloud
but
feelings
gentlemen
feelings
are
another
matter
you
see
gentlemenmitya
frownedit
seems
to
me
that
about
feelings
youve
no
right
to
question
me
i
know
that
you
are
bound
by
your
office
i
quite
understand
that
but
thats
my
affair
my
private
intimate
affair
yet

since
i
havent
concealed
my
feelings
in
the
past

in
the
tavern
for
instance
ive
talked
to
every
one
so

so
i
wont
make
a
secret
of
it
now
you
see
i
understand
gentlemen
that
there
are
terrible
facts
against
me
in
this
business
i
told
every
one
that
id
kill
him
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
hes
been
killed
so
it
must
have
been
me
ha
ha
i
can
make
allowances
for
you
gentlemen
i
can
quite
make
allowances
im
struck
all
of
a
heap
myself
for
who
can
have
murdered
him
if
not
i
thats
what
it
comes
to
isnt
it
if
not
i
who
can
it
be
who
gentlemen
i
want
to
know
i
insist
on
knowing
he
exclaimed
suddenly
where
was
he
murdered
how
was
he
murdered
how
and
with
what
tell
me
he
asked
quickly
looking
at
the
two
lawyers
we
found
him
in
his
study
lying
on
his
back
on
the
floor
with
his
head
battered
in
said
the
prosecutor
thats
horrible
mitya
shuddered
and
putting
his
elbows
on
the
table
hid
his
face
in
his
right
hand
we
will
continue
interposed
nikolay
parfenovitch
so
what
was
it
that
impelled
you
to
this
sentiment
of
hatred
you
have
asserted
in
public
i
believe
that
it
was
based
upon
jealousy
well
yes
jealousy
and
not
only
jealousy
disputes
about
money
yes
about
money
too
there
was
a
dispute
about
three
thousand
roubles
i
think
which
you
claimed
as
part
of
your
inheritance
three
thousand
more
more
cried
mitya
hotly
more
than
six
thousand
more
than
ten
perhaps
i
told
every
one
so
shouted
it
at
them
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
let
it
go
at
three
thousand
i
was
desperately
in
need
of
that
three
thousand

so
the
bundle
of
notes
for
three
thousand
that
i
knew
he
kept
under
his
pillow
ready
for
grushenka
i
considered
as
simply
stolen
from
me
yes
gentlemen
i
looked
upon
it
as
mine
as
my
own
property
the
prosecutor
looked
significantly
at
the
investigating
lawyer
and
had
time
to
wink
at
him
on
the
sly
we
will
return
to
that
subject
later
said
the
lawyer
promptly
you
will
allow
us
to
note
that
point
and
write
it
down
that
you
looked
upon
that
money
as
your
own
property
write
it
down
by
all
means
i
know
thats
another
fact
that
tells
against
me
but
im
not
afraid
of
facts
and
i
tell
them
against
myself
do
you
hear
do
you
know
gentlemen
you
take
me
for
a
different
sort
of
man
from
what
i
am
he
added
suddenly
gloomy
and
dejected
you
have
to
deal
with
a
man
of
honor
a
man
of
the
highest
honor
above
alldont
lose
sight
of
ita
man
whos
done
a
lot
of
nasty
things
but
has
always
been
and
still
is
honorable
at
bottom
in
his
inner
being
i
dont
know
how
to
express
it
thats
just
whats
made
me
wretched
all
my
life
that
i
yearned
to
be
honorable
that
i
was
so
to
say
a
martyr
to
a
sense
of
honor
seeking
for
it
with
a
lantern
with
the
lantern
of
diogenes
and
yet
all
my
life
ive
been
doing
filthy
things
like
all
of
us
gentlemen

that
is
like
me
alone
that
was
a
mistake
like
me
alone
me
alone
gentlemen
my
head
aches

his
brows
contracted
with
pain
you
see
gentlemen
i
couldnt
bear
the
look
of
him
there
was
something
in
him
ignoble
impudent
trampling
on
everything
sacred
something
sneering
and
irreverent
loathsome
loathsome
but
now
that
hes
dead
i
feel
differently
how
do
you
mean
i
dont
feel
differently
but
i
wish
i
hadnt
hated
him
so
you
feel
penitent
no
not
penitent
dont
write
that
im
not
much
good
myself
im
not
very
beautiful
so
i
had
no
right
to
consider
him
repulsive
thats
what
i
mean
write
that
down
if
you
like
saying
this
mitya
became
very
mournful
he
had
grown
more
and
more
gloomy
as
the
inquiry
continued
at
that
moment
another
unexpected
scene
followed
though
grushenka
had
been
removed
she
had
not
been
taken
far
away
only
into
the
room
next
but
one
from
the
blue
room
in
which
the
examination
was
proceeding
it
was
a
little
room
with
one
window
next
beyond
the
large
room
in
which
they
had
danced
and
feasted
so
lavishly
she
was
sitting
there
with
no
one
by
her
but
maximov
who
was
terribly
depressed
terribly
scared
and
clung
to
her
side
as
though
for
security
at
their
door
stood
one
of
the
peasants
with
a
metal
plate
on
his
breast
grushenka
was
crying
and
suddenly
her
grief
was
too
much
for
her
she
jumped
up
flung
up
her
arms
and
with
a
loud
wail
of
sorrow
rushed
out
of
the
room
to
him
to
her
mitya
and
so
unexpectedly
that
they
had
not
time
to
stop
her
mitya
hearing
her
cry
trembled
jumped
up
and
with
a
yell
rushed
impetuously
to
meet
her
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
come
together
though
they
saw
one
another
he
was
seized
by
the
arms
he
struggled
and
tried
to
tear
himself
away
it
took
three
or
four
men
to
hold
him
she
was
seized
too
and
he
saw
her
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
crying
aloud
as
they
carried
her
away
when
the
scene
was
over
he
came
to
himself
again
sitting
in
the
same
place
as
before
opposite
the
investigating
lawyer
and
crying
out
to
them
what
do
you
want
with
her
why
do
you
torment
her
shes
done
nothing
nothing
the
lawyers
tried
to
soothe
him
about
ten
minutes
passed
like
this
at
last
mihail
makarovitch
who
had
been
absent
came
hurriedly
into
the
room
and
said
in
a
loud
and
excited
voice
to
the
prosecutor
shes
been
removed

downstairs

dmitri
fyodorovitch
my
dear
fellow
began
the
police
captain
and
there
was
a
look
of
warm
almost
fatherly
feeling
for
the
luckless
prisoner
on
his
excited
face
i
took
your
agrafena
alexandrovna
downstairs
myself
and
confided
her
to

care
of
the
landlords
daughters
and
that
old
fellow
maximov

the
time

i
soothed
her

soothed
and
calmed
her
i
impressed
on
her
that
you
have
to
clear
yourself
so
she
mustnt
hinder
you
must
not
depress
you
or
you
may
lose
your
head
and
say
the
wrong
thing
in
your
evidence
in
fact
i
talked
to
her
and
she
understood
shes
a
sensible
girl
my
boy

goodhearted
girl
she
would
have
kissed
my
old
hands

sent
me
herself
to

worry
about
her
and
i

or

the
goodnatured
police
captain
said
a
great
deal
that
was
irregular
but
grushenkas
suffering
a
fellow
creatures
suffering

his
good
natured
heart
and

gentlemen
he
said

to

two
lawyers

whole
soul

that
woman

the
queen

with
honorable
men
she

my
light
she

my
holy
one
and
if
only
you
knew
did
you
hear
her
cry
ill

to
death
with

and
what
have
i
a
penniless
beggar
done
for
her
why
such
love
for
me
how
can
a
clumsy
ugly
brute
like
me
with
my
ugly
face
deserve
such
love
that
she
is
ready
to
go
to
exile
with
me
and
how
she
fell
down
at
your
feet
for
my
sake
just
now
and
yet
shes
proud
and
has
done
nothing
how
can
i
help
adoring
her
how
can
i
help
crying
out
and
rushing
to
her
as
i
did
just
now
gentlemen
forgive
me
but
now
now
i
am
comforted
and
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
burst
into
tears
but
they
were
happy
tears
he
recovered
himself
instantly
the
old
police
captain
seemed
much
pleased
and
the
lawyers
also
they
felt
that
the
examination
was
passing
into
a
new
phase
when
the
police
captain
went
out
mitya
was
positively
gay
now
gentlemen
i
am
at
your
disposal
entirely
at
your
disposal
and
if
it
were
not
for
all
these
trivial
details
we
should
understand
one
another
in
a
minute
im
at
those
details
again
im
at
your
disposal
gentlemen
but
i
declare
that
we
must
have
mutual
confidence
you
in
me
and
i
in
you
or
therell
be
no
end
to
it
i
speak
in
your
interests
to
business
gentlemen
to
business
and
dont
rummage
in
my
soul
dont
tease
me
with
trifles
but
only
ask
me
about
facts
and
what
matters
and
i
will
satisfy
you
at
once
and
damn
the
details
so
spoke
mitya
the
interrogation
began
again
chapter
iv
the
second
ordeal
you
dont
know
how
you
encourage
us
dmitri
fyodorovitch
by
your
readiness
to
answer
said
nikolay
parfenovitch
with
an
animated
air
and
obvious
satisfaction
beaming
in
his
very
prominent
shortsighted
light
gray
eyes
from
which
he
had
removed
his
spectacles
a
moment
before
and
you
have
made
a
very
just
remark
about
the
mutual
confidence
without
which
it
is
sometimes
positively
impossible
to
get
on
in
cases
of
such
importance
if
the
suspected
party
really
hopes
and
desires
to
defend
himself
and
is
in
a
position
to
do
so
we
on
our
side
will
do
everything
in
our
power
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
how
we
are
conducting
the
case
you
approve
ippolit
kirillovitch
he
turned
to
the
prosecutor
oh
undoubtedly
replied
the
prosecutor
his
tone
was
somewhat
cold
compared
with
nikolay
parfenovitchs
impulsiveness
i
will
note
once
for
all
that
nikolay
parfenovitch
who
had
but
lately
arrived
among
us
had
from
the
first
felt
marked
respect
for
ippolit
kirillovitch
our
prosecutor
and
had
become
almost
his
bosom
friend
he
was
almost
the
only
person
who
put
implicit
faith
in
ippolit
kirillovitchs
extraordinary
talents
as
a
psychologist
and
orator
and
in
the
justice
of
his
grievance
he
had
heard
of
him
in
petersburg
on
the
other
hand
young
nikolay
parfenovitch
was
the
only
person
in
the
whole
world
whom
our
unappreciated
prosecutor
genuinely
liked
on
their
way
to
mokroe
they
had
time
to
come
to
an
understanding
about
the
present
case
and
now
as
they
sat
at
the
table
the
sharpwitted
junior
caught
and
interpreted
every
indication
on
his
senior
colleagues
facehalf
a
word
a
glance
or
a
wink
gentlemen
only
let
me
tell
my
own
story
and
dont
interrupt
me
with
trivial
questions
and
ill
tell
you
everything
in
a
moment
said
mitya
excitedly
excellent
thank
you
but
before
we
proceed
to
listen
to
your
communication
will
you
allow
me
to
inquire
as
to
another
little
fact
of
great
interest
to
us
i
mean
the
ten
roubles
you
borrowed
yesterday
at
about
five
oclock
on
the
security
of
your
pistols
from
your
friend
pyotr
ilyitch
perhotin
i
pledged
them
gentlemen
i
pledged
them
for
ten
roubles
what
more
thats
all
about
it
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
town
i
pledged
them
you
got
back
to
town
then
you
had
been
out
of
town
yes
i
went
a
journey
of
forty
versts
into
the
country
didnt
you
know
the
prosecutor
and
nikolay
parfenovitch
exchanged
glances
well
how
would
it
be
if
you
began
your
story
with
a
systematic
description
of
all
you
did
yesterday
from
the
morning
onwards
allow
us
for
instance
to
inquire
why
you
were
absent
from
the
town
and
just
when
you
left
and
when
you
came
backall
those
facts
you
should
have
asked
me
like
that
from
the
beginning
cried
mitya
laughing
aloud
and
if
you
like
we
wont
begin
from
yesterday
but
from
the
morning
of
the
day
before
then
youll
understand
how
why
and
where
i
went
i
went
the
day
before
yesterday
gentlemen
to
a
merchant
of
the
town
called
samsonov
to
borrow
three
thousand
roubles
from
him
on
safe
security
it
was
a
pressing
matter
gentlemen
it
was
a
sudden
necessity
allow
me
to
interrupt
you
the
prosecutor
put
in
politely
why
were
you
in
such
pressing
need
for
just
that
sum
three
thousand
oh
gentlemen
you
neednt
go
into
details
how
when
and
why
and
why
just
so
much
money
and
not
so
much
and
all
that
rigmarole
why
itll
run
to
three
volumes
and
then
youll
want
an
epilogue
mitya
said
all
this
with
the
goodnatured
but
impatient
familiarity
of
a
man
who
is
anxious
to
tell
the
whole
truth
and
is
full
of
the
best
intentions
gentlemenhe
corrected
himself
hurriedlydont
be
vexed
with
me
for
my
restiveness
i
beg
you
again
believe
me
once
more
i
feel
the
greatest
respect
for
you
and
understand
the
true
position
of
affairs
dont
think
im
drunk
im
quite
sober
now
and
besides
being
drunk
would
be
no
hindrance
its
with
me
you
know
like
the
saying
when
he
is
sober
he
is
a
fool
when
he
is
drunk
he
is
a
wise
man
ha
ha
but
i
see
gentlemen
its
not
the
proper
thing
to
make
jokes
to
you
till
weve
had
our
explanation
i
mean
and
ive
my
own
dignity
to
keep
up
too
i
quite
understand
the
difference
for
the
moment
i
am
after
all
in
the
position
of
a
criminal
and
so
far
from
being
on
equal
terms
with
you
and
its
your
business
to
watch
me
i
cant
expect
you
to
pat
me
on
the
head
for
what
i
did
to
grigory
for
one
cant
break
old
mens
heads
with
impunity
i
suppose
youll
put
me
away
for
him
for
six
months
or
a
year
perhaps
in
a
house
of
correction
i
dont
know
what
the
punishment
isbut
it
will
be
without
loss
of
the
rights
of
my
rank
without
loss
of
my
rank
wont
it
so
you
see
gentlemen
i
understand
the
distinction
between
us
but
you
must
see
that
you
could
puzzle
god
himself
with
such
questions
how
did
you
step
where
did
you
step
when
did
you
step
and
on
what
did
you
step
i
shall
get
mixed
up
if
you
go
on
like
this
and
you
will
put
it
all
down
against
me
and
what
will
that
lead
to
to
nothing
and
even
if
its
nonsense
im
talking
now
let
me
finish
and
you
gentlemen
being
men
of
honor
and
refinement
will
forgive
me
ill
finish
by
asking
you
gentlemen
to
drop
that
conventional
method
of
questioning
i
mean
beginning
from
some
miserable
trifle
how
i
got
up
what
i
had
for
breakfast
how
i
spat
and
where
i
spat
and
so
distracting
the
attention
of
the
criminal
suddenly
stun
him
with
an
overwhelming
question
whom
did
you
murder
whom
did
you
rob
ha
ha
thats
your
regulation
method
thats
where
all
your
cunning
comes
in
you
can
put
peasants
off
their
guard
like
that
but
not
me
i
know
the
tricks
ive
been
in
the
service
too
ha
ha
ha
youre
not
angry
gentlemen
you
forgive
my
impertinence
he
cried
looking
at
them
with
a
goodnature
that
was
almost
surprising
its
only
mitya
karamazov
you
know
so
you
can
overlook
it
it
would
be
inexcusable
in
a
sensible
man
but
you
can
forgive
it
in
mitya
ha
ha
nikolay
parfenovitch
listened
and
laughed
too
though
the
prosecutor
did
not
laugh
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
keenly
on
mitya
as
though
anxious
not
to
miss
the
least
syllable
the
slightest
movement
the
smallest
twitch
of
any
feature
of
his
face
thats
how
we
have
treated
you
from
the
beginning
said
nikolay
parfenovitch
still
laughing
we
havent
tried
to
put
you
out
by
asking
how
you
got
up
in
the
morning
and
what
you
had
for
breakfast
we
began
indeed
with
questions
of
the
greatest
importance
i
understand
i
saw
it
and
appreciated
it
and
i
appreciate
still
more
your
present
kindness
to
me
an
unprecedented
kindness
worthy
of
your
noble
hearts
we
three
here
are
gentlemen
and
let
everything
be
on
the
footing
of
mutual
confidence
between
educated
wellbred
people
who
have
the
common
bond
of
noble
birth
and
honor
in
any
case
allow
me
to
look
upon
you
as
my
best
friends
at
this
moment
of
my
life
at
this
moment
when
my
honor
is
assailed
thats
no
offense
to
you
gentlemen
is
it
on
the
contrary
youve
expressed
all
that
so
well
dmitri
fyodorovitch
nikolay
parfenovitch
answered
with
dignified
approbation
and
enough
of
those
trivial
questions
gentlemen
all
those
tricky
questions
cried
mitya
enthusiastically
or
theres
simply
no
knowing
where
we
shall
get
to
is
there
i
will
follow
your
sensible
advice
entirely
the
prosecutor
interposed
addressing
mitya
i
dont
withdraw
my
question
however
it
is
now
vitally
important
for
us
to
know
exactly
why
you
needed
that
sum
i
mean
precisely
three
thousand
why
i
needed
it
oh
for
one
thing
and
another
well
it
was
to
pay
a
debt
a
debt
to
whom
that
i
absolutely
refuse
to
answer
gentlemen
not
because
i
couldnt
or
because
i
shouldnt
dare
or
because
it
would
be
damaging
for
its
all
a
paltry
matter
and
absolutely
trifling
buti
wont
because
its
a
matter
of
principle
thats
my
private
life
and
i
wont
allow
any
intrusion
into
my
private
life
thats
my
principle
your
question
has
no
bearing
on
the
case
and
whatever
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
is
my
private
affair
i
wanted
to
pay
a
debt
i
wanted
to
pay
a
debt
of
honor
but
to
whom
i
wont
say
allow
me
to
make
a
note
of
that
said
the
prosecutor
by
all
means
write
down
that
i
wont
say
that
i
wont
write
that
i
should
think
it
dishonorable
to
say
ech
you
can
write
it
youve
nothing
else
to
do
with
your
time
allow
me
to
caution
you
sir
and
to
remind
you
once
more
if
you
are
unaware
of
it
the
prosecutor
began
with
a
peculiar
and
stern
impressiveness
that
you
have
a
perfect
right
not
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
you
now
and
we
on
our
side
have
no
right
to
extort
an
answer
from
you
if
you
decline
to
give
it
for
one
reason
or
another
that
is
entirely
a
matter
for
your
personal
decision
but
it
is
our
duty
on
the
other
hand
in
such
cases
as
the
present
to
explain
and
set
before
you
the
degree
of
injury
you
will
be
doing
yourself
by
refusing
to
give
this
or
that
piece
of
evidence
after
which
i
will
beg
you
to
continue
gentlemen
im
not
angry

i

mitya
muttered
in
a
rather
disconcerted
tone
well
gentlemen
you
see
that
samsonov
to
whom
i
went
then

we
will
of
course
not
reproduce
his
account
of
what
is
known
to
the
reader
already
mitya
was
impatiently
anxious
not
to
omit
the
slightest
detail
at
the
same
time
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
it
over
but
as
he
gave
his
evidence
it
was
written
down
and
therefore
they
had
continually
to
pull
him
up
mitya
disliked
this
but
submitted
got
angry
though
still
goodhumoredly
he
did
it
is
true
exclaim
from
time
to
time
gentlemen
thats
enough
to
make
an
angel
out
of
patience
or
gentlemen
its
no
good
your
irritating
me
but
even
though
he
exclaimed
he
still
preserved
for
a
time
his
genially
expansive
mood
so
he
told
them
how
samsonov
had
made
a
fool
of
him
two
days
before
he
had
completely
realized
by
now
that
he
had
been
fooled
the
sale
of
his
watch
for
six
roubles
to
obtain
money
for
the
journey
was
something
new
to
the
lawyers
they
were
at
once
greatly
interested
and
even
to
mityas
intense
indignation
thought
it
necessary
to
write
the
fact
down
as
a
secondary
confirmation
of
the
circumstance
that
he
had
hardly
a
farthing
in
his
pocket
at
the
time
little
by
little
mitya
began
to
grow
surly
then
after
describing
his
journey
to
see
lyagavy
the
night
spent
in
the
stifling
hut
and
so
on
he
came
to
his
return
to
the
town
here
he
began
without
being
particularly
urged
to
give
a
minute
account
of
the
agonies
of
jealousy
he
endured
on
grushenkas
account
he
was
heard
with
silent
attention
they
inquired
particularly
into
the
circumstance
of
his
having
a
place
of
ambush
in
marya
kondratyevnas
house
at
the
back
of
fyodor
pavlovitchs
garden
to
keep
watch
on
grushenka
and
of
smerdyakovs
bringing
him
information
they
laid
particular
stress
on
this
and
noted
it
down
of
his
jealousy
he
spoke
warmly
and
at
length
and
though
inwardly
ashamed
at
exposing
his
most
intimate
feelings
to
public
ignominy
so
to
speak
he
evidently
overcame
his
shame
in
order
to
tell
the
truth
the
frigid
severity
with
which
the
investigating
lawyer
and
still
more
the
prosecutor
stared
intently
at
him
as
he
told
his
story
disconcerted
him
at
last
considerably
that
boy
nikolay
parfenovitch
to
whom
i
was
talking
nonsense
about
women
only
a
few
days
ago
and
that
sickly
prosecutor
are
not
worth
my
telling
this
to
he
reflected
mournfully
its
ignominious
be
patient
humble
hold
thy
peace

he
wound
up
his
reflections
with
that
line
but
he
pulled
himself
together
to
go
on
again
when
he
came
to
telling
of
his
visit
to
madame
hohlakov
he
regained
his
spirits
and
even
wished
to
tell
a
little
anecdote
of
that
lady
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
but
the
investigating
lawyer
stopped
him
and
civilly
suggested
that
he
should
pass
on
to
more
essential
matters
at
last
when
he
described
his
despair
and
told
them
how
when
he
left
madame
hohlakovs
he
thought
that
hed
get
three
thousand
if
he
had
to
murder
some
one
to
do
it
they
stopped
him
again
and
noted
down
that
he
had
meant
to
murder
some
one
mitya
let
them
write
it
without
protest
at
last
he
reached
the
point
in
his
story
when
he
learned
that
grushenka
had
deceived
him
and
had
returned
from
samsonovs
as
soon
as
he
left
her
there
though
she
had
said
that
she
would
stay
there
till
midnight
if
i
didnt
kill
fenya
then
gentlemen
it
was
only
because
i
hadnt
time
broke
from
him
suddenly
at
that
point
in
his
story
that
too
was
carefully
written
down
mitya
waited
gloomily
and
was
beginning
to
tell
how
he
ran
into
his
fathers
garden
when
the
investigating
lawyer
suddenly
stopped
him
and
opening
the
big
portfolio
that
lay
on
the
sofa
beside
him
he
brought
out
the
brass
pestle
do
you
recognize
this
object
he
asked
showing
it
to
mitya
oh
yes
he
laughed
gloomily
of
course
i
recognize
it
let
me
have
a
look
at
it
damn
it
never
mind
you
have
forgotten
to
mention
it
observed
the
investigating
lawyer
hang
it
all
i
shouldnt
have
concealed
it
from
you
do
you
suppose
i
could
have
managed
without
it
it
simply
escaped
my
memory
be
so
good
as
to
tell
us
precisely
how
you
came
to
arm
yourself
with
it
certainly
i
will
be
so
good
gentlemen
and
mitya
described
how
he
took
the
pestle
and
ran
but
what
object
had
you
in
view
in
arming
yourself
with
such
a
weapon
what
object
no
object
i
just
picked
it
up
and
ran
off
what
for
if
you
had
no
object
mityas
wrath
flared
up
he
looked
intently
at
the
boy
and
smiled
gloomily
and
malignantly
he
was
feeling
more
and
more
ashamed
at
having
told
such
people
the
story
of
his
jealousy
so
sincerely
and
spontaneously
bother
the
pestle
broke
from
him
suddenly
but
still
oh
to
keep
off
dogs
oh
because
it
was
dark
in
case
anything
turned
up
but
have
you
ever
on
previous
occasions
taken
a
weapon
with
you
when
you
went
out
since
youre
afraid
of
the
dark
ugh
damn
it
all
gentlemen
theres
positively
no
talking
to
you
cried
mitya
exasperated
beyond
endurance
and
turning
to
the
secretary
crimson
with
anger
he
said
quickly
with
a
note
of
fury
in
his
voice
write
down
at
once

at
once

that
i
snatched
up
the
pestle
to
go
and
kill
my
father

fyodor
pavlovitch

by
hitting
him
on
the
head
with
it
well
now
are
you
satisfied
gentlemen
are
your
minds
relieved
he
said
glaring
defiantly
at
the
lawyers
we
quite
understand
that
you
made
that
statement
just
now
through
exasperation
with
us
and
the
questions
we
put
to
you
which
you
consider
trivial
though
they
are
in
fact
essential
the
prosecutor
remarked
dryly
in
reply
well
upon
my
word
gentlemen
yes
i
took
the
pestle
what
does
one
pick
things
up
for
at
such
moments
i
dont
know
what
for
i
snatched
it
up
and
ranthats
all
for
to
me
gentlemen
passons
or
i
declare
i
wont
tell
you
any
more
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hand
he
sat
sideways
to
them
and
gazed
at
the
wall
struggling
against
a
feeling
of
nausea
he
had
in
fact
an
awful
inclination
to
get
up
and
declare
that
he
wouldnt
say
another
word
not
if
you
hang
me
for
it
you
see
gentlemen
he
said
at
last
with
difficulty
controlling
himself
you
see
i
listen
to
you
and
am
haunted
by
a
dream
its
a
dream
i
have
sometimes
you
know
i
often
dream
itits
always
the
same

that
some
one
is
hunting
me
some
one
im
awfully
afraid
of

that
hes
hunting
me
in
the
dark
in
the
night

tracking
me
and
i
hide
somewhere
from
him
behind
a
door
or
cupboard
hide
in
a
degrading
way
and
the
worst
of
it
is
he
always
knows
where
i
am
but
he
pretends
not
to
know
where
i
am
on
purpose
to
prolong
my
agony
to
enjoy
my
terror
thats
just
what
youre
doing
now
its
just
like
that
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
you
dream
about
inquired
the
prosecutor
yes
it
is
dont
you
want
to
write
it
down
said
mitya
with
a
distorted
smile
no
no
need
to
write
it
down
but
still
you
do
have
curious
dreams
its
not
a
question
of
dreams
now
gentlementhis
is
realism
this
is
real
life
im
a
wolf
and
youre
the
hunters
well
hunt
him
down
you
are
wrong
to
make
such
comparisons

began
nikolay
parfenovitch
with
extraordinary
softness
no
im
not
wrong
not
at
all
mitya
flared
up
again
though
his
outburst
of
wrath
had
obviously
relieved
his
heart
he
grew
more
good
humored
at
every
word
you
may
not
trust
a
criminal
or
a
man
on
trial
tortured
by
your
questions
but
an
honorable
man
the
honorable
impulses
of
the
heart
i
say
that
boldlyno
that
you
must
believe
you
have
no
right
indeed

but
be
silent
heart
be
patient
humble
hold
thy
peace
well
shall
i
go
on
he
broke
off
gloomily
if
youll
be
so
kind
answered
nikolay
parfenovitch
chapter
v
the
third
ordeal
though
mitya
spoke
sullenly
it
was
evident
that
he
was
trying
more
than
ever
not
to
forget
or
miss
a
single
detail
of
his
story
he
told
them
how
he
had
leapt
over
the
fence
into
his
fathers
garden
how
he
had
gone
up
to
the
window
told
them
all
that
had
passed
under
the
window
clearly
precisely
distinctly
he
described
the
feelings
that
troubled
him
during
those
moments
in
the
garden
when
he
longed
so
terribly
to
know
whether
grushenka
was
with
his
father
or
not
but
strange
to
say
both
the
lawyers
listened
now
with
a
sort
of
awful
reserve
looked
coldly
at
him
asked
few
questions
mitya
could
gather
nothing
from
their
faces
theyre
angry
and
offended
he
thought
well
bother
them
when
he
described
how
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
to
make
the
signal
to
his
father
that
grushenka
had
come
so
that
he
should
open
the
window
the
lawyers
paid
no
attention
to
the
word
signal
as
though
they
entirely
failed
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
this
connection
so
much
so
that
mitya
noticed
it
coming
at
last
to
the
moment
when
seeing
his
father
peering
out
of
the
window
his
hatred
flared
up
and
he
pulled
the
pestle
out
of
his
pocket
he
suddenly
as
though
of
design
stopped
short
he
sat
gazing
at
the
wall
and
was
aware
that
their
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
well
said
the
investigating
lawyer
you
pulled
out
the
weapon
and

and
what
happened
then
then
why
then
i
murdered
him

hit
him
on
the
head
and
cracked
his
skull
i
suppose
thats
your
story
thats
it
his
eyes
suddenly
flashed
all
his
smothered
wrath
suddenly
flamed
up
with
extraordinary
violence
in
his
soul
our
story
repeated
nikolay
parfenovitch
welland
yours
mitya
dropped
his
eyes
and
was
a
long
time
silent
my
story
gentlemen
well
it
was
like
this
he
began
softly
whether
it
was
some
ones
tears
or
my
mother
prayed
to
god
or
a
good
angel
kissed
me
at
that
instant
i
dont
know
but
the
devil
was
conquered
i
rushed
from
the
window
and
ran
to
the
fence
my
father
was
alarmed
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
me
then
cried
out
and
sprang
back
from
the
window
i
remember
that
very
well
i
ran
across
the
garden
to
the
fence

and
there
grigory
caught
me
when
i
was
sitting
on
the
fence
at
that
point
he
raised
his
eyes
at
last
and
looked
at
his
listeners
they
seemed
to
be
staring
at
him
with
perfectly
unruffled
attention
a
sort
of
paroxysm
of
indignation
seized
on
mityas
soul
why
youre
laughing
at
me
at
this
moment
gentlemen
he
broke
off
suddenly
what
makes
you
think
that
observed
nikolay
parfenovitch
you
dont
believe
one
wordthats
why
i
understand
of
course
that
i
have
come
to
the
vital
point
the
old
mans
lying
there
now
with
his
skull
broken
while
iafter
dramatically
describing
how
i
wanted
to
kill
him
and
how
i
snatched
up
the
pestlei
suddenly
run
away
from
the
window
a
romance
poetry
as
though
one
could
believe
a
fellow
on
his
word
ha
ha
you
are
scoffers
gentlemen
and
he
swung
round
on
his
chair
so
that
it
creaked
and
did
you
notice
asked
the
prosecutor
suddenly
as
though
not
observing
mityas
excitement
did
you
notice
when
you
ran
away
from
the
window
whether
the
door
into
the
garden
was
open
no
it
was
not
open
it
was
not
it
was
shut
and
who
could
open
it
bah
the
door
wait
a
bit
he
seemed
suddenly
to
bethink
himself
and
almost
with
a
start
why
did
you
find
the
door
open
yes
it
was
open
why
who
could
have
opened
it
if
you
did
not
open
it
yourselves
cried
mitya
greatly
astonished
the
door
stood
open
and
your
fathers
murderer
undoubtedly
went
in
at
that
door
and
having
accomplished
the
crime
went
out
again
by
the
same
door
the
prosecutor
pronounced
deliberately
as
though
chiseling
out
each
word
separately
that
is
perfectly
clear
the
murder
was
committed
in
the
room
and
not
through
the
window
that
is
absolutely
certain
from
the
examination
that
has
been
made
from
the
position
of
the
body
and
everything
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
circumstance
mitya
was
absolutely
dumbfounded
but
thats
utterly
impossible
he
cried
completely
at
a
loss
i

i
didnt
go
in
i
tell
you
positively
definitely
the
door
was
shut
the
whole
time
i
was
in
the
garden
and
when
i
ran
out
of
the
garden
i
only
stood
at
the
window
and
saw
him
through
the
window
thats
all
thats
all
i
remember
to
the
last
minute
and
if
i
didnt
remember
it
would
be
just
the
same
i
know
it
for
no
one
knew
the
signals
except
smerdyakov
and
me
and
the
dead
man
and
he
wouldnt
have
opened
the
door
to
any
one
in
the
world
without
the
signals
signals
what
signals
asked
the
prosecutor
with
greedy
almost
hysterical
curiosity
he
instantly
lost
all
trace
of
his
reserve
and
dignity
he
asked
the
question
with
a
sort
of
cringing
timidity
he
scented
an
important
fact
of
which
he
had
known
nothing
and
was
already
filled
with
dread
that
mitya
might
be
unwilling
to
disclose
it
so
you
didnt
know
mitya
winked
at
him
with
a
malicious
and
mocking
smile
what
if
i
wont
tell
you
from
whom
could
you
find
out
no
one
knew
about
the
signals
except
my
father
smerdyakov
and
me
that
was
all
heaven
knew
too
but
it
wont
tell
you
but
its
an
interesting
fact
theres
no
knowing
what
you
might
build
on
it
ha
ha
take
comfort
gentlemen
ill
reveal
it
youve
some
foolish
idea
in
your
hearts
you
dont
know
the
man
you
have
to
deal
with
you
have
to
do
with
a
prisoner
who
gives
evidence
against
himself
to
his
own
damage
yes
for
im
a
man
of
honor
and
youare
not
the
prosecutor
swallowed
this
without
a
murmur
he
was
trembling
with
impatience
to
hear
the
new
fact
minutely
and
diffusely
mitya
told
them
everything
about
the
signals
invented
by
fyodor
pavlovitch
for
smerdyakov
he
told
them
exactly
what
every
tap
on
the
window
meant
tapped
the
signals
on
the
table
and
when
nikolay
parfenovitch
said
that
he
supposed
he
mitya
had
tapped
the
signal
grushenka
has
come
when
he
tapped
to
his
father
he
answered
precisely
that
he
had
tapped
that
signal
that
grushenka
had
come
so
now
you
can
build
up
your
tower
mitya
broke
off
and
again
turned
away
from
them
contemptuously
so
no
one
knew
of
the
signals
but
your
dead
father
you
and
the
valet
smerdyakov
and
no
one
else
nikolay
parfenovitch
inquired
once
more
yes
the
valet
smerdyakov
and
heaven
write
down
about
heaven
that
may
be
of
use
besides
you
will
need
god
yourselves
and
they
had
already
of
course
begun
writing
it
down
but
while
they
wrote
the
prosecutor
said
suddenly
as
though
pitching
on
a
new
idea
but
if
smerdyakov
also
knew
of
these
signals
and
you
absolutely
deny
all
responsibility
for
the
death
of
your
father
was
it
not
he
perhaps
who
knocked
the
signal
agreed
upon
induced
your
father
to
open
to
him
and
then

committed
the
crime
mitya
turned
upon
him
a
look
of
profound
irony
and
intense
hatred
his
silent
stare
lasted
so
long
that
it
made
the
prosecutor
blink
youve
caught
the
fox
again
commented
mitya
at
last
youve
got
the
beast
by
the
tail
ha
ha
i
see
through
you
mr
prosecutor
you
thought
of
course
that
i
should
jump
at
that
catch
at
your
prompting
and
shout
with
all
my
might
aie
its
smerdyakov
hes
the
murderer
confess
thats
what
you
thought
confess
and
ill
go
on
but
the
prosecutor
did
not
confess
he
held
his
tongue
and
waited
youre
mistaken
im
not
going
to
shout
its
smerdyakov

said
mitya
and
you
dont
even
suspect
him
why
do
you
suspect
him
he
is
suspected
too
mitya
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
floor
joking
apart
he
brought
out
gloomily
listen
from
the
very
beginning
almost
from
the
moment
when
i
ran
out
to
you
from
behind
the
curtain
ive
had
the
thought
of
smerdyakov
in
my
mind
ive
been
sitting
here
shouting
that
im
innocent
and
thinking
all
the
time
smerdyakov
i
cant
get
smerdyakov
out
of
my
head
in
fact
i
too
thought
of
smerdyakov
just
now
but
only
for
a
second
almost
at
once
i
thought
no
its
not
smerdyakov
its
not
his
doing
gentlemen
in
that
case
is
there
anybody
else
you
suspect
nikolay
parfenovitch
inquired
cautiously
i
dont
know
any
one
it
could
be
whether
its
the
hand
of
heaven
or
satan
but

not
smerdyakov
mitya
jerked
out
with
decision
but
what
makes
you
affirm
so
confidently
and
emphatically
that
its
not
he
from
my
convictionmy
impression
because
smerdyakov
is
a
man
of
the
most
abject
character
and
a
coward
hes
not
a
coward
hes
the
epitome
of
all
the
cowardice
in
the
world
walking
on
two
legs
he
has
the
heart
of
a
chicken
when
he
talked
to
me
he
was
always
trembling
for
fear
i
should
kill
him
though
i
never
raised
my
hand
against
him
he
fell
at
my
feet
and
blubbered
he
has
kissed
these
very
boots
literally
beseeching
me
not
to
frighten
him
do
you
hear
not
to
frighten
him
what
a
thing
to
say
why
i
offered
him
money
hes
a
puling
chickensickly
epileptic
weakmindeda
child
of
eight
could
thrash
him
he
has
no
character
worth
talking
about
its
not
smerdyakov
gentlemen
he
doesnt
care
for
money
he
wouldnt
take
my
presents
besides
what
motive
had
he
for
murdering
the
old
man
why
hes
very
likely
his
son
you
knowhis
natural
son
do
you
know
that
we
have
heard
that
legend
but
you
are
your
fathers
son
too
you
know
yet
you
yourself
told
every
one
you
meant
to
murder
him
thats
a
thrust
and
a
nasty
mean
one
too
im
not
afraid
oh
gentlemen
isnt
it
too
base
of
you
to
say
that
to
my
face
its
base
because
i
told
you
that
myself
i
not
only
wanted
to
murder
him
but
i
might
have
done
it
and
whats
more
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
tell
you
of
my
own
accord
that
i
nearly
murdered
him
but
you
see
i
didnt
murder
him
you
see
my
guardian
angel
saved
methats
what
youve
not
taken
into
account
and
thats
why
its
so
base
of
you
for
i
didnt
kill
him
i
didnt
kill
him
do
you
hear
i
did
not
kill
him
he
was
almost
choking
he
had
not
been
so
moved
before
during
the
whole
interrogation
and
what
has
he
told
you
gentlemensmerdyakov
i
mean
he
added
suddenly
after
a
pause
may
i
ask
that
question
you
may
ask
any
question
the
prosecutor
replied
with
frigid
severity
any
question
relating
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
we
are
i
repeat
bound
to
answer
every
inquiry
you
make
we
found
the
servant
smerdyakov
concerning
whom
you
inquire
lying
unconscious
in
his
bed
in
an
epileptic
fit
of
extreme
severity
that
had
recurred
possibly
ten
times
the
doctor
who
was
with
us
told
us
after
seeing
him
that
he
may
possibly
not
outlive
the
night
well
if
thats
so
the
devil
must
have
killed
him
broke
suddenly
from
mitya
as
though
until
that
moment
he
had
been
asking
himself
was
it
smerdyakov
or
not
we
will
come
back
to
this
later
nikolay
parfenovitch
decided
now
wouldnt
you
like
to
continue
your
statement
mitya
asked
for
a
rest
his
request
was
courteously
granted
after
resting
he
went
on
with
his
story
but
he
was
evidently
depressed
he
was
exhausted
mortified
and
morally
shaken
to
make
things
worse
the
prosecutor
exasperated
him
as
though
intentionally
by
vexatious
interruptions
about
trifling
points
scarcely
had
mitya
described
how
sitting
on
the
wall
he
had
struck
grigory
on
the
head
with
the
pestle
while
the
old
man
had
hold
of
his
left
leg
and
how
he
had
then
jumped
down
to
look
at
him
when
the
prosecutor
stopped
him
to
ask
him
to
describe
exactly
how
he
was
sitting
on
the
wall
mitya
was
surprised
oh
i
was
sitting
like
this
astride
one
leg
on
one
side
of
the
wall
and
one
on
the
other
and
the
pestle
the
pestle
was
in
my
hand
not
in
your
pocket
do
you
remember
that
precisely
was
it
a
violent
blow
you
gave
him
it
must
have
been
a
violent
one
but
why
do
you
ask
would
you
mind
sitting
on
the
chair
just
as
you
sat
on
the
wall
then
and
showing
us
just
how
you
moved
your
arm
and
in
what
direction
youre
making
fun
of
me
arent
you
asked
mitya
looking
haughtily
at
the
speaker
but
the
latter
did
not
flinch
mitya
turned
abruptly
sat
astride
on
his
chair
and
swung
his
arm
this
was
how
i
struck
him
thats
how
i
knocked
him
down
what
more
do
you
want
thank
you
may
i
trouble
you
now
to
explain
why
you
jumped
down
with
what
object
and
what
you
had
in
view
oh
hang
it
i
jumped
down
to
look
at
the
man
id
hurt

i
dont
know
what
for
though
you
were
so
excited
and
were
running
away
yes
though
i
was
excited
and
running
away
you
wanted
to
help
him
help
yes
perhaps
i
did
want
to
help
him
i
dont
remember
you
dont
remember
then
you
didnt
quite
know
what
you
were
doing
not
at
all
i
remember
everythingevery
detail
i
jumped
down
to
look
at
him
and
wiped
his
face
with
my
handkerchief
we
have
seen
your
handkerchief
did
you
hope
to
restore
him
to
consciousness
i
dont
know
whether
i
hoped
it
i
simply
wanted
to
make
sure
whether
he
was
alive
or
not
ah
you
wanted
to
be
sure
well
what
then
im
not
a
doctor
i
couldnt
decide
i
ran
away
thinking
id
killed
him
and
now
hes
recovered
excellent
commented
the
prosecutor
thank
you
thats
all
i
wanted
kindly
proceed
alas
it
never
entered
mityas
head
to
tell
them
though
he
remembered
it
that
he
had
jumped
back
from
pity
and
standing
over
the
prostrate
figure
had
even
uttered
some
words
of
regret
youve
come
to
grief
old
mantheres
no
help
for
it
well
there
you
must
lie
the
prosecutor
could
only
draw
one
conclusion
that
the
man
had
jumped
back
at
such
a
moment
and
in
such
excitement
simply
with
the
object
of
ascertaining
whether
the
only
witness
of
his
crime
were
dead
that
he
must
therefore
have
been
a
man
of
great
strength
coolness
decision
and
foresight
even
at
such
a
moment

and
so
on
the
prosecutor
was
satisfied
ive
provoked
the
nervous
fellow
by
trifles
and
he
has
said
more
than
he
meant
to
with
painful
effort
mitya
went
on
but
this
time
he
was
pulled
up
immediately
by
nikolay
parfenovitch
how
came
you
to
run
to
the
servant
fedosya
markovna
with
your
hands
so
covered
with
blood
and
as
it
appears
your
face
too
why
i
didnt
notice
the
blood
at
all
at
the
time
answered
mitya
thats
quite
likely
it
does
happen
sometimes
the
prosecutor
exchanged
glances
with
nikolay
parfenovitch
i
simply
didnt
notice
youre
quite
right
there
prosecutor
mitya
assented
suddenly
next
came
the
account
of
mityas
sudden
determination
to
step
aside
and
make
way
for
their
happiness
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
open
his
heart
to
them
as
before
and
tell
them
about
the
queen
of
his
soul
he
disliked
speaking
of
her
before
these
chilly
persons
who
were
fastening
on
him
like
bugs
and
so
in
response
to
their
reiterated
questions
he
answered
briefly
and
abruptly
well
i
made
up
my
mind
to
kill
myself
what
had
i
left
to
live
for
that
question
stared
me
in
the
face
her
first
rightful
lover
had
come
back
the
man
who
wronged
her
but
whod
hurried
back
to
offer
his
love
after
five
years
and
atone
for
the
wrong
with
marriage
so
i
knew
it
was
all
over
for
me
and
behind
me
disgrace
and
that
bloodgrigorys
what
had
i
to
live
for
so
i
went
to
redeem
the
pistols
i
had
pledged
to
load
them
and
put
a
bullet
in
my
brain
tomorrow
and
a
grand
feast
the
night
before
yes
a
grand
feast
the
night
before
damn
it
all
gentlemen
do
make
haste
and
finish
it
i
meant
to
shoot
myself
not
far
from
here
beyond
the
village
and
id
planned
to
do
it
at
five
oclock
in
the
morning
and
i
had
a
note
in
my
pocket
already
i
wrote
it
at
perhotins
when
i
loaded
my
pistols
heres
the
letter
read
it
its
not
for
you
i
tell
it
he
added
contemptuously
he
took
it
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
flung
it
on
the
table
the
lawyers
read
it
with
curiosity
and
as
is
usual
added
it
to
the
papers
connected
with
the
case
and
you
didnt
even
think
of
washing
your
hands
at
perhotins
you
were
not
afraid
then
of
arousing
suspicion
what
suspicion
suspicion
or
not
i
should
have
galloped
here
just
the
same
and
shot
myself
at
five
oclock
and
you
wouldnt
have
been
in
time
to
do
anything
if
it
hadnt
been
for
whats
happened
to
my
father
you
would
have
known
nothing
about
it
and
wouldnt
have
come
here
oh
its
the
devils
doing
it
was
the
devil
murdered
father
it
was
through
the
devil
that
you
found
it
out
so
soon
how
did
you
manage
to
get
here
so
quick
its
marvelous
a
dream
mr
perhotin
informed
us
that
when
you
came
to
him
you
held
in
your
hands

your
bloodstained
hands

your
money

a
lot
of
money

a
bundle
of
hundredrouble
notes
and
that
his
servantboy
saw
it
too
thats
true
gentlemen
i
remember
it
was
so
now
theres
one
little
point
presents
itself
can
you
inform
us
nikolay
parfenovitch
began
with
extreme
gentleness
where
did
you
get
so
much
money
all
of
a
sudden
when
it
appears
from
the
facts
from
the
reckoning
of
time
that
you
had
not
been
home
the
prosecutors
brows
contracted
at
the
question
being
asked
so
plainly
but
he
did
not
interrupt
nikolay
parfenovitch
no
i
didnt
go
home
answered
mitya
apparently
perfectly
composed
but
looking
at
the
floor
allow
me
then
to
repeat
my
question
nikolay
parfenovitch
went
on
as
though
creeping
up
to
the
subject
where
were
you
able
to
procure
such
a
sum
all
at
once
when
by
your
own
confession
at
five
oclock
the
same
day
you
i
was
in
want
of
ten
roubles
and
pledged
my
pistols
with
perhotin
and
then
went
to
madame
hohlakov
to
borrow
three
thousand
which
she
wouldnt
give
me
and
so
on
and
all
the
rest
of
it
mitya
interrupted
sharply
yes
gentlemen
i
was
in
want
of
it
and
suddenly
thousands
turned
up
eh
do
you
know
gentlemen
youre
both
afraid
now
what
if
he
wont
tell
us
where
he
got
it
thats
just
how
it
is
im
not
going
to
tell
you
gentlemen
youve
guessed
right
youll
never
know
said
mitya
chipping
out
each
word
with
extraordinary
determination
the
lawyers
were
silent
for
a
moment
you
must
understand
mr
karamazov
that
it
is
of
vital
importance
for
us
to
know
said
nikolay
parfenovitch
softly
and
suavely
i
understand
but
still
i
wont
tell
you
the
prosecutor
too
intervened
and
again
reminded
the
prisoner
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
if
he
thought
it
to
his
interest
and
so
on
but
in
view
of
the
damage
he
might
do
himself
by
his
silence
especially
in
a
case
of
such
importance
as
and
so
on
gentlemen
and
so
on
enough
ive
heard
that
rigmarole
before
mitya
interrupted
again
i
can
see
for
myself
how
important
it
is
and
that
this
is
the
vital
point
and
still
i
wont
say
what
is
it
to
us
its
not
our
business
but
yours
you
are
doing
yourself
harm
observed
nikolay
parfenovitch
nervously
you
see
gentlemen
joking
apartmitya
lifted
his
eyes
and
looked
firmly
at
them
bothi
had
an
inkling
from
the
first
that
we
should
come
to
loggerheads
at
this
point
but
at
first
when
i
began
to
give
my
evidence
it
was
all
still
far
away
and
misty
it
was
all
floating
and
i
was
so
simple
that
i
began
with
the
supposition
of
mutual
confidence
existing
between
us
now
i
can
see
for
myself
that
such
confidence
is
out
of
the
question
for
in
any
case
we
were
bound
to
come
to
this
cursed
stumbling
block
and
now
weve
come
to
it
its
impossible
and
theres
an
end
of
it
but
i
dont
blame
you
you
cant
believe
it
all
simply
on
my
word
i
understand
that
of
course
he
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
couldnt
you
without
abandoning
your
resolution
to
be
silent
about
the
chief
point
could
you
not
at
the
same
time
give
us
some
slight
hint
as
to
the
nature
of
the
motives
which
are
strong
enough
to
induce
you
to
refuse
to
answer
at
a
crisis
so
full
of
danger
to
you
mitya
smiled
mournfully
almost
dreamily
im
much
more
goodnatured
than
you
think
gentlemen
ill
tell
you
the
reason
why
and
give
you
that
hint
though
you
dont
deserve
it
i
wont
speak
of
that
gentlemen
because
it
would
be
a
stain
on
my
honor
the
answer
to
the
question
where
i
got
the
money
would
expose
me
to
far
greater
disgrace
than
the
murder
and
robbing
of
my
father
if
i
had
murdered
and
robbed
him
thats
why
i
cant
tell
you
i
cant
for
fear
of
disgrace
what
gentlemen
are
you
going
to
write
that
down
yes
well
write
it
down
lisped
nikolay
parfenovitch
you
ought
not
to
write
that
down
about
disgrace
i
only
told
you
that
in
the
goodness
of
my
heart
i
neednt
have
told
you
i
made
you
a
present
of
it
so
to
speak
and
you
pounce
upon
it
at
once
oh
well
writewrite
what
you
like
he
concluded
with
scornful
disgust
im
not
afraid
of
you
and
i
can
still
hold
up
my
head
before
you
and
cant
you
tell
us
the
nature
of
that
disgrace
nikolay
parfenovitch
hazarded
the
prosecutor
frowned
darkly
no
no
cest
fini
dont
trouble
yourselves
its
not
worth
while
soiling
ones
hands
i
have
soiled
myself
enough
through
you
as
it
is
youre
not
worth
itno
one
is

enough
gentlemen
im
not
going
on
this
was
said
too
peremptorily
nikolay
parfenovitch
did
not
insist
further
but
from
ippolit
kirillovitchs
eyes
he
saw
that
he
had
not
given
up
hope
can
you
not
at
least
tell
us
what
sum
you
had
in
your
hands
when
you
went
into
mr
perhotinshow
many
roubles
exactly
i
cant
tell
you
that
you
spoke
to
mr
perhotin
i
believe
of
having
received
three
thousand
from
madame
hohlakov
perhaps
i
did
enough
gentlemen
i
wont
say
how
much
i
had
will
you
be
so
good
then
as
to
tell
us
how
you
came
here
and
what
you
have
done
since
you
arrived
oh
you
might
ask
the
people
here
about
that
but
ill
tell
you
if
you
like
he
proceeded
to
do
so
but
we
wont
repeat
his
story
he
told
it
dryly
and
curtly
of
the
raptures
of
his
love
he
said
nothing
but
told
them
that
he
abandoned
his
determination
to
shoot
himself
owing
to
new
factors
in
the
case
he
told
the
story
without
going
into
motives
or
details
and
this
time
the
lawyers
did
not
worry
him
much
it
was
obvious
that
there
was
no
essential
point
of
interest
to
them
here
we
shall
verify
all
that
we
will
come
back
to
it
during
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
which
will
of
course
take
place
in
your
presence
said
nikolay
parfenovitch
in
conclusion
and
now
allow
me
to
request
you
to
lay
on
the
table
everything
in
your
possession
especially
all
the
money
you
still
have
about
you
my
money
gentlemen
certainly
i
understand
that
that
is
necessary
im
surprised
indeed
that
you
havent
inquired
about
it
before
its
true
i
couldnt
get
away
anywhere
im
sitting
here
where
i
can
be
seen
but
heres
my
moneycount
ittake
it
thats
all
i
think
he
turned
it
all
out
of
his
pockets
even
the
small
changetwo
pieces
of
twenty
copeckshe
pulled
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
they
counted
the
money
which
amounted
to
eight
hundred
and
thirtysix
roubles
and
forty
copecks
and
is
that
all
asked
the
investigating
lawyer
yes
you
stated
just
now
in
your
evidence
that
you
spent
three
hundred
roubles
at
plotnikovs
you
gave
perhotin
ten
your
driver
twenty
here
you
lost
two
hundred
then
nikolay
parfenovitch
reckoned
it
all
up
mitya
helped
him
readily
they
recollected
every
farthing
and
included
it
in
the
reckoning
nikolay
parfenovitch
hurriedly
added
up
the
total
with
this
eight
hundred
you
must
have
had
about
fifteen
hundred
at
first
i
suppose
so
snapped
mitya
how
is
it
they
all
assert
there
was
much
more
let
them
assert
it
but
you
asserted
it
yourself
yes
i
did
too
we
will
compare
all
this
with
the
evidence
of
other
persons
not
yet
examined
dont
be
anxious
about
your
money
it
will
be
properly
taken
care
of
and
be
at
your
disposal
at
the
conclusion
of

what
is
beginning

if
it
appears
or
so
to
speak
is
proved
that
you
have
undisputed
right
to
it
well
and
now
nikolay
parfenovitch
suddenly
got
up
and
informed
mitya
firmly
that
it
was
his
duty
and
obligation
to
conduct
a
minute
and
thorough
search
of
your
clothes
and
everything
else
by
all
means
gentlemen
ill
turn
out
all
my
pockets
if
you
like
and
he
did
in
fact
begin
turning
out
his
pockets
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
off
your
clothes
too
what
undress
ugh
damn
it
wont
you
search
me
as
i
am
cant
you
its
utterly
impossible
dmitri
fyodorovitch
you
must
take
off
your
clothes
as
you
like
mitya
submitted
gloomily
only
please
not
here
but
behind
the
curtains
who
will
search
them
behind
the
curtains
of
course
nikolay
parfenovitch
bent
his
head
in
assent
his
small
face
wore
an
expression
of
peculiar
solemnity
chapter
vi
the
prosecutor
catches
mitya
something
utterly
unexpected
and
amazing
to
mitya
followed
he
could
never
even
a
minute
before
have
conceived
that
any
one
could
behave
like
that
to
him
mitya
karamazov
what
was
worst
of
all
there
was
something
humiliating
in
it
and
on
their
side
something
supercilious
and
scornful
it
was
nothing
to
take
off
his
coat
but
he
was
asked
to
undress
further
or
rather
not
asked
but
commanded
he
quite
understood
that
from
pride
and
contempt
he
submitted
without
a
word
several
peasants
accompanied
the
lawyers
and
remained
on
the
same
side
of
the
curtain
to
be
ready
if
force
is
required
thought
mitya
and
perhaps
for
some
other
reason
too
well
must
i
take
off
my
shirt
too
he
asked
sharply
but
nikolay
parfenovitch
did
not
answer
he
was
busily
engaged
with
the
prosecutor
in
examining
the
coat
the
trousers
the
waistcoat
and
the
cap
and
it
was
evident
that
they
were
both
much
interested
in
the
scrutiny
they
make
no
bones
about
it
thought
mitya
they
dont
keep
up
the
most
elementary
politeness
i
ask
you
for
the
second
timeneed
i
take
off
my
shirt
or
not
he
said
still
more
sharply
and
irritably
dont
trouble
yourself
we
will
tell
you
what
to
do
nikolay
parfenovitch
said
and
his
voice
was
positively
peremptory
or
so
it
seemed
to
mitya
meantime
a
consultation
was
going
on
in
undertones
between
the
lawyers
there
turned
out
to
be
on
the
coat
especially
on
the
left
side
at
the
back
a
huge
patch
of
blood
dry
and
still
stiff
there
were
bloodstains
on
the
trousers
too
nikolay
parfenovitch
moreover
in
the
presence
of
the
peasant
witnesses
passed
his
fingers
along
the
collar
the
cuffs
and
all
the
seams
of
the
coat
and
trousers
obviously
looking
for
somethingmoney
of
course
he
didnt
even
hide
from
mitya
his
suspicion
that
he
was
capable
of
sewing
money
up
in
his
clothes
he
treats
me
not
as
an
officer
but
as
a
thief
mitya
muttered
to
himself
they
communicated
their
ideas
to
one
another
with
amazing
frankness
the
secretary
for
instance
who
was
also
behind
the
curtain
fussing
about
and
listening
called
nikolay
parfenovitchs
attention
to
the
cap
which
they
were
also
fingering
you
remember
gridyenko
the
copyingclerk
observed
the
secretary
last
summer
he
received
the
wages
of
the
whole
office
and
pretended
to
have
lost
the
money
when
he
was
drunk
and
where
was
it
found
why
in
just
such
pipings
in
his
cap
the
hundredrouble
notes
were
screwed
up
in
little
rolls
and
sewed
in
the
piping
both
the
lawyers
remembered
gridyenkos
case
perfectly
and
so
laid
aside
mityas
cap
and
decided
that
all
his
clothes
must
be
more
thoroughly
examined
later
excuse
me
cried
nikolay
parfenovitch
suddenly
noticing
that
the
right
cuff
of
mityas
shirt
was
turned
in
and
covered
with
blood
excuse
me
whats
that
blood
yes
mitya
jerked
out
that
is
what
blood

and
why
is
the
cuff
turned
in
mitya
told
him
how
he
had
got
the
sleeve
stained
with
blood
looking
after
grigory
and
had
turned
it
inside
when
he
was
washing
his
hands
at
perhotins
you
must
take
off
your
shirt
too
thats
very
important
as
material
evidence
mitya
flushed
red
and
flew
into
a
rage
what
am
i
to
stay
naked
he
shouted
dont
disturb
yourself
we
will
arrange
something
and
meanwhile
take
off
your
socks
youre
not
joking
is
that
really
necessary
mityas
eyes
flashed
we
are
in
no
mood
for
joking
answered
nikolay
parfenovitch
sternly
well
if
i
must
muttered
mitya
and
sitting
down
on
the
bed
he
took
off
his
socks
he
felt
unbearably
awkward
all
were
clothed
while
he
was
naked
and
strange
to
say
when
he
was
undressed
he
felt
somehow
guilty
in
their
presence
and
was
almost
ready
to
believe
himself
that
he
was
inferior
to
them
and
that
now
they
had
a
perfect
right
to
despise
him
when
all
are
undressed
one
is
somehow
not
ashamed
but
when
ones
the
only
one
undressed
and
everybody
is
looking
its
degrading
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
again
and
again
its
like
a
dream
ive
sometimes
dreamed
of
being
in
such
degrading
positions
it
was
a
misery
to
him
to
take
off
his
socks
they
were
very
dirty
and
so
were
his
underclothes
and
now
every
one
could
see
it
and
what
was
worse
he
disliked
his
feet
all
his
life
he
had
thought
both
his
big
toes
hideous
he
particularly
loathed
the
coarse
flat
crooked
nail
on
the
right
one
and
now
they
would
all
see
it
feeling
intolerably
ashamed
made
him
at
once
and
intentionally
rougher
he
pulled
off
his
shirt
himself
would
you
like
to
look
anywhere
else
if
youre
not
ashamed
to
no
theres
no
need
to
at
present
well
am
i
to
stay
naked
like
this
he
added
savagely
yes
that
cant
be
helped
for
the
time
kindly
sit
down
here
for
a
while
you
can
wrap
yourself
in
a
quilt
from
the
bed
and
i

ill
see
to
all
this
all
the
things
were
shown
to
the
witnesses
the
report
of
the
search
was
drawn
up
and
at
last
nikolay
parfenovitch
went
out
and
the
clothes
were
carried
out
after
him
ippolit
kirillovitch
went
out
too
mitya
was
left
alone
with
the
peasants
who
stood
in
silence
never
taking
their
eyes
off
him
mitya
wrapped
himself
up
in
the
quilt
he
felt
cold
his
bare
feet
stuck
out
and
he
couldnt
pull
the
quilt
over
so
as
to
cover
them
nikolay
parfenovitch
seemed
to
be
gone
a
long
time
an
insufferable
time
he
thinks
of
me
as
a
puppy
thought
mitya
gnashing
his
teeth
that
rotten
prosecutor
has
gone
too
contemptuous
no
doubt
it
disgusts
him
to
see
me
naked
mitya
imagined
however
that
his
clothes
would
be
examined
and
returned
to
him
but
what
was
his
indignation
when
nikolay
parfenovitch
came
back
with
quite
different
clothes
brought
in
behind
him
by
a
peasant
here
are
clothes
for
you
he
observed
airily
seeming
well
satisfied
with
the
success
of
his
mission
mr
kalganov
has
kindly
provided
these
for
this
unusual
emergency
as
well
as
a
clean
shirt
luckily
he
had
them
all
in
his
trunk
you
can
keep
your
own
socks
and
underclothes
mitya
flew
into
a
passion
i
wont
have
other
peoples
clothes
he
shouted
menacingly
give
me
my
own
its
impossible
give
me
my
own
damn
kalganov
and
his
clothes
too
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
could
persuade
him
but
they
succeeded
somehow
in
quieting
him
down
they
impressed
upon
him
that
his
clothes
being
stained
with
blood
must
be
included
with
the
other
material
evidence
and
that
they
had
not
even
the
right
to
let
him
have
them
now

taking
into
consideration
the
possible
outcome
of
the
case
mitya
at
last
understood
this
he
subsided
into
gloomy
silence
and
hurriedly
dressed
himself
he
merely
observed
as
he
put
them
on
that
the
clothes
were
much
better
than
his
old
ones
and
that
he
disliked
gaining
by
the
change
the
coat
was
besides
ridiculously
tight
am
i
to
be
dressed
up
like
a
fool

for
your
amusement
they
urged
upon
him
again
that
he
was
exaggerating
that
kalganov
was
only
a
little
taller
so
that
only
the
trousers
might
be
a
little
too
long
but
the
coat
turned
out
to
be
really
tight
in
the
shoulders
damn
it
all
i
can
hardly
button
it
mitya
grumbled
be
so
good
as
to
tell
mr
kalganov
from
me
that
i
didnt
ask
for
his
clothes
and
its
not
my
doing
that
theyve
dressed
me
up
like
a
clown
he
understands
that
and
is
sorry

i
mean
not
sorry
to
lend
you
his
clothes
but
sorry
about
all
this
business
mumbled
nikolay
parfenovitch
confound
his
sorrow
well
where
now
am
i
to
go
on
sitting
here
he
was
asked
to
go
back
to
the
other
room
mitya
went
in
scowling
with
anger
and
trying
to
avoid
looking
at
any
one
dressed
in
another
mans
clothes
he
felt
himself
disgraced
even
in
the
eyes
of
the
peasants
and
of
trifon
borissovitch
whose
face
appeared
for
some
reason
in
the
doorway
and
vanished
immediately
hes
come
to
look
at
me
dressed
up
thought
mitya
he
sat
down
on
the
same
chair
as
before
he
had
an
absurd
nightmarish
feeling
as
though
he
were
out
of
his
mind
well
what
now
are
you
going
to
flog
me
thats
all
thats
left
for
you
he
said
clenching
his
teeth
and
addressing
the
prosecutor
he
would
not
turn
to
nikolay
parfenovitch
as
though
he
disdained
to
speak
to
him
he
looked
too
closely
at
my
socks
and
turned
them
inside
out
on
purpose
to
show
every
one
how
dirty
they
werethe
scoundrel
well
now
we
must
proceed
to
the
examination
of
witnesses
observed
nikolay
parfenovitch
as
though
in
reply
to
mityas
question
yes
said
the
prosecutor
thoughtfully
as
though
reflecting
on
something
weve
done
what
we
could
in
your
interest
dmitri
fyodorovitch
nikolay
parfenovitch
went
on
but
having
received
from
you
such
an
uncompromising
refusal
to
explain
to
us
the
source
from
which
you
obtained
the
money
found
upon
you
we
are
at
the
present
moment
what
is
the
stone
in
your
ring
mitya
interrupted
suddenly
as
though
awakening
from
a
reverie
he
pointed
to
one
of
the
three
large
rings
adorning
nikolay
parfenovitchs
right
hand
ring
repeated
nikolay
parfenovitch
with
surprise
yes
that
one

on
your
middle
finger
with
the
little
veins
in
it
what
stone
is
that
mitya
persisted
like
a
peevish
child
thats
a
smoky
topaz
said
nikolay
parfenovitch
smiling
would
you
like
to
look
at
it
ill
take
it
off

no
dont
take
it
off
cried
mitya
furiously
suddenly
waking
up
and
angry
with
himself
dont
take
it
off

theres
no
need
damn
it
gentlemen
youve
sullied
my
heart
can
you
suppose
that
i
would
conceal
it
from
you
if
i
had
really
killed
my
father
that
i
would
shuffle
lie
and
hide
myself
no
thats
not
like
dmitri
karamazov
that
he
couldnt
do
and
if
i
were
guilty
i
swear
i
shouldnt
have
waited
for
your
coming
or
for
the
sunrise
as
i
meant
at
first
but
should
have
killed
myself
before
this
without
waiting
for
the
dawn
i
know
that
about
myself
now
i
couldnt
have
learnt
so
much
in
twenty
years
as
ive
found
out
in
this
accursed
night
and
should
i
have
been
like
this
on
this
night
and
at
this
moment
sitting
with
you
could
i
have
talked
like
this
could
i
have
moved
like
this
could
i
have
looked
at
you
and
at
the
world
like
this
if
i
had
really
been
the
murderer
of
my
father
when
the
very
thought
of
having
accidentally
killed
grigory
gave
me
no
peace
all
nightnot
from
fearoh
not
simply
from
fear
of
your
punishment
the
disgrace
of
it
and
you
expect
me
to
be
open
with
such
scoffers
as
you
who
see
nothing
and
believe
in
nothing
blind
moles
and
scoffers
and
to

mitya
uttered
his
sudden
monologue
as
though
he
were
determined
to
be
absolutely
silent
for
the
future
the
prosecutor
watched
him
the
whole
time
and
only
when
he
had
ceased
speaking
observed
as
though
it
were
the
most
ordinary
thing
with
the
most
frigid
and
composed
air
oh
about
the
open
door
of
which
you
spoke
just
now
we
may
as
well
inform
you
by
the
way
now
of
a
very
interesting
piece
of
evidence
of
the
greatest
importance
both
to
you
and
to
us
that
has
been
given
us
by
grigory
the
old
man
you
wounded
on
his
recovery
he
clearly
and
emphatically
stated
in
reply
to
our
questions
that
when
on
coming
out
to
the
steps
and
hearing
a
noise
in
the
garden
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
into
it
through
the
little
gate
which
stood
open
before
he
noticed
you
running
as
you
have
told
us
already
in
the
dark
from
the
open
window
where
you
saw
your
father
he
grigory
glanced
to
the
left
and
while
noticing
the
open
window
observed
at
the
same
time
much
nearer
to
him
the
door
standing
wide
openthat
door
which
you
have
stated
to
have
been
shut
the
whole
time
you
were
in
the
garden
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
grigory
himself
confidently
affirms
and
bears
witness
that
you
must
have
run
from
that
door
though
of
course
he
did
not
see
you
do
so
with
his
own
eyes
since
he
only
noticed
you
first
some
distance
away
in
the
garden
running
towards
the
fence
mitya
had
leapt
up
from
his
chair
halfway
through
this
speech
nonsense
he
yelled
in
a
sudden
frenzy
its
a
barefaced
lie
he
couldnt
have
seen
the
door
open
because
it
was
shut
hes
lying
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
repeat
that
he
is
firm
in
his
statement
he
does
not
waver
he
adheres
to
it
weve
crossexamined
him
several
times
precisely
i
have
crossexamined
him
several
times
nikolay
parfenovitch
confirmed
warmly
its
false
false
its
either
an
attempt
to
slander
me
or
the
hallucination
of
a
madman
mitya
still
shouted
hes
simply
raving
from
loss
of
blood
from
the
wound
he
must
have
fancied
it
when
he
came
to
hes
raving
yes
but
he
noticed
the
open
door
not
when
he
came
to
after
his
injuries
but
before
that
as
soon
as
he
went
into
the
garden
from
the
lodge
but
its
false
its
false
it
cant
be
so
hes
slandering
me
from
spite
he
couldnt
have
seen
it

i
didnt
come
from
the
door
gasped
mitya
the
prosecutor
turned
to
nikolay
parfenovitch
and
said
to
him
impressively
confront
him
with
it
do
you
recognize
this
object
nikolay
parfenovitch
laid
upon
the
table
a
large
and
thick
official
envelope
on
which
three
seals
still
remained
intact
the
envelope
was
empty
and
slit
open
at
one
end
mitya
stared
at
it
with
open
eyes
it

it
must
be
that
envelope
of
my
fathers
the
envelope
that
contained
the
three
thousand
roubles

and
if
theres
inscribed
on
it
allow
me
for
my
little
chicken

yesthree
thousand
he
shouted
do
you
see
three
thousand
do
you
see
of
course
we
see
but
we
didnt
find
the
money
in
it
it
was
empty
and
lying
on
the
floor
by
the
bed
behind
the
screen
for
some
seconds
mitya
stood
as
though
thunderstruck
gentlemen
its
smerdyakov
he
shouted
suddenly
at
the
top
of
his
voice
its
he
whos
murdered
him
hes
robbed
him
no
one
else
knew
where
the
old
man
hid
the
envelope
its
smerdyakov
thats
clear
now
but
you
too
knew
of
the
envelope
and
that
it
was
under
the
pillow
i
never
knew
it
ive
never
seen
it
this
is
the
first
time
ive
looked
at
it
id
only
heard
of
it
from
smerdyakov
he
was
the
only
one
who
knew
where
the
old
man
kept
it
hidden
i
didnt
know

mitya
was
completely
breathless
but
you
told
us
yourself
that
the
envelope
was
under
your
deceased
fathers
pillow
you
especially
stated
that
it
was
under
the
pillow
so
you
must
have
known
it
weve
got
it
written
down
confirmed
nikolay
parfenovitch
nonsense
its
absurd
id
no
idea
it
was
under
the
pillow
and
perhaps
it
wasnt
under
the
pillow
at
all
it
was
just
a
chance
guess
that
it
was
under
the
pillow
what
does
smerdyakov
say
have
you
asked
him
where
it
was
what
does
smerdyakov
say
thats
the
chief
point
and
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
tell
lies
against
myself
i
told
you
without
thinking
that
it
was
under
the
pillow
and
now
you
oh
you
know
how
one
says
the
wrong
thing
without
meaning
it
no
one
knew
but
smerdyakov
only
smerdyakov
and
no
one
else
he
didnt
even
tell
me
where
it
was
but
its
his
doing
his
doing
theres
no
doubt
about
it
he
murdered
him
thats
as
clear
as
daylight
now
mitya
exclaimed
more
and
more
frantically
repeating
himself
incoherently
and
growing
more
and
more
exasperated
and
excited
you
must
understand
that
and
arrest
him
at
once
he
must
have
killed
him
while
i
was
running
away
and
while
grigory
was
unconscious
thats
clear
now
he
gave
the
signal
and
father
opened
to
him

for
no
one
but
he
knew
the
signal
and
without
the
signal
father
would
never
have
opened
the
door
but
youre
again
forgetting
the
circumstance
the
prosecutor
observed
still
speaking
with
the
same
restraint
though
with
a
note
of
triumph
that
there
was
no
need
to
give
the
signal
if
the
door
already
stood
open
when
you
were
there
while
you
were
in
the
garden
the
door
the
door
muttered
mitya
and
he
stared
speechless
at
the
prosecutor
he
sank
back
helpless
in
his
chair
all
were
silent
yes
the
door
its
a
nightmare
god
is
against
me
he
exclaimed
staring
before
him
in
complete
stupefaction
come
you
see
the
prosecutor
went
on
with
dignity
and
you
can
judge
for
yourself
dmitri
fyodorovitch
on
the
one
hand
we
have
the
evidence
of
the
open
door
from
which
you
ran
out
a
fact
which
overwhelms
you
and
us
on
the
other
side
your
incomprehensible
persistent
and
so
to
speak
obdurate
silence
with
regard
to
the
source
from
which
you
obtained
the
money
which
was
so
suddenly
seen
in
your
hands
when
only
three
hours
earlier
on
your
own
showing
you
pledged
your
pistols
for
the
sake
of
ten
roubles
in
view
of
all
these
facts
judge
for
yourself
what
are
we
to
believe
and
what
can
we
depend
upon
and
dont
accuse
us
of
being
frigid
cynical
scoffing
people
who
are
incapable
of
believing
in
the
generous
impulses
of
your
heart
try
to
enter
into
our
position

mitya
was
indescribably
agitated
he
turned
pale
very
well
he
exclaimed
suddenly
i
will
tell
you
my
secret
ill
tell
you
where
i
got
the
money
ill
reveal
my
shame
that
i
may
not
have
to
blame
myself
or
you
hereafter
and
believe
me
dmitri
fyodorovitch
put
in
nikolay
parfenovitch
in
a
voice
of
almost
pathetic
delight
that
every
sincere
and
complete
confession
on
your
part
at
this
moment
may
later
on
have
an
immense
influence
in
your
favor
and
may
indeed
moreover
but
the
prosecutor
gave
him
a
slight
shove
under
the
table
and
he
checked
himself
in
time
mitya
it
is
true
had
not
heard
him
chapter
vii
mityas
great
secret
received
with
hisses
gentlemen
he
began
still
in
the
same
agitation
i
want
to
make
a
full
confession
that
money
was
my
own
the
lawyers
faces
lengthened
that
was
not
at
all
what
they
expected
how
do
you
mean
faltered
nikolay
parfenovitch
when
at
five
oclock
on
the
same
day
from
your
own
confession
damn
five
oclock
on
the
same
day
and
my
own
confession
thats
nothing
to
do
with
it
now
that
money
was
my
own
my
own
that
is
stolen
by
me

not
mine
i
mean
but
stolen
by
me
and
it
was
fifteen
hundred
roubles
and
i
had
it
on
me
all
the
time
all
the
time

but
where
did
you
get
it
i
took
it
off
my
neck
gentlemen
off
this
very
neck

it
was
here
round
my
neck
sewn
up
in
a
rag
and
id
had
it
round
my
neck
a
long
time
its
a
month
since
i
put
it
round
my
neck

to
my
shame
and
disgrace
and
from
whom
did
you

appropriate
it
you
mean
steal
it
speak
out
plainly
now
yes
i
consider
that
i
practically
stole
it
but
if
you
prefer
i
appropriated
it
i
consider
i
stole
it
and
last
night
i
stole
it
finally
last
night
but
you
said
that
its
a
month
since
you

obtained
it
yes
but
not
from
my
father
not
from
my
father
dont
be
uneasy
i
didnt
steal
it
from
my
father
but
from
her
let
me
tell
you
without
interrupting
its
hard
to
do
you
know
you

a
month
ago
i
was
sent
for
by
katerina
ivanovna

betrothed

her
yes
of
course
i
know
you
know
her
shes
a
noble
creature
noblest
of
the
noble
but
she
has
hated
me
ever
so
long
oh
ever
so
long

and
hated
me
with
good
reason
good
reason
katerina
ivanovna
nikolay
parfenovitch
exclaimed
with
wonder
the
prosecutor
too
stared
oh
dont
take
her
name
in
vain
im
a
scoundrel
to
bring
her
into
it
yes
ive
seen
that
she
hated
me

a
long
while
from
the
very
first
even
that
evening
at
my
lodging

but
enough
enough
youre
unworthy
even
to
know
of
that
no
need
of
that
at
all
i
need
only
tell
you
that
she
sent
for
me
a
month
ago
gave
me
three
thousand
roubles
to
send
off
to
her
sister
and
another
relation
in
moscow
as
though
she
couldnt
have
sent
it
off
herself
and
i

it
was
just
at
that
fatal
moment
in
my
life
when
i

well
in
fact
when
id
just
come
to
love
another
her
shes
sitting
down
below
now
grushenka
i
carried
her
off
here
to
mokroe
then
and
wasted
here
in
two
days
half
that
damned
three
thousand
but
the
other
half
i
kept
on
me
well
ive
kept
that
other
half
that
fifteen
hundred
like
a
locket
round
my
neck
but
yesterday
i
undid
it
and
spent
it
whats
left
of

hundred
roubles

your
hands

the
change

of
the
fifteen

hows
that
why
when
you

that
who
knows
it
who
counted
the
money
did
i
let
any
one

exactly
three
thousand
its
true
i
did
i
told
the
whole
town

and
the
whole
town

and
here
at
mokroe
too
every
one
reckoned
it
was
three
thousand
yet
i
didnt
spend
three
thousand
but
fifteen
hundred
and
the
other
fifteen
hundred

into
a
little
bag
thats
how
it
was
gentlemen

where
i
got
that
money

is
almost
miraculous
murmured
nikolay
parfenovitch

me
to
inquire

the
prosecutor

last

circumstance

left
about
you
a
month

no
one
and
nobody
what
was
your
reason
for
this
reticence
what
was
your
motive
for
making
such
a
secret
of
it
to
be
more
precise
you
have
told
us
at
last
your
secret
in
your
words
so
disgraceful
though
in
realitythat
is
of
course
comparatively
speakingthis
action
that
is
the
appropriation
of
three
thousand
roubles
belonging
to
some
one
else
and
of
course
only
for
a
time
is
in
my
view
at
least
only
an
act
of
the
greatest
recklessness
and
not
so
disgraceful
when
one
takes
into
consideration
your
character
even
admitting
that
it
was
an
action
in
the
highest
degree
discreditable
still
discreditable
is
not
disgraceful
many
people
have
already
guessed
during
this
last
month
about
the
three
thousand
of
katerina
ivanovnas
that
you
have
spent
and
i
heard
the
legend
myself
apart
from
your
confession
mihail
makarovitch
for
instance
had
heard
it
too
so
that
indeed
it
was
scarcely
a
legend
but
the
gossip
of
the
whole
town
there
are
indications
too
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
you
confessed
this
yourself
to
some
one
i
mean
that
the
money
was
katerina
ivanovnas
and
so
its
extremely
surprising
to
me
that
hitherto
that
is
up
to
the
present
moment
you
have
made
such
an
extraordinary
secret
of
the
fifteen
hundred
you
say
you
put
by
apparently
connecting
a
feeling
of
positive
horror
with
that
secret
its
not
easy
to
believe
that
it
could
cost
you
such
distress
to
confess
such
a
secret
you
cried
out
just
now
that
siberia
would
be
better
than
confessing
it

the
prosecutor
ceased
speaking
he
was
provoked
he
did
not
conceal
his
vexation
which
was
almost
anger
and
gave
vent
to
all
his
accumulated
spleen
disconnectedly
and
incoherently
without
choosing
words
its
not
the
fifteen
hundred
thats
the
disgrace
but
that
i
put
it
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
three
thousand
said
mitya
firmly
why
smiled
the
prosecutor
irritably
what
is
there
disgraceful
to
your
thinking
in
your
having
set
aside
half
of
the
three
thousand
you
had
discreditably
if
you
prefer
disgracefully
appropriated
your
taking
the
three
thousand
is
more
important
than
what
you
did
with
it
and
by
the
way
why
did
you
do
thatwhy
did
you
set
apart
that
half
for
what
purpose
for
what
object
did
you
do
it
can
you
explain
that
to
us
oh
gentlemen
the
purpose
is
the
whole
point
cried
mitya
i
put
it
aside
because
i
was
vile
that
is
because
i
was
calculating
and
to
be
calculating
in
such
a
case
is
vile

and
that
vileness
has
been
going
on
a
whole
month
its
incomprehensible
i
wonder
at
you
but
ill
make
it
clearer
perhaps
it
really
is
incomprehensible
you
see
attend
to
what
i
say
i
appropriate
three
thousand
entrusted
to
my
honor
i
spend
it
on
a
spree
say
i
spend
it
all
and
next
morning
i
go
to
her
and
say
katya
ive
done
wrong
ive
squandered
your
three
thousand
well
is
that
right
no
its
not
rightits
dishonest
and
cowardly
im
a
beast
with
no
more
selfcontrol
than
a
beast
thats
so
isnt
it
but
still
im
not
a
thief
not
a
downright
thief
youll
admit
i
squandered
it
but
i
didnt
steal
it
now
a
second
rather
more
favorable
alternative
follow
me
carefully
or
i
may
get
confused
againmy
heads
going
roundand
so
for
the
second
alternative
i
spend
here
only
fifteen
hundred
out
of
the
three
thousand
that
is
only
half
next
day
i
go
and
take
that
half
to
her
katya
take
this
fifteen
hundred
from
me
im
a
low
beast
and
an
untrustworthy
scoundrel
for
ive
wasted
half
the
money
and
i
shall
waste
this
too
so
keep
me
from
temptation
well
what
of
that
alternative
i
should
be
a
beast
and
a
scoundrel
and
whatever
you
like
but
not
a
thief
not
altogether
a
thief
or
i
should
not
have
brought
back
what
was
left
but
have
kept
that
too
she
would
see
at
once
that
since
i
brought
back
half
i
should
pay
back
what
id
spent
that
i
should
never
give
up
trying
to
that
i
should
work
to
get
it
and
pay
it
back
so
in
that
case
i
should
be
a
scoundrel
but
not
a
thief
you
may
say
what
you
like
not
a
thief
i
admit
that
there
is
a
certain
distinction
said
the
prosecutor
with
a
cold
smile
but
its
strange
that
you
see
such
a
vital
difference
yes
i
see
a
vital
difference
every
man
may
be
a
scoundrel
and
perhaps
every
man
is
a
scoundrel
but
not
every
one
can
be
a
thief
it
takes
an
archscoundrel
to
be
that
oh
of
course
i
dont
know
how
to
make
these
fine
distinctions

but
a
thief
is
lower
than
a
scoundrel
thats
my
conviction
listen
i
carry
the
money
about
me
a
whole
month
i
may
make
up
my
mind
to
give
it
back
tomorrow
and
im
a
scoundrel
no
longer
but
i
cannot
make
up
my
mind
you
see
though
im
making
up
my
mind
every
day
and
every
day
spurring
myself
on
to
do
it
and
yet
for
a
whole
month
i
cant
bring
myself
to
it
you
see
is
that
right
to
your
thinking
is
that
right
certainly
thats
not
right
that
i
can
quite
understand
and
that
i
dont
dispute
answered
the
prosecutor
with
reserve
and
let
us
give
up
all
discussion
of
these
subtleties
and
distinctions
and
if
you
will
be
so
kind
get
back
to
the
point
and
the
point
is
that
you
have
still
not
told
us
altogether
weve
asked
you
why
in
the
first
place
you
halved
the
money
squandering
one
half
and
hiding
the
other
for
what
purpose
exactly
did
you
hide
it
what
did
you
mean
to
do
with
that
fifteen
hundred
i
insist
upon
that
question
dmitri
fyodorovitch
yes
of
course
cried
mitya
striking
himself
on
the
forehead
forgive
me
im
worrying
you
and
am
not
explaining
the
chief
point
or
youd
understand
in
a
minute
for
its
just
the
motive
of
it
thats
the
disgrace
you
see
it
was
all
to
do
with
the
old
man
my
dead
father
he
was
always
pestering
agrafena
alexandrovna
and
i
was
jealous
i
thought
then
that
she
was
hesitating
between
me
and
him
so
i
kept
thinking
every
day
suppose
she
were
to
make
up
her
mind
all
of
a
sudden
suppose
she
were
to
leave
off
tormenting
me
and
were
suddenly
to
say
to
me
i
love
you
not
him
take
me
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
and
id
only
forty
copecks
how
could
i
take
her
away
what
could
i
do
why
id
be
lost
you
see
i
didnt
know
her
then
i
didnt
understand
her
i
thought
she
wanted
money
and
that
she
wouldnt
forgive
my
poverty
and
so
i
fiendishly
counted
out
the
half
of
that
three
thousand
sewed
it
up
calculating
on
it
sewed
it
up
before
i
was
drunk
and
after
i
had
sewn
it
up
i
went
off
to
get
drunk
on
the
rest
yes
that
was
base
do
you
understand
now
both
the
lawyers
laughed
aloud
i
should
have
called
it
sensible
and
moral
on
your
part
not
to
have
squandered
it
all
chuckled
nikolay
parfenovitch
for
after
all
what
does
it
amount
to
why
that
i
stole
it
thats
what
it
amounts
to
oh
god
you
horrify
me
by
not
understanding
every
day
that
i
had
that
fifteen
hundred
sewn
up
round
my
neck
every
day
and
every
hour
i
said
to
myself
youre
a
thief
youre
a
thief
yes
thats
why
ive
been
so
savage
all
this
month
thats
why
i
fought
in
the
tavern
thats
why
i
attacked
my
father
it
was
because
i
felt
i
was
a
thief
i
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
i
didnt
dare
even
to
tell
alyosha
my
brother
about
that
fifteen
hundred
i
felt
i
was
such
a
scoundrel
and
such
a
pickpocket
but
do
you
know
while
i
carried
it
i
said
to
myself
at
the
same
time
every
hour
no
dmitri
fyodorovitch
you
may
yet
not
be
a
thief
why
because
i
might
go
next
day
and
pay
back
that
fifteen
hundred
to
katya
and
only
yesterday
i
made
up
my
mind
to
tear
my
amulet
off
my
neck
on
my
way
from
fenyas
to
perhotin
i
hadnt
been
able
till
that
moment
to
bring
myself
to
it
and
it
was
only
when
i
tore
it
off
that
i
became
a
downright
thief
a
thief
and
a
dishonest
man
for
the
rest
of
my
life
why
because
with
that
i
destroyed
too
my
dream
of
going
to
katya
and
saying
im
a
scoundrel
but
not
a
thief
do
you
understand
now
do
you
understand
what
was
it
made
you
decide
to
do
it
yesterday
nikolay
parfenovitch
interrupted
why
its
absurd
to
ask
because
i
had
condemned
myself
to
die
at
five
oclock
this
morning
here
at
dawn
i
thought
it
made
no
difference
whether
i
died
a
thief
or
a
man
of
honor
but
i
see
its
not
so
it
turns
out
that
it
does
make
a
difference
believe
me
gentlemen
what
has
tortured
me
most
during
this
night
has
not
been
the
thought
that
id
killed
the
old
servant
and
that
i
was
in
danger
of
siberia
just
when
my
love
was
being
rewarded
and
heaven
was
open
to
me
again
oh
that
did
torture
me
but
not
in
the
same
way
not
so
much
as
the
damned
consciousness
that
i
had
torn
that
damned
money
off
my
breast
at
last
and
spent
it
and
had
become
a
downright
thief
oh
gentlemen
i
tell
you
again
with
a
bleeding
heart
i
have
learnt
a
great
deal
this
night
i
have
learnt
that
its
not
only
impossible
to
live
a
scoundrel
but
impossible
to
die
a
scoundrel
no
gentlemen
one
must
die
honest
mitya
was
pale
his
face
had
a
haggard
and
exhausted
look
in
spite
of
his
being
intensely
excited
i
am
beginning
to
understand
you
dmitri
fyodorovitch
the
prosecutor
said
slowly
in
a
soft
and
almost
compassionate
tone
but
all
this
if
youll
excuse
my
saying
so
is
a
matter
of
nerves
in
my
opinion

your
overwrought
nerves
thats
what
it
is
and
why
for
instance
should
you
not
have
saved
yourself
such
misery
for
almost
a
month
by
going
and
returning
that
fifteen
hundred
to
the
lady
who
had
entrusted
it
to
you
and
why
could
you
not
have
explained
things
to
her
and
in
view
of
your
position
which
you
describe
as
being
so
awful
why
could
you
not
have
had
recourse
to
the
plan
which
would
so
naturally
have
occurred
to
ones
mind
that
is
after
honorably
confessing
your
errors
to
her
why
could
you
not
have
asked
her
to
lend
you
the
sum
needed
for
your
expenses
which
with
her
generous
heart
she
would
certainly
not
have
refused
you
in
your
distress
especially
if
it
had
been
with
some
guarantee
or
even
on
the
security
you
offered
to
the
merchant
samsonov
and
to
madame
hohlakov
i
suppose
you
still
regard
that
security
as
of
value
mitya
suddenly
crimsoned
surely
you
dont
think
me
such
an
out
and
out
scoundrel
as
that
you
cant
be
speaking
in
earnest
he
said
with
indignation
looking
the
prosecutor
straight
in
the
face
and
seeming
unable
to
believe
his
ears
i
assure
you
im
in
earnest
why
do
you
imagine
im
not
serious
it
was
the
prosecutors
turn
to
be
surprised
oh
how
base
that
would
have
been
gentlemen
do
you
know
you
are
torturing
me
let
me
tell
you
everything
so
be
it
ill
confess
all
my
infernal
wickedness
but
to
put
you
to
shame
and
youll
be
surprised
yourselves
at
the
depth
of
ignominy
to
which
a
medley
of
human
passions
can
sink
you
must
know
that
i
already
had
that
plan
myself
that
plan
you
spoke
of
just
now
prosecutor
yes
gentlemen
i
too
have
had
that
thought
in
my
mind
all
this
current
month
so
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
deciding
to
go
to
katyai
was
mean
enough
for
that
but
to
go
to
her
to
tell
her
of
my
treachery
and
for
that
very
treachery
to
carry
it
out
for
the
expenses
of
that
treachery
to
beg
for
money
from
her
katya
to
beg
do
you
hear
to
beg
and
go
straight
from
her
to
run
away
with
the
other
the
rival
who
hated
and
insulted
herto
think
of
it
you
must
be
mad
prosecutor
mad
i
am
not
but
i
did
speak
in
haste
without
thinking

of
that
feminine
jealousy

if
there
could
be
jealousy
in
this
case
as
you
assert

yes
perhaps
there
is
something
of
the
kind
said
the
prosecutor
smiling
but
that
would
have
been
so
infamous
mitya
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
fiercely
that
would
have
been
filthy
beyond
everything
yes
do
you
know
that
she
might
have
given
me
that
money
yes
and
she
would
have
given
it
too
shed
have
been
certain
to
give
it
to
be
revenged
on
me
shed
have
given
it
to
satisfy
her
vengeance
to
show
her
contempt
for
me
for
hers
is
an
infernal
nature
too
and
shes
a
woman
of
great
wrath
id
have
taken
the
money
too
oh
i
should
have
taken
it
i
should
have
taken
it
and
then
for
the
rest
of
my
life

oh
god
forgive
me
gentlemen
im
making
such
an
outcry
because
ive
had
that
thought
in
my
mind
so
lately
only
the
day
before
yesterday
that
night
when
i
was
having
all
that
bother
with
lyagavy
and
afterwards
yesterday
all
day
yesterday
i
remember
till
that
happened

till
what
happened
put
in
nikolay
parfenovitch
inquisitively
but
mitya
did
not
hear
it
i
have
made
you
an
awful
confession
mitya
said
gloomily
in
conclusion
you
must
appreciate
it
and
whats
more
you
must
respect
it
for
if
not
if
that
leaves
your
souls
untouched
then
youve
simply
no
respect
for
me
gentlemen
i
tell
you
that
and
i
shall
die
of
shame
at
having
confessed
it
to
men
like
you
oh
i
shall
shoot
myself
yes
i
see
i
see
already
that
you
dont
believe
me
what
you
want
to
write
that
down
too
he
cried
in
dismay
yes
what
you
said
just
now
said
nikolay
parfenovitch
looking
at
him
in
surprise
that
is
that
up
to
the
last
hour
you
were
still
contemplating
going
to
katerina
ivanovna
to
beg
that
sum
from
her
i
assure
you
thats
a
very
important
piece
of
evidence
for
us
dmitri
fyodorovitch
i
mean
for
the
whole
case

and
particularly
for
you
particularly
important
for
you
have
mercy
gentlemen
mitya
flung
up
his
hands
dont
write
that
anyway
have
some
shame
here
ive
torn
my
heart
asunder
before
you
and
you
seize
the
opportunity
and
are
fingering
the
wounds
in
both
halves
oh
my
god
in
despair
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
dont
worry
yourself
so
dmitri
fyodorovitch
observed
the
prosecutor
everything
that
is
written
down
will
be
read
over
to
you
afterwards
and
what
you
dont
agree
to
well
alter
as
you
like
but
now
ill
ask
you
one
little
question
for
the
second
time
has
no
one
absolutely
no
one
heard
from
you
of
that
money
you
sewed
up
that
i
must
tell
you
is
almost
impossible
to
believe
no
one
no
one
i
told
you
so
before
or
youve
not
understood
anything
let
me
alone
very
well
this
matter
is
bound
to
be
explained
and
theres
plenty
of
time
for
it
but
meantime
consider
we
have
perhaps
a
dozen
witnesses
that
you
yourself
spread
it
abroad
and
even
shouted
almost
everywhere
about
the
three
thousand
youd
spent
here
three
thousand
not
fifteen
hundred
and
now
too
when
you
got
hold
of
the
money
you
had
yesterday
you
gave
many
people
to
understand
that
you
had
brought
three
thousand
with
you
youve
got
not
dozens
but
hundreds
of
witnesses
two
hundred
witnesses
two
hundred
have
heard
it
thousands
have
heard
it
cried
mitya
well
you
see
all
bear
witness
to
it
and
the
word
all
means
something
it
means
nothing
i
talked
rot
and
every
one
began
repeating
it
but
what
need
had
you
to
talk
rot
as
you
call
it
the
devil
knows
from
bravado
perhaps

at
having
wasted
so
much
money
to
try
and
forget
that
money
i
had
sewn
up
perhaps

yes
that
was
why

damn
it

how
often
will
you
ask
me
that
question
well
i
told
a
fib
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
once
id
said
it
i
didnt
care
to
correct
it
what
does
a
man
tell
lies
for
sometimes
thats
very
difficult
to
decide
dmitri
fyodorovitch
what
makes
a
man
tell
lies
observed
the
prosecutor
impressively
tell
me
though
was
that
amulet
as
you
call
it
on
your
neck
a
big
thing
no
not
big
how
big
for
instance
if
you
fold
a
hundredrouble
note
in
half
that
would
be
the
size
youd
better
show
us
the
remains
of
it
you
must
have
them
somewhere
damnation
what
nonsense
i
dont
know
where
they
are
but
excuse
me
where
and
when
did
you
take
it
off
your
neck
according
to
your
own
evidence
you
didnt
go
home
when
i
was
going
from
fenyas
to
perhotins
on
the
way
i
tore
it
off
my
neck
and
took
out
the
money
in
the
dark
what
should
i
want
a
light
for
i
did
it
with
my
fingers
in
one
minute
without
scissors
in
the
street
in
the
marketplace
i
think
it
was
why
scissors
it
was
an
old
rag
it
was
torn
in
a
minute
where
did
you
put
it
afterwards
i
dropped
it
there
where
was
it
exactly
in
the
marketplace
in
the
marketplace
the
devil
knows
whereabouts
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
thats
extremely
important
dmitri
fyodorovitch
it
would
be
material
evidence
in
your
favor
how
is
it
you
dont
understand
that
who
helped
you
to
sew
it
up
a
month
ago
no
one
helped
me
i
did
it
myself
can
you
sew
a
soldier
has
to
know
how
to
sew
no
knowledge
was
needed
to
do
that
where
did
you
get
the
material
that
is
the
rag
in
which
you
sewed
the
money
are
you
laughing
at
me
not
at
all
and
we
are
in
no
mood
for
laughing
dmitri
fyodorovitch
i
dont
know
where
i
got
the
rag
fromsomewhere
i
suppose
i
should
have
thought
you
couldnt
have
forgotten
it
upon
my
word
i
dont
remember
i
might
have
torn
a
bit
off
my
linen
thats
very
interesting
we
might
find
in
your
lodgings
tomorrow
the
shirt
or
whatever
it
is
from
which
you
tore
the
rag
what
sort
of
rag
was
it
cloth
or
linen
goodness
only
knows
what
it
was
wait
a
bit
i
believe
i
didnt
tear
it
off
anything
it
was
a
bit
of
calico
i
believe
i
sewed
it
up
in
a
cap
of
my
landladys
in
your
landladys
cap
yes
i
took
it
from
her
how
did
you
get
it
you
see
i
remember
once
taking
a
cap
for
a
rag
perhaps
to
wipe
my
pen
on
i
took
it
without
asking
because
it
was
a
worthless
rag
i
tore
it
up
and
i
took
the
notes
and
sewed
them
up
in
it
i
believe
it
was
in
that
very
rag
i
sewed
them
an
old
piece
of
calico
washed
a
thousand
times
and
you
remember
that
for
certain
now
i
dont
know
whether
for
certain
i
think
it
was
in
the
cap
but
hang
it
what
does
it
matter
in
that
case
your
landlady
will
remember
that
the
thing
was
lost
no
she
wont
she
didnt
miss
it
it
was
an
old
rag
i
tell
you
an
old
rag
not
worth
a
farthing
and
where
did
you
get
the
needle
and
thread
ill
stop
now
i
wont
say
any
more
enough
of
it
said
mitya
losing
his
temper
at
last
its
strange
that
you
should
have
so
completely
forgotten
where
you
threw
the
pieces
in
the
marketplace
give
orders
for
the
marketplace
to
be
swept
tomorrow
and
perhaps
youll
find
it
said
mitya
sneering
enough
gentlemen
enough
he
decided
in
an
exhausted
voice
i
see
you
dont
believe
me
not
for
a
moment
its
my
fault
not
yours
i
ought
not
to
have
been
so
ready
why
why
did
i
degrade
myself
by
confessing
my
secret
to
you
its
a
joke
to
you
i
see
that
from
your
eyes
you
led
me
on
to
it
prosecutor
sing
a
hymn
of
triumph
if
you
can
damn
you
you
torturers
he
bent
his
head
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
the
lawyers
were
silent
a
minute
later
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
them
almost
vacantly
his
face
now
expressed
complete
hopeless
despair
and
he
sat
mute
and
passive
as
though
hardly
conscious
of
what
was
happening
in
the
meantime
they
had
to
finish
what
they
were
about
they
had
immediately
to
begin
examining
the
witnesses
it
was
by
now
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
the
lights
had
been
extinguished
long
ago
mihail
makarovitch
and
kalganov
who
had
been
continually
in
and
out
of
the
room
all
the
while
the
interrogation
had
been
going
on
had
now
both
gone
out
again
the
lawyers
too
looked
very
tired
it
was
a
wretched
morning
the
whole
sky
was
overcast
and
the
rain
streamed
down
in
bucketfuls
mitya
gazed
blankly
out
of
the
window
may
i
look
out
of
the
window
he
asked
nikolay
parfenovitch
suddenly
oh
as
much
as
you
like
the
latter
replied
mitya
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
the
rain
lashed
against
its
little
greenish
panes
he
could
see
the
muddy
road
just
below
the
house
and
farther
away
in
the
rain
and
mist
a
row
of
poor
black
dismal
huts
looking
even
blacker
and
poorer
in
the
rain
mitya
thought
of
phbus
the
goldenhaired
and
how
he
had
meant
to
shoot
himself
at
his
first
ray
perhaps
it
would
be
even
better
on
a
morning
like
this
he
thought
with
a
smile
and
suddenly
flinging
his
hand
downwards
he
turned
to
his
torturers
gentlemen
he
cried
i
see
that
i
am
lost
but
she
tell
me
about
her
i
beseech
you
surely
she
need
not
be
ruined
with
me
shes
innocent
you
know
she
was
out
of
her
mind
when
she
cried
last
night
its
all
my
fault
shes
done
nothing
nothing
ive
been
grieving
over
her
all
night
as
i
sat
with
you
cant
you
wont
you
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
her
now
you
can
set
your
mind
quite
at
rest
on
that
score
dmitri
fyodorovitch
the
prosecutor
answered
at
once
with
evident
alacrity
we
have
so
far
no
grounds
for
interfering
with
the
lady
in
whom
you
are
so
interested
i
trust
that
it
may
be
the
same
in
the
later
development
of
the
case
on
the
contrary
well
do
everything
that
lies
in
our
power
in
that
matter
set
your
mind
completely
at
rest
gentlemen
i
thank
you
i
knew
that
you
were
honest
straightforward
people
in
spite
of
everything
youve
taken
a
load
off
my
heart
well
what
are
we
to
do
now
im
ready
well
we
ought
to
make
haste
we
must
pass
to
examining
the
witnesses
without
delay
that
must
be
done
in
your
presence
and
therefore
shouldnt
we
have
some
tea
first
interposed
nikolay
parfenovitch
i
think
weve
deserved
it
they
decided
that
if
tea
were
ready
downstairs
mihail
makarovitch
had
no
doubt
gone
down
to
get
some
they
would
have
a
glass
and
then
go
on
and
on
putting
off
their
proper
breakfast
until
a
more
favorable
opportunity
tea
really
was
ready
below
and
was
soon
brought
up
mitya
at
first
refused
the
glass
that
nikolay
parfenovitch
politely
offered
him
but
afterwards
he
asked
for
it
himself
and
drank
it
greedily
he
looked
surprisingly
exhausted
it
might
have
been
supposed
from
his
herculean
strength
that
one
night
of
carousing
even
accompanied
by
the
most
violent
emotions
could
have
had
little
effect
on
him
but
he
felt
that
he
could
hardly
hold
his
head
up
and
from
time
to
time
all
the
objects
about
him
seemed
heaving
and
dancing
before
his
eyes

little

chapter
viii
the
evidence
of
the
witnesses
the
babe
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
began
but
we
will
not
continue
our
story
in
such
detail
as
before
and
so
we
will
not
dwell
on
how
nikolay
parfenovitch
impressed
on
every
witness
called
that
he
must
give
his
evidence
in
accordance
with
truth
and
conscience
and
that
he
would
afterwards
have
to
repeat
his
evidence
on
oath
how
every
witness
was
called
upon
to
sign
the
protocol
of
his
evidence
and
so
on
we
will
only
note
that
the
point
principally
insisted
upon
in
the
examination
was
the
question
of
the
three
thousand
roubles
that
is
was
the
sum
spent
here
at
mokroe
by
mitya
on
the
first
occasion
a
month
before
three
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
and
again
had
he
spent
three
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
yesterday
alas
all
the
evidence
given
by
every
one
turned
out
to
be
against
mitya
there
was
not
one
in
his
favor
and
some
witnesses
introduced
new
almost
crushing
facts
in
contradiction
of
his
mityas
story
the
first
witness
examined
was
trifon
borissovitch
he
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
as
he
stood
before
the
lawyers
he
had
on
the
contrary
an
air
of
stern
and
severe
indignation
with
the
accused
which
gave
him
an
appearance
of
truthfulness
and
personal
dignity
he
spoke
little
and
with
reserve
waited
to
be
questioned
answered
precisely
and
deliberately
firmly
and
unhesitatingly
he
bore
witness
that
the
sum
spent
a
month
before
could
not
have
been
less
than
three
thousand
that
all
the
peasants
about
here
would
testify
that
they
had
heard
the
sum
of
three
thousand
mentioned
by
dmitri
fyodorovitch
himself
what
a
lot
of
money
he
flung
away
on
the
gypsy
girls
alone
he
wasted
a
thousand
i
daresay
on
them
alone
i
dont
believe
i
gave
them
five
hundred
was
mityas
gloomy
comment
on
this
its
a
pity
i
didnt
count
the
money
at
the
time
but
i
was
drunk
mitya
was
sitting
sideways
with
his
back
to
the
curtains
he
listened
gloomily
with
a
melancholy
and
exhausted
air
as
though
he
would
say
oh
say
what
you
like
it
makes
no
difference
now
more
than
a
thousand
went
on
them
dmitri
fyodorovitch
retorted
trifon
borissovitch
firmly
you
flung
it
about
at
random
and
they
picked
it
up
they
were
a
rascally
thievish
lot
horsestealers
theyve
been
driven
away
from
here
or
maybe
theyd
bear
witness
themselves
how
much
they
got
from
you
i
saw
the
sum
in
your
hands
myselfcount
it
i
didnt
you
didnt
let
me
thats
true
enoughbut
by
the
look
of
it
i
should
say
it
was
far
more
than
fifteen
hundred

fifteen
hundred
indeed
weve
seen
money
too
we
can
judge
of
amounts
as
for
the
sum
spent
yesterday
he
asserted
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
told
him
as
soon
as
he
arrived
that
he
had
brought
three
thousand
with
him
come
now
is
that
so
trifon
borissovitch
replied
mitya
surely
i
didnt
declare
so
positively
that
id
brought
three
thousand
you
did
say
so
dmitri
fyodorovitch
you
said
it
before
andrey
andrey
himself
is
still
here
send
for
him
and
in
the
hall
when
you
were
treating
the
chorus
you
shouted
straight
out
that
you
would
leave
your
sixth
thousand
herethat
is
with
what
you
spent
before
we
must
understand
stepan
and
semyon
heard
it
and
pyotr
fomitch
kalganov
too
was
standing
beside
you
at
the
time
maybe
hed
remember
it
the
evidence
as
to
the
sixth
thousand
made
an
extraordinary
impression
on
the
two
lawyers
they
were
delighted
with
this
new
mode
of
reckoning
three
and
three
made
six
three
thousand
then
and
three
now
made
six
that
was
clear
they
questioned
all
the
peasants
suggested
by
trifon
borissovitch
stepan
and
semyon
the
driver
andrey
and
kalganov
the
peasants
and
the
driver
unhesitatingly
confirmed
trifon
borissovitchs
evidence
they
noted
down
with
particular
care
andreys
account
of
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
mitya
on
the
road

where
says
he
am
i
dmitri
fyodorovitch
going
to
heaven
or
to
hell
and
shall
i
be
forgiven
in
the
next
world
or
not

the
psychological
ippolit
kirillovitch
heard
this
with
a
subtle
smile
and
ended
by
recommending
that
these
remarks
as
to
where
dmitri
fyodorovitch
would
go
should
be
included
in
the
case
kalganov
when
called
came
in
reluctantly
frowning
and
illhumored
and
he
spoke
to
the
lawyers
as
though
he
had
never
met
them
before
in
his
life
though
they
were
acquaintances
whom
he
had
been
meeting
every
day
for
a
long
time
past
he
began
by
saying
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
didnt
want
to
but
it
appeared
that
he
had
heard
of
the
sixth
thousand
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
standing
close
by
at
the
moment
as
far
as
he
could
see
he
didnt
know
how
much
money
mitya
had
in
his
hands
he
affirmed
that
the
poles
had
cheated
at
cards
in
reply
to
reiterated
questions
he
stated
that
after
the
poles
had
been
turned
out
mityas
position
with
agrafena
alexandrovna
had
certainly
improved
and
that
she
had
said
that
she
loved
him
he
spoke
of
agrafena
alexandrovna
with
reserve
and
respect
as
though
she
had
been
a
lady
of
the
best
society
and
did
not
once
allow
himself
to
call
her
grushenka
in
spite
of
the
young
mans
obvious
repugnance
at
giving
evidence
ippolit
kirillovitch
examined
him
at
great
length
and
only
from
him
learnt
all
the
details
of
what
made
up
mityas
romance
so
to
say
on
that
night
mitya
did
not
once
pull
kalganov
up
at
last
they
let
the
young
man
go
and
he
left
the
room
with
unconcealed
indignation
the
poles
too
were
examined
though
they
had
gone
to
bed
in
their
room
they
had
not
slept
all
night
and
on
the
arrival
of
the
police
officers
they
hastily
dressed
and
got
ready
realizing
that
they
would
certainly
be
sent
for
they
gave
their
evidence
with
dignity
though
not
without
some
uneasiness
the
little
pole
turned
out
to
be
a
retired
official
of
the
twelfth
class
who
had
served
in
siberia
as
a
veterinary
surgeon
his
name
was
mussyalovitch
pan
vrublevsky
turned
out
to
be
an
uncertificated
dentist
although
nikolay
parfenovitch
asked
them
questions
on
entering
the
room
they
both
addressed
their
answers
to
mihail
makarovitch
who
was
standing
on
one
side
taking
him
in
their
ignorance
for
the
most
important
person
and
in
command
and
addressed
him
at
every
word
as
pan
colonel
only
after
several
reproofs
from
mihail
makarovitch
himself
they
grasped
that
they
had
to
address
their
answers
to
nikolay
parfenovitch
only
it
turned
out
that
they
could
speak
russian
quite
correctly
except
for
their
accent
in
some
words
of
his
relations
with
grushenka
past
and
present
pan
mussyalovitch
spoke
proudly
and
warmly
so
that
mitya
was
roused
at
once
and
declared
that
he
would
not
allow
the
scoundrel
to
speak
like
that
in
his
presence
pan
mussyalovitch
at
once
called
attention
to
the
word
scoundrel
and
begged
that
it
should
be
put
down
in
the
protocol
mitya
fumed
with
rage
hes
a
scoundrel
a
scoundrel
you
can
put
that
down
and
put
down
too
that
in
spite
of
the
protocol
i
still
declare
that
hes
a
scoundrel
he
cried
though
nikolay
parfenovitch
did
insert
this
in
the
protocol
he
showed
the
most
praiseworthy
tact
and
management
after
sternly
reprimanding
mitya
he
cut
short
all
further
inquiry
into
the
romantic
aspect
of
the
case
and
hastened
to
pass
to
what
was
essential
one
piece
of
evidence
given
by
the
poles
roused
special
interest
in
the
lawyers
that
was
how
in
that
very
room
mitya
had
tried
to
buy
off
pan
mussyalovitch
and
had
offered
him
three
thousand
roubles
to
resign
his
claims
seven
hundred
roubles
down
and
the
remaining
two
thousand
three
hundred
to
be
paid
next
day
in
the
town
he
had
sworn
at
the
time
that
he
had
not
the
whole
sum
with
him
at
mokroe
but
that
his
money
was
in
the
town
mitya
observed
hotly
that
he
had
not
said
that
he
would
be
sure
to
pay
him
the
remainder
next
day
in
the
town
but
pan
vrublevsky
confirmed
the
statement
and
mitya
after
thinking
for
a
moment
admitted
frowning
that
it
must
have
been
as
the
poles
stated
that
he
had
been
excited
at
the
time
and
might
indeed
have
said
so
the
prosecutor
positively
pounced
on
this
piece
of
evidence
it
seemed
to
establish
for
the
prosecution
and
they
did
in
fact
base
this
deduction
on
it
that
half
or
a
part
of
the
three
thousand
that
had
come
into
mityas
hands
might
really
have
been
left
somewhere
hidden
in
the
town
or
even
perhaps
somewhere
here
in
mokroe
this
would
explain
the
circumstance
so
baffling
for
the
prosecution
that
only
eight
hundred
roubles
were
to
be
found
in
mityas
hands
this
circumstance
had
been
the
one
piece
of
evidence
which
insignificant
as
it
was
had
hitherto
told
to
some
extent
in
mityas
favor
now
this
one
piece
of
evidence
in
his
favor
had
broken
down
in
answer
to
the
prosecutors
inquiry
where
he
would
have
got
the
remaining
two
thousand
three
hundred
roubles
since
he
himself
had
denied
having
more
than
fifteen
hundred
mitya
confidently
replied
that
he
had
meant
to
offer
the
little
chap
not
money
but
a
formal
deed
of
conveyance
of
his
rights
to
the
village
of
tchermashnya
those
rights
which
he
had
already
offered
to
samsonov
and
madame
hohlakov
the
prosecutor
positively
smiled
at
the
innocence
of
this
subterfuge
and
you
imagine
he
would
have
accepted
such
a
deed
as
a
substitute
for
two
thousand
three
hundred
roubles
in
cash
he
certainly
would
have
accepted
it
mitya
declared
warmly
why
look
here
he
might
have
grabbed
not
two
thousand
but
four
or
six
for
it
he
would
have
put
his
lawyers
poles
and
jews
on
to
the
job
and
might
have
got
not
three
thousand
but
the
whole
property
out
of
the
old
man
the
evidence
of
pan
mussyalovitch
was
of
course
entered
in
the
protocol
in
the
fullest
detail
then
they
let
the
poles
go
the
incident
of
the
cheating
at
cards
was
hardly
touched
upon
nikolay
parfenovitch
was
too
well
pleased
with
them
as
it
was
and
did
not
want
to
worry
them
with
trifles
moreover
it
was
nothing
but
a
foolish
drunken
quarrel
over
cards
there
had
been
drinking
and
disorder
enough
that
night
so
the
two
hundred
roubles
remained
in
the
pockets
of
the
poles
then
old
maximov
was
summoned
he
came
in
timidly
approached
with
little
steps
looking
very
disheveled
and
depressed
he
had
all
this
time
taken
refuge
below
with
grushenka
sitting
dumbly
beside
her
and
now
and
then
hed
begin
blubbering
over
her
and
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
blue
check
handkerchief
as
mihail
makarovitch
described
afterwards
so
that
she
herself
began
trying
to
pacify
and
comfort
him
the
old
man
at
once
confessed
that
he
had
done
wrong
that
he
had
borrowed
ten
roubles
in
my
poverty
from
dmitri
fyodorovitch
and
that
he
was
ready
to
pay
it
back
to
nikolay
parfenovitchs
direct
question
had
he
noticed
how
much
money
dmitri
fyodorovitch
held
in
his
hand
as
he
must
have
been
able
to
see
the
sum
better
than
any
one
when
he
took
the
note
from
him
maximov
in
the
most
positive
manner
declared
that
there
was
twenty
thousand
have
you
ever
seen
so
much
as
twenty
thousand
before
then
inquired
nikolay
parfenovitch
with
a
smile
to
be
sure
i
have
not
twenty
but
seven
when
my
wife
mortgaged
my
little
property
shed
only
let
me
look
at
it
from
a
distance
boasting
of
it
to
me
it
was
a
very
thick
bundle
all
rainbowcolored
notes
and
dmitri
fyodorovitchs
were
all
rainbowcolored
he
was
not
kept
long
at
last
it
was
grushenkas
turn
nikolay
parfenovitch
was
obviously
apprehensive
of
the
effect
her
appearance
might
have
on
mitya
and
he
muttered
a
few
words
of
admonition
to
him
but
mitya
bowed
his
head
in
silence
giving
him
to
understand
that
he
would
not
make
a
scene
mihail
makarovitch
himself
led
grushenka
in
she
entered
with
a
stern
and
gloomy
face
that
looked
almost
composed
and
sat
down
quietly
on
the
chair
offered
her
by
nikolay
parfenovitch
she
was
very
pale
she
seemed
to
be
cold
and
wrapped
herself
closely
in
her
magnificent
black
shawl
she
was
suffering
from
a
slight
feverish
chillthe
first
symptom
of
the
long
illness
which
followed
that
night
her
grave
air
her
direct
earnest
look
and
quiet
manner
made
a
very
favorable
impression
on
every
one
nikolay
parfenovitch
was
even
a
little
bit
fascinated
he
admitted
himself
when
talking
about
it
afterwards
that
only
then
had
he
seen
how
handsome
the
woman
was
for
though
he
had
seen
her
several
times
before
he
had
always
looked
upon
her
as
something
of
a
provincial
hetaira
she
has
the
manners
of
the
best
society
he
said
enthusiastically
gossiping
about
her
in
a
circle
of
ladies
but
this
was
received
with
positive
indignation
by
the
ladies
who
immediately
called
him
a
naughty
man
to
his
great
satisfaction
as
she
entered
the
room
grushenka
only
glanced
for
an
instant
at
mitya
who
looked
at
her
uneasily
but
her
face
reassured
him
at
once
after
the
first
inevitable
inquiries
and
warnings
nikolay
parfenovitch
asked
her
hesitating
a
little
but
preserving
the
most
courteous
manner
on
what
terms
she
was
with
the
retired
lieutenant
dmitri
fyodorovitch
karamazov
to
this
grushenka
firmly
and
quietly
replied
he
was
an
acquaintance
he
came
to
see
me
as
an
acquaintance
during
the
last
month
to
further
inquisitive
questions
she
answered
plainly
and
with
complete
frankness
that
though
at
times
she
had
thought
him
attractive
she
had
not
loved
him
but
had
won
his
heart
as
well
as
his
old
fathers
in
my
nasty
spite
that
she
had
seen
that
mitya
was
very
jealous
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
every
one
else
but
that
had
only
amused
her
she
had
never
meant
to
go
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
she
had
simply
been
laughing
at
him
i
had
no
thoughts
for
either
of
them
all
this
last
month
i
was
expecting
another
man
who
had
wronged
me
but
i
think
she
said
in
conclusion
that
theres
no
need
for
you
to
inquire
about
that
nor
for
me
to
answer
you
for
thats
my
own
affair
nikolay
parfenovitch
immediately
acted
upon
this
hint
he
again
dismissed
the
romantic
aspect
of
the
case
and
passed
to
the
serious
one
that
is
to
the
question
of
most
importance
concerning
the
three
thousand
roubles
grushenka
confirmed
the
statement
that
three
thousand
roubles
had
certainly
been
spent
on
the
first
carousal
at
mokroe
and
though
she
had
not
counted
the
money
herself
she
had
heard
that
it
was
three
thousand
from
dmitri
fyodorovitchs
own
lips
did
he
tell
you
that
alone
or
before
some
one
else
or
did
you
only
hear
him
speak
of
it
to
others
in
your
presence
the
prosecutor
inquired
immediately
to
which
grushenka
replied
that
she
had
heard
him
say
so
before
other
people
and
had
heard
him
say
so
when
they
were
alone
did
he
say
it
to
you
alone
once
or
several
times
inquired
the
prosecutor
and
learned
that
he
had
told
grushenka
so
several
times
ippolit
kirillovitch
was
very
well
satisfied
with
this
piece
of
evidence
further
examination
elicited
that
grushenka
knew
too
where
that
money
had
come
from
and
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
got
it
from
katerina
ivanovna
and
did
you
never
once
hear
that
the
money
spent
a
month
ago
was
not
three
thousand
but
less
and
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
saved
half
that
sum
for
his
own
use
no
i
never
heard
that
answered
grushenka
it
was
explained
further
that
mitya
had
on
the
contrary
often
told
her
that
he
hadnt
a
farthing
he
was
always
expecting
to
get
some
from
his
father
said
grushenka
in
conclusion
did
he
never
say
before
you

casually
or
in
a
moment
of
irritation
nikolay
parfenovitch
put
in
suddenly
that
he
intended
to
make
an
attempt
on
his
fathers
life
ach
he
did
say
so
sighed
grushenka
once
or
several
times
he
mentioned
it
several
times
always
in
anger
and
did
you
believe
he
would
do
it
no
i
never
believed
it
she
answered
firmly
i
had
faith
in
his
noble
heart
gentlemen
allow
me
cried
mitya
suddenly
allow
me
to
say
one
word
to
agrafena
alexandrovna

your
presence

speak

parfenovitch

agrafena
alexandrovna
mitya
got
up
from
his
chair
have
faith
in
god
and
in
me
i
am
not
guilty
of
my
fathers
murder
having
uttered
these
words
mitya
sat
down
again
on
his
chair
grushenka
stood
up
and
crossed
herself
devoutly
before
the
ikon
thanks
be
to
thee
o
lord
she
said
in
a
voice
thrilled
with
emotion
and
still
standing
she
turned
to
nikolay
parfenovitch
and
added
as
he
has
spoken
now
believe
it
i
know
him
hell
say
anything
as
a
joke
or
from
obstinacy
but
hell
never
deceive
you
against
his
conscience
hes
telling
the
whole
truth
you
may
believe
it
thanks
agrafena
alexandrovna
youve
given
me
fresh
courage
mitya
responded
in
a
quivering
voice
as
to
the
money
spent
the
previous
day
she
declared
that
she
did
not
know
what
sum
it
was
but
had
heard
him
tell
several
people
that
he
had
three
thousand
with
him
and
to
the
question
where
he
got
the
money
she
said
that
he
had
told
her
that
he
had
stolen
it
from
katerina
ivanovna
and
that
she
had
replied
to
that
that
he
hadnt
stolen
it
and
that
he
must
pay
the
money
back
next
day
on
the
prosecutors
asking
her
emphatically
whether
the
money
he
said
he
had
stolen
from
katerina
ivanovna
was
what
he
had
spent
yesterday
or
what
he
had
squandered
here
a
month
ago
she
declared
that
he
meant
the
money
spent
a
month
ago
and
that
that
was
how
she
understood
him
grushenka
was
at
last
released
and
nikolay
parfenovitch
informed
her
impulsively
that
she
might
at
once
return
to
the
town
and
that
if
he
could
be
of
any
assistance
to
her
with
horses
for
example
or
if
she
would
care
for
an
escort
he

would
be
i
thank
you
sincerely
said
grushenka
bowing
to
him
im
going
with
this
old
gentleman
i
am
driving
him
back
to
town
with
me
and
meanwhile
if
youll
allow
me
ill
wait
below
to
hear
what
you
decide
about
dmitri
fyodorovitch
she
went
out
mitya
was
calm
and
even
looked
more
cheerful
but
only
for
a
moment
he
felt
more
and
more
oppressed
by
a
strange
physical
weakness
his
eyes
were
closing
with
fatigue
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
was
at
last
over
they
proceeded
to
a
final
revision
of
the
protocol
mitya
got
up
moved
from
his
chair
to
the
corner
by
the
curtain
lay
down
on
a
large
chest
covered
with
a
rug
and
instantly
fell
asleep
he
had
a
strange
dream
utterly
out
of
keeping
with
the
place
and
the
time
he
was
driving
somewhere
in
the
steppes
where
he
had
been
stationed
long
ago
and
a
peasant
was
driving
him
in
a
cart
with
a
pair
of
horses
through
snow
and
sleet
he
was
cold
it
was
early
in
november
and
the
snow
was
falling
in
big
wet
flakes
melting
as
soon
as
it
touched
the
earth
and
the
peasant
drove
him
smartly
he
had
a
fair
long
beard
he
was
not
an
old
man
somewhere
about
fifty
and
he
had
on
a
gray
peasants
smock
not
far
off
was
a
village
he
could
see
the
black
huts
and
half
the
huts
were
burnt
down
there
were
only
the
charred
beams
sticking
up
and
as
they
drove
in
there
were
peasant
women
drawn
up
along
the
road
a
lot
of
women
a
whole
row
all
thin
and
wan
with
their
faces
a
sort
of
brownish
color
especially
one
at
the
edge
a
tall
bony
woman
who
looked
forty
but
might
have
been
only
twenty
with
a
long
thin
face
and
in
her
arms
was
a
little
baby
crying
and
her
breasts
seemed
so
dried
up
that
there
was
not
a
drop
of
milk
in
them
and
the
child
cried
and
cried
and
held
out
its
little
bare
arms
with
its
little
fists
blue
from
cold
why
are
they
crying
why
are
they
crying
mitya
asked
as
they
dashed
gayly
by
its
the
babe
answered
the
driver
the
babe
weeping
and
mitya
was
struck
by
his
saying
in
his
peasant
way
the
babe
and
he
liked
the
peasants
calling
it
a
babe
there
seemed
more
pity
in
it
but
why
is
it
weeping
mitya
persisted
stupidly
why
are
its
little
arms
bare
why
dont
they
wrap
it
up
the
babes
cold
its
little
clothes
are
frozen
and
dont
warm
it
but
why
is
it
why
foolish
mitya
still
persisted
why
theyre
poor
people
burnt
out
theyve
no
bread
theyre
begging
because
theyve
been
burnt
out
no
no
mitya
as
it
were
still
did
not
understand
tell
me
why
it
is
those
poor
mothers
stand
there
why
are
people
poor
why
is
the
babe
poor
why
is
the
steppe
barren
why
dont
they
hug
each
other
and
kiss
why
dont
they
sing
songs
of
joy
why
are
they
so
dark
from
black
misery
why
dont
they
feed
the
babe
and
he
felt
that
though
his
questions
were
unreasonable
and
senseless
yet
he
wanted
to
ask
just
that
and
he
had
to
ask
it
just
in
that
way
and
he
felt
that
a
passion
of
pity
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
was
rising
in
his
heart
that
he
wanted
to
cry
that
he
wanted
to
do
something
for
them
all
so
that
the
babe
should
weep
no
more
so
that
the
dark
faced
driedup
mother
should
not
weep
that
no
one
should
shed
tears
again
from
that
moment
and
he
wanted
to
do
it
at
once
at
once
regardless
of
all
obstacles
with
all
the
recklessness
of
the
karamazovs
and
im
coming
with
you
i
wont
leave
you
now
for
the
rest
of
my
life
im
coming
with
you
he
heard
close
beside
him
grushenkas
tender
voice
thrilling
with
emotion
and
his
heart
glowed
and
he
struggled
forward
towards
the
light
and
he
longed
to
live
to
live
to
go
on
and
on
towards
the
new
beckoning
light
and
to
hasten
hasten
now
at
once
what
where
he
exclaimed
opening
his
eyes
and
sitting
up
on
the
chest
as
though
he
had
revived
from
a
swoon
smiling
brightly
nikolay
parfenovitch
was
standing
over
him
suggesting
that
he
should
hear
the
protocol
read
aloud
and
sign
it
mitya
guessed
that
he
had
been
asleep
an
hour
or
more
but
he
did
not
hear
nikolay
parfenovitch
he
was
suddenly
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
pillow
under
his
head
which
hadnt
been
there
when
he
had
leant
back
exhausted
on
the
chest
who
put
that
pillow
under
my
head
who
was
so
kind
he
cried
with
a
sort
of
ecstatic
gratitude
and
tears
in
his
voice
as
though
some
great
kindness
had
been
shown
him
he
never
found
out
who
this
kind
man
was
perhaps
one
of
the
peasant
witnesses
or
nikolay
parfenovitchs
little
secretary
had
compassionately
thought
to
put
a
pillow
under
his
head
but
his
whole
soul
was
quivering
with
tears
he
went
to
the
table
and
said
that
he
would
sign
whatever
they
liked
ive
had
a
good
dream
gentlemen
he
said
in
a
strange
voice
with
a

chapter
ix
they
carry
mitya
away
when
the
protocol
had
been
signed
nikolay
parfenovitch
turned
solemnly
to
the
prisoner
and
read
him
the
committal
setting
forth
that
in
such
a
year
on
such
a
day
in
such
a
place
the
investigating
lawyer
of
such
andsuch
a
district
court
having
examined
soandso
to
wit
mitya
accused
of
this
and
of
that
all
the
charges
were
carefully
written
out
and
having
considered
that
the
accused
not
pleading
guilty
to
the
charges
made
against
him
had
brought
forward
nothing
in
his
defense
while
the
witnesses
soandso
and
soandso
and
the
circumstances
suchandsuch
testify
against
him
acting
in
accordance
with
suchandsuch
articles
of
the
statute
book
and
so
on
has
ruled
that
in
order
to
preclude
soand
so
mitya
from
all
means
of
evading
pursuit
and
judgment
he
be
detained
in
suchandsuch
a
prison
which
he
hereby
notifies
to
the
accused
and
communicates
a
copy
of
this
same
committal
to
the
deputy
prosecutor
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
brief
mitya
was
informed
that
he
was
from
that
moment
a
prisoner
and
that
he
would
be
driven
at
once
to
the
town
and
there
shut
up
in
a
very
unpleasant
place
mitya
listened
attentively
and
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
gentlemen
i
dont
blame
you
im
ready
i
understand
that
theres
nothing
else
for
you
to
do
nikolay
parfenovitch
informed
him
gently
that
he
would
be
escorted
at
once
by
the
rural
police
officer
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
who
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
stay
mitya
interrupted
suddenly
and
impelled
by
uncontrollable
feeling
he
pronounced
addressing
all
in
the
room
gentlemen
were
all
cruel
were
all
monsters
we
all
make
men
weep
and
mothers
and
babes
at
the
breast
but
of
all
let
it
be
settled
here
now
of
all
i
am
the
lowest
reptile
ive
sworn
to
amend
and
every
day
ive
done
the
same
filthy
things
i
understand
now
that
such
men
as
i
need
a
blow
a
blow
of
destiny
to
catch
them
as
with
a
noose
and
bind
them
by
a
force
from
without
never
never
should
i
have
risen
of
myself
but
the
thunderbolt
has
fallen
i
accept
the
torture
of
accusation
and
my
public
shame
i
want
to
suffer
and
by
suffering
i
shall
be
purified
perhaps
i
shall
be
purified
gentlemen
but
listen
for
the
last
time
i
am
not
guilty
of
my
fathers
blood
i
accept
my
punishment
not
because
i
killed
him
but
because
i
meant
to
kill
him
and
perhaps
i
really
might
have
killed
him
still
i
mean
to
fight
it
out
with
you
i
warn
you
of
that
ill
fight
it
out
with
you
to
the
end
and
then
god
will
decide
goodby
gentlemen
dont
be
vexed
with
me
for
having
shouted
at
you
during
the
examination
oh
i
was
still
such
a
fool
then
in
another
minute
i
shall
be
a
prisoner
but
now
for
the
last
time
as
a
free
man
dmitri
karamazov
offers
you
his
hand
saying
goodby
to
you
i
say
it
to
all
men
his
voice
quivered
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
but
nikolay
parfenovitch
who
happened
to
stand
nearest
to
him
with
a
sudden
almost
nervous
movement
hid
his
hands
behind
his
back
mitya
instantly
noticed
this
and
started
he
let
his
outstretched
hand
fall
at
once
the
preliminary
inquiry
is
not
yet
over
nikolay
parfenovitch
faltered
somewhat
embarrassed
we
will
continue
it
in
the
town
and
i
for
my
part
of
course
am
ready
to
wish
you
all
success

in
your
defense
as
a
matter
of
fact
dmitri
fyodorovitch
ive
always
been
disposed
to
regard
you
as
so
to
speak
more
unfortunate
than
guilty
all
of
us
here
if
i
may
make
bold
to
speak
for
all
we
are
all
ready
to
recognize
that
you
are
at
bottom
a
young
man
of
honor
but
alas
one
who
has
been
carried
away
by
certain
passions
to
a
somewhat
excessive
degree
nikolay
parfenovitchs
little
figure
was
positively
majestic
by
the
time
he
had
finished
speaking
it
struck
mitya
that
in
another
minute
this
boy
would
take
his
arm
lead
him
to
another
corner
and
renew
their
conversation
about
girls
but
many
quite
irrelevant
and
inappropriate
thoughts
sometimes
occur
even
to
a
prisoner
when
he
is
being
led
out
to
execution
gentlemen
you
are
good
you
are
humane
may
i
see
her
to
say
goodby
for
the
last
time
asked
mitya
certainly
but
considering

in
fact
now
its
impossible
except
in
the
presence
of
oh
well
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
grushenka
was
brought
in
but
the
farewell
was
brief
and
of
few
words
and
did
not
at
all
satisfy
nikolay
parfenovitch
grushenka
made
a
deep
bow
to
mitya
i
have
told
you
i
am
yours
and
i
will
be
yours
i
will
follow
you
for
ever
wherever
they
may
send
you
farewell
you
are
guiltless
though
youve
been
your
own
undoing
her
lips
quivered
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
forgive
me
grusha
for
my
love
for
ruining
you
too
with
my
love
mitya
would
have
said
something
more
but
he
broke
off
and
went
out
he
was
at
once
surrounded
by
men
who
kept
a
constant
watch
on
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
to
which
he
had
driven
up
with
such
a
dash
the
day
before
with
andreys
three
horses
two
carts
stood
in
readiness
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
a
sturdy
thickset
man
with
a
wrinkled
face
was
annoyed
about
something
some
sudden
irregularity
he
was
shouting
angrily
he
asked
mitya
to
get
into
the
cart
with
somewhat
excessive
surliness
when
i
stood
him
drinks
in
the
tavern
the
man
had
quite
a
different
face
thought
mitya
as
he
got
in
at
the
gates
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
peasants
women
and
drivers
trifon
borissovitch
came
down
the
steps
too
all
stared
at
mitya
forgive
me
at
parting
good
people
mitya
shouted
suddenly
from
the
cart
forgive
us
too
he
heard
two
or
three
voices
goodby
to
you
too
trifon
borissovitch
but
trifon
borissovitch
did
not
even
turn
round
he
was
perhaps
too
busy
he
too
was
shouting
and
fussing
about
something
it
appeared
that
everything
was
not
yet
ready
in
the
second
cart
in
which
two
constables
were
to
accompany
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
the
peasant
who
had
been
ordered
to
drive
the
second
cart
was
pulling
on
his
smock
stoutly
maintaining
that
it
was
not
his
turn
to
go
but
akims
but
akim
was
not
to
be
seen
they
ran
to
look
for
him
the
peasant
persisted
and
besought
them
to
wait
you
see
what
our
peasants
are
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
theyve
no
shame
exclaimed
trifon
borissovitch
akim
gave
you
twentyfive
copecks
the
day
before
yesterday
youve
drunk
it
all
and
now
you
cry
out
im
simply
surprised
at
your
goodnature
with
our
low
peasants
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
thats
all
i
can
say
but
what
do
we
want
a
second
cart
for
mitya
put
in
lets
start
with
the
one
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
i
wont
be
unruly
i
wont
run
away
from
you
old
fellow
what
do
we
want
an
escort
for
ill
trouble
you
sir
to
learn
how
to
speak
to
me
if
youve
never
been
taught
im
not
old
fellow
to
you
and
you
can
keep
your
advice
for
another
time
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
snapped
out
savagely
as
though
glad
to
vent
his
wrath
mitya
was
reduced
to
silence
he
flushed
all
over
a
moment
later
he
felt
suddenly
very
cold
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
dull
sky
was
still
overcast
with
clouds
and
a
keen
wind
was
blowing
straight
in
his
face
ive
taken
a
chill
thought
mitya
twitching
his
shoulders
at
last
mavriky
mavrikyevitch
too
got
into
the
cart
sat
down
heavily
and
as
though
without
noticing
it
squeezed
mitya
into
the
corner
it
is
true
that
he
was
out
of
humor
and
greatly
disliked
the
task
that
had
been
laid
upon
him
goodby
trifon
borissovitch
mitya
shouted
again
and
felt
himself
that
he
had
not
called
out
this
time
from
goodnature
but
involuntarily
from
resentment
but
trifon
borissovitch
stood
proudly
with
both
hands
behind
his
back
and
staring
straight
at
mitya
with
a
stern
and
angry
face
he
made
no
reply
goodby
dmitri
fyodorovitch
goodby
he
heard
all
at
once
the
voice
of
kalganov
who
had
suddenly
darted
out
running
up
to
the
cart
he
held
out
his
hand
to
mitya
he
had
no
cap
on
mitya
had
time
to
seize
and
press
his
hand
goodby
dear
fellow
i
shant
forget
your
generosity
he
cried
warmly
but
the
cart
moved
and
their
hands
parted
the
bell
began
ringing
and
mitya
was
driven
off
kalganov
ran
back
sat
down
in
a
corner
bent
his
head
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
burst
out
crying
for
a
long
while
he
sat
like
that
crying
as
though
he
were
a
little
boy
instead
of
a
young
man
of
twenty
oh
he
believed
almost
without
doubt
in
mityas
guilt
what
are
these
people
what
can
men
be
after
this
he
exclaimed
incoherently
in
bitter
despondency
almost
despair
at
that
moment
he
had
no
desire
to
live
is
it
worth
it
is
it
worth
it
exclaimed
the
boy
in
his
grief
part
iv
book
x
the
boys
chapter
i
kolya
krassotkin
it
was
the
beginning
of
november
there
had
been
a
hard
frost
eleven
degrees
raumur
without
snow
but
a
little
dry
snow
had
fallen
on
the
frozen
ground
during
the
night
and
a
keen
dry
wind
was
lifting
and
blowing
it
along
the
dreary
streets
of
our
town
especially
about
the
marketplace
it
was
a
dull
morning
but
the
snow
had
ceased
not
far
from
the
marketplace
close
to
plotnikovs
shop
there
stood
a
small
house
very
clean
both
without
and
within
it
belonged
to
madame
krassotkin
the
widow
of
a
former
provincial
secretary
who
had
been
dead
for
fourteen
years
his
widow
still
a
nicelooking
woman
of
thirtytwo
was
living
in
her
neat
little
house
on
her
private
means
she
lived
in
respectable
seclusion
she
was
of
a
soft
but
fairly
cheerful
disposition
she
was
about
eighteen
at
the
time
of
her
husbands
death
she
had
been
married
only
a
year
and
had
just
borne
him
a
son
from
the
day
of
his
death
she
had
devoted
herself
heart
and
soul
to
the
bringing
up
of
her
precious
treasure
her
boy
kolya
though
she
had
loved
him
passionately
those
fourteen
years
he
had
caused
her
far
more
suffering
than
happiness
she
had
been
trembling
and
fainting
with
terror
almost
every
day
afraid
he
would
fall
ill
would
catch
cold
do
something
naughty
climb
on
a
chair
and
fall
off
it
and
so
on
and
so
on
when
kolya
began
going
to
school
the
mother
devoted
herself
to
studying
all
the
sciences
with
him
so
as
to
help
him
and
go
through
his
lessons
with
him
she
hastened
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
teachers
and
their
wives
even
made
up
to
kolyas
schoolfellows
and
fawned
upon
them
in
the
hope
of
thus
saving
kolya
from
being
teased
laughed
at
or
beaten
by
them
she
went
so
far
that
the
boys
actually
began
to
mock
at
him
on
her
account
and
taunt
him
with
being
a
mothers
darling
but
the
boy
could
take
his
own
part
he
was
a
resolute
boy
tremendously
strong
as
was
rumored
in
his
class
and
soon
proved
to
be
the
fact
he
was
agile
strongwilled
and
of
an
audacious
and
enterprising
temper
he
was
good
at
lessons
and
there
was
a
rumor
in
the
school
that
he
could
beat
the
teacher
dardanelov
at
arithmetic
and
universal
history
though
he
looked
down
upon
every
one
he
was
a
good
comrade
and
not
supercilious
he
accepted
his
schoolfellows
respect
as
his
due
but
was
friendly
with
them
above
all
he
knew
where
to
draw
the
line
he
could
restrain
himself
on
occasion
and
in
his
relations
with
the
teachers
he
never
overstepped
that
last
mystic
limit
beyond
which
a
prank
becomes
an
unpardonable
breach
of
discipline
but
he
was
as
fond
of
mischief
on
every
possible
occasion
as
the
smallest
boy
in
the
school
and
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
mischief
as
for
creating
a
sensation
inventing
something
something
effective
and
conspicuous
he
was
extremely
vain
he
knew
how
to
make
even
his
mother
give
way
to
him
he
was
almost
despotic
in
his
control
of
her
she
gave
way
to
him
oh
she
had
given
way
to
him
for
years
the
one
thought
unendurable
to
her
was
that
her
boy
had
no
great
love
for
her
she
was
always
fancying
that
kolya
was
unfeeling
to
her
and
at
times
dissolving
into
hysterical
tears
she
used
to
reproach
him
with
his
coldness
the
boy
disliked
this
and
the
more
demonstrations
of
feeling
were
demanded
of
him
the
more
he
seemed
intentionally
to
avoid
them
yet
it
was
not
intentional
on
his
part
but
instinctiveit
was
his
character
his
mother
was
mistaken
he
was
very
fond
of
her
he
only
disliked
sheepish
sentimentality
as
he
expressed
it
in
his
schoolboy
language
there
was
a
bookcase
in
the
house
containing
a
few
books
that
had
been
his
fathers
kolya
was
fond
of
reading
and
had
read
several
of
them
by
himself
his
mother
did
not
mind
that
and
only
wondered
sometimes
at
seeing
the
boy
stand
for
hours
by
the
bookcase
poring
over
a
book
instead
of
going
to
play
and
in
that
way
kolya
read
some
things
unsuitable
for
his
age
though
the
boy
as
a
rule
knew
where
to
draw
the
line
in
his
mischief
he
had
of
late
begun
to
play
pranks
that
caused
his
mother
serious
alarm
it
is
true
there
was
nothing
vicious
in
what
he
did
but
a
wild
mad
recklessness
it
happened
that
july
during
the
summer
holidays
that
the
mother
and
son
went
to
another
district
fortyfive
miles
away
to
spend
a
week
with
a
distant
relation
whose
husband
was
an
official
at
the
railway
station
the
very
station
the
nearest
one
to
our
town
from
which
a
month
later
ivan
fyodorovitch
karamazov
set
off
for
moscow
there
kolya
began
by
carefully
investigating
every
detail
connected
with
the
railways
knowing
that
he
could
impress
his
schoolfellows
when
he
got
home
with
his
newly
acquired
knowledge
but
there
happened
to
be
some
other
boys
in
the
place
with
whom
he
soon
made
friends
some
of
them
were
living
at
the
station
others
in
the
neighborhood
there
were
six
or
seven
of
them
all
between
twelve
and
fifteen
and
two
of
them
came
from
our
town
the
boys
played
together
and
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
day
of
kolyas
stay
at
the
station
a
mad
bet
was
made
by
the
foolish
boys
kolya
who
was
almost
the
youngest
of
the
party
and
rather
looked
down
upon
by
the
others
in
consequence
was
moved
by
vanity
or
by
reckless
bravado
to
bet
them
two
roubles
that
he
would
lie
down
between
the
rails
at
night
when
the
eleven
oclock
train
was
due
and
would
lie
there
without
moving
while
the
train
rolled
over
him
at
full
speed
it
is
true
they
made
a
preliminary
investigation
from
which
it
appeared
that
it
was
possible
to
lie
so
flat
between
the
rails
that
the
train
could
pass
over
without
touching
but
to
lie
there
was
no
joke
kolya
maintained
stoutly
that
he
would
at
first
they
laughed
at
him
called
him
a
little
liar
a
braggart
but
that
only
egged
him
on
what
piqued
him
most
was
that
these
boys
of
fifteen
turned
up
their
noses
at
him
too
superciliously
and
were
at
first
disposed
to
treat
him
as
a
small
boy
not
fit
to
associate
with
them
and
that
was
an
unendurable
insult
and
so
it
was
resolved
to
go
in
the
evening
half
a
mile
from
the
station
so
that
the
train
might
have
time
to
get
up
full
speed
after
leaving
the
station
the
boys
assembled
it
was
a
pitchdark
night
without
a
moon
at
the
time
fixed
kolya
lay
down
between
the
rails
the
five
others
who
had
taken
the
bet
waited
among
the
bushes
below
the
embankment
their
hearts
beating
with
suspense
which
was
followed
by
alarm
and
remorse
at
last
they
heard
in
the
distance
the
rumble
of
the
train
leaving
the
station
two
red
lights
gleamed
out
of
the
darkness
the
monster
roared
as
it
approached
run
run
away
from
the
rails
the
boys
cried
to
kolya
from
the
bushes
breathless
with
terror
but
it
was
too
late
the
train
darted
up
and
flew
past
the
boys
rushed
to
kolya
he
lay
without
moving
they
began
pulling
at
him
lifting
him
up
he
suddenly
got
up
and
walked
away
without
a
word
then
he
explained
that
he
had
lain
there
as
though
he
were
insensible
to
frighten
them
but
the
fact
was
that
he
really
had
lost
consciousness
as
he
confessed
long
after
to
his
mother
in
this
way
his
reputation
as
a
desperate
character
was
established
for
ever
he
returned
home
to
the
station
as
white
as
a
sheet
next
day
he
had
a
slight
attack
of
nervous
fever
but
he
was
in
high
spirits
and
well
pleased
with
himself
the
incident
did
not
become
known
at
once
but
when
they
came
back
to
the
town
it
penetrated
to
the
school
and
even
reached
the
ears
of
the
masters
but
then
kolyas
mother
hastened
to
entreat
the
masters
on
her
boys
behalf
and
in
the
end
dardanelov
a
respected
and
influential
teacher
exerted
himself
in
his
favor
and
the
affair
was
ignored
dardanelov
was
a
middleaged
bachelor
who
had
been
passionately
in
love
with
madame
krassotkin
for
many
years
past
and
had
once
already
about
a
year
previously
ventured
trembling
with
fear
and
the
delicacy
of
his
sentiments
to
offer
her
most
respectfully
his
hand
in
marriage
but
she
refused
him
resolutely
feeling
that
to
accept
him
would
be
an
act
of
treachery
to
her
son
though
dardanelov
had
to
judge
from
certain
mysterious
symptoms
reason
for
believing
that
he
was
not
an
object
of
aversion
to
the
charming
but
too
chaste
and
tenderhearted
widow
kolyas
mad
prank
seemed
to
have
broken
the
ice
and
dardanelov
was
rewarded
for
his
intercession
by
a
suggestion
of
hope
the
suggestion
it
is
true
was
a
faint
one
but
then
dardanelov
was
such
a
paragon
of
purity
and
delicacy
that
it
was
enough
for
the
time
being
to
make
him
perfectly
happy
he
was
fond
of
the
boy
though
he
would
have
felt
it
beneath
him
to
try
and
win
him
over
and
was
severe
and
strict
with
him
in
class
kolya
too
kept
him
at
a
respectful
distance
he
learned
his
lessons
perfectly
he
was
second
in
his
class
was
reserved
with
dardanelov
and
the
whole
class
firmly
believed
that
kolya
was
so
good
at
universal
history
that
he
could
beat
even
dardanelov
kolya
did
indeed
ask
him
the
question
who
founded
troy
to
which
dardanelov
had
made
a
very
vague
reply
referring
to
the
movements
and
migrations
of
races
to
the
remoteness
of
the
period
to
the
mythical
legends
but
the
question
who
had
founded
troy
that
is
what
individuals
he
could
not
answer
and
even
for
some
reason
regarded
the
question
as
idle
and
frivolous
but
the
boys
remained
convinced
that
dardanelov
did
not
know
who
founded
troy
kolya
had
read
of
the
founders
of
troy
in
smaragdov
whose
history
was
among
the
books
in
his
fathers
bookcase
in
the
end
all
the
boys
became
interested
in
the
question
who
it
was
that
had
founded
troy
but
krassotkin
would
not
tell
his
secret
and
his
reputation
for
knowledge
remained
unshaken
after
the
incident
on
the
railway
a
certain
change
came
over
kolyas
attitude
to
his
mother
when
anna
fyodorovna
madame
krassotkin
heard
of
her
sons
exploit
she
almost
went
out
of
her
mind
with
horror
she
had
such
terrible
attacks
of
hysterics
lasting
with
intervals
for
several
days
that
kolya
seriously
alarmed
at
last
promised
on
his
honor
that
such
pranks
should
never
be
repeated
he
swore
on
his
knees
before
the
holy
image
and
swore
by
the
memory
of
his
father
at
madame
krassotkins
instance
and
the
manly
kolya
burst
into
tears
like
a
boy
of
six
and
all
that
day
the
mother
and
son
were
constantly
rushing
into
each
others
arms
sobbing
next
day
kolya
woke
up
as
unfeeling
as
before
but
he
had
become
more
silent
more
modest
sterner
and
more
thoughtful
six
weeks
later
it
is
true
he
got
into
another
scrape
which
even
brought
his
name
to
the
ears
of
our
justice
of
the
peace
but
it
was
a
scrape
of
quite
another
kind
amusing
foolish
and
he
did
not
as
it
turned
out
take
the
leading
part
in
it
but
was
only
implicated
in
it
but
of
this
later
his
mother
still
fretted
and
trembled
but
the
more
uneasy
she
became
the
greater
were
the
hopes
of
dardanelov
it
must
be
noted
that
kolya
understood
and
divined
what
was
in
dardanelovs
heart
and
of
course
despised
him
profoundly
for
his
feelings
he
had
in
the
past
been
so
tactless
as
to
show
this
contempt
before
his
mother
hinting
vaguely
that
he
knew
what
dardanelov
was
after
but
from
the
time
of
the
railway
incident
his
behavior
in
this
respect
also
was
changed
he
did
not
allow
himself
the
remotest
allusion
to
the
subject
and
began
to
speak
more
respectfully
of
dardanelov
before
his
mother
which
the
sensitive
woman
at
once
appreciated
with
boundless
gratitude
but
at
the
slightest
mention
of
dardanelov
by
a
visitor
in
kolyas
presence
she
would
flush
as
pink
as
a
rose
at
such
moments
kolya
would
either
stare
out
of
the
window
scowling
or
would
investigate
the
state
of
his
boots
or
would
shout
angrily
for
perezvon
the
big
shaggy
mangy
dog
which
he
had
picked
up
a
month
before
brought
home
and
kept
for
some
reason
secretly
indoors
not
showing
him
to
any
of
his
schoolfellows
he
bullied
him
frightfully
teaching
him
all
sorts
of
tricks
so
that
the
poor
dog
howled
for
him
whenever
he
was
absent
at
school
and
when
he
came
in
whined
with
delight
rushed
about
as
if
he
were
crazy
begged
lay
down
on
the
ground
pretending
to
be
dead
and
so
on
in
fact
showed
all
the
tricks
he
had
taught
him
not
at
the
word
of
command
but
simply
from
the
zeal
of
his
excited
and
grateful
heart
i
have
forgotten
by
the
way
to
mention
that
kolya
krassotkin
was
the
boy
stabbed
with
a
penknife
by
the
boy
already
known
to
the
reader
as
the
son
of
captain
snegiryov
ilusha
had
been
defending
his
father
when
the
schoolboys
jeered
at
him
shouting
the
nickname
wisp
of
tow
chapter
ii
children
and
so
on
that
frosty
snowy
and
windy
day
in
november
kolya
krassotkin
was
sitting
at
home
it
was
sunday
and
there
was
no
school
it
had
just
struck
eleven
and
he
particularly
wanted
to
go
out
on
very
urgent
business
but
he
was
left
alone
in
charge
of
the
house
for
it
so
happened
that
all
its
elder
inmates
were
absent
owing
to
a
sudden
and
singular
event
madame
krassotkin
had
let
two
little
rooms
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
house
by
a
passage
to
a
doctors
wife
with
her
two
small
children
this
lady
was
the
same
age
as
anna
fyodorovna
and
a
great
friend
of
hers
her
husband
the
doctor
had
taken
his
departure
twelve
months
before
going
first
to
orenburg
and
then
to
tashkend
and
for
the
last
six
months
she
had
not
heard
a
word
from
him
had
it
not
been
for
her
friendship
with
madame
krassotkin
which
was
some
consolation
to
the
forsaken
lady
she
would
certainly
have
completely
dissolved
away
in
tears
and
now
to
add
to
her
misfortunes
katerina
her
only
servant
was
suddenly
moved
the
evening
before
to
announce
to
her
mistresss
amazement
that
she
proposed
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
before
morning
it
seemed
almost
miraculous
to
every
one
that
no
one
had
noticed
the
probability
of
it
before
the
astounded
doctors
wife
decided
to
move
katerina
while
there
was
still
time
to
an
establishment
in
the
town
kept
by
a
midwife
for
such
emergencies
as
she
set
great
store
by
her
servant
she
promptly
carried
out
this
plan
and
remained
there
looking
after
her
by
the
morning
all
madame
krassotkins
friendly
sympathy
and
energy
were
called
upon
to
render
assistance
and
appeal
to
some
one
for
help
in
the
case
so
both
the
ladies
were
absent
from
home
the
krassotkins
servant
agafya
had
gone
out
to
the
market
and
kolya
was
thus
left
for
a
time
to
protect
and
look
after
the
kids
that
is
the
son
and
daughter
of
the
doctors
wife
who
were
left
alone
kolya
was
not
afraid
of
taking
care
of
the
house
besides
he
had
perezvon
who
had
been
told
to
lie
flat
without
moving
under
the
bench
in
the
hall
every
time
kolya
walking
to
and
fro
through
the
rooms
came
into
the
hall
the
dog
shook
his
head
and
gave
two
loud
and
insinuating
taps
on
the
floor
with
his
tail
but
alas
the
whistle
did
not
sound
to
release
him
kolya
looked
sternly
at
the
luckless
dog
who
relapsed
again
into
obedient
rigidity
the
one
thing
that
troubled
kolya
was
the
kids
he
looked
of
course
with
the
utmost
scorn
on
katerinas
unexpected
adventure
but
he
was
very
fond
of
the
bereaved
kiddies
and
had
already
taken
them
a
picturebook
nastya
the
elder
a
girl
of
eight
could
read
and
kostya
the
boy
aged
seven
was
very
fond
of
being
read
to
by
her
krassotkin
could
of
course
have
provided
more
diverting
entertainment
for
them
he
could
have
made
them
stand
side
by
side
and
played
soldiers
with
them
or
sent
them
hiding
all
over
the
house
he
had
done
so
more
than
once
before
and
was
not
above
doing
it
so
much
so
that
a
report
once
spread
at
school
that
krassotkin
played
horses
with
the
little
lodgers
at
home
prancing
with
his
head
on
one
side
like
a
tracehorse
but
krassotkin
haughtily
parried
this
thrust
pointing
out
that
to
play
horses
with
boys
of
ones
own
age
boys
of
thirteen
would
certainly
be
disgraceful
at
this
date
but
that
he
did
it
for
the
sake
of
the
kids
because
he
liked
them
and
no
one
had
a
right
to
call
him
to
account
for
his
feelings
the
two
kids
adored
him
but
on
this
occasion
he
was
in
no
mood
for
games
he
had
very
important
business
of
his
own
before
him
something
almost
mysterious
meanwhile
time
was
passing
and
agafya
with
whom
he
could
have
left
the
children
would
not
come
back
from
market
he
had
several
times
already
crossed
the
passage
opened
the
door
of
the
lodgers
room
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
kids
who
were
sitting
over
the
book
as
he
had
bidden
them
every
time
he
opened
the
door
they
grinned
at
him
hoping
he
would
come
in
and
would
do
something
delightful
and
amusing
but
kolya
was
bothered
and
did
not
go
in
at
last
it
struck
eleven
and
he
made
up
his
mind
once
for
all
that
if
that
damned
agafya
did
not
come
back
within
ten
minutes
he
should
go
out
without
waiting
for
her
making
the
kids
promise
of
course
to
be
brave
when
he
was
away
not
to
be
naughty
not
to
cry
from
fright
with
this
idea
he
put
on
his
wadded
winter
overcoat
with
its
catskin
fur
collar
slung
his
satchel
round
his
shoulder
and
regardless
of
his
mothers
constantly
reiterated
entreaties
that
he
would
always
put
on
goloshes
in
such
cold
weather
he
looked
at
them
contemptuously
as
he
crossed
the
hall
and
went
out
with
only
his
boots
on
perezvon
seeing
him
in
his
outdoor
clothes
began
tapping
nervously
yet
vigorously
on
the
floor
with
his
tail
twitching
all
over
he
even
uttered
a
plaintive
whine
but
kolya
seeing
his
dogs
passionate
excitement
decided
that
it
was
a
breach
of
discipline
kept
him
for
another
minute
under
the
bench
and
only
when
he
had
opened
the
door
into
the
passage
whistled
for
him
the
dog
leapt
up
like
a
mad
creature
and
rushed
bounding
before
him
rapturously
kolya
opened
the
door
to
peep
at
the
kids
they
were
both
sitting
as
before
at
the
table
not
reading
but
warmly
disputing
about
something
the
children
often
argued
together
about
various
exciting
problems
of
life
and
nastya
being
the
elder
always
got
the
best
of
it
if
kostya
did
not
agree
with
her
he
almost
always
appealed
to
kolya
krassotkin
and
his
verdict
was
regarded
as
infallible
by
both
of
them
this
time
the
kids
discussion
rather
interested
krassotkin
and
he
stood
still
in
the
passage
to
listen
the
children
saw
he
was
listening
and
that
made
them
dispute
with
even
greater
energy
i
shall
never
never
believe
nastya
prattled
that
the
old
women
find
babies
among
the
cabbages
in
the
kitchengarden
its
winter
now
and
there
are
no
cabbages
and
so
the
old
woman
couldnt
have
taken
katerina
a
daughter
kolya
whistled
to
himself
or
perhaps
they
do
bring
babies
from
somewhere
but
only
to
those
who
are
married
kostya
stared
at
nastya
and
listened
pondering
profoundly
nastya
how
silly
you
are
he
said
at
last
firmly
and
calmly
how
can
katerina
have
a
baby
when
she
isnt
married
nastya
was
exasperated
you
know
nothing
about
it
she
snapped
irritably
perhaps
she
has
a
husband
only
he
is
in
prison
so
now
shes
got
a
baby
but
is
her
husband
in
prison
the
matteroffact
kostya
inquired
gravely
or
i
tell
you
what
nastya
interrupted
impulsively
completely
rejecting
and
forgetting
her
first
hypothesis
she
hasnt
a
husband
you
are
right
there
but
she
wants
to
be
married
and
so
shes
been
thinking
of
getting
married
and
thinking
and
thinking
of
it
till
now
shes
got
it
that
is
not
a
husband
but
a
baby
well
perhaps
so
kostya
agreed
entirely
vanquished
but
you
didnt
say
so
before
so
how
could
i
tell
come
kiddies
said
kolya
stepping
into
the
room
youre
terrible
people
i
see
and
perezvon
with
you
grinned
kostya
and
began
snapping
his
fingers
and
calling
perezvon
i
am
in
a
difficulty
kids
krassotkin
began
solemnly
and
you
must
help
me
agafya
must
have
broken
her
leg
since
she
has
not
turned
up
till
now
thats
certain
i
must
go
out
will
you
let
me
go
the
children
looked
anxiously
at
one
another
their
smiling
faces
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
but
they
did
not
yet
fully
grasp
what
was
expected
of
them
you
wont
be
naughty
while
i
am
gone
you
wont
climb
on
the
cupboard
and
break
your
legs
you
wont
be
frightened
alone
and
cry
a
look
of
profound
despondency
came
into
the
childrens
faces
and
i
could
show
you
something
as
a
reward
a
little
copper
cannon
which
can
be
fired
with
real
gunpowder
the
childrens
faces
instantly
brightened
show
us
the
cannon
said
kostya
beaming
all
over
krassotkin
put
his
hand
in
his
satchel
and
pulling
out
a
little
bronze
cannon
stood
it
on
the
table
ah
you
are
bound
to
ask
that
look
its
on
wheels
he
rolled
the
toy
on
along
the
table
and
it
can
be
fired
off
too
it
can
be
loaded
with
shot
and
fired
off
and
it
could
kill
any
one
it
can
kill
any
one
youve
only
got
to
aim
at
anybody
and
krassotkin
explained
where
the
powder
had
to
be
put
where
the
shot
should
be
rolled
in
showing
a
tiny
hole
like
a
touchhole
and
told
them
that
it
kicked
when
it
was
fired
the
children
listened
with
intense
interest
what
particularly
struck
their
imagination
was
that
the
cannon
kicked
and
have
you
got
any
powder
nastya
inquired
yes
show
us
the
powder
too
she
drawled
with
a
smile
of
entreaty
krassotkin
dived
again
into
his
satchel
and
pulled
out
a
small
flask
containing
a
little
real
gunpowder
he
had
some
shot
too
in
a
screw
of
paper
he
even
uncorked
the
flask
and
shook
a
little
powder
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
one
has
to
be
careful
theres
no
fire
about
or
it
would
blow
up
and
kill
us
all
krassotkin
warned
them
sensationally
the
children
gazed
at
the
powder
with
an
awestricken
alarm
that
only
intensified
their
enjoyment
but
kostya
liked
the
shot
better
and
does
the
shot
burn
he
inquired
no
it
doesnt
give
me
a
little
shot
he
asked
in
an
imploring
voice
ill
give
you
a
little
shot
here
take
it
but
dont
show
it
to
your
mother
till
i
come
back
or
shell
be
sure
to
think

and
will
die
of
fright
and
give
you
a
thrashing
mother
never
does
whip
us
nastya
observed
at
once
i
know

only
said
it
to
finish
the
sentence
and
dont
you
ever
deceive

except

this
once
until
i
come
back
and
so

verge
of
tears
already

to

nastya
chimed
in
with
timid
haste

with
peril

begged
theres
no

for
it
we
must
have
recourse
to
perezvon
ici
perezvon
and
kolya
began
giving
orders
to
the
dog
who
performed
all
his
tricks
he
was
a
roughhaired
dog
of
medium
size
with
a
coat
of
a
sort
of
lilac
gray
color
he
was
blind
in
his
right
eye
and
his
left
ear
was
torn
he
whined
and
jumped
stood
and
walked
on
his
hind
legs
lay
on
his
back
with
his
paws
in
the
air
rigid
as
though
he
were
dead
while
this
last
performance
was
going
on
the
door
opened
and
agafya
madame
krassotkins
servant
a
stout
woman
of
forty
marked
with
smallpox
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
had
come
back
from
market
and
had
a
bag
full
of
provisions
in
her
hand
holding
up
the
bag
of
provisions
in
her
left
hand
she
stood
still
to
watch
the
dog
though
kolya
had
been
so
anxious
for
her
return
he
did
not
cut
short
the
performance
and
after
keeping
perezvon
dead
for
the
usual
time
at
last
he
whistled
to
him
the
dog
jumped
up
and
began
bounding
about
in
his
joy
at
having
done
his
duty
only
think
a
dog
agafya
observed
sententiously
why

muttered
agafya
busying
herself
about
the
stove
without
a
trace
of
anger
or
displeasure
in
her
voice
she
seemed
quite
pleased
in
fact
to
enjoy
a
skirmish
with
her
merry
young
master

in
an
undertone
as
he
passed

chapter
iii
the
schoolboy
but
kolya
did
not
hear
her
at
last
he
could
go
out
as
he
went
out
at
the
gate
he
looked
round
him
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
saying
it
is
freezing
went
straight
along
the
street
and
turned
off
to
the
right
towards
the
marketplace
when
he
reached
the
last
house
but
one
before
the
marketplace
he
stopped
at
the
gate
pulled
a
whistle
out
of
his
pocket
and
whistled
with
all
his
might
as
though
giving
a
signal
he
had
not
to
wait
more
than
a
minute
before
a
rosycheeked
boy
of
about
eleven
wearing
a
warm
neat
and
even
stylish
coat
darted
out
to
meet
him
this
was
smurov
a
boy
in
the
preparatory
class
two
classes
below
kolya
krassotkin
son
of
a
welltodo
official
apparently
he
was
forbidden
by
his
parents
to
associate
with
krassotkin
who
was
well
known
to
be
a
desperately
naughty
boy
so
smurov
was
obviously
slipping
out
on
the
sly
he
wasif
the
reader
has
not
forgottenone
of
the
group
of
boys
who
two
months
before
had
thrown
stones
at
ilusha
he
was
the
one
who
told
alyosha
karamazov
about
ilusha
ive
been
waiting
for
you
for
the
last
hour
krassotkin
said
smurov
stolidly
and
the
boys
strode
towards
the
marketplace
i
am
late
answered
krassotkin
i
was
detained
by
circumstances
you
wont
be
thrashed
for
coming
with
me
come
i
say
im
never
thrashed
and
youve
got
perezvon
with
you
yes
youre
taking
him
too
yes
ah
if
it
were
only
zhutchka
thats
impossible
zhutchkas
nonexistent
zhutchka
is
lost
in
the
mists
of
obscurity
ah
couldnt
we
do
this
smurov
suddenly
stood
still
you
see
ilusha
says
that
zhutchka
was
a
shaggy
grayish
smokylooking
dog
like
perezvon
couldnt
you
tell
him
this
is
zhutchka
and
he
might
believe
you
boy
shun
a
lie
thats
one
thing
even
with
a
good
objectthats
another
above
all
i
hope
youve
not
told
them
anything
about
my
coming
heaven
forbid
i
know
what
i
am
about
but
you
wont
comfort
him
with
perezvon
said
smurov
with
a
sigh
you
know
his
father
the
captain
the
wisp
of
tow
told
us
that
he
was
going
to
bring
him
a
real
mastiff
pup
with
a
black
nose
today
he
thinks
that
would
comfort
ilusha
but
i
doubt
it
and
how
is
ilusha
ah
he
is
bad
very
bad
i
believe
hes
in
consumption
he
is
quite
conscious
but
his
breathing
his
breathings
gone
wrong
the
other
day
he
asked
to
have
his
boots
on
to
be
led
round
the
room
he
tried
to
walk
but
he
couldnt
stand
ah
i
told
you
before
father
he
said
that
those
boots
were
no
good
i
could
never
walk
properly
in
them
he
fancied
it
was
his
boots
that
made
him
stagger
but
it
was
simply
weakness
really
he
wont
live
another
week
herzenstube
is
looking
after
him
now
they
are
rich
againtheyve
got
heaps
of
money
they
are
rogues
who
are
rogues
doctors
and
the
whole
crew
of
quacks
collectively
and
also
of
course
individually
i
dont
believe
in
medicine
its
a
useless
institution
i
mean
to
go
into
all
that
but
whats
that
sentimentality
youve
got
up
there
the
whole
class
seems
to
be
there
every
day
not
the
whole
class
its
only
ten
of
our
fellows
who
go
to
see
him
every
day
theres
nothing
in
that
what
i
dont
understand
in
all
this
is
the
part
that
alexey
karamazov
is
taking
in
it
his
brothers
going
to
be
tried
tomorrow
or
next
day
for
such
a
crime
and
yet
he
has
so
much
time
to
spend
on
sentimentality
with
boys
theres
no
sentimentality
about
it
you
are
going
yourself
now
to
make
it
up
with
ilusha
make
it
up
with
him
what
an
absurd
expression
but
i
allow
no
one
to
analyze
my
actions
and
how
pleased
ilusha
will
be
to
see
you
he
has
no
idea
that
you
are
coming
why
was
it
why
was
it
you
wouldnt
come
all
this
time
smurov
cried
with
sudden
warmth
my
dear
boy
thats
my
business
not
yours
i
am
going
of
myself
because
i
choose
to
but
youve
all
been
hauled
there
by
alexey
karamazovtheres
a
difference
you
know
and
how
do
you
know
i
may
not
be
going
to
make
it
up
at
all
its
a
stupid
expression
its
not
karamazov
at
all
its
not
his
doing
our
fellows
began
going
there
of
themselves
of
course
they
went
with
karamazov
at
first
and
theres
been
nothing
of
that
sortno
silliness
first
one
went
and
then
another
his
father
was
awfully
pleased
to
see
us
you
know
he
will
simply
go
out
of
his
mind
if
ilusha
dies
he
sees
that
ilushas
dying
and
he
seems
so
glad
weve
made
it
up
with
ilusha
ilusha
asked
after
you
that
was
all
he
just
asks
and
says
no
more
his
father
will
go
out
of
his
mind
or
hang
himself
he
behaved
like
a
madman
before
you
know
he
is
a
very
decent
man
we
made
a
mistake
then
its
all
the
fault
of
that
murderer
who
beat
him
then
karamazovs
a
riddle
to
me
all
the
same
i
might
have
made
his
acquaintance
long
ago
but
i
like
to
have
a
proper
pride
in
some
cases
besides
i
have
a
theory
about
him
which
i
must
work
out
and
verify
kolya
subsided
into
dignified
silence
smurov
too
was
silent
smurov
of
course
worshiped
krassotkin
and
never
dreamed
of
putting
himself
on
a
level
with
him
now
he
was
tremendously
interested
at
kolyas
saying
that
he
was
going
of
himself
to
see
ilusha
he
felt
that
there
must
be
some
mystery
in
kolyas
suddenly
taking
it
into
his
head
to
go
to
him
that
day
they
crossed
the
marketplace
in
which
at
that
hour
were
many
loaded
wagons
from
the
country
and
a
great
number
of
live
fowls
the
market
women
were
selling
rolls
cottons
and
threads
etc
in
their
booths
these
sunday
markets
were
navely
called
fairs
in
the
town
and
there
were
many
such
fairs
in
the
year
perezvon
ran
about
in
the
wildest
spirits
sniffing
about
first
one
side
then
the
other
when
he
met
other
dogs
they
zealously
smelt
each
other
over
according
to
the
rules
of
canine
etiquette
i
like
to
watch
such
realistic
scenes
smurov
said
kolya
suddenly
have
you
noticed
how
dogs
sniff
at
one
another
when
they
meet
it
seems
to
be
a
law
of
their
nature
yes
its
a
funny
habit
no
its
not
funny
you
are
wrong
there
theres
nothing
funny
in
nature
however
funny
it
may
seem
to
man
with
his
prejudices
if
dogs
could
reason
and
criticize
us
theyd
be
sure
to
find
just
as
much
that
would
be
funny
to
them
if
not
far
more
in
the
social
relations
of
men
their
mastersfar
more
indeed
i
repeat
that
because
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
far
more
foolishness
among
us
thats
rakitins
ideaa
remarkable
idea
i
am
a
socialist
smurov
and
what
is
a
socialist
asked
smurov
thats
when
all
are
equal
and
all
have
property
in
common
there
are
no
marriages
and
every
one
has
any
religion
and
laws
he
likes
best
and
all
the
rest
of
it
you
are
not
old
enough
to
understand
that
yet
its
cold
though
yes
twelve
degrees
of
frost
father
looked
at
the
thermometer
just
now
have
you
noticed
smurov
that
in
the
middle
of
winter
we
dont
feel
so
cold
even
when
there
are
fifteen
or
eighteen
degrees
of
frost
as
we
do
now
in
the
beginning
of
winter
when
there
is
a
sudden
frost
of
twelve
degrees
especially
when
there
is
not
much
snow
its
because
people
are
not
used
to
it
everything
is
habit
with
men
everything
even
in
their
social
and
political
relations
habit
is
the
great
motivepower
what
a
funnylooking
peasant
kolya
pointed
to
a
tall
peasant
with
a
goodnatured
countenance
in
a
long
sheepskin
coat
who
was
standing
by
his
wagon
clapping
together
his
hands
in
their
shapeless
leather
gloves
to
warm
them
his
long
fair
beard
was
all
white
with
frost
that
peasants
beards
frozen
kolya
cried
in
a
loud
provocative
voice
as
he
passed
him
lots
of
peoples
beards
are
frozen
the
peasant
replied
calmly
and
sententiously
dont
provoke
him
observed
smurov
its
all
right
he
wont
be
cross
hes
a
nice
fellow

ech

the
peasant
heaved
a
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
goodby
matvey
goodby

kolya
observed
to
smurov
i
like
talking
to
the
peasants
and
am
always
glad

a
lie
pretending

smurov

smurov
i
dont
like
being
asked
the
same
thing
twice
i
like
people
to
understand
at
the
first
word
some
things
cant
be
explained
according
to
a
peasants
notions
schoolboys

whipped
and

be
whipped
what
would
a
schoolboy
be
if
he
were
not
whipped
and
if
i
were
to
tell
him
we
are
not
hed
be
disappointed
but
you
dont
understand
that
one
has
to
know
how
to
talk
to
the
peasants
only
dont
tease
them
please
or
youll
get
into
another
scrape
as
you

a
market

one
of
the
booths

saucy
jackanapes
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
among
the
other
market
women
round
her
suddenly
a
man
in
a
violent
rage
darted
out
from
the
arcade
of
shops
close
by
he
was
a
young
man
not
a
native
of
the
town
with
dark
curly
hair
and
a
long
pale
face
marked
with
smallpox
he
wore
a
long
blue
coat
and
a
peaked
cap
and
looked
like
a
merchants
clerk
he
was
in
a
state
of
stupid
excitement
and
brandished
his
fist
at
kolya
i
know
you
he
cried
angrily
i
know
you
kolya
stared
at
him
he
could
not
recall
when
he
could
have
had
a
row
with
the
man
but
he
had
been
in
so
many
rows
in
the
street
that
he
could
hardly
remember
them
all
do
you
he
asked
sarcastically
i
know
you
i
know
you
the
man
repeated
idiotically
so
much
the
better
for
you
well
its
time
i
was
going
goodby
you
are
at
your
saucy
pranks
again
cried
the
man
you
are

my
saucy
pranks

said
kolya
standing
still
and
scanning
him
not
my
business
no
its
not
your
business
whose
then
whose
then
whose
then
its
trifon
nikititchs
business
not
yours
what
trifon
nikititch
asked
the
youth
staring
with
loutish
amazement
at
kolya
but
still
as
angry
as
ever
kolya
scanned
him
gravely
have
you
been
to
the
church
of
the
ascension
he
suddenly
asked
him
with
stern
emphasis
what
church
of
ascension
what
for
no
i
havent
said
the
young
man
somewhat
taken
aback
do
you
know
sabaneyev
kolya
went
on
even
more
emphatically
and
even
more
severely
what
sabaneyev
no
i
dont
know
him
well
then
you
can
go
to
the
devil
said
kolya
cutting
short
the
conversation
and
turning
sharply
to
the
right
he
strode
quickly
on
his
way
as
though
he
disdained
further
conversation
with
a
dolt
who
did
not
even
know
sabaneyev
stop
heigh
what
sabaneyev
the
young
man
recovered
from
his
momentary
stupefaction
and
was
as
excited
as
before
what
did
he
say
he
turned
to
the
market
women
with
a
silly
stare
the
women
laughed
you
can
never
tell
what
hes
after
said
one
of
them
what
sabaneyev
is
it
hes
talking
about
the
young
man
repeated
still
furious
and
brandishing
his
right
arm
it
must
be
a
sabaneyev
who
worked
for
the
kuzmitchovs
thats
who
it
must
be
one
of
the
women
suggested
the
young
man
stared
at
her
wildly
for
the
kuzmitchovs
repeated
another
woman
but
his
name
wasnt
trifon
his
names
kuzma
not
trifon
but
the
boy
said
trifon
nikititch
so
it
cant
be
the
same
his
name
is
not
trifon
and
not
sabaneyev
its
tchizhov
put
in
suddenly
a
third
woman
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
listening
gravely
alexey
ivanitch
is
his
name
tchizhov
alexey
ivanitch
not
a
doubt
about
it
its
tchizhov
a
fourth
woman
emphatically
confirmed
the
statement
the
bewildered
youth
gazed
from
one
to
another
but
what
did
he
ask
for
what
did
he
ask
for
good
people
he
cried
almost
in
desperation

do
you
know
sabaneyev
says
he
and
who

devils
to
know
who

of
the
women

at
him
impressively
what

tell
me
if
you

that
tall
sniveling
fellow
who

summer

to
know
yourself
what
you
want
with
him
if

such
a
clamor
about
him

he
was
laughing
at
me
the
woman
guffawed
but
kolya
was
by
now
a
long
way
off
marching
along
with
a
triumphant
air
smurov
walked
beside
him
looking
round
at
the
shouting
group
far
behind
he
too
was
in
high
spirits
though
he
was
still
afraid
of
getting
into
some
scrape
in
kolyas
company
what
sabaneyev
did
you
mean
he
asked
kolya
foreseeing
what
his
answer
would
be
how
do
i
know
now
therell
be
a
hubbub
among
them
all
day
i
like
to
stir
up
fools
in
every
class
of
society
theres
another
blockhead
that
peasant
there
you
know
they
say
theres
no
one
stupider
than
a
stupid
frenchman
but
a
stupid
russian
shows
it
in
his
face
just
as
much
cant
you
see
it
all
over
his
face
that
he
is
a
fool
that
peasant
eh
let
him
alone
kolya

go
on
nothing
could
stop
me
now
i
am

hey

morning
peasant
a
sturdylooking
peasant
with
a
round
simple
face
and
grizzled
beard
who
was
walking
by
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
the
boy
he
seemed
not
quite
sober
good
morning
if
you
are
not
laughing
at
me
he
said
deliberately
in
reply
and
if

a
clever
peasant
cleverer
than
you
the
peasant
answered
unexpectedly
with
the
same
gravity
i
doubt
it
said
kolya
somewhat
taken
aback
its
true
though
perhaps
it
is
it
is
brother
goodby
peasant
goodby
there
are
all
sorts
of
peasants
kolya
observed
to
smurov
after
a
brief
silence
how
could
i
tell
i
had
hit
on
a
clever
one
i
am
always
ready
to
recognize
intelligence
in
the
peasantry
in
the
distance
the
cathedral
clock
struck
halfpast
eleven
the
boys
made
haste
and
they
walked
as
far
as
captain
snegiryovs
lodging
a
considerable
distance
quickly
and
almost
in
silence
twenty
paces
from
the
house
kolya
stopped
and
told
smurov
to
go
on
ahead
and
ask
karamazov
to
come
out
to
him
one
must
sniff
round
a
bit
first
he
observed
to
smurov
why
ask
him
to
come
out
smurov
protested
you
go
in
they
will
be
awfully
glad
to
see
you
whats
the
sense
of
making
friends
in
the
frost
out
here
i
know
why
i
want
to
see
him
out
here
in
the
frost
kolya
cut
him
short
in
the
despotic
tone
he
was
fond
of
adopting
with
small
boys
and
smurov
ran
to
do
his
bidding
chapter
iv
the
lost
dog
kolya
leaned
against
the
fence
with
an
air
of
dignity
waiting
for
alyosha
to
appear
yes
he
had
long
wanted
to
meet
him
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
him
from
the
boys
but
hitherto
he
had
always
maintained
an
appearance
of
disdainful
indifference
when
he
was
mentioned
and
he
had
even
criticized
what
he
heard
about
alyosha
but
secretly
he
had
a
great
longing
to
make
his
acquaintance
there
was
something
sympathetic
and
attractive
in
all
he
was
told
about
alyosha
so
the
present
moment
was
important
to
begin
with
he
had
to
show
himself
at
his
best
to
show
his
independence
or
hell
think
of
me
as
thirteen
and
take
me
for
a
boy
like
the
rest
of
them
and
what
are
these
boys
to
him
i
shall
ask
him
when
i
get
to
know
him
its
a
pity
i
am
so
short
though
tuzikov
is
younger
than
i
am
yet
he
is
half
a
head
taller
but
i
have
a
clever
face
i
am
not
goodlooking
i
know
im
hideous
but
ive
a
clever
face
i
mustnt
talk
too
freely
if
i
fall
into
his
arms
all
at
once
he
may
thinktfoo
how
horrible
if
he
should
think
such
were
the
thoughts
that
excited
kolya
while
he
was
doing
his
utmost
to
assume
the
most
independent
air
what
distressed
him
most
was
his
being
so
short
he
did
not
mind
so
much
his
hideous
face
as
being
so
short
on
the
wall
in
a
corner
at
home
he
had
the
year
before
made
a
pencilmark
to
show
his
height
and
every
two
months
since
he
anxiously
measured
himself
against
it
to
see
how
much
he
had
gained
but
alas
he
grew
very
slowly
and
this
sometimes
reduced
him
almost
to
despair
his
face
was
in
reality
by
no
means
hideous
on
the
contrary
it
was
rather
attractive
with
a
fair
pale
skin
freckled
his
small
lively
gray
eyes
had
a
fearless
look
and
often
glowed
with
feeling
he
had
rather
high
cheekbones
small
very
red
but
not
very
thick
lips
his
nose
was
small
and
unmistakably
turned
up
ive

regular
pug

kolya
used
to
mutter
to
himself
when
he
looked
in
the
lookingglass
and
he
always
left
it
with
indignation
but
perhaps
i
havent
got
a
clever
face
he
sometimes
thought
doubtful
even
of
that
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
his
mind
was
preoccupied
with
his
face
and
his
height
on
the
contrary
however
bitter
the
moments
before
the
lookingglass
were
to
him
he
quickly
forgot
them
and
forgot
them
for
a
long
time
abandoning
himself
entirely
to
ideas
and
to
real
life
as
he
formulated
it
to
himself
alyosha
came
out
quickly
and
hastened
up
to
kolya
before
he
reached
him
kolya
could
see
that
he
looked
delighted
can
he
be
so
glad
to
see
me
kolya
wondered
feeling
pleased
we
may
note
here
in
passing
that
alyoshas
appearance
had
undergone
a
complete
change
since
we
saw
him
last
he
had
abandoned
his
cassock
and
was
wearing
now
a
wellcut
coat
a
soft
round
hat
and
his
hair
had
been
cropped
short
all
this
was
very
becoming
to
him
and
he
looked
quite
handsome
his
charming
face
always
had
a
goodhumored
expression
but
there
was
a
gentleness
and
serenity
in
his
goodhumor
to
kolyas
surprise
alyosha
came
out
to
him
just
as
he
was
without
an
overcoat
he
had
evidently
come
in
haste
he
held
out
his
hand
to
kolya
at
once
here
you
are
at
last
how
anxious
weve
been
to
see
you
there
were
reasons
which
you
shall
know
directly
anyway
i
am
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
ive
long
been
hoping
for
an
opportunity
and
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
kolya
muttered
a
little
breathless
we
should
have
met
anyway
ive
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
too
but
youve
been
a
long
time
coming
here

me
how
are
things

ilusha
is
very
ill
he
is
certainly
dying
how
awful
you
must
admit
that
medicine
is
a
fraud
karamazov
cried
kolya
warmly
ilusha
has
mentioned
you
often
very
often
even
in
his
sleep
in
delirium
you
know
one
can
see
that
you
used
to
be
very
very
dear
to
him

before
the
incident

with
the
knife
then
theres
another
reason
tell
me
is
that
your
dog
yes
perezvon
not
zhutchka
alyosha
looked
at
kolya
with
eyes
full
of
pity
is
she
lost
for
ever
i
know
you
would
all
like
it
to
be
zhutchka
ive
heard
all
about
it
kolya
smiled
mysteriously
listen
karamazov
ill
tell
you
all
about
it
thats
what
i
came
for
thats
what
i
asked
you
to
come
out
here
for
to
explain
the
whole
episode
to
you
before
we
go
in
he
began
with
animation
you
see
karamazov
ilusha
came
into
the
preparatory
class
last
spring
well
you
know
what
our
preparatory
class
isa
lot
of
small
boys
they
began
teasing
ilusha
at
once
i
am
two
classes
higher
up
and
of
course
i
only
look
on
at
them
from
a
distance
i
saw
the
boy
was
weak
and
small
but
he
wouldnt
give
in
to
them
he
fought
with
them
i
saw
he
was
proud
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
fire
i
like
children
like
that
and
they
teased
him
all
the
more
the
worst
of
it
was
he
was
horribly
dressed
at
the
time
his
breeches
were
too
small
for
him
and
there
were
holes
in
his
boots
they
worried
him
about
it
they
jeered
at
him
that
i
cant
stand
i
stood
up
for
him
at
once
and
gave
it
to
them
hot
i
beat
them
but
they
adore
me
do
you
know
karamazov
kolya
boasted
impulsively
but
i
am
always
fond
of
children
ive
two
chickens
in
my
hands
at
home
nowthats
what
detained
me
today
so
they
left
off
beating
ilusha
and
i
took
him
under
my
protection
i
saw
the
boy
was
proud
i
tell
you
that
the
boy
was
proud
but
in
the
end
he
became
slavishly
devoted
to
me
he
did
my
slightest
bidding
obeyed
me
as
though
i
were
god
tried
to
copy
me
in
the
intervals
between
the
classes
he
used
to
run
to
me
at
once
and
id
go
about
with
him
on
sundays
too
they
always
laugh
when
an
older
boy
makes
friends
with
a
younger
one
like
that
but
thats
a
prejudice
if
its
my
fancy
thats
enough
i
am
teaching
him
developing
him
why
shouldnt
i
develop
him
if
i
like
him
here
you
karamazov
have
taken
up
with
all
these
nestlings
i
see
you
want
to
influence
the
younger
generationto
develop
them
to
be
of
use
to
them
and
i
assure
you
this
trait
in
your
character
which
i
knew
by
hearsay
attracted
me
more
than
anything
let
us
get
to
the
point
though
i
noticed
that
there
was
a
sort
of
softness
and
sentimentality
coming
over
the
boy
and
you
know
i
have
a
positive
hatred
of
this
sheepish
sentimentality
and
i
have
had
it
from
a
baby
there
were
contradictions
in
him
too
he
was
proud
but
he
was
slavishly
devoted
to
me
and
yet
all
at
once
his
eyes
would
flash
and
hed
refuse
to
agree
with
me
hed
argue
fly
into
a
rage
i
used
sometimes
to
propound
certain
ideas
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
disagreed
with
the
ideas
but
that
he
was
simply
rebelling
against
me
because
i
was
cool
in
responding
to
his
endearments
and
so
in
order
to
train
him
properly
the
tenderer
he
was
the
colder
i
became
i
did
it
on
purpose
that
was
my
idea
my
object
was
to
form
his
character
to
lick
him
into
shape
to
make
a
man
of
him

and
besides

no
doubt
you
understand
me
at
a
word
suddenly
i
noticed
for
three
days
in
succession
he
was
downcast
and
dejected
not
because
of
my
coldness
but
for
something
else
something
more
important
i
wondered
what
the
tragedy
was
i
have
pumped
him
and
found
out
that
he
had
somehow
got
to
know
smerdyakov
who
was
footman
to
your
late
fatherit
was
before
his
death
of
courseand
he
taught
the
little
fool
a
silly
trickthat
is
a
brutal
nasty
trick
he
told
him
to
take
a
piece
of
bread
to
stick
a
pin
in
it
and
throw
it
to
one
of
those
hungry
dogs
who
snap
up
anything
without
biting
it
and
then
to
watch
and
see
what
would
happen
so
they
prepared
a
piece
of
bread
like
that
and
threw
it
to
zhutchka
that
shaggy
dog
theres
been
such
a
fuss
about
the
people
of
the
house
it
belonged
to
never
fed
it
at
all
though
it
barked
all
day
do
you
like
that
stupid
barking
karamazov
i
cant
stand
it
so
it
rushed
at
the
bread
swallowed
it
and
began
to
squeal
it
turned
round
and
round
and
ran
away
squealing
as
it
ran
out
of
sight
that
was
ilushas
own
account
of
it
he
confessed
it
to
me
and
cried
bitterly
he
hugged
me
shaking
all
over
he
kept
on
repeating
he
ran
away
squealing
the
sight
of
that
haunted
him
he
was
tormented
by
remorse
i
could
see
that
i
took
it
seriously
i
determined
to
give
him
a
lesson
for
other
things
as
well
so
i
must
confess
i
wasnt
quite
straightforward
and
pretended
to
be
more
indignant
perhaps
than
i
was
youve
done
a
nasty
thing
i
said
you
are
a
scoundrel
i
wont
tell
of
it
of
course
but
i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
for
a
time
ill
think
it
over
and
let
you
know
through
smurovthats
the
boy
whos
just
come
with
me
hes
always
ready
to
do
anything
for
mewhether
i
will
have
anything
to
do
with
you
in
the
future
or
whether
i
give
you
up
for
good
as
a
scoundrel
he
was
tremendously
upset
i
must
own
i
felt
id
gone
too
far
as
i
spoke
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
did
what
i
thought
best
at
the
time
a
day
or
two
after
i
sent
smurov
to
tell
him
that
i
would
not
speak
to
him
again
thats
what
we
call
it
when
two
schoolfellows
refuse
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
one
another
secretly
i
only
meant
to
send
him
to
coventry
for
a
few
days
and
then
if
i
saw
signs
of
repentance
to
hold
out
my
hand
to
him
again
that
was
my
intention
but
what
do
you
think
happened
he
heard
smurovs
message
his
eyes
flashed
tell
krassotkin
from
me
he
cried
that
i
will
throw
bread
with
pins
to
all
the
dogsallall
of
them
so
hes
going
in
for
a
little
temper
we
must
smoke
it
out
of
him
and
i
began
to
treat
him
with
contempt
whenever
i
met
him
i
turned
away
or
smiled
sarcastically
and
just
then
that
affair
with
his
father
happened
you
remember
you
must
realize
that
he
was
fearfully
worked
up
by
what
had
happened
already
the
boys
seeing
id
given
him
up
set
on
him
and
taunted
him
shouting
wisp
of
tow
wisp
of
tow
and
he
had
soon
regular
skirmishes
with
them
which
i
am
very
sorry
for
they
seem
to
have
given
him
one
very
bad
beating
one
day
he
flew
at
them
all
as
they
were
coming
out
of
school
i
stood
a
few
yards
off
looking
on
and
i
swear
i
dont
remember
that
i
laughed
it
was
quite
the
other
way
i
felt
awfully
sorry
for
him
in
another
minute
i
would
have
run
up
to
take
his
part
but
he
suddenly
met
my
eyes
i
dont
know
what
he
fancied
but
he
pulled
out
a
penknife
rushed
at
me
and
struck
at
my
thigh
here
in
my
right
leg
i
didnt
move
i
dont
mind
owning
i
am
plucky
sometimes
karamazov
i
simply
looked
at
him
contemptuously
as
though
to
say
this
is
how
you
repay
all
my
kindness
do
it
again
if
you
like
im
at
your
service
but
he
didnt
stab
me
again
he
broke
down
he
was
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
he
threw
away
the
knife
burst
out
crying
and
ran
away
i
did
not
sneak
on
him
of
course
and
i
made
them
all
keep
quiet
so
it
shouldnt
come
to
the
ears
of
the
masters
i
didnt
even
tell
my
mother
till
it
had
healed
up
and
the
wound
was
a
mere
scratch
and
then
i
heard
that
the
same
day
hed
been
throwing
stones
and
had
bitten
your
fingerbut
you
understand
now
what
a
state
he
was
in
well
it
cant
be
helped
it
was
stupid
of
me
not
to
come
and
forgive
himthat
is
to
make
it
up
with
himwhen
he
was
taken
ill
i
am
sorry
for
it
now
but
i
had
a
special
reason
so
now
ive
told
you
all
about
it

but
im
afraid
it
was
stupid
of
me
oh
what
a
pity
exclaimed
alyosha
with
feeling
that
i
didnt
know
before
what
terms
you
were
on
with
him
or
id
have
come
to
you
long
ago
to
beg
you
to
go
to
him
with
me
would
you
believe
it
when
he
was
feverish
he
talked
about
you
in
delirium
i
didnt
know
how
much
you
were
to
him
and
youve
really
not
succeeded
in
finding
that
dog
his
father
and
the
boys
have
been
hunting
all
over
the
town
for
it
would
you
believe
it
since
hes
been
ill
ive
three
times
heard
him
repeat
with
tears
its
because
i
killed
zhutchka
father
that
i
am
ill
now
god
is
punishing
me
for
it
he
cant
get
that
idea
out
of
his
head
and
if
the
dog
were
found
and
proved
to
be
alive
one
might
almost
fancy
the
joy
would
cure
him
we
have
all
rested
our
hopes
on
you
tell
me
what
made
you
hope
that
i
should
be
the
one
to
find
him
kolya
asked
with
great
curiosity
why
did
you
reckon
on
me
rather
than
any
one
else
there
was
a
report
that
you
were
looking
for
the
dog
and
that
you
would
bring
it
when
youd
found
it
smurov
said
something
of
the
sort
weve
all
been
trying
to
persuade
ilusha
that
the
dog
is
alive
that
its
been
seen
the
boys
brought
him
a
live
hare
he
just
looked
at
it
with
a
faint
smile
and
asked
them
to
set
it
free
in
the
fields
and
so
we
did
his
father
has
just
this
moment
come
back
bringing
him
a
mastiff
pup
hoping
to
comfort
him
with
that
but
i
think
it
only
makes
it
worse
tell
me
karamazov
what
sort
of
man
is
the
father
i
know
him
but
what
do
you
make
of
hima
mountebank
a
buffoon
oh
no
there
are
people
of
deep
feeling
who
have
been
somehow
crushed
buffoonery
in
them
is
a
form
of
resentful
irony
against
those
to
whom
they
darent
speak
the
truth
from
having
been
for
years
humiliated
and
intimidated
by
them
believe
me
krassotkin
that
sort
of
buffoonery
is
sometimes
tragic
in
the
extreme
his
whole
life
now
is
centered
in
ilusha
and
if
ilusha
dies
he
will
either
go
mad
with
grief
or
kill
himself
i
feel
almost
certain
of
that
when
i
look
at
him
now
i
understand
you
karamazov
i
see
you
understand
human
nature
kolya
added
with
feeling
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
with
a
dog
i
thought
it
was
zhutchka
you
were
bringing
wait
a
bit
karamazov
perhaps
we
shall
find
it
yet
but
this
is
perezvon
ill
let
him
go
in
now
and
perhaps
it
will
amuse
ilusha
more
than
the
mastiff
pup
wait
a
bit
karamazov
you
will
know
something
in
a
minute
but
i
say
i
am
keeping
you
here
kolya
cried
suddenly
youve
no
overcoat
on
in
this
bitter
cold
you
see
what
an
egoist
i
am
oh
we
are
all
egoists
karamazov
dont
trouble
it
is
cold
but
i
dont
often
catch
cold
let
us
go
in
though
and
by
the
way
what
is
your
name
i
know
you
are
called
kolya
but
what
else
nikolaynikolay
ivanovitch
krassotkin
or
as
they
say
in
official
documents
krassotkin
son

kolya
laughed
for
some
reason
but
added
suddenly
of
course
i
hate
my
name
nikolay
why
so
its
so
trivial
so
ordinary
you
are
thirteen
asked
alyosha
no
fourteenthat
is
i
shall
be
fourteen
very
soon
in
a
fortnight
ill
confess
one
weakness
of
mine
karamazov
just
to
you
since
its
our
first
meeting
so
that
you
may
understand
my
character
at
once
i
hate
being
asked
my
age
more
than
that

and
in
fact

theres
a
libelous
story
going
about
me
that
last
week
i
played
robbers
with
the
preparatory
boys
its
a
fact
that
i
did
play
with
them
but
its
a
perfect
libel
to
say
i
did
it
for
my
own
amusement
i
have
reasons
for
believing
that
youve
heard
the
story
but
i
wasnt
playing
for
my
own
amusement
it
was
for
the
sake
of
the
children
because
they
couldnt
think
of
anything
to
do
by
themselves
but
theyve
always
got
some
silly
tale
this
is
an
awful
town
for
gossip
i
can
tell
you
but
what
if
you
had
been
playing
for
your
own
amusement
whats
the
harm
come
i
say
for
my
own
amusement
you
dont
play
horses
do
you
but
you
must
look
at
it
like
this
said
alyosha
smiling
grownup
people
go
to
the
theater
and
there
the
adventures
of
all
sorts
of
heroes
are
representedsometimes
there
are
robbers
and
battles
tooand
isnt
that
just
the
same
thing
in
a
different
form
of
course
and
young
peoples
games
of
soldiers
or
robbers
in
their
playtime
are
also
art
in
its
first
stage
you
know
they
spring
from
the
growing
artistic
instincts
of
the
young
and
sometimes
these
games
are
much
better
than
performances
in
the
theater
the
only
difference
is
that
people
go
there
to
look
at
the
actors
while
in
these
games
the
young
people
are
the
actors
themselves
but
thats
only
natural
you
think
so
is
that
your
idea
kolya
looked
at
him
intently
oh
you
know
thats
rather
an
interesting
view
when
i
go
home
ill
think
it
over
ill
admit
i
thought
i
might
learn
something
from
you
ive
come
to
learn
of
you
karamazov
kolya
concluded
in
a
voice
full
of
spontaneous
feeling
and
i
of
you
said
alyosha
smiling
and
pressing
his
hand
kolya
was
much
pleased
with
alyosha
what
struck
him
most
was
that
he
treated
him
exactly
like
an
equal
and
that
he
talked
to
him
just
as
if
he
were
quite
grown
up
ill
show
you
something
directly
karamazov
its
a
theatrical
performance

he
said
laughing
nervously
thats
why
ive
come
let
us
go
first
to
the
people
of
the
house
on
the
left
all
the
boys
leave
their
coats
in
there
because
the
room
is
small
and
hot

only

in
for
a
minute
ill
keep
on
my
overcoat

passage

and
be
dead

to
him
when

and
youll
see
hell
dash
in
like
mad
only
smurov
must
not
forget
to
open
the
door
at
the
moment
ill
arrange
it
all
and
youll
see
something
chapter
v
by
ilushas
bedside
the
room
inhabited
by
the
family
of
the
retired
captain
snegiryov
is
already
familiar
to
the
reader
it
was
close
and
crowded
at
that
moment
with
a
number
of
visitors
several
boys
were
sitting
with
ilusha
and
though
all
of
them
like
smurov
were
prepared
to
deny
that
it
was
alyosha
who
had
brought
them
and
reconciled
them
with
ilusha
it
was
really
the
fact
all
the
art
he
had
used
had
been
to
take
them
one
by
one
to
ilusha
without
sheepish
sentimentality
appearing
to
do
so
casually
and
without
design
it
was
a
great
consolation
to
ilusha
in
his
suffering
he
was
greatly
touched
by
seeing
the
almost
tender
affection
and
sympathy
shown
him
by
these
boys
who
had
been
his
enemies
krassotkin
was
the
only
one
missing
and
his
absence
was
a
heavy
load
on
ilushas
heart
perhaps
the
bitterest
of
all
his
bitter
memories
was
his
stabbing
krassotkin
who
had
been
his
one
friend
and
protector
clever
little
smurov
who
was
the
first
to
make
it
up
with
ilusha
thought
it
was
so
but
when
smurov
hinted
to
krassotkin
that
alyosha
wanted
to
come
and
see
him
about
something
the
latter
cut
him
short
bidding
smurov
tell
karamazov
at
once
that
he
knew
best
what
to
do
that
he
wanted
no
ones
advice
and
that
if
he
went
to
see
ilusha
he
would
choose
his
own
time
for
he
had
his
own
reasons
that
was
a
fortnight
before
this
sunday
that
was
why
alyosha
had
not
been
to
see
him
as
he
had
meant
to
but
though
he
waited
he
sent
smurov
to
him
twice
again
both
times
krassotkin
met
him
with
a
curt
impatient
refusal
sending
alyosha
a
message
not
to
bother
him
any
more
that
if
he
came
himself
he
krassotkin
would
not
go
to
ilusha
at
all
up
to
the
very
last
day
smurov
did
not
know
that
kolya
meant
to
go
to
ilusha
that
morning
and
only
the
evening
before
as
he
parted
from
smurov
kolya
abruptly
told
him
to
wait
at
home
for
him
next
morning
for
he
would
go
with
him
to
the
snegiryovs
but
warned
him
on
no
account
to
say
he
was
coming
as
he
wanted
to
drop
in
casually
smurov
obeyed
smurovs
fancy
that
kolya
would
bring
back
the
lost
dog
was
based
on
the
words
kolya
had
dropped
that
they
must
be
asses
not
to
find
the
dog
if
it
was
alive
when
smurov
waiting
for
an
opportunity
timidly
hinted
at
his
guess
about
the
dog
krassotkin
flew
into
a
violent
rage
im
not
such
an
ass
as
to
go
hunting
about
the
town
for
other
peoples
dogs
when
ive
got
a
dog
of
my
own
and
how
can
you
imagine
a
dog
could
be
alive
after
swallowing
a
pin
sheepish
sentimentality
thats
what
it
is
for
the
last
fortnight
ilusha
had
not
left
his
little
bed
under
the
ikons
in
the
corner
he
had
not
been
to
school
since
the
day
he
met
alyosha
and
bit
his
finger
he
was
taken
ill
the
same
day
though
for
a
month
afterwards
he
was
sometimes
able
to
get
up
and
walk
about
the
room
and
passage
but
latterly
he
had
become
so
weak
that
he
could
not
move
without
help
from
his
father
his
father
was
terribly
concerned
about
him
he
even
gave
up
drinking
and
was
almost
crazy
with
terror
that
his
boy
would
die
and
often
especially
after
leading
him
round
the
room
on
his
arm
and
putting
him
back
to
bed
he
would
run
to
a
dark
corner
in
the
passage
and
leaning
his
head
against
the
wall
he
would
break
into
paroxysms
of
violent
weeping
stifling
his
sobs
that
they
might
not
be
heard
by
ilusha
returning
to
the
room
he
would
usually
begin
doing
something
to
amuse
and
comfort
his
precious
boy
he
would
tell
him
stories
funny
anecdotes
or
would
mimic
comic
people
he
had
happened
to
meet
even
imitate
the
howls
and
cries
of
animals
but
ilusha
could
not
bear
to
see
his
father
fooling
and
playing
the
buffoon
though
the
boy
tried
not
to
show
how
he
disliked
it
he
saw
with
an
aching
heart
that
his
father
was
an
object
of
contempt
and
he
was
continually
haunted
by
the
memory
of
the
wisp
of
tow
and
that
terrible
day
nina
ilushas
gentle
crippled
sister
did
not
like
her
fathers
buffoonery
either
varvara
had
been
gone
for
some
time
past
to
petersburg
to
study
at
the
university
but
the
halfimbecile
mother
was
greatly
diverted
and
laughed
heartily
when
her
husband
began
capering
about
or
performing
something
it
was
the
only
way
she
could
be
amused
all
the
rest
of
the
time
she
was
grumbling
and
complaining
that
now
every
one
had
forgotten
her
that
no
one
treated
her
with
respect
that
she
was
slighted
and
so
on
but
during
the
last
few
days
she
had
completely
changed
she
began
looking
constantly
at
ilushas
bed
in
the
corner
and
seemed
lost
in
thought
she
was
more
silent
quieter
and
if
she
cried
she
cried
quietly
so
as
not
to
be
heard
the
captain
noticed
the
change
in
her
with
mournful
perplexity
the
boys
visits
at
first
only
angered
her
but
later
on
their
merry
shouts
and
stories
began
to
divert
her
and
at
last
she
liked
them
so
much
that
if
the
boys
had
given
up
coming
she
would
have
felt
dreary
without
them
when
the
children
told
some
story
or
played
a
game
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
she
called
some
of
them
to
her
and
kissed
them
she
was
particularly
fond
of
smurov
as
for
the
captain
the
presence
in
his
room
of
the
children
who
came
to
cheer
up
ilusha
filled
his
heart
from
the
first
with
ecstatic
joy
he
even
hoped
that
ilusha
would
now
get
over
his
depression
and
that
that
would
hasten
his
recovery
in
spite
of
his
alarm
about
ilusha
he
had
not
till
lately
felt
one
minutes
doubt
of
his
boys
ultimate
recovery
he
met
his
little
visitors
with
homage
waited
upon
them
hand
and
foot
he
was
ready
to
be
their
horse
and
even
began
letting
them
ride
on
his
back
but
ilusha
did
not
like
the
game
and
it
was
given
up
he
began
buying
little
things
for
them
gingerbread
and
nuts
gave
them
tea
and
cut
them
sandwiches
it
must
be
noted
that
all
this
time
he
had
plenty
of
money
he
had
taken
the
two
hundred
roubles
from
katerina
ivanovna
just
as
alyosha
had
predicted
he
would
and
afterwards
katerina
ivanovna
learning
more
about
their
circumstances
and
ilushas
illness
visited
them
herself
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
family
and
succeeded
in
fascinating
the
half
imbecile
mother
since
then
she
had
been
lavish
in
helping
them
and
the
captain
terrorstricken
at
the
thought
that
his
boy
might
be
dying
forgot
his
pride
and
humbly
accepted
her
assistance
all
this
time
doctor
herzenstube
who
was
called
in
by
katerina
ivanovna
came
punctually
every
other
day
but
little
was
gained
by
his
visits
and
he
dosed
the
invalid
mercilessly
but
on
that
sunday
morning
a
new
doctor
was
expected
who
had
come
from
moscow
where
he
had
a
great
reputation
katerina
ivanovna
had
sent
for
him
from
moscow
at
great
expense
not
expressly
for
ilusha
but
for
another
object
of
which
more
will
be
said
in
its
place
hereafter
but
as
he
had
come
she
had
asked
him
to
see
ilusha
as
well
and
the
captain
had
been
told
to
expect
him
he
hadnt
the
slightest
idea
that
kolya
krassotkin
was
coming
though
he
had
long
wished
for
a
visit
from
the
boy
for
whom
ilusha
was
fretting
at
the
moment
when
krassotkin
opened
the
door
and
came
into
the
room
the
captain
and
all
the
boys
were
round
ilushas
bed
looking
at
a
tiny
mastiff
pup
which
had
only
been
born
the
day
before
though
the
captain
had
bespoken
it
a
week
ago
to
comfort
and
amuse
ilusha
who
was
still
fretting
over
the
lost
and
probably
dead
zhutchka
ilusha
who
had
heard
three
days
before
that
he
was
to
be
presented
with
a
puppy
not
an
ordinary
puppy
but
a
pedigree
mastiff
a
very
important
point
of
course
tried
from
delicacy
of
feeling
to
pretend
that
he
was
pleased
but
his
father
and
the
boys
could
not
help
seeing
that
the
puppy
only
served
to
recall
to
his
little
heart
the
thought
of
the
unhappy
dog
he
had
killed
the
puppy
lay
beside
him
feebly
moving
and
he
smiling
sadly
stroked
it
with
his
thin
pale
wasted
hand
clearly
he
liked
the
puppy
but

it
wasnt
zhutchka
if
he
could
have
had
zhutchka
and
the
puppy
too
then
he
would
have
been
completely
happy
krassotkin
cried
one
of
the
boys
suddenly
he
was
the
first
to
see
him
come
in
krassotkins
entrance
made
a
general
sensation
the
boys
moved
away
and
stood
on
each
side
of
the
bed
so
that
he
could
get
a
full
view
of
ilusha
the
captain
ran
eagerly
to
meet
kolya
please
come
in

you
are
welcome
he
said
hurriedly
ilusha
mr
krassotkin
has
come
to
see
you
but
krassotkin
shaking
hands
with
him
hurriedly
instantly
showed
his
complete
knowledge
of
the
manners
of
good
society
he
turned
first
to
the
captains
wife
sitting
in
her
armchair
who
was
very
illhumored
at
the
moment
and
was
grumbling
that
the
boys
stood
between
her
and
ilushas
bed
and
did
not
let
her
see
the
new
puppy
with
the
greatest
courtesy
he
made
her
a
bow
scraping
his
foot
and
turning
to
nina
he
made
her
as
the
only
other
lady
present
a
similar
bow
this
polite
behavior
made
an
extremely
favorable
impression
on
the
deranged
lady
there
you
can
see
at
once
he
is
a
young
man
that
has
been
well
brought
up
she
commented
aloud
throwing
up
her
hands
but
as
for
our
other
visitors
they
come
in
one
on
the
top
of
another
how
do
you
mean
mamma
one
on
the
top
of
another
how
is
that
muttered
the
captain
affectionately
though
a
little
anxious
on
her
account
thats
how
they
ride
in
they
get
on
each
others
shoulders
in
the
passage
and
prance
in
like
that
on
a
respectable
family
strange
sort
of
visitors
but
whos
come
in
like
that
mamma
why
that
boy
came
in
riding
on
that
ones
back
and
this
one
on
that
ones
kolya
was
already
by
ilushas
bedside
the
sick
boy
turned
visibly
paler
he
raised
himself
in
the
bed
and
looked
intently
at
kolya
kolya
had
not
seen
his
little
friend
for
two
months
and
he
was
overwhelmed
at
the
sight
of
him
he
had
never
imagined
that
he
would
see
such
a
wasted
yellow
face
such
enormous
feverishly
glowing
eyes
and
such
thin
little
hands
he
saw
with
grieved
surprise
ilushas
rapid
hard
breathing
and
dry
lips
he
stepped
close
to
him
held
out
his
hand
and
almost
overwhelmed
he
said
well
old
man

how
are
you
but
his
voice
failed
him
he
couldnt
achieve
an
appearance
of
ease
his
face
suddenly
twitched
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
quivered
ilusha
smiled
a
pitiful
little
smile
still
unable
to
utter
a
word
something
moved
kolya
to
raise
his
hand
and
pass
it
over
ilushas
hair
never
mind
he
murmured
softly
to
him
to
cheer
him
up
or
perhaps
not
knowing
why
he
said
it
for
a
minute
they
were
silent
again
hallo
so
youve
got
a
new
puppy
kolya
said
suddenly
in
a
most
callous
voice
yees
answered
ilusha
in
a
long
whisper
gasping
for
breath
a
black
nose
that
means
hell
be
fierce
a
good
housedog
kolya
observed
gravely
and
stolidly
as
if
the
only
thing
he
cared
about
was
the
puppy
and
its
black
nose
but
in
reality
he
still
had
to
do
his
utmost
to
control
his
feelings
not
to
burst
out
crying
like
a
child
and
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
control
it
when
it
grows
up
youll
have
to
keep
it
on
the
chain
im
sure
hell
be
a
huge
dog
cried
one
of
the
boys
of
course
he
will
a
mastiff
large
like
this
as
big
as
a
calf
shouted
several
voices
as
big
as
a
calf
as
a
real
calf
chimed
in
the
captain
i
got
one
like
that
on
purpose
one
of
the
fiercest
breed
and
his
parents
are
huge
and
very
fierce
they
stand
as
high
as
this
from
the
floor

down
here
on
ilushas
bed
or
here
on
the
bench

are
welcome

been
hoping
to
see
you
a
long
time
you
were
so
kind
as
to
come
with
alexey
fyodorovitch
krassotkin
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
at
ilushas
feet
though
he
had
perhaps
prepared
a
freeandeasy
opening
for
the
conversation
on
his
way
now
he
completely
lost
the
thread
of
it
no

i
came
with
perezvon
ive
got
a
dog
now
called
perezvon
a
slavonic
name
hes
out
there

if
i
whistle
hell
run
in
ive
brought
a
dog
too
he
said
addressing
ilusha
all
at
once
do
you
remember
zhutchka
old
man
he
suddenly
fired
the
question
at
him
ilushas
little
face
quivered
he
looked
with
an
agonized
expression
at
kolya
alyosha
standing
at
the
door
frowned
and
signed
to
kolya
not
to
speak
of
zhutchka
but
he
did
not
or
would
not
notice
where

is
zhutchka
ilusha
asked
in
a
broken
voice
oh
well
my
boy
your
zhutchkas
lost
and
done
for
ilusha
did
not
speak
but
he
fixed
an
intent
gaze
once
more
on
kolya
alyosha
catching
kolyas
eye
signed
to
him
vigorously
again
but
he
turned
away
his
eyes
pretending
not
to
have
noticed
it
must
have
run
away
and
died
somewhere
it
must
have
died
after
a
meal
like
that
kolya
pronounced
pitilessly
though
he
seemed
a
little
breathless
but
ive
got
a
dog
perezvon

a
slavonic
name
ive
brought
him
to
show
you
i
dont
want
him
said
ilusha
suddenly
no
no
you
really
must
see
him

it
will
amuse
you
i
brought
him
on
purpose
hes
the
same
sort
of
shaggy
dog
you
allow
me
to
call
in
my
dog
madam
he
suddenly
addressed
madame
snegiryov
with
inexplicable
excitement
in
his
manner
i
dont
want
him
i
dont
want
him
cried
ilusha
with
a
mournful
break
in
his
voice
there
was
a
reproachful
light
in
his
eyes
youd
better
the
captain
started
up
from
the
chest
by
the
wall
on
which
he
had
just
sat
down
youd
better

another
time
he
muttered
but
kolya
could
not
be
restrained
he
hurriedly
shouted
to
smurov
open
the
door
and
as
soon
as
it
was
open
he
blew
his
whistle
perezvon
dashed
headlong
into
the
room
jump
perezvon
beg
beg
shouted
kolya
jumping
up
and
the
dog
stood
erect
on
its
hindlegs
by
ilushas
bedside
what
followed
was
a
surprise
to
every
one
ilusha
started
lurched
violently
forward
bent
over
perezvon
and
gazed
at
him
faint
with
suspense
its

zhutchka
he
cried
suddenly
in
a
voice
breaking
with
joy
and
suffering
and
who
did
you
think
it
was
krassotkin
shouted
with
all
his
might
in
a
ringing
happy
voice
and
bending
down
he
seized
the
dog
and
lifted
him
up
to
ilusha
look
old
man
you
see
blind
of
one
eye
and
the
left
ear
is
torn
just
the
marks
you
described
to
me
it
was
by
that
i
found
him
i
found
him
directly
he
did
not
belong
to
any
one
he
explained
turning
quickly
to
the
captain
to
his
wife
to
alyosha
and
then
again
to
ilusha
he
used
to
live
in
the
fedotovs
backyard
though
he
made
his
home
there
they
did
not
feed
him
he
was
a
stray
dog
that
had
run
away
from
the
village

i
found
him
you
see
old
man
he
couldnt
have
swallowed
what
you
gave
him
if
he
had
he
must
have
died
he
must
have
so
he
must
have
spat
it
out
since
he
is
alive
you
did
not
see
him
do
it
but
the
pin
pricked
his
tongue
that
is
why
he
squealed
he
ran
away
squealing
and
you
thought
hed
swallowed
it
he
might
well
squeal
because
the
skin
of
dogs
mouths
is
so
tender

tenderer
than
in
men
much
tenderer
kolya
cried
impetuously
his
face
glowing
and
radiant
with
delight
ilusha
could
not
speak
white
as
a
sheet
he
gazed
openmouthed
at
kolya
with
his
great
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
his
head
and
if
krassotkin
who
had
no
suspicion
of
it
had
known
what
a
disastrous
and
fatal
effect
such
a
moment
might
have
on
the
sick
childs
health
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
play
such
a
trick
on
him
but
alyosha
was
perhaps
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
realized
it
as
for
the
captain
he
behaved
like
a
small
child
zhutchka
its
zhutchka
he
cried
in
a
blissful
voice
ilusha
this
is
zhutchka
your
zhutchka
mamma
this
is
zhutchka
he
was
almost
weeping
and
i
never
guessed
cried
smurov
regretfully
bravo
krassotkin
i
said
hed
find
the
dog
and
here
hes
found
him
here
hes
found
him
another
boy
repeated
gleefully
krassotkins
a
brick
cried
a
third
voice
hes
a
brick
hes
a
brick
cried
the
other
boys
and
they
began
clapping
wait
wait
krassotkin
did
his
utmost
to
shout
above
them
all
ill
tell
you
how
it
happened
thats
the
whole
point
i
found
him
i
took
him
home
and
hid
him
at
once
i
kept
him
locked
up
at
home
and
did
not
show
him
to
any
one
till
today
only
smurov
has
known
for
the
last
fortnight
but
i
assured
him
this
dog
was
called
perezvon
and
he
did
not
guess
and
meanwhile
i
taught
the
dog
all
sorts
of
tricks
you
should
only
see
all
the
things
he
can
do
i
trained
him
so
as
to
bring
you
a
welltrained
dog
in
good
condition
old
man
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
to
you
see
old
man
what
a
fine
dog
your
zhutchka
is
now
havent
you
a
bit
of
meat
hell
show
you
a
trick
that
will
make
you
die
with
laughing
a
piece
of
meat
havent
you
got
any
the
captain
ran
across
the
passage
to
the
landlady
where
their
cooking
was
done
not
to
lose
precious
time
kolya
in
desperate
haste
shouted
to
perezvon
dead
and
the
dog
immediately
turned
round
and
lay
on
his
back
with
its
four
paws
in
the
air
the
boys
laughed
ilusha
looked
on
with
the
same
suffering
smile
but
the
person
most
delighted
with
the
dogs
performance
was
mamma
she
laughed
at
the
dog
and
began
snapping
her
fingers
and
calling
it
perezvon
perezvon
nothing
will
make
him
get
up
nothing
kolya
cried
triumphantly
proud
of
his
success
he
wont
move
for
all
the
shouting
in
the
world
but
if
i
call
to
him
hell
jump
up
in
a
minute
ici
perezvon
the
dog
leapt
up
and
bounded
about
whining
with
delight
the
captain
ran
back
with
a
piece
of
cooked
beef
is
it
hot
kolya
inquired
hurriedly
with
a
businesslike
air
taking
the
meat
dogs
dont
like
hot
things
no
its
all
right
look
everybody
look
ilusha
look
old
man
why
arent
you
looking
he
does
not
look
at
him
now
ive
brought
him
the
new
trick
consisted
in
making
the
dog
stand
motionless
with
his
nose
out
and
putting
a
tempting
morsel
of
meat
just
on
his
nose
the
luckless
dog
had
to
stand
without
moving
with
the
meat
on
his
nose
as
long
as
his
master
chose
to
keep
him
without
a
movement
perhaps
for
half
an
hour
but
he
kept
perezvon
only
for
a
brief
moment
paid
for
cried
kolya
and
the
meat
passed
in
a
flash
from
the
dogs
nose
to
his
mouth
the
audience
of
course
expressed
enthusiasm
and
surprise
can
you
really
have
put
off
coming
all
this
time
simply
to
train
the
dog
exclaimed
alyosha
with
an
involuntary
note
of
reproach
in
his
voice
simply
for
that
answered
kolya
with
perfect
simplicity
i
wanted
to
show
him
in
all
his
glory
perezvon
perezvon
called
ilusha
suddenly
snapping
his
thin
fingers
and
beckoning
to
the
dog
what
is
it
let
him
jump
up
on
the
bed
ici
perezvon
kolya
slapped
the
bed
and
perezvon
darted
up
by
ilusha
the
boy
threw
both
arms
round
his
head
and
perezvon
instantly
licked
his
cheek
ilusha
crept
close
to
him
stretched
himself
out
in
bed
and
hid
his
face
in
the
dogs
shaggy
coat
dear
dear
kept
exclaiming
the
captain
kolya
sat
down
again
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
ilusha
i
can
show
you
another
trick

brought
you

little
cannon

i
told
you

it
before
and
you
said
how
much
youd
like
to
see
it
well
here
ive
brought
it
to
you
and
kolya
hurriedly
pulled
out
of
his
satchel
the
little
bronze
cannon
he
hurried
because
he
was
happy
himself
another
time
he
would
have
waited
till
the
sensation
made
by
perezvon
had
passed
off
now
he
hurried
on
regardless
of
all
consideration
you
are
all
happy
now
he
felt
so
heres
something
to
make
you
happier
he
was
perfectly
enchanted
himself
ive
been
coveting
this
thing
for
a
long
while
its
for
you
old
man
its
for
you
it
belonged
to
morozov
it
was
no
use
to
him
he
had
it
from
his
brother
i
swopped
a
book
from
fathers
bookcase
for
it
a
kinsman
of
mahomet
or
salutary
folly
a
scandalous
book
published
in
moscow
a
hundred
years
ago
before
they
had
any
censorship
and
morozov
has
a
taste
for
such
things
he
was
grateful
to
me
too
kolya
held
the
cannon
in
his
hand
so
that
all
could
see
and
admire
it
ilusha
raised
himself
and
with
his
right
arm
still
round
the
dog
he
gazed
enchanted
at
the
toy
the
sensation
was
even
greater
when
kolya
announced
that
he
had
gunpowder
too
and
that
it
could
be
fired
off
at
once
if
it
wont
alarm
the
ladies
mamma
immediately
asked
to
look
at
the
toy
closer
and
her
request
was
granted
she
was
much
pleased
with
the
little
bronze
cannon
on
wheels
and
began
rolling
it
to
and
fro
on
her
lap
she
readily
gave
permission
for
the
cannon
to
be
fired
without
any
idea
of
what
she
had
been
asked
kolya
showed
the
powder
and
the
shot
the
captain
as
a
military
man
undertook
to
load
it
putting
in
a
minute
quantity
of
powder
he
asked
that
the
shot
might
be
put
off
till
another
time
the
cannon
was
put
on
the
floor
aiming
towards
an
empty
part
of
the
room
three
grains
of
powder
were
thrust
into
the
touchhole
and
a
match
was
put
to
it
a
magnificent
explosion
followed
mamma
was
startled
but
at
once
laughed
with
delight
the
boys
gazed
in
speechless
triumph
but
the
captain
looking
at
ilusha
was
more
enchanted
than
any
of
them
kolya
picked
up
the
cannon
and
immediately
presented
it
to
ilusha
together
with
the
powder
and
the
shot
i
got
it
for
you
for
you
ive
been
keeping
it
for
you
a
long
time
he
repeated
once
more
in
his
delight
oh
give
it
to
me
no
give
me
the
cannon
mamma
began
begging
like
a
little
child
her
face
showed
a
piteous
fear
that
she
would
not
get
it
kolya
was
disconcerted
the
captain
fidgeted
uneasily
mamma
mamma
he
ran
to
her
the
cannons
yours
of
course
but
let
ilusha
have
it
because
its
a
present
to
him
but
its
just
as
good
as
yours
ilusha
will
always
let
you
play
with
it
it
shall
belong
to
both
of
you
both
of
you
no
i
dont
want
it
to
belong
to
both
of
us
i
want
it
to
be
mine
altogether
not
ilushas
persisted
mamma
on
the
point
of
tears
take
it
mother
here
keep
it
ilusha
cried
krassotkin
may
i
give
it
to
my
mother
he
turned
to
krassotkin
with
an
imploring
face
as
though
he
were
afraid
he
might
be
offended
at
his
giving
his
present
to
some
one
else
of
course
you
may
krassotkin
assented
heartily
and
taking
the
cannon
from
ilusha
he
handed
it
himself
to
mamma
with
a
polite
bow
she
was
so
touched
that
she
cried
ilusha
darling
hes
the
one
who
loves
his
mamma
she
said
tenderly
and
at
once
began
wheeling
the
cannon
to
and
fro
on
her
lap
again
mamma
let
me
kiss
your
hand
the
captain
darted
up
to
her
at
once
and
did
so
and
i
never
saw
such
a
charming
fellow
as
this
nice
boy
said
the
grateful
lady
pointing
to
krassotkin
and
ill
bring
you
as
much
powder
as
you
like
ilusha
we
make
the
powder
ourselves
now
borovikov
found
out
how
its
madetwentyfour
parts
of
saltpeter
ten
of
sulphur
and
six
of
birchwood
charcoal
its
all
pounded
together
mixed
into
a
paste
with
water
and
rubbed
through
a
tammy
sievethats
how
its
done
smurov
told
me
about
your
powder
only
father
says
its
not
real
gunpowder
responded
ilusha
not
real
kolya
flushed
it
burns
i
dont
know
of
course
no
i
didnt
mean
that
put
in
the
captain
with
a
guilty
face
i
only
said
that
real
powder
is
not
made
like
that
but
thats
nothing
it
can
be
made
so
i
dont
know
you
know
best
we
lighted
some
in
a
pomatum
pot
it
burned
splendidly
it
all
burnt
away
leaving
only
a
tiny
ash
but
that
was
only
the
paste
and
if
you
rub
it
through

but
of
course
you
know
best
i
dont
know
and
bulkins
father
thrashed
him
on
account
of
our
powder
did
you
hear
he
turned
to
ilusha
yes
answered
ilusha
he
listened
to
kolya
with
immense
interest
and
enjoyment
we
had
prepared
a
whole
bottle
of
it
and
he
used
to
keep
it
under
his
bed
his
father
saw
it
he
said
it
might
explode
and
thrashed
him
on
the
spot
he
was
going
to
make
a
complaint
against
me
to
the
masters
he
is
not
allowed
to
go
about
with
me
now
no
one
is
allowed
to
go
about
with
me
now
smurov
is
not
allowed
to
either
ive
got
a
bad
name
with
every
one
they
say
im
a
desperate
character

kolya
smiled
scornfully
it
all
began
from
what
happened
on
the
railway
ah
weve
heard
of
that
exploit
of
yours
too
cried
the
captain
how
could
you
lie
still
on
the
line
is
it
possible
you
werent
the
least
afraid
lying
there
under
the
train
werent
you
frightened
the
captain
was
abject
in
his
flattery
of
kolya
nnot
particularly
answered
kolya
carelessly
whats
blasted
my
reputation
more
than
anything
here
was
that
cursed
goose
he
said
turning
again
to
ilusha
but
though
he
assumed
an
unconcerned
air
as
he
talked
he
still
could
not
control
himself
and
was
continually
missing
the
note
he
tried
to
keep
up
ah
i
heard
about
the
goose
ilusha
laughed
beaming
all
over
they
told
me
but
i
didnt
understand
did
they
really
take
you
to
the
court
the
most
stupid
trivial
affair
they
made
a
mountain
of
a
molehill
as
they
always
do
kolya
began
carelessly
i
was
walking
through
the
marketplace
here
one
day
just
when
theyd
driven
in
the
geese
i
stopped
and
looked
at
them
all
at
once
a
fellow
who
is
an
errandboy
at
plotnikovs
now
looked
at
me
and
said
what
are
you
looking
at
the
geese
for
i
looked
at
him
he
was
a
stupid
moonfaced
fellow
of
twenty
i
am
always
on
the
side
of
the
peasantry
you
know
i
like
talking
to
the
peasants
weve
dropped
behind
the
peasantsthats
an
axiom
i
believe
you
are
laughing
karamazov
no
heaven
forbid
i
am
listening
said
alyosha
with
a
most
goodnatured
air
and
the
sensitive
kolya
was
immediately
reassured
my
theory
karamazov
is
clear
and
simple
he
hurried
on
again
looking
pleased
i
believe
in
the
people
and
am
always
glad
to
give
them
their
due
but
i
am
not
for
spoiling
them
that
is
a
sine
qua
non

but
i
was
telling
you
about
the
goose
so
i
turned
to
the
fool
and
answered
i
am
wondering
what
the
goose
thinks
about
he
looked
at
me
quite
stupidly
and
what
does
the
goose
think
about
he
asked
do
you
see
that
cart
full
of
oats
i
said
the
oats
are
dropping
out
of
the
sack
and
the
goose
has
put
its
neck
right
under
the
wheel
to
gobble
them
updo
you
see
i
see
that
quite
well
he
said
well
said
i
if
that
cart
were
to
move
on
a
little
would
it
break
the
gooses
neck
or
not
itd
be
sure
to
break
it
and
he
grinned
all
over
his
face
highly
delighted
come
on
then
said
i
lets
try
lets
he
said
and
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
arrange
he
stood
at
the
bridle
without
being
noticed
and
i
stood
on
one
side
to
direct
the
goose
and
the
owner
wasnt
looking
he
was
talking
to
some
one
so
i
had
nothing
to
do
the
goose
thrust
its
head
in
after
the
oats
of
itself
under
the
cart
just
under
the
wheel
i
winked
at
the
lad
he
tugged
at
the
bridle
and
crack
the
gooses
neck
was
broken
in
half
and
as
luck
would
have
it
all
the
peasants
saw
us
at
that
moment
and
they
kicked
up
a
shindy
at
once
you
did
that
on
purpose
no
not
on
purpose
yes
you
did
on
purpose
well
they
shouted
take
him
to
the
justice
of
the
peace
they
took
me
too
you
were
there
too
they
said
you
helped
youre
known
all
over
the
market
and
for
some
reason
i
really
am
known
all
over
the
market
kolya
added
conceitedly
we
all
went
off
to
the
justices
they
brought
the
goose
too
the
fellow
was
crying
in
a
great
funk
simply
blubbering
like
a
woman
and
the
farmer
kept
shouting
that
you
could
kill
any
number
of
geese
like
that
well
of
course
there
were
witnesses
the
justice
of
the
peace
settled
it
in
a
minute
that
the
farmer
was
to
be
paid
a
rouble
for
the
goose
and
the
fellow
to
have
the
goose
and
he
was
warned
not
to
play
such
pranks
again
and
the
fellow
kept
blubbering
like
a
woman
it
wasnt
me
he
said
it
was
he
egged
me
on
and
he
pointed
to
me
i
answered
with
the
utmost
composure
that
i
hadnt
egged
him
on
that
i
simply
stated
the
general
proposition
had
spoken
hypothetically
the
justice
of
the
peace
smiled
and
was
vexed
with
himself
at
once
for
having
smiled
ill
complain
to
your
masters
of
you
so
that
for
the
future
you
maynt
waste
your
time
on
such
general
propositions
instead
of
sitting
at
your
books
and
learning
your
lessons
he
didnt
complain
to
the
masters
that
was
a
joke
but
the
matter
was
noised
abroad
and
came
to
the
ears
of
the
masters
their
ears
are
long
you
know
the
classical
master
kolbasnikov
was
particularly
shocked
about
it
but
dardanelov
got
me
off
again
but
kolbasnikov
is
savage
with
every
one
now
like
a
green
ass
did
you
know
ilusha
he
is
just
married
got
a
dowry
of
a
thousand
roubles
and
his
brides
a
regular
fright
of
the
first
rank
and
the
last
degree
the
thirdclass
fellows
wrote
an
epigram
on
it
astounding
news
has
reached
the
class
kolbasnikov
has
been
an
ass
and
so
on
awfully
funny
ill
bring
it
to
you
later
on
i
say
nothing
against
dardanelov
he
is
a
learned
man
theres
no
doubt
about
it
i
respect
men
like
that
and
its
not
because
he
stood
up
for
me
but
you
took
him
down
about
the
founders
of
troy
smurov
put
in
suddenly
unmistakably
proud
of
krassotkin
at
such
a
moment
he
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
story
of
the
goose
did
you
really
take
him
down
the
captain
inquired
in
a
flattering
way
on
the
question
who
founded
troy
we
heard
of
it
ilusha
told
me
about
it
at
the
time
he
knows
everything
father
he
knows
more
than
any
of
us
put
in
ilusha
he
only
pretends
to
be
like
that
but
really
he
is
top
in
every
subject
ilusha
looked
at
kolya
with
infinite
happiness
oh
thats
all
nonsense
about
troy
a
trivial
matter
i
consider
this
an
unimportant
question
said
kolya
with
haughty
humility
he
had
by
now
completely
recovered
his
dignity
though
he
was
still
a
little
uneasy
he
felt
that
he
was
greatly
excited
and
that
he
had
talked
about
the
goose
for
instance
with
too
little
reserve
while
alyosha
had
looked
serious
and
had
not
said
a
word
all
the
time
and
the
vain
boy
began
by
degrees
to
have
a
rankling
fear
that
alyosha
was
silent
because
he
despised
him
and
thought
he
was
showing
off
before
him
if
he
dared
to
think
anything
like
that
kolya
would
i
regard
the
question
as
quite
a
trivial
one
he
rapped
out
again
proudly
and
i
know
who
founded
troy
a
boy
who
had
not
spoken
before
said
suddenly
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
he
was
silent
and
seemed
to
be
shy
he
was
a
pretty
boy
of
about
eleven
called
kartashov
he
was
sitting
near
the
door
kolya
looked
at
him
with
dignified
amazement
the
fact
was
that
the
identity
of
the
founders
of
troy
had
become
a
secret
for
the
whole
school
a
secret
which
could
only
be
discovered
by
reading
smaragdov
and
no
one
had
smaragdov
but
kolya
one
day
when
kolyas
back
was
turned
kartashov
hastily
opened
smaragdov
which
lay
among
kolyas
books
and
immediately
lighted
on
the
passage
relating
to
the
foundation
of
troy
this
was
a
good
time
ago
but
he
felt
uneasy
and
could
not
bring
himself
to
announce
publicly
that
he
too
knew
who
had
founded
troy
afraid
of
what
might
happen
and
of
krassotkins
somehow
putting
him
to
shame
over
it
but
now
he
couldnt
resist
saying
it
for
weeks
he
had
been
longing
to
well
who
did
found
it
asked
kolya
turning
to
him
with
haughty
superciliousness
he
saw
from
his
face
that
he
really
did
know
and
at
once
made
up
his
mind
how
to
take
it
there
was
so
to
speak
a
discordant
note
in
the
general
harmony
troy
was
founded
by
teucer
dardanus
ilius
and
tros
the
boy
rapped
out
at
once
and
in
the
same
instant
he
blushed
blushed
so
that
it
was
painful
to
look
at
him
but
the
boys
stared
at
him
stared
at
him
for
a
whole
minute
and
then
all
the
staring
eyes
turned
at
once
and
were
fastened
upon
kolya
who
was
still
scanning
the
audacious
boy
with
disdainful
composure
in
what
sense
did
they
found
it
he
deigned
to
comment
at
last
and
what
is
meant
by
founding
a
city
or
a
state
what
do
they
do
did
they
go
and
each
lay
a
brick
do
you
suppose
there
was
laughter
the
offending
boy
turned
from
pink
to
crimson
he
was
silent
and
on
the
point
of
tears
kolya
held
him
so
for
a
minute
before
you
talk
of
a
historical
event
like
the
foundation
of
a
nationality
you
must
first
understand
what
you
mean
by
it
he
admonished
him
in
stern
incisive
tones
but
i
attach
no
consequence
to
these
old
wives
tales
and
i
dont
think
much
of
universal
history
in
general
he
added
carelessly
addressing
the
company
generally
universal
history
the
captain
inquired
looking
almost
scared
yes
universal
history
its
the
study
of
the
successive
follies
of
mankind
and
nothing
more
the
only
subjects
i
respect
are
mathematics
and
natural
science
said
kolya
he
was
showing
off
and
he
stole
a
glance
at
alyosha
his
was
the
only
opinion
he
was
afraid
of
there
but
alyosha
was
still
silent
and
still
serious
as
before
if
alyosha
had
said
a
word
it
would
have
stopped
him
but
alyosha
was
silent
and
it
might
be
the
silence
of
contempt
and
that
finally
irritated
kolya
the
classical
languages
too

they
are
simply
madness
nothing
more
you
seem
to
disagree
with
me
again
karamazov
i
dont
agree
said
alyosha
with
a
faint
smile
the
study
of
the
classics
if
you
ask
my
opinion
is
simply
a
police
measure
thats
simply
why
it
has
been
introduced
into
our
schools
by
degrees
kolya
began
to
get
breathless
again
latin
and
greek
were
introduced
because
they
are
a
bore
and
because
they
stupefy
the
intellect
it
was
dull
before
so
what
could
they
do
to
make
things
duller
it
was
senseless
enough
before
so
what
could
they
do
to
make
it
more
senseless
so
they
thought
of
greek
and
latin
thats
my
opinion
i
hope
i
shall
never
change
it
kolya
finished
abruptly
his
cheeks
were
flushed
thats
true
assented
smurov
suddenly
in
a
ringing
tone
of
conviction
he
had
listened
attentively
and
yet
he
is
first
in
latin
himself
cried
one
of
the
group
of
boys
suddenly
yes
father
he
says
that
and
yet
he
is
first
in
latin
echoed
ilusha
what
of
it
kolya
thought
fit
to
defend
himself
though
the
praise
was
very
sweet
to
him
i
am
fagging
away
at
latin
because
i
have
to
because
i
promised
my
mother
to
pass
my
examination
and
i
think
that
whatever
you
do
its
worth
doing
it
well
but
in
my
soul
i
have
a
profound
contempt
for
the
classics
and
all
that
fraud
you
dont
agree
karamazov
why
fraud
alyosha
smiled
again
well
all
the
classical
authors
have
been
translated
into
all
languages
so
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
studying
the
classics
they
introduced
latin
but
solely
as
a
police
measure
to
stupefy
the
intelligence
so
what
can
one
call
it
but
a
fraud
why
who
taught
you
all
this
cried
alyosha
surprised
at
last
in
the
first
place
i
am
capable
of
thinking
for
myself
without
being
taught
besides
what
i
said
just
now
about
the
classics
being
translated
our
teacher
kolbasnikov
has
said
to
the
whole
of
the
third
class
the
doctor
has
come
cried
nina
who
had
been
silent
till
then
a
carriage
belonging
to
madame
hohlakov
drove
up
to
the
gate
the
captain
who
had
been
expecting
the
doctor
all
the
morning
rushed
headlong
out
to
meet
him
mamma
pulled
herself
together
and
assumed
a
dignified
air
alyosha
went
up
to
ilusha
and
began
setting
his
pillows
straight
nina
from
her
invalid
chair
anxiously
watched
him
putting
the
bed
tidy
the
boys
hurriedly
took
leave
some
of
them
promised
to
come
again
in
the
evening
kolya
called
perezvon
and
the
dog
jumped
off
the
bed
i
wont
go
away
i
wont
go
away
kolya
said
hastily
to
ilusha
ill
wait
in
the
passage
and
come
back
when
the
doctors
gone
ill
come
back
with
perezvon
but
by
now
the
doctor
had
entered
an
importantlooking
person
with
long
dark
whiskers
and
a
shiny
shaven
chin
wearing
a
bearskin
coat
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
he
stopped
taken
aback
he
probably
fancied
he
had
come
to
the
wrong
place
how
is
this
where
am
i
he
muttered
not
removing
his
coat
nor
his
peaked
sealskin
cap
the
crowd
the
poverty
of
the
room
the
washing
hanging
on
a
line
in
the
corner
puzzled
him
the
captain
bent
double
was
bowing
low
before
him
its
here
sir
here
sir
he
muttered
cringingly
its
here
youve
come
right
you
were
coming
to
us
snegiryov
the
doctor
said
loudly
and
pompously
mr
snegiryovis
that
you
thats
me
sir
ah
the
doctor
looked
round
the
room
with
a
squeamish
air
once
more
and
threw
off
his
coat
displaying
to
all
eyes
the
grand
decoration
at
his
neck
the
captain
caught
the
fur
coat
in
the
air
and
the
doctor
took
off
his
cap
where
is
the
patient
he
asked
emphatically
chapter
vi
precocity
what
do
you
think
the
doctor
will
say
to
him
kolya
asked
quickly
what
a
repulsive
mug
though
hasnt
he
i
cant
endure
medicine
ilusha
is
dying
i
think
thats
certain
answered
alyosha
mournfully
they
are
rogues
medicines
a
fraud
i
am
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
though
karamazov
i
wanted
to
know
you
for
a
long
time
i
am
only
sorry
we
meet
in
such
sad
circumstances
kolya
had
a
great
inclination
to
say
something
even
warmer
and
more
demonstrative
but
he
felt
ill
at
ease
alyosha
noticed
this
smiled
and
pressed
his
hand
ive
long
learned
to
respect
you
as
a
rare
person
kolya
muttered
again
faltering
and
uncertain
i
have
heard
you
are
a
mystic
and
have
been
in
the
monastery
i
know
you
are
a
mystic
but

that
hasnt
put
me
off
contact
with
real
life
will
cure
you
its
always
so
with
characters
like
yours
what
do
you
mean
by
mystic
cure
me
of
what
alyosha
was
rather
astonished
oh
god
and
all
the
rest
of
it
what
dont
you
believe
in
god
oh
ive
nothing
against
god
of
course
god
is
only
a
hypothesis
but

i
admit
that
he
is
needed

for
the
order
of
the
universe
and
all
that

and
that
if
there
were
no
god
he
would
have
to
be
invented
added
kolya
beginning
to
blush
he
suddenly
fancied
that
alyosha
might
think
he
was
trying
to
show
off
his
knowledge
and
to
prove
that
he
was
grown
up
i
havent
the
slightest
desire
to
show
off
my
knowledge
to
him
kolya
thought
indignantly
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
felt
horribly
annoyed
i
must
confess
i
cant
endure
entering
on
such
discussions
he
said
with
a
final
air
its
possible
for
one
who
doesnt
believe
in
god
to
love
mankind
dont
you
think
so
voltaire
didnt
believe
in
god
and
loved
mankind
i
am
at
it
again
he
thought
to
himself
voltaire
believed
in
god
though
not
very
much
i
think
and
i
dont
think
he
loved
mankind
very
much
either
said
alyosha
quietly
gently
and
quite
naturally
as
though
he
were
talking
to
some
one
of
his
own
age
or
even
older
kolya
was
particularly
struck
by
alyoshas
apparent
diffidence
about
his
opinion
of
voltaire
he
seemed
to
be
leaving
the
question
for
him
little
kolya
to
settle
have
you
read
voltaire
alyosha
finished
no
not
to
say
read
but
ive
read
candide
in
the
russian
translation

in
an
absurd
grotesque
old
translation

at
it
again
again
and
did
you
understand
it
oh
yes
everything
that
is

why
do
you
suppose
i
shouldnt
understand
it
theres
a
lot
of
nastiness
in
it
of
course
of
course
i
can
understand
that
its
a
philosophical
novel
and
written
to
advocate
an
idea
kolya
was
getting
mixed
by
now
i
am
a
socialist
karamazov
i
am
an
incurable
socialist
he
announced
suddenly
apropos
of
nothing
a
socialist
laughed
alyosha
but
when
have
you
had
time
to
become
one
why
i
thought
you
were
only
thirteen
kolya
winced
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
thirteen
but
fourteen
fourteen
in
a
fortnight
he
flushed
angrily
and
in
the
second
place
i
am
at
a
complete
loss
to
understand
what
my
age
has
to
do
with
it
the
question
is
what
are
my
convictions
not
what
is
my
age
isnt
it
when
you
are
older
youll
understand
for
yourself
the
influence
of
age
on
convictions
i
fancied
too
that
you
were
not
expressing
your
own
ideas
alyosha
answered
serenely
and
modestly
but
kolya
interrupted
him
hotly
come
you
want
obedience
and
mysticism
you
must
admit
that
the
christian
religion
for
instance
has
only
been
of
use
to
the
rich
and
the
powerful
to
keep
the
lower
classes
in
slavery
thats
so
isnt
it
ah
i
know
where
you
read
that
and
i
am
sure
some
one
told
you
so
cried
alyosha
i
say
what
makes
you
think
i
read
it
and
certainly
no
one
told
me
so
i
can
think
for
myself
i
am
not
opposed
to
christ
if
you
like
he
was
a
most
humane
person
and
if
he
were
alive
today
he
would
be
found
in
the
ranks
of
the
revolutionists
and
would
perhaps
play
a
conspicuous
part
theres
no
doubt
about
that
oh
where
where
did
you
get
that
from
what
fool
have
you
made
friends
with
exclaimed
alyosha
come
the
truth
will
out
it
has
so
chanced
that
i
have
often
talked
to
mr
rakitin
of
course
but

old
byelinsky
said
that
too
so
they
say
byelinsky
i
dont
remember
he
hasnt
written
that
anywhere
if
he
didnt
write
it
they
say
he
said
it
i
heard
that
from
a

but
never
mind
and
have
you
read
byelinsky
well
no

i
havent
read
all
of
him
but

i
read
the
passage
about
tatyana
why
she
didnt
go
off
with
onyegin
didnt
go
off
with
onyegin
surely
you
dont

understand
that
already
why
you
seem
to
take
me
for
little
smurov
said
kolya
with
a
grin
of
irritation
but
please
dont
suppose
i
am
such
a
revolutionist
i
often
disagree
with
mr
rakitin
though
i
mention
tatyana
i
am
not
at
all
for
the
emancipation
of
women
i
acknowledge
that
women
are
a
subject
race
and
must
obey
les
femmes
tricottent
as
napoleon
said
kolya
for
some
reason
smiled
and
on
that
question
at
least
i
am
quite
of
one
mind
with
that
pseudogreat
man
i
think
too
that
to
leave
ones
own
country
and
fly
to
america
is
mean
worse
than
meansilly
why
go
to
america
when
one
may
be
of
great
service
to
humanity
here
now
especially
theres
a
perfect
mass
of
fruitful
activity
open
to
us
thats
what
i
answered
what
do
you
mean
answered
whom
has
some
one
suggested
your
going
to
america
already
i
must
own
theyve
been
at
me
to
go
but
i
declined
thats
between
ourselves
of
course
karamazov
do
you
hear
not
a
word
to
any
one
i
say
this
only
to
you
i
am
not
at
all
anxious
to
fall
into
the
clutches
of
the
secret
police
and
take
lessons
at
the
chain
bridge
long
will
you
remember
the
house
at
the
chain
bridge
do
you
remember
its
splendid
why
are
you
laughing
you
dont
suppose
i
am
fibbing
do
you
what
if
he
should
find
out
that
ive
only
that
one
number
of
the
bell
in
fathers
bookcase
and
havent
read
any
more
of
it
kolya
thought
with
a
shudder
oh
no
i
am
not
laughing
and
dont
suppose
for
a
moment
that
you
are
lying
no
indeed
i
cant
suppose
so
for
all
this
alas
is
perfectly
true
but
tell
me
have
you
read
pushkinonyegin
for
instance
you
spoke
just
now
of
tatyana
no
i
havent
read
it
yet
but
i
want
to
read
it
i
have
no
prejudices
karamazov
i
want
to
hear
both
sides
what
makes
you
ask
oh
nothing
tell
me
karamazov
have
you
an
awful
contempt
for
me
kolya
rapped
out
suddenly
and
drew
himself
up
before
alyosha
as
though
he
were
on
drill
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
without
beating
about
the
bush
i
have
a
contempt
for
you
alyosha
looked
at
him
wondering
what
for
i
am
only
sad
that
a
charming
nature
such
as
yours
should
be
perverted
by
all
this
crude
nonsense
before
you
have
begun
life
dont
be
anxious
about
my
nature
kolya
interrupted
not
without
complacency
but
its
true
that
i
am
stupidly
sensitive
crudely
sensitive
you
smiled
just
now
and
i
fancied
you
seemed
to
oh
my
smile
meant
something
quite
different
ill
tell
you
why
i
smiled
not
long
ago
i
read
the
criticism
made
by
a
german
who
had
lived
in
russia
on
our
students
and
schoolboys
of
today
show
a
russian
schoolboy
he
writes
a
map
of
the
stars
which
he
knows
nothing
about
and
he
will
give
you
back
the
map
next
day
with
corrections
on
it
no
knowledge
and
unbounded
conceitthats
what
the
german
meant
to
say
about
the
russian
schoolboy
yes
thats
perfectly
right
kolya
laughed
suddenly
exactly
so
bravo
the
german
but
he
did
not
see
the
good
side
what
do
you
think
conceit
may
be
that
comes
from
youth
that
will
be
corrected
if
need
be
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
an
independent
spirit
almost
from
childhood
boldness
of
thought
and
conviction
and
not
the
spirit
of
these
sausage
makers
groveling
before
authority
but
the
german
was
right
all
the
same
bravo
the
german
but
germans
want
strangling
all
the
same
though
they
are
so
good
at
science
and
learning
they
must
be
strangled
strangled
what
for
smiled
alyosha
well
perhaps
i
am
talking
nonsense
i
agree
i
am
awfully
childish
sometimes
and
when
i
am
pleased
about
anything
i
cant
restrain
myself
and
am
ready
to
talk
any
stuff
but
i
say
we
are
chattering
away
here
about
nothing
and
that
doctor
has
been
a
long
time
in
there
but
perhaps
hes
examining
the
mamma
and
that
poor
crippled
nina
i
liked
that
nina
you
know
she
whispered
to
me
suddenly
as
i
was
coming
away
why
didnt
you
come
before
and
in
such
a
voice
so
reproachfully
i
think
she
is
awfully
nice
and
pathetic
yes
yes
well
youll
be
coming
often
you
will
see
what
she
is
like
it
would
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
to
know
people
like
that
to
learn
to
value
a
great
deal
which
you
will
find
out
from
knowing
these
people
alyosha
observed
warmly
that
would
have
more
effect
on
you
than
anything
oh
how
i
regret
and
blame
myself
for
not
having
come
sooner
kolya
exclaimed
with
bitter
feeling
yes
its
a
great
pity
you
saw
for
yourself
how
delighted
the
poor
child
was
to
see
you
and
how
he
fretted
for
you
to
come
dont
tell
me
you
make
it
worse
but
it
serves
me
right
what
kept
me
from
coming
was
my
conceit
my
egoistic
vanity
and
the
beastly
wilfullness
which
i
never
can
get
rid
of
though
ive
been
struggling
with
it
all
my
life
i
see
that
now
i
am
a
beast
in
lots
of
ways
karamazov
no
you
have
a
charming
nature
though
its
been
distorted
and
i
quite
understand
why
you
have
had
such
an
influence
on
this
generous
morbidly
sensitive
boy
alyosha
answered
warmly
and
you
say
that
to
me
cried
kolya
and
would
you
believe
it
i
thoughtive
thought
several
times
since
ive
been
herethat
you
despised
me
if
only
you
knew
how
i
prize
your
opinion
but
are
you
really
so
sensitive
at
your
age
would
you
believe
it
just
now
when
you
were
telling
your
story
i
thought
as
i
watched
you
that
you
must
be
very
sensitive
you
thought
so
what
an
eye
youve
got
i
say
i
bet
that
was
when
i
was
talking
about
the
goose
that
was
just
when
i
was
fancying
you
had
a
great
contempt
for
me
for
being
in
such
a
hurry
to
show
off
and
for
a
moment
i
quite
hated
you
for
it
and
began
talking
like
a
fool
then
i
fanciedjust
now
herewhen
i
said
that
if
there
were
no
god
he
would
have
to
be
invented
that
i
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
display
my
knowledge
especially
as
i
got
that
phrase
out
of
a
book
but
i
swear
i
wasnt
showing
off
out
of
vanity
though
i
really
dont
know
why
because
i
was
so
pleased
yes
i
believe
it
was
because
i
was
so
pleased

though
its
perfectly
disgraceful
for
any
one
to
be
gushing
directly
they
are
pleased
i
know
that
but
i
am
convinced
now
that
you
dont
despise
me
it
was
all
my
imagination
oh
karamazov
i
am
profoundly
unhappy
i
sometimes
fancy
all
sorts
of
things
that
every
one
is
laughing
at
me
the
whole
world
and
then
i
feel
ready
to
overturn
the
whole
order
of
things
and
you
worry
every
one
about
you
smiled
alyosha
yes
i
worry
every
one
about
me
especially
my
mother
karamazov
tell
me
am
i
very
ridiculous
now
dont
think
about
that
dont
think
of
it
at
all
cried
alyosha
and
what
does
ridiculous
mean
isnt
every
one
constantly
being
or
seeming
ridiculous
besides
nearly
all
clever
people
now
are
fearfully
afraid
of
being
ridiculous
and
that
makes
them
unhappy
all
i
am
surprised
at
is
that
you
should
be
feeling
that
so
early
though
ive
observed
it
for
some
time
past
and
not
only
in
you
nowadays
the
very
children
have
begun
to
suffer
from
it
its
almost
a
sort
of
insanity
the
devil
has
taken
the
form
of
that
vanity
and
entered
into
the
whole
generation
its
simply
the
devil
added
alyosha
without
a
trace
of
the
smile
that
kolya
staring
at
him
expected
to
see
you
are
like
every
one
else
said
alyosha
in
conclusion
that
is
like
very
many
others
only
you
must
not
be
like
everybody
else
thats
all
even
if
every
one
is
like
that
yes
even
if
every
one
is
like
that
you
be
the
only
one
not
like
it
you
really
are
not
like
every
one
else
here
you
are
not
ashamed
to
confess
to
something
bad
and
even
ridiculous
and
who
will
admit
so
much
in
these
days
no
one
and
people
have
even
ceased
to
feel
the
impulse
to
self
criticism
dont
be
like
every
one
else
even
if
you
are
the
only
one
splendid
i
was
not
mistaken
in
you
you
know
how
to
console
one
oh
how
i
have
longed
to
know
you
karamazov
ive
long
been
eager
for
this
meeting
can
you
really
have
thought
about
me
too
you
said
just
now
that
you
thought
of
me
too
yes
id
heard
of
you
and
had
thought
of
you
too

and
if
its
partly
vanity
that
makes
you
ask
it
doesnt
matter
do
you
know
karamazov
our
talk
has
been
like
a
declaration
of
love
said
kolya
in
a
bashful
and
melting
voice
thats
not
ridiculous
is
it
not
at
all
ridiculous
and
if
it
were
it
wouldnt
matter
because
its
been
a
good
thing
alyosha
smiled
brightly
but
do
you
know
karamazov
you
must
admit
that
you
are
a
little
ashamed
yourself
now
i
see
it
by
your
eyes
kolya
smiled
with
a
sort
of
sly
happiness
why
ashamed
well
why
are
you
blushing
it
was
you
made
me
blush
laughed
alyosha
and
he
really
did
blush
oh
well
i
am
a
little
goodness
knows
why
i
dont
know
he
muttered
almost
embarrassed
oh
how
i
love
you
and
admire
you
at
this
moment
just
because
you
are
rather
ashamed
because
you
are
just
like
me
cried
kolya
in
positive
ecstasy
his
cheeks
glowed
his
eyes
beamed
you
know
kolya
you
will
be
very
unhappy
in
your
life
something
made
alyosha
say
suddenly
i
know
i
know
how
you
know
it
all
beforehand
kolya
agreed
at
once
but
you
will
bless
life
on
the
whole
all
the
same
just
so
hurrah
you
are
a
prophet
oh
we
shall
get
on
together
karamazov
do
you
know
what
delights
me
most
is
that
you
treat
me
quite
like
an
equal
but
we
are
not
equals
no
we
are
not
you
are
better
but
we
shall
get
on
do
you
know
all
this
last
month
ive
been
saying
to
myself
either
we
shall
be
friends
at
once
for
ever
or
we
shall
part
enemies
to
the
grave

and
saying
that
of
course
you
loved
me
alyosha
laughed
gayly
i
did
i
loved
you
awfully
ive
been
loving
and
dreaming
of
you
and
how
do
you
know
it
all
beforehand
ah
heres
the
doctor
goodness
what
will
he
tell
us
look
at
his
face
chapter
vii
ilusha
the
doctor
came
out
of
the
room
again
muffled
in
his
fur
coat
and
with
his
cap
on
his
head
his
face
looked
almost
angry
and
disgusted
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
getting
dirty
he
cast
a
cursory
glance
round
the
passage
looking
sternly
at
alyosha
and
kolya
as
he
did
so
alyosha
waved
from
the
door
to
the
coachman
and
the
carriage
that
had
brought
the
doctor
drove
up
the
captain
darted
out
after
the
doctor
and
bowing
apologetically
stopped
him
to
get
the
last
word
the
poor
fellow
looked
utterly
crushed
there
was
a
scared
look
in
his
eyes
your
excellency
your
excellency

is
it
possible
he
began
but
could
not
go
on
and
clasped
his
hands
in
despair
yet
he
still
gazed
imploringly
at
the
doctor
as
though
a
word
from
him
might
still
change
the
poor
boys
fate
i
cant
help
it
i
am
not
god
the
doctor
answered
offhand
though
with
the
customary
impressiveness
doctor

your
excellency

and
will
it
be
soon
soon
you
must
be
prepared
for
anything
said
the
doctor
in
emphatic
and
incisive
tones
and
dropping
his
eyes
he
was
about
to
step
out
to
the
coach
your
excellency
for
christs
sake
the
terrorstricken
captain
stopped
him
again
your
excellency
but
can
nothing
absolutely
nothing
save
him
now
its
not
in
my
hands
now
said
the
doctor
impatiently
but
hm
he
stopped
suddenly
if
you
could
for
instance

send

your
patient

at
once
without
delay
the
words
at
once
without
delay
the
doctor
uttered
with
an
almost
wrathful
sternness
that
made
the
captain
start
to
syracuse
the
change
to
the
new
beneficial
climatic
conditions
might
possibly
effect
to
syracuse
cried
the
captain
unable
to
grasp
what
was
said
syracuse
is
in
sicily
kolya
jerked
out
suddenly
in
explanation
the
doctor
looked
at
him
sicily
your
excellency
faltered
the
captain
but
youve
seenhe
spread
out
his
hands
indicating
his
surroundingsmamma
and
my
family
nno
sicily
is
not
the
place
for
the
family
the
family
should
go
to
caucasus
in
the
early
spring

your
daughter
must
go
to
the
caucasus
and
your
wife

after
a
course
of
the
waters
in
the
caucasus

her
rheumatism

be
sent
straight
to
paris
to
the
mental
specialist
lepelletier
i
could
give
you
a
note
to
him
and
then

there
might
be
a
change
doctor
doctor
but
you
see
the
captain
flung
wide
his
hands
again
despairingly
indicating
the
bare
wooden
walls
of
the
passage
well
thats
not
my
business
grinned
the
doctor
i
have
only
told
you
the
answer
of
medical
science
to
your
question
as
to
possible
treatment
as
for
the
rest
to
my
regret
dont
be
afraid
apothecary
my
dog
wont
bite
you
kolya
rapped
out
loudly
noticing
the
doctors
rather
uneasy
glance
at
perezvon
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
there
was
a
wrathful
note
in
kolyas
voice
he
used
the
word
apothecary
instead
of

on
purpose
and
as
he
explained
afterwards
used
it
to
insult
him
whats
that
the
doctor
flung
up
his
head
staring
with
surprise
at
kolya

addressed

incisively
again

repeated
the
doctor
perplexed

frowning
and
speaking
quickly

he
cried
to
krassotkin

of

he
repeated
rather
impatiently
he
wants

doctor
stamped
in
a
perfect
fury
and

said
kolya
turning
pale
with
quivering
voice
and
flashing
eyes

cried
peremptorily
there

man
in
the
world

pointed
to
alyosha

good
by
he
stepped
forward
opened
the
door
and
quickly
went
into
the
inner
room
perezvon
flew
after
him
the
doctor
stood
still
for
five
seconds
in
amazement
looking
at
alyosha
then
with
a
curse
he
went
out
quickly
to
the
carriage
repeating
aloud
this
is

this
is

i
dont
know
what
it
is
the
captain
darted
forward
to
help
him
into
the
carriage
alyosha
followed
kolya
into
the
room
he
was
already
by
ilushas
bedside
the
sick
boy
was
holding
his
hand
and
calling
for
his
father
a
minute
later
the
captain
too
came
back
father
father
come

we

ilusha
faltered
in
violent
excitement
but
apparently
unable
to
go
on
he
flung
his
wasted
arms
round
his
father
and
kolya
uniting
them
in
one
embrace
and
hugging
them
as
tightly
as
he
could
the
captain
suddenly
began
to
shake
with
dumb
sobs
and
kolyas
lips
and
chin
twitched
father

how

the
doctor

the
captain
began

his
face
on
his
fathers
shoulder

cried
suddenly
in
a
voice
that
sounded
angry
but
dont
ever
forget
me
father
ilusha
went
on
come
to
my
grave

and

bury

by

big
stone
where
we

to

for
our

and

in
the
evening

and

father
his
voice
broke
they
were
all
three
silent
still
embracing
nina
was
crying
quietly
in
her
chair
and
at
last
seeing
them
all
crying
mamma
too
burst
into
tears
ilusha
ilusha
she
exclaimed
krassotkin
suddenly
released
himself
from
ilushas
embrace
goodby
old
man
mother

he
said
quickly
what

not
tell
her
she
will
be
dreadfully
anxious
but
after

of
things
and
ill

perezvon
but
now
i
will
take
him
with
me
because
he
will
begin
to
howl
when
i
am
away
and
bother
you
goodby
and
he
ran
out
into
the
passage
he
didnt
want
to
cry
but
in
the
passage
he
burst
into
tears
alyosha
found
him
crying
kolya
you
must
be
sure
to
keep
your
word
and
come
or
he
will
be
terribly
disappointed
alyosha
said
emphatically
i
will
oh
how
i
curse
myself
for
not
having
come
before
muttered
kolya
crying
and
no
longer
ashamed
of
it
at
that
moment
the
captain
flew
out
of
the
room
and
at
once
closed
the
door
behind
him
his
face
looked
frenzied
his
lips
were
trembling
he
stood
before
the
two
and
flung
up
his
arms
i
dont
want
a
good
boy
i
dont
want
another
boy
he
muttered
in
a
wild
whisper
clenching
his
teeth
if
i
forget
thee
jerusalem
may
my
tongue
he
broke
off
with
a
sob
and
sank
on
his
knees
before
the
wooden
bench
pressing
his
fists
against
his
head
he
began
sobbing
with
absurd
whimpering
cries
doing
his
utmost
that
his
cries
should
not
be
heard
in
the
room
kolya
ran
out
into
the
street
goodby
karamazov
will
you
come
yourself
he
cried
sharply
and
angrily
to
alyosha
i
will
certainly
come
in
the
evening
what
was
that
he
said
about
jerusalem
what
did
he
mean
by
that
its
from
the
bible
if
i
forget
thee
jerusalem
that
is
if
i
forget
all
that

most
precious
to
me

anything

its
place
then
may
i
understand
thats
enough
mind
you
come
ici
perezvon
he
cried
with
positive
ferocity
to
the
dog
and
with
rapid
strides
he
went
home
book

chapter
i
at
grushenkas
alyosha
went
towards
the
cathedral
square
to
the
widow
morozovs
house
to
see
grushenka
who
had
sent
fenya
to
him
early
in
the
morning
with
an
urgent
message
begging
him
to
come
questioning
fenya
alyosha
learned
that
her
mistress
had
been
particularly
distressed
since
the
previous
day
during
the
two
months
that
had
passed
since
mityas
arrest
alyosha
had
called
frequently
at
the
widow
morozovs
house
both
from
his
own
inclination
and
to
take
messages
for
mitya
three
days
after
mityas
arrest
grushenka
was
taken
very
ill
and
was
ill
for
nearly
five
weeks
for
one
whole
week
she
was
unconscious
she
was
very
much
changedthinner
and
a
little
sallow
though
she
had
for
the
past
fortnight
been
well
enough
to
go
out
but
to
alyosha
her
face
was
even
more
attractive
than
before
and
he
liked
to
meet
her
eyes
when
he
went
in
to
her
a
look
of
firmness
and
intelligent
purpose
had
developed
in
her
face
there
were
signs
of
a
spiritual
transformation
in
her
and
a
steadfast
fine
and
humble
determination
that
nothing
could
shake
could
be
discerned
in
her
there
was
a
small
vertical
line
between
her
brows
which
gave
her
charming
face
a
look
of
concentrated
thought
almost
austere
at
the
first
glance
there
was
scarcely
a
trace
of
her
former
frivolity
it
seemed
strange
to
alyosha
too
that
in
spite
of
the
calamity
that
had
overtaken
the
poor
girl
betrothed
to
a
man
who
had
been
arrested
for
a
terrible
crime
almost
at
the
instant
of
their
betrothal
in
spite
of
her
illness
and
the
almost
inevitable
sentence
hanging
over
mitya
grushenka
had
not
yet
lost
her
youthful
cheerfulness
there
was
a
soft
light
in
the
once
proud
eyes
though
at
times
they
gleamed
with
the
old
vindictive
fire
when
she
was
visited
by
one
disturbing
thought
stronger
than
ever
in
her
heart
the
object
of
that
uneasiness
was
the
same
as
everkaterina
ivanovna
of
whom
grushenka
had
even
raved
when
she
lay
in
delirium
alyosha
knew
that
she
was
fearfully
jealous
of
her
yet
katerina
ivanovna
had
not
once
visited
mitya
in
his
prison
though
she
might
have
done
it
whenever
she
liked
all
this
made
a
difficult
problem
for
alyosha
for
he
was
the
only
person
to
whom
grushenka
opened
her
heart
and
from
whom
she
was
continually
asking
advice
sometimes
he
was
unable
to
say
anything
full
of
anxiety
he
entered
her
lodging
she
was
at
home
she
had
returned
from
seeing
mitya
half
an
hour
before
and
from
the
rapid
movement
with
which
she
leapt
up
from
her
chair
to
meet
him
he
saw
that
she
had
been
expecting
him
with
great
impatience
a
pack
of
cards
dealt
for
a
game
of
fools
lay
on
the
table
a
bed
had
been
made
up
on
the
leather
sofa
on
the
other
side
and
maximov
lay
halfreclining
on
it
he
wore
a
dressing
gown
and
a
cotton
nightcap
and
was
evidently
ill
and
weak
though
he
was
smiling
blissfully
when
the
homeless
old
man
returned
with
grushenka
from
mokroe
two
months
before
he
had
simply
stayed
on
and
was
still
staying
with
her
he
arrived
with
her
in
rain
and
sleet
sat
down
on
the
sofa
drenched
and
scared
and
gazed
mutely
at
her
with
a
timid
appealing
smile
grushenka
who
was
in
terrible
grief
and
in
the
first
stage
of
fever
almost
forgot
his
existence
in
all
she
had
to
do
the
first
half
hour
after
her
arrival
suddenly
she
chanced
to
look
at
him
intently
he
laughed
a
pitiful
helpless
little
laugh
she
called
fenya
and
told
her
to
give
him
something
to
eat
all
that
day
he
sat
in
the
same
place
almost
without
stirring
when
it
got
dark
and
the
shutters
were
closed
fenya
asked
her
mistress
is
the
gentleman
going
to
stay
the
night
mistress
yes
make
him
a
bed
on
the
sofa
answered
grushenka
questioning
him
more
in
detail
grushenka
learned
from
him
that
he
had
literally
nowhere
to
go
and
that
mr
kalganov
my
benefactor
told
me
straight
that
he
wouldnt
receive
me
again
and
gave
me
five
roubles
well
god
bless
you
youd
better
stay
then
grushenka
decided
in
her
grief
smiling
compassionately
at
him
her
smile
wrung
the
old
mans
heart
and
his
lips
twitched
with
grateful
tears
and
so
the
destitute
wanderer
had
stayed
with
her
ever
since
he
did
not
leave
the
house
even
when
she
was
ill
fenya
and
her
grandmother
the
cook
did
not
turn
him
out
but
went
on
serving
him
meals
and
making
up
his
bed
on
the
sofa
grushenka
had
grown
used
to
him
and
coming
back
from
seeing
mitya
whom
she
had
begun
to
visit
in
prison
before
she
was
really
well
she
would
sit
down
and
begin
talking
to
maximushka
about
trifling
matters
to
keep
her
from
thinking
of
her
sorrow
the
old
man
turned
out
to
be
a
good
storyteller
on
occasions
so
that
at
last
he
became
necessary
to
her
grushenka
saw
scarcely
any
one
else
beside
alyosha
who
did
not
come
every
day
and
never
stayed
long
her
old
merchant
lay
seriously
ill
at
this
time
at
his
last
gasp
as
they
said
in
the
town
and
he
did
in
fact
die
a
week
after
mityas
trial
three
weeks
before
his
death
feeling
the
end
approaching
he
made
his
sons
their
wives
and
children
come
upstairs
to
him
at
last
and
bade
them
not
leave
him
again
from
that
moment
he
gave
strict
orders
to
his
servants
not
to
admit
grushenka
and
to
tell
her
if
she
came
the
master
wishes
you
long
life
and
happiness
and
tells
you
to
forget
him
but
grushenka
sent
almost
every
day
to
inquire
after
him
youve
come
at
last
she
cried
flinging
down
the
cards
and
joyfully
greeting
alyosha
and
maximushkas
been
scaring
me
that
perhaps
you
wouldnt
come
ah

need
you

down
to
the
table

alyosha
sitting
down
at
the
table
i

hungry

fenya
fenya

cried
grushenka
its
been
made
a
long
time
ready
for
you
and
bring
some
little
pies
and
mind
they
are
hot

you
know
weve
had
a
storm
over
those
pies
today
i
took
them
to
the
prison
for
him
and
would
you
believe
it
he
threw
them
back
to
me
he
would
not
eat
them
he
flung
one
of
them
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
so
i
said
to
him
i
shall
leave
them
with
the
warder
if
you
dont
eat
them
before
evening
it
will
be
that
your
venomous
spite
is
enough
for
you
with
that
i
went
away
we
quarreled
again
would
you
believe
it
whenever
i
go
we
quarrel
grushenka
said
all
this
in
one
breath
in
her
agitation
maximov
feeling
nervous
at
once
smiled
and
looked
on
the
floor
what
did
you
quarrel
about
this
time
asked
alyosha
i
didnt
expect
it
in
the
least
only
fancy
he
is
jealous
of
the
pole
why
are
you
keeping
him
he
said
so
youve
begun
keeping
him
he
is
jealous
jealous
of
me
all
the
time
jealous
eating
and
sleeping
he
even
took
it
into
his
head
to
be
jealous
of
kuzma
last
week
but
he
knew
about
the
pole
before
yes
but
there
it
is
he
has
known
about
him
from
the
very
beginning
but
today
he
suddenly
got
up
and
began
scolding
about
him
i
am
ashamed
to
repeat
what
he
said
silly
fellow
rakitin
went
in
as
i
came
out
perhaps
rakitin
is
egging
him
on
what
do
you
think
she
added
carelessly
he
loves
you
thats
what
it
is
he
loves
you
so
much
and
now
he
is
particularly
worried
i
should
think
he
might
be
with
the
trial
tomorrow
and
i
went
to
him
to
say
something
about
tomorrow
for
i
dread
to
think
whats
going
to
happen
then
you
say
that
he
is
worried
but
how
worried
i
am
and
he
talks
about
the
pole
hes
too
silly
he
is
not
jealous
of
maximushka
yet
anyway
my
wife
was
dreadfully
jealous
over
me
too
maximov
put
in
his
word
jealous
of
you
grushenka
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
of
whom
could
she
have
been
jealous
of
the
servant
girls
hold
your
tongue
maximushka
i
am
in
no
laughing
mood
now
i
feel
angry
dont
ogle
the
pies
i
shant
give
you
any
they
are
not
good
for
you
and
i
wont
give
you
any
vodka
either
i
have
to
look
after
him
too
just
as
though
i
kept
an
almshouse
she
laughed
i
dont
deserve
your
kindness
i
am
a
worthless
creature
said
maximov
with
tears
in
his
voice
you
would
do
better
to
spend
your
kindness
on
people
of
more
use
than
me
ech
every
one
is
of
use
maximushka
and
how
can
we
tell
whos
of
most
use
if
only
that
pole
didnt
exist
alyosha
hes
taken
it
into
his
head
to
fall
ill
too
today
ive
been
to
see
him
also
and
i
shall
send
him
some
pies
too
on
purpose
i
hadnt
sent
him
any
but
mitya
accused
me
of
it
so
now
i
shall
send
some
ah
heres
fenya
with
a
letter
yes
its
from
the
polesbegging
again
pan
mussyalovitch
had
indeed
sent
an
extremely
long
and
characteristically
eloquent
letter
in
which
he
begged
her
to
lend
him
three
roubles
in
the
letter
was
enclosed
a
receipt
for
the
sum
with
a
promise
to
repay
it
within
three
months
signed
by
pan
vrublevsky
as
well
grushenka
had
received
many
such
letters
accompanied
by
such
receipts
from
her
former
lover
during
the
fortnight
of
her
convalescence
but
she
knew
that
the
two
poles
had
been
to
ask
after
her
health
during
her
illness
the
first
letter
grushenka
got
from
them
was
a
long
one
written
on
large
notepaper
and
with
a
big
family
crest
on
the
seal
it
was
so
obscure
and
rhetorical
that
grushenka
put
it
down
before
she
had
read
half
unable
to
make
head
or
tail
of
it
she
could
not
attend
to
letters
then
the
first
letter
was
followed
next
day
by
another
in
which
pan
mussyalovitch
begged
her
for
a
loan
of
two
thousand
roubles
for
a
very
short
period
grushenka
left
that
letter
too
unanswered
a
whole
series
of
letters
had
followedone
every
dayall
as
pompous
and
rhetorical
but
the
loan
asked
for
gradually
diminishing
dropped
to
a
hundred
roubles
then
to
twentyfive
to
ten
and
finally
grushenka
received
a
letter
in
which
both
the
poles
begged
her
for
only
one
rouble
and
included
a
receipt
signed
by
both
then
grushenka
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
them
and
at
dusk
she
went
round
herself
to
their
lodging
she
found
the
two
poles
in
great
poverty
almost
destitution
without
food
or
fuel
without
cigarettes
in
debt
to
their
landlady
the
two
hundred
roubles
they
had
carried
off
from
mitya
at
mokroe
had
soon
disappeared
but
grushenka
was
surprised
at
their
meeting
her
with
arrogant
dignity
and
selfassertion
with
the
greatest
punctilio
and
pompous
speeches
grushenka
simply
laughed
and
gave
her
former
admirer
ten
roubles
then
laughing
she
told
mitya
of
it
and
he
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
but
ever
since
the
poles
had
attached
themselves
to
grushenka
and
bombarded
her
daily
with
requests
for
money
and
she
had
always
sent
them
small
sums
and
now
that
day
mitya
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
be
fearfully
jealous
like
a
fool
i
went
round
to
him
just
for
a
minute
on
the
way
to
see
mitya
for
he
is
ill
too
my
pole
grushenka
began
again
with
nervous
haste
i
was
laughing
telling
mitya
about
it
fancy
i
said
my
pole
had
the
happy
thought
to
sing
his
old
songs
to
me
to
the
guitar
he
thought
i
would
be
touched
and
marry
him
mitya
leapt
up
swearing
so
there
ill
send
them
the
pies
fenya
is
it
that
little
girl
theyve
sent
here
give
her
three
roubles
and
pack
a
dozen
pies
up
in
a
paper
and
tell
her
to
take
them
and
you
alyosha
be
sure
to
tell
mitya
that
i
did
send
them
the
pies
i
wouldnt
tell
him
for
anything
said
alyosha
smiling
ech
you
think
he
is
unhappy
about
it
why
hes
jealous
on
purpose
he
doesnt
care
said
grushenka
bitterly
on
purpose
queried
alyosha
i
tell
you
you
are
silly
alyosha
you
know
nothing
about
it
with
all
your
cleverness
i
am
not
offended
that
he
is
jealous
of
a
girl
like
me
i
would
be
offended
if
he
were
not
jealous
i
am
like
that
i
am
not
offended
at
jealousy
i
have
a
fierce
heart
too
i
can
be
jealous
myself
only
what
offends
me
is
that
he
doesnt
love
me
at
all
i
tell
you
he
is
jealous
now
on
purpose
am
i
blind
dont
i
see
he
began
talking
to
me
just
now
of
that
woman
of
katerina
saying
she
was
this
and
that
how
she
had
ordered
a
doctor
from
moscow
for
him
to
try
and
save
him
how
she
had
ordered
the
best
counsel
the
most
learned
one
too
so
he
loves
her
if
hell
praise
her
to
my
face
more
shame
to
him
hes
treated
me
badly
himself
so
he
attacked
me
to
make
out
i
am
in
fault
first
and
to
throw
it
all
on
me
you
were
with
your
pole
before
me
so
i
cant
be
blamed
for
katerina
thats
what
it
amounts
to
he
wants
to
throw
the
whole
blame
on
me
he
attacked
me
on
purpose
on
purpose
i
tell
you
but
ill
grushenka
could
not
finish
saying
what
she
would
do
she
hid
her
eyes
in
her
handkerchief
and
sobbed
violently
he
doesnt
love
katerina
ivanovna
said
alyosha
firmly
well
whether
he
loves
her
or
not
ill
soon
find
out
for
myself
said
grushenka
with
a
menacing
note
in
her
voice
taking
the
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
her
face
was
distorted
alyosha
saw
sorrowfully
that
from
being
mild
and
serene
it
had
become
sullen
and
spiteful
enough
of
this
foolishness
she
said
suddenly
its
not
for
that
i
sent
for
you
alyosha
darling
tomorrowwhat
will
happen
tomorrow
thats
what
worries
me
and
its
only
me
it
worries
i
look
at
every
one
and
no
one
is
thinking
of
it
no
one
cares
about
it
are
you
thinking
about
it
even
tomorrow
hell
be
tried
you
know
tell
me
how
will
he
be
tried
you
know
its
the
valet
the
valet
killed
him
good
heavens
can
they
condemn
him
in
place
of
the
valet
and
will
no
one
stand
up
for
him
they
havent
troubled
the
valet
at
all
have
they
hes
been
severely
crossexamined
observed
alyosha
thoughtfully
but
every
one
came
to
the
conclusion
it
was
not
he
now
he
is
lying
very
ill
he
has
been
ill
ever
since
that
attack
really
ill
added
alyosha
oh
dear
couldnt
you
go
to
that
counsel
yourself
and
tell
him
the
whole
thing
by
yourself
hes
been
brought
from
petersburg
for
three
thousand
roubles
they
say
we
gave
these
three
thousand
togetherivan
katerina
ivanovna
and
ibut
she
paid
two
thousand
for
the
doctor
from
moscow
herself
the
counsel
fetyukovitch
would
have
charged
more
but
the
case
has
become
known
all
over
russia
its
talked
of
in
all
the
papers
and
journals
fetyukovitch
agreed
to
come
more
for
the
glory
of
the
thing
because
the
case
has
become
so
notorious
i
saw
him
yesterday
well
did
you
talk
to
him
grushenka
put
in
eagerly
he
listened
and
said
nothing
he
told
me
that
he
had
already
formed
his
opinion
but
he
promised
to
give
my
words
consideration
consideration
ah
they
are
swindlers
theyll
ruin
him
and
why
did
she
send
for
the
doctor
as
an
expert
they
want
to
prove
that
mityas
mad
and
committed
the
murder
when
he
didnt
know
what
he
was
doing
alyosha
smiled
gently
but
mitya
wont
agree
to
that
yes
but
that
would
be
the
truth
if
he
had
killed
him
cried
grushenka
he
was
mad
then
perfectly
mad
and
that
was
my
fault
wretch
that
i
am
but
of
course
he
didnt
do
it
he
didnt
do
it
and
they
are
all
against
him
the
whole
town
even
fenyas
evidence
went
to
prove
he
had
done
it
and
the
people
at
the
shop
and
that
official
and
at
the
tavern
too
before
people
had
heard
him
say
so
they
are
all
all
against
him
all
crying
out
against
him
yes
theres
a
fearful
accumulation
of
evidence
alyosha
observed
grimly
and
grigorygrigory
vassilyevitchsticks
to
his
story
that
the
door
was
open
persists
that
he
saw
ittheres
no
shaking
him
i
went
and
talked
to
him
myself
hes
rude
about
it
too
yes
thats
perhaps
the
strongest
evidence
against
him
said
alyosha
and
as
for
mityas
being
mad
he
certainly
seems
like
it
now
grushenka
began
with
a
peculiarly
anxious
and
mysterious
air
do
you
know
alyosha
ive
been
wanting
to
talk
to
you
about
it
for
a
long
time
i
go
to
him
every
day
and
simply
wonder
at
him
tell
me
now
what
do
you
suppose
hes
always
talking
about
he
talks
and
talks
and
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
i
fancied
he
was
talking
of
something
intellectual
that
i
couldnt
understand
in
my
foolishness
only
he
suddenly
began
talking
to
me
about
a
babethat
is
about
some
child
why
is
the
babe
poor
he
said
its
for
that
babe

am
going
to
siberia
now
i
am
not
a
murderer
but

to
siberia
what
that
meant
what
babe
i
couldnt
tell
for
the
life
of
me
only
i
cried
when
he
said
it
because
he
said
it
so
nicely
he
cried
himself
and
i
cried
too
he
suddenly
kissed
me
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
me
what
did
it
mean
alyosha
tell
me
what
is
this
babe

be
rakitin

alyosha

what

grushenka
began
and
suddenly
broke
off
alyosha
gazed
at
her
in
amazement
ivans
going
has
he
been
to
see

me

and
suddenly

much

whole

to
see
him
twice
the
first
directly
he
arrived
he
galloped
here
from
moscow
at
once
of
course
before
i
was
taken
ill
and
the
second
time
was
a
week
ago
he
told
mitya
not
to
tell
you
about
it
under
any
circumstances
and
not
to
tell
any
one
in
fact
he
came
secretly
alyosha
sat
plunged
in
thought
considering
something
the
news
evidently
impressed
him
ivan
doesnt
talk
to
me
of
mityas
case
he
said
slowly
hes
said
very
little
to
me
these
last
two
months
and
whenever
i
go
to
see
him
he
seems
vexed
at
my
coming
so
ive
not
been
to
him
for
the
last
three
weeks
hm
if
he
was
there
a
week
ago

there
certainly
has
been
a
change
in
mitya
this
week
there
has
been
a
change
grushenka
assented
quickly
they
have
a
secret
they
have
a
secret
mitya
told
me
himself
there
was
a
secret
and
such
a
secret
that
mitya
cant
rest
before
then
he
was
cheerfuland
indeed
he
is
cheerful
nowbut
when
he
shakes
his
head
like
that
you
know
and
strides
about
the
room
and
keeps
pulling
at
the
hair
on
his
right
temple
with
his
right
hand
i
know
there
is
something
on
his
mind
worrying
him
i
know
he
was
cheerful
before
though
indeed
he
is
cheerful
today
but
you
said
he
was
worried
yes
he
is
worried
and
yet
cheerful
he
keeps
on
being
irritable
for
a
minute
and
then
cheerful
and
then
irritable
again
and
you
know
alyosha
i
am
constantly
wondering
at
himwith
this
awful
thing
hanging
over
him
he
sometimes
laughs
at
such
trifles
as
though
he
were
a
baby
himself
and
did
he
really
tell
you
not
to
tell
me
about
ivan
did
he
say
dont
tell
him
yes
he
told
me
dont
tell
him
its
you
that
mityas
most
afraid
of
because
its
a
secret
he
said
himself
it
was
a
secret
alyosha
darling
go
to
him
and
find
out
what
their
secret
is
and
come
and
tell
me
grushenka
besought
him
with
sudden
eagerness
set
my
mind
at
rest
that
i
may
know
the
worst
thats
in
store
for
me
thats
why
i
sent
for
you

think
its
something
to
do
with
you
if
it
were
he
wouldnt
have
told
you
there
was
a
secret

wants
to
tell
me
but
doesnt
dare
to
he
warns
me
there
is
a
secret
he
tells
me
but
he
wont
tell
me
what
it
is
what

you
think
yourself
what
do
i
think
its
the
end
for
me
thats
what
i
think
they
all
three
have
been
plotting
my
end
for
katerinas
in
it
its
all
katerina
it
all
comes
from
her
she
is
this
and
that
and
that
means
that
i
am
not
he
tells
me
that
beforehandwarns
me
he
is
planning
to
throw
me
over
thats
the
whole
secret
theyve
planned
it
together
the
three
of
themmitya
katerina
and
ivan
fyodorovitch
alyosha
ive
been
wanting
to
ask
you
a
long
time
a
week
ago
he
suddenly
told
me
that
ivan
was
in
love
with
katerina
because
he
often
goes
to
see
her
did
he
tell
me
the
truth
or
not
tell
me
on
your
conscience
tell
me
the
worst
i
wont
tell
you
a
lie
ivan
is
not
in
love
with
katerina
ivanovna
i
think
oh
thats
what
i
thought
he
is
lying
to
me
shameless
deceiver
thats
what
it
is
and
he
was
jealous
of
me
just
now
so
as
to
put
the
blame
on
me
afterwards
he
is
stupid
he
cant
disguise
what
he
is
doing
he
is
so
open
you
know
but
ill
give
it
to
him
ill
give
it
to
him
you
believe
i
did
it
he
said
he
said
that
to
me
to
me
he
reproached
me
with
that
god
forgive
him
you
wait
ill
make
it
hot
for
katerina
at
the
trial
ill
just
say
a
word
then

ill
tell
everything
then
and
again
she
cried
bitterly
this
i
can
tell
you
for
certain
grushenka
alyosha
said
getting
up
first
that
he
loves
you
loves
you
more
than
any
one
in
the
world
and
you
only
believe
me
i
know
i
do
know
the
second
thing
is
that
i
dont
want
to
worm
his
secret
out
of
him
but
if
hell
tell
me
of
himself
to
day
i
shall
tell
him
straight
out
that
i
have
promised
to
tell
you
then
ill
come
to
you
today
and
tell
you
only

i
fancy

katerina
ivanovna
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
that
the
secret
is
about
something
else
thats
certain
it
isnt
likely
its
about
katerina
ivanovna
it
seems
to
me
goodby
for
now
alyosha
shook
hands
with
her
grushenka
was
still
crying
he
saw
that
she
put
little
faith
in
his
consolation
but
she
was
better
for
having
had
her
sorrow
out
for
having
spoken
of
it
he
was
sorry
to
leave
her
in
such
a
state
of
mind
but
he
was
in
haste
he
had
a
great
many
things
to
do
still
chapter
ii
the
injured
foot
the
first
of
these
things
was
at
the
house
of
madame
hohlakov
and
he
hurried
there
to
get
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible
and
not
be
too
late
for
mitya
madame
hohlakov
had
been
slightly
ailing
for
the
last
three
weeks
her
foot
had
for
some
reason
swollen
up
and
though
she
was
not
in
bed
she
lay
all
day
halfreclining
on
the
couch
in
her
boudoir
in
a
fascinating
but
decorous
dshabill
alyosha
had
once
noted
with
innocent
amusement
that
in
spite
of
her
illness
madame
hohlakov
had
begun
to
be
rather
dressytopknots
ribbons
loose
wrappers
had
made
their
appearance
and
he
had
an
inkling
of
the
reason
though
he
dismissed
such
ideas
from
his
mind
as
frivolous
during
the
last
two
months
the
young
official
perhotin
had
become
a
regular
visitor
at
the
house
alyosha
had
not
called
for
four
days
and
he
was
in
haste
to
go
straight
to
lise
as
it
was
with
her
he
had
to
speak
for
lise
had
sent
a
maid
to
him
the
previous
day
specially
asking
him
to
come
to
her
about
something
very
important
a
request
which
for
certain
reasons
had
interest
for
alyosha
but
while
the
maid
went
to
take
his
name
in
to
lise
madame
hohlakov
heard
of
his
arrival
from
some
one
and
immediately
sent
to
beg
him
to
come
to
her
just
for
one
minute
alyosha
reflected
that
it
was
better
to
accede
to
the
mammas
request
or
else
she
would
be
sending
down
to
lises
room
every
minute
that
he
was
there
madame
hohlakov
was
lying
on
a
couch
she
was
particularly
smartly
dressed
and
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
extreme
nervous
excitement
she
greeted
alyosha
with
cries
of
rapture
its
ages
ages
perfect
ages
since
ive
seen
you
its
a
whole
weekonly
think
of
it
ah
but
you
were
here
only
four
days
ago
on
wednesday
you
have
come
to
see
lise
im
sure
you
meant
to
slip
into
her
room
on
tiptoe
without
my
hearing
you
my
dear
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
if
you
only
knew
how
worried
i
am
about
her
but
of
that
later
though
thats
the
most
important
thing
of
that
later
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
trust
you
implicitly
with
my
lise
since
the
death
of
father

his
soul
she
crossed
herselfi
look
upon
you
as
a
monk
though
you
look
charming
in
your
new
suit
where
did
you
find
such
a
tailor
in
these
parts
no
no
thats
not
the
chief
thingof
that
later
forgive
me
for
sometimes
calling
you
alyosha
an
old
woman
like
me
may
take
liberties
she
smiled
coquettishly
but
that
will
do
later
too
the
important
thing
is
that
i
shouldnt
forget
what
is
important
please
remind
me
of
it
yourself
as
soon
as
my
tongue
runs
away
with
me
you

say
the
important
thing
ach
how

i
know
now
what
is
of
most
importance
ever
since
lise
took
back
her
promiseher
childish
promise
alexey
fyodorovitchto
marry
you
youve
realized
of
course
that
it
was
only
the
playful
fancy
of
a
sick
child
who
had
been
so
long
confined
to
her
chairthank
god
she
can
walk

weary
this
katya
cette
charmante
personne
has
disappointed
all
my
hopes
now
she
is
going
to
follow
one
of
your
brothers
to
siberia
and
your
other
brother
is
going
to
follow
her
and
will
live
in
the
nearest
town
and
they
will
all
torment
one
another
it
drives
me
out
of
my
mind
worst
of
allthe
publicity
the
story
has
been
told
a
million
times
over
in
all
the
papers
in
moscow
and
petersburg
ah
yes
would
you
believe
it
theres
a
paragraph
that
i
was
a
dear
friend
of
your
brothers

i
cant
repeat
the
horrid
word
just
fancy
just
fancy
impossible
where
was
the
paragraph
what
did
it
say
ill
show
you
directly
i
got
the
paper
and
read
it
yesterday
here
in
the
petersburg
paper
gossip
the
paper
began
coming
out
this
year
i
am
awfully
fond
of
gossip
and
i
take
it
in
and
now
it
pays
me
outthis
is
what
gossip
comes
to
here
it
is
here
this
passage
read
it
and
she
handed
alyosha
a
sheet
of
newspaper
which
had
been
under
her
pillow
it
was
not
exactly
that
she
was
upset
she
seemed
overwhelmed
and
perhaps
everything
really
was
mixed
up
in
a
tangle
in
her
head
the
paragraph
was
very
typical
and
must
have
been
a
great
shock
to
her
but
fortunately
perhaps
she
was
unable
to
keep
her
mind
fixed
on
any
one
subject
at
that
moment
and
so
might
race
off
in
a
minute
to
something
else
and
quite
forget
the
newspaper
alyosha
was
well
aware
that
the
story
of
the
terrible
case
had
spread
all
over
russia
and
good
heavens
what
wild
rumors
about
his
brother
about
the
karamazovs
and
about
himself
he
had
read
in
the
course
of
those
two
months
among
other
equally
credible
items
one
paper
had
even
stated
that
he
had
gone
into
a
monastery
and
become
a
monk
in
horror
at
his
brothers
crime
another
contradicted
this
and
stated
that
he
and
his
elder
father
zossima
had
broken
into
the
monastery
chest
and
made
tracks
from
the
monastery
the
present
paragraph
in
the
paper
gossip
was
under
the
heading
the
karamazov
case
at
skotoprigonyevsk
that
alas
was
the
name
of
our
little
town
i
had
hitherto
kept
it
concealed
it
was
brief
and
madame
hohlakov
was
not
directly
mentioned
in
it
no
names
appeared
in
fact
it
was
merely
stated
that
the
criminal
whose
approaching
trial
was
making
such
a
sensationretired
army
captain
an
idle
swaggerer
and
reactionary
bullywas
continually
involved
in
amorous
intrigues
and
particularly
popular
with
certain
ladies
who
were
pining
in
solitude
one
such
lady
a
pining
widow
who
tried
to
seem
young
though
she
had
a
grownup
daughter
was
so
fascinated
by
him
that
only
two
hours
before
the
crime
she
offered
him
three
thousand
roubles
on
condition
that
he
would
elope
with
her
to
the
gold
mines
but
the
criminal
counting
on
escaping
punishment
had
preferred
to
murder
his
father
to
get
the
three
thousand
rather
than
go
off
to
siberia
with
the
middleaged
charms
of
his
pining
lady
this
playful
paragraph
finished
of
course
with
an
outburst
of
generous
indignation
at
the
wickedness
of
parricide
and
at
the
lately
abolished
institution
of
serfdom
reading
it
with
curiosity
alyosha
folded
up
the
paper
and
handed
it
back
to
madame
hohlakov
well
that
must
be
me
she
hurried
on
again
of
course
i
am
meant
scarcely
more
than
an
hour
before
i
suggested
gold
mines
to
him
and
here
they
talk
of
middleaged
charms
as
though
that
were
my
motive
he
writes
that
out
of
spite
god
almighty
forgive
him
for
the
middleaged
charms
as
i
forgive
him
you
know
its
do
you
know
who
it
is
its
your
friend
rakitin
perhaps
said
alyosha
though
ive
heard
nothing
about
it
its
he
its
he
no
perhaps
about
it
you
know
i
turned
him
out
of
the
house
you
know
all
that
story
dont
you
i
know
that
you
asked
him
not
to
visit
you
for
the
future
but
why
it
was
i
havent
heard

from
you
at
least
ah
then
youve
heard
it
from
him
he
abuses
me
i
suppose
abuses
me
dreadfully
yes
he
does
but
then
he
abuses
every
one
but
why
youve
given
him
up
i
havent
heard
from
him
either
i
meet
him
very
seldom
now
indeed
we
are
not
friends
well
then
ill
tell
you
all
about
it
theres
no
help
for
it
ill
confess
for
there
is
one
point
in
which
i
was
perhaps
to
blame
only
a
little
little
point
so
little
that
perhaps
it
doesnt
count
you
see
my
dear
boymadame
hohlakov
suddenly
looked
arch
and
a
charming
though
enigmatic
smile
played
about
her
lipsyou
see
i
suspect

you
must
forgive
me
alyosha
i
am
like
a
mother
to
you
no
no
quite
the
contrary
i
speak
to
you
now
as
though
you
were
my
fathermothers
quite
out
of
place
well
its
as
though
i
were
confessing
to
father
zossima
thats
just
it
i
called
you
a
monk
just
now
well
that
poor
young
man
your
friend
rakitin
mercy
on
us
i
cant
be
angry
with
him
i
feel
cross
but
not
very
that
frivolous
young
man
would
you
believe
it
seems
to
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
fall
in
love
with
me
i
only
noticed
it
later
at
firsta
month
agohe
only
began
to
come
oftener
to
see
me
almost
every
day
though
of
course
we
were
acquainted
before
i
knew
nothing
about
it

and
suddenly
it
dawned
upon
me
and
i
began
to
notice
things
with
surprise
you
know
two
months
ago
that
modest
charming
excellent
young
man
pyotr
ilyitch
perhotin
whos
in
the
service
here
began
to
be
a
regular
visitor
at
the
house
you
met
him
here
ever
so
many
times
yourself
and
he
is
an
excellent
earnest
young
man
isnt
he
he
comes
once
every
three
days
not
every
day
though
i
should
be
glad
to
see
him
every
day
and
always
so
well
dressed
altogether
i
love
young
people
alyosha
talented
modest
like
you
and
he
has
almost
the
mind
of
a
statesman
he
talks
so
charmingly
and
i
shall
certainly
certainly
try
and
get
promotion
for
him
he
is
a
future
diplomat
on
that
awful
day
he
almost
saved
me
from
death
by
coming
in
the
night
and
your
friend
rakitin
comes
in
such
boots
and
always
stretches
them
out
on
the
carpet
he
began
hinting
at
his
feelings
in
fact
and
one
day
as
he
was
going
he
squeezed
my
hand
terribly
hard
my
foot
began
to
swell
directly
after
he
pressed
my
hand
like
that
he
had
met
pyotr
ilyitch
here
before
and
would
you
believe
it
he
is
always
gibing
at
him
growling
at
him
for
some
reason
i
simply
looked
at
the
way
they
went
on
together
and
laughed
inwardly
so
i
was
sitting
here
aloneno
i
was
laid
up
then
well
i
was
lying
here
alone
and
suddenly
rakitin
comes
in
and
only
fancy
brought
me
some
verses
of
his
own
compositiona
short
poem
on
my
bad
foot
that
is
he
described
my
foot
in
a
poem
wait
a
minutehow
did
it
go
a
captivating
little
foot
it
began
somehow
like
that
i
can
never
remember
poetry
ive
got
it
here
ill
show
it
to
you
later
but
its
a
charming
thingcharming
and
you
know
its
not
only
about
the
foot
it
had
a
good
moral
too
a
charming
idea
only
ive
forgotten
it
in
fact
it
was
just
the
thing
for
an
album
so
of
course
i
thanked
him
and
he
was
evidently
flattered
id
hardly
had
time
to
thank
him
when
in
comes
pyotr
ilyitch
and
rakitin
suddenly
looked
as
black
as
night
i
could
see
that
pyotr
ilyitch
was
in
the
way
for
rakitin
certainly
wanted
to
say
something
after
giving
me
the
verses
i
had
a
presentiment
of
it
but
pyotr
ilyitch
came
in
i
showed
pyotr
ilyitch
the
verses
and
didnt
say
who
was
the
author
but
i
am
convinced
that
he
guessed
though
he
wont
own
it
to
this
day
and
declares
he
had
no
idea
but
he
says
that
on
purpose
pyotr
ilyitch
began
to
laugh
at
once
and
fell
to
criticizing
it
wretched
doggerel
he
said
they
were
some
divinity
student
must
have
written
them
and
with
such
vehemence
such
vehemence
then
instead
of
laughing
your
friend
flew
into
a
rage
good
gracious
i
thought
theyll
fly
at
each
other
it
was
i
who
wrote
them
said
he
i
wrote
them
as
a
joke
he
said
for
i
think
it
degrading
to
write
verses
but
they
are
good
poetry
they
want
to
put
a
monument
to
your
pushkin
for
writing
about
womens
feet
while
i
wrote
with
a
moral
purpose
and
you
said
he
are
an
advocate
of
serfdom
youve
no
humane
ideas
said
he
you
have
no
modern
enlightened
feelings
you
are
uninfluenced
by
progress
you
are
a
mere
official
he
said
and
you
take
bribes
then
i
began
screaming
and
imploring
them
and
you
know
pyotr
ilyitch
is
anything
but
a
coward
he
at
once
took
up
the
most
gentlemanly
tone
looked
at
him
sarcastically
listened
and
apologized
id
no
idea
said
he
i
shouldnt
have
said
it
if
i
had
known
i
should
have
praised
it
poets
are
all
so
irritable
he
said
in
short
he
laughed
at
him
under
cover
of
the
most
gentlemanly
tone
he
explained
to
me
afterwards
that
it
was
all
sarcastic
i
thought
he
was
in
earnest
only
as
i
lay
there
just
as
before
you
now
i
thought
would
it
or
would
it
not
be
the
proper
thing
for
me
to
turn
rakitin
out
for
shouting
so
rudely
at
a
visitor
in
my
house
and
would
you
believe
it
i
lay
here
shut
my
eyes
and
wondered
would
it
be
the
proper
thing
or
not
i
kept
worrying
and
worrying
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
and
i
couldnt
make
up
my
mind
whether
to
make
an
outcry
or
not
one
voice
seemed
to
be
telling
me
speak
and
the
other
no
dont
speak
and
no
sooner
had
the
second
voice
said
that
than
i
cried
out
and
fainted
of
course
there
was
a
fuss
i
got
up
suddenly
and
said
to
rakitin
its
painful
for
me
to
say
it
but
i
dont
wish
to
see
you
in
my
house
again
so
i
turned
him
out
ah
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
know
myself
i
did
wrong
i
was
putting
it
on
i
wasnt
angry
with
him
at
all
really
but
i
suddenly
fanciedthat
was
what
did
itthat
it
would
be
such
a
fine
scene
and
yet
believe
me
it
was
quite
natural
for
i
really
shed
tears
and
cried
for
several
days
afterwards
and
then
suddenly
one
afternoon
i
forgot
all
about
it
so
its
a
fortnight
since
hes
been
here
and
i
kept
wondering
whether
he
would
come
again
i
wondered
even
yesterday
then
suddenly
last
night
came
this
gossip
i
read
it
and
gasped
who
could
have
written
it
he
must
have
written
it
he
went
home
sat
down
wrote
it
on
the
spot
sent
it
and
they
put
it
in
it
was
a
fortnight
ago
you
see
but
alyosha
its
awful
how
i
keep
talking
and
dont
say
what
i
want
to
say
ah
the
words
come
of
themselves
its
very
important
for
me
to
be
in
time
to
see
my
brother
today
alyosha
faltered
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
you
bring
it
all
back
to
me
listen
what
is
an
aberration
what
aberration
asked
alyosha
wondering
in
the
legal
sense
an
aberration
in
which
everything
is
pardonable
whatever
you
do
you
will
be
acquitted
at
once
what
do
you
mean
ill
tell
you
this
katya

ah
she
is
a
charming
charming
creature
only
i
never
can
make
out
who
it
is
she
is
in
love
with
she
was
with
me
some
time
ago
and
i
couldnt
get
anything
out
of
her
especially
as
she
wont
talk
to
me
except
on
the
surface
now
she
is
always
talking
about
my
health
and
nothing
else
and
she
takes
up
such
a
tone
with
me
too
i
simply
said
to
myself
well
so
be
it
i
dont
care
oh
yes
i
was
talking
of
aberration
this
doctor
has
come
you
know
a
doctor
has
come
of
course
you
know
itthe
one
who
discovers
madmen
you
wrote
for
him
no
it
wasnt
you
but
katya
its
all
katyas
doing
well
you
see
a
man
may
be
sitting
perfectly
sane
and
suddenly
have
an
aberration
he
may
be
conscious
and
know
what
he
is
doing
and
yet
be
in
a
state
of
aberration
and
theres
no
doubt
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
was
suffering
from
aberration
they
found
out
about
aberration
as
soon
as
the
law
courts
were
reformed
its
all
the
good
effect
of
the
reformed
law
courts
the
doctor
has
been
here
and
questioned
me
about
that
evening
about
the
gold
mines
how
did
he
seem
then
he
asked
me
he
must
have
been
in
a
state
of
aberration
he
came
in
shouting
money
money
three
thousand
give
me
three
thousand
and
then
went
away
and
immediately
did
the
murder
i
dont
want
to
murder
him
he
said
and
he
suddenly
went
and
murdered
him
thats
why
theyll
acquit
him
because
he
struggled
against
it
and
yet
he
murdered
him
but
he
didnt
murder
him
alyosha
interrupted
rather
sharply
he
felt
more
and
more
sick
with
anxiety
and
impatience
yes
i
know
it
was
that
old
man
grigory
murdered
him
grigory
cried
alyosha
yes
yes
it
was
grigory
he
lay
as
dmitri
fyodorovitch
struck
him
down
and
then
got
up
saw
the
door
open
went
in
and
killed
fyodor
pavlovitch
but
why
why
suffering
from
aberration
when
he
recovered
from
the
blow
dmitri
fyodorovitch
gave
him
on
the
head
he
was
suffering
from
aberration
he
went
and
committed
the
murder
as
for
his
saying
he
didnt
he
very
likely
doesnt
remember
only
you
know
itll
be
better
ever
so
much
better
if
dmitri
fyodorovitch
murdered
him
and
thats
how
it
must
have
been
though
i
say
it
was
grigory
it
certainly
was
dmitri
fyodorovitch
and
thats
better
ever
so
much
better
oh
not
better
that
a
son
should
have
killed
his
father
i
dont
defend
that
children
ought
to
honor
their
parents
and
yet
it
would
be
better
if
it
were
he
as
youd
have
nothing
to
cry
over
then
for
he
did
it
when
he
was
unconscious
or
rather
when
he
was
conscious
but
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
let
them
acquit
himthats
so
humane
and
would
show
what
a
blessing
reformed
law
courts
are
i
knew
nothing
about
it
but
they
say
they
have
been
so
a
long
time
and
when
i
heard
it
yesterday
i
was
so
struck
by
it
that
i
wanted
to
send
for
you
at
once
and
if
he
is
acquitted
make
him
come
straight
from
the
law
courts
to
dinner
with
me
and
ill
have
a
party
of
friends
and
well
drink
to
the
reformed
law
courts
i
dont
believe
hed
be
dangerous
besides
ill
invite
a
great
many
friends
so
that
he
could
always
be
led
out
if
he
did
anything
and
then
he
might
be
made
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
something
in
another
town
for
those
who
have
been
in
trouble
themselves
make
the
best
judges
and
besides
who
isnt
suffering
from
aberration
nowadaysyou
i
all
of
us
are
in
a
state
of
aberration
and
there
are
ever
so
many
examples
of
it
a
man
sits
singing
a
song
suddenly
something
annoys
him
he
takes
a
pistol
and
shoots
the
first
person
he
comes
across
and
no
one
blames
him
for
it
i
read
that
lately
and
all
the
doctors
confirm
it
the
doctors
are
always
confirming
they
confirm
anything
why
my
lise
is
in
a
state
of
aberration
she
made
me
cry
again
yesterday
and
the
day
before
too
and
today
i
suddenly
realized
that
its
all
due
to
aberration
oh
lise
grieves
me
so
i
believe
shes
quite
mad
why
did
she
send
for
you
did
she
send
for
you
or
did
you
come
of
yourself
yes
she
sent
for
me
and
i
am
just
going
to
her
alyosha
got
up
resolutely
oh
my
dear
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
perhaps
thats
whats
most
important
madame
hohlakov
cried
suddenly
bursting
into
tears
god
knows
i
trust
lise
to
you
with
all
my
heart
and
its
no
matter
her
sending
for
you
on
the
sly
without
telling
her
mother
but
forgive
me
i
cant
trust
my
daughter
so
easily
to
your
brother
ivan
fyodorovitch
though
i
still
consider
him
the
most
chivalrous
young
man
but
only
fancy
hes
been
to
see
lise
and
i
knew
nothing
about
it
how
what
when
alyosha
was
exceedingly
surprised
he
had
not
sat
down
again
and
listened
standing
i
will
tell
you
thats
perhaps
why
i
asked
you
to
come
for
i
dont
know
now
why
i
did
ask
you
to
come
well
ivan
fyodorovitch
has
been
to
see
me
twice
since
he
came
back
from
moscow
first
time
he
came
as
a
friend
to
call
on
me
and
the
second
time
katya
was
here
and
he
came
because
he
heard
she
was
here
i
didnt
of
course
expect
him
to
come
often
knowing
what
a
lot
he
has
to
do
as
it
is
vous
comprenez
cette
affaire
et
la
mort
terrible
de
votre
papa
but
i
suddenly
heard
hed
been
here
again
not
to
see
me
but
to
see
lise
thats
six
days
ago
now
he
came
stayed
five
minutes
and
went
away
and
i
didnt
hear
of
it
till
three
days
afterwards
from
glafira
so
it
was
a
great
shock
to
me
i
sent
for
lise
directly
she
laughed
he
thought
you
were
asleep
she
said
and
came
in
to
me
to
ask
after
your
health
of
course
thats
how
it
happened
but
lise
lise
mercy
on
us
how
she
distresses
me
would
you
believe
it
one
night
four
days
ago
just
after
you
saw
her
last
time
and
had
gone
away
she
suddenly
had
a
fit
screaming
shrieking
hysterics
why
is
it
i
never
have
hysterics
then
next
day
another
fit
and
the
same
thing
on
the
third
and
yesterday
too
and
then
yesterday
that
aberration
she
suddenly
screamed
out
i
hate
ivan
fyodorovitch
i
insist
on
your
never
letting
him
come
to
the
house
again
i
was
struck
dumb
at
these
amazing
words
and
answered
on
what
grounds
could
i
refuse
to
see
such
an
excellent
young
man
a
young
man
of
such
learning
too
and
so
unfortunatefor
all
this
business
is
a
misfortune
isnt
it
she
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
at
my
words
and
so
rudely
you
know
well
i
was
pleased
i
thought
i
had
amused
her
and
the
fits
would
pass
off
especially
as
i
wanted
to
refuse
to
see
ivan
fyodorovitch
anyway
on
account
of
his
strange
visits
without
my
knowledge
and
meant
to
ask
him
for
an
explanation
but
early
this
morning
lise
waked
up
and
flew
into
a
passion
with
yulia
and
would
you
believe
it
slapped
her
in
the
face
thats
monstrous
i
am
always
polite
to
my
servants
and
an
hour
later
she
was
hugging
yulias
feet
and
kissing
them
she
sent
a
message
to
me
that
she
wasnt
coming
to
me
at
all
and
would
never
come
and
see
me
again
and
when
i
dragged
myself
down
to
her
she
rushed
to
kiss
me
crying
and
as
she
kissed
me
she
pushed
me
out
of
the
room
without
saying
a
word
so
i
couldnt
find
out
what
was
the
matter
now
dear
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
rest
all
my
hopes
on
you
and
of
course
my
whole
life
is
in
your
hands
i
simply
beg
you
to
go
to
lise
and
find
out
everything
from
her
as
you
alone
can
and
come
back
and
tell
meme
her
mother
for
you
understand
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
simply
the
death
of
me
if
this
goes
on
or
else
i
shall
run
away
i
can
stand
no
more
i
have
patience
but
i
may
lose
patience
and
then

then
something
awful
will
happen
ah

a
hasty
retreat

madame
hohlakov
called
after
him
but
alyosha
had
already
left
the
room
chapter
iii
a
little
demon
going
in
to
lise
he
found
her
half
reclining
in
the
invalidchair
in
which
she
had
been
wheeled
when
she
was
unable
to
walk
she
did
not
move
to
meet
him
but
her
sharp
keen
eyes
were
simply
riveted
on
his
face
there
was
a
feverish
look
in
her
eyes
her
face
was
pale
and
yellow
alyosha
was
amazed
at
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
her
in
three
days
she
was
positively
thinner
she
did
not
hold
out
her
hand
to
him
he
touched
the
thin
long
fingers
which
lay
motionless
on
her
dress
then
he
sat
down
facing
her
without
a
word
i
know
you
are
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
the
prison
lise
said
curtly
and
mammas
kept
you
there
for
hours
shes
just
been
telling
you
about
me
and
yulia
how
do
you
know
asked
alyosha
ive
been
listening
why
do
you
stare
at
me
i
want
to
listen
and
i
do
listen
theres
no
harm
in
that
i
dont
apologize
you
are
upset
about
something
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
happy
ive
only
just
been
reflecting
for
the
thirtieth
time
what
a
good
thing
it
is
i
refused
you
and
shall
not
be
your
wife
you
are
not
fit
to
be
a
husband
if
i
were
to
marry
you
and
give
you
a
note
to
take
to
the
man
i
loved
after
you
youd
take
it
and
be
sure
to
give
it
to
him
and
bring
an
answer
back
too
if
you
were
forty
you
would
still
go
on
taking
my
loveletters
for
me
she
suddenly
laughed
there
is
something
spiteful
and
yet
openhearted
about
you
alyosha
smiled
to
her
the
openheartedness
consists
in
my
not
being
ashamed
of
myself
with
you
whats
more
i
dont
want
to
feel
ashamed
with
you
just
with
you
alyosha
why
is
it
i
dont
respect
you
i
am
very
fond
of
you
but
i
dont
respect
you
if
i
respected
you
i
shouldnt
talk
to
you
without
shame
should
i
no
but
do
you
believe
that
i
am
not
ashamed
with
you
no
i
dont
believe
it

nervously
again

look

her
hand
at
him

his
mouth

god
will
censure
you
alyosha
was
watching
her
steadily
thats
just
what
i
should
like
i
would
go
up
and
they
would
censure
me
and
i
would
burst
out
laughing
in
their
faces
i
should
dreadfully
like
to
set
fire
to
the
house
alyosha
to
our
house
you
still
dont
believe
me
why
there
are
children
of
twelve
years
old
who
have
a
longing
to
set
fire
to
something
and
they
do
set
things
on
fire
too
its
a
sort
of
disease
thats
not
true
thats
not
true
there
may
be
children
but
thats
not
what
i
mean
you
take
evil
for
good
its
a
passing
crisis
its
the
result
of
your
illness
perhaps
you
do
despise
me
though
its
simply
that
i
dont
want
to
do
good
i
want
to
do
evil
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
illness
why
do
evil
so
that
everything
might
be
destroyed
ah
how
nice
it
would
be
if
everything
were
destroyed
you
know
alyosha
i
sometimes
think
of
doing
a
fearful
lot
of
harm
and
everything
bad
and
i
should
do
it
for
a
long
while
on
the
sly
and
suddenly
every
one
would
find
it
out
every
one
will
stand
round
and
point
their
fingers
at
me
and
i
would
look
at
them
all
that
would
be
awfully
nice
why
would
it
be
so
nice
alyosha
i
dont
know
its
a
craving
to
destroy
something
good
or
as
you
say
to
set
fire
to
something
it
happens
sometimes
i
not
only
say
it
i
shall
do
it
i
believe
you
ah
how
i
love
you
for
saying
you
believe
me
and
you
are
not
lying
one
little
bit
but
perhaps
you
think
that
i
am
saying
all
this
on
purpose
to
annoy
you
no
i
dont
think
that

though
perhaps
there
is
a
little
desire
to
do
that
in
it
too
there
is
a
little
i
never
can
tell
lies
to
you
she
declared
with
a
strange
fire
in
her
eyes
what
struck
alyosha
above
everything
was
her
earnestness
there
was
not
a
trace
of
humor
or
jesting
in
her
face
now
though
in
old
days
fun
and
gayety
never
deserted
her
even
at
her
most
earnest
moments
there
are
moments
when
people
love
crime
said
alyosha
thoughtfully
yes
yes
you
have
uttered
my
thought
they
love
crime
every
one
loves
crime
they
love
it
always
not
at
some
moments
you
know
its
as
though
people
have
made
an
agreement
to
lie
about
it
and
have
lied
about
it
ever
since
they
all
declare
that
they
hate
evil
but
secretly
they
all
love
it
and
are
you
still
reading
nasty
books
yes
i
am
mamma
reads
them
and
hides
them
under
her
pillow
and
i
steal
them
arent
you
ashamed
to
destroy
yourself
i
want
to
destroy
myself
theres
a
boy

railway

passing
lucky
fellow

awful
but
secretly
they
simply
love
it
i
for
one
love
it
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
say
about
every
one
said
alyosha
softly
oh
what
ideas
you
have
lise

in
delight
and
you

monk

respect
you

funny
dream
of

sometimes
dream
of
devils
its
night

am
in
my
room
with
a
candle
and
suddenly
there
are
devils
all
over
the
place
in
all
the
corners
under
the
table
and
they
open
the
doors
theres
a
crowd
of
them
behind
the
doors
and
they
want
to
come
and
seize
me
and
they
are
just
coming
just
seizing
me
but
i
suddenly
cross
myself
and
they
all
draw
back
though
they
dont
go
away
altogether
they
stand
at
the
doors
and
in
the
corners
waiting
and
suddenly
i
have
a
frightful
longing
to
revile
god
aloud
and
so
i
begin
and
then
they
come
crowding
back
to
me
delighted
and
seize
me
again
and
i
cross
myself
again
and
they
all
draw
back
its
awful
fun
it
takes
ones
breath
away

impressed
and
for
half
a
minute
she
was
silent

and
see
me
come
and
see
me
more
often
she
said
suddenly
in
a
supplicating
voice
ill

come
to
see
you
all
my
life
answered
alyosha
firmly

the
only
person
i
can
talk
to
you
know
lise
began
again
i
talk
to
no
one
but
myself
and
you
only
you
in
the
whole
world
and
to
you
more
readily
than
to
myself
and
i
am
not
a
bit
ashamed
with
you
not
a
bit
alyosha
why
am
i
not
ashamed
with
you
not
a
bit
alyosha
is
it
true
that
at
easter
the
jews
steal
a
child
and
kill
it
i
dont
know
theres
a
book
here
in
which
i
read
about
the
trial
of
a
jew
who
took
a
child
of
four
years
old
and
cut
off
the
fingers
from
both
hands
and
then
crucified
him
on
the
wall
hammered
nails
into
him
and
crucified
him
and
afterwards
when
he
was
tried
he
said
that
the
child
died
soon
within
four
hours
that
was
soon
he
said
the
child
moaned
kept
on
moaning
and
he
stood
admiring
it
thats
nice
nice
nice
i
sometimes
imagine
that
it
was
i
who
crucified
him
he
would
hang
there
moaning
and
i
would
sit
opposite
him
eating
pineapple
compote
i
am
awfully
fond
of
pineapple
compote
do
you
like
it
alyosha
looked
at
her
in
silence
her
pale
sallow
face
was
suddenly
contorted
her
eyes
burned
you
know
when
i
read
about
that
jew
i
shook
with
sobs
all
night
i
kept
fancying
how
the
little
thing
cried
and
moaned
a
child
of
four
years
old
understands
you
know
and
all
the
while
the
thought
of
pineapple
compote
haunted
me
in
the
morning
i
wrote
a
letter
to
a
certain
person
begging
him
particularly
to
come
and
see
me
he
came
and
i
suddenly
told
him
all
about
the
child
and
the
pineapple
compote
all
about
it
all
and
said
that
it
was
nice
he
laughed
and
said
it
really
was
nice
then
he
got
up
and
went
away
he
was
only
here
five
minutes
did
he
despise
me
did
he
despise
me
tell
me

me
alyosha
did
he
despise
me
or
not

sat
up
on
the
couch
with
flashing
eyes
tell
me
alyosha
asked
anxiously
did
you
send
for
that
person
yes
i
did
did
you
send
him
a
letter
yes
simply
to
ask
about
that
about
that
child
no
not
about
that
at
all
but
when
he
came
i
asked
him
about
that
at
once
he
answered
laughed
got
up
and
went
away
that
person
behaved
honorably
alyosha
murmured
and
did
he
despise
me
did
he
laugh
at
me
no
for
perhaps
he
believes
in
the
pineapple
compote
himself
he
is
very
ill
now
too
lise
yes

with
flashing
eyes

alyosha
went
on
only
he
does
not
believe
any
one
if
he
doesnt
believe
in

despises
me

seemed
to
grind
her
teeth
when
he
went
out
laughing

felt
that
it
was
nice
to
be
despised
the
child
with
fingers
cut
off
is
nice
and
to
be
despised

nice
and
she
laughed
in
alyoshas
face
a
feverish
malicious
laugh
do

alyosha

suddenly
jumped
from

couch

to
him
and
seized
him
with
both
hands
save
me
she
almost
groaned

a
frenzy
but

alyosha
warmly
and
will
you
weep

and
she
almost
forcibly
pushed
alyosha
out
of
the
door
he
looked
at
her
with
pained
surprise
when
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
letter
in
his
right
hand
a
tiny
letter
folded
up
tight
and
sealed
he
glanced
at
it
and
instantly
read
the
address
to
ivan
fyodorovitch
karamazov
he
looked
quickly
at
lise
her
face
had
become
almost
menacing
give
it
to
him
you
must
give
it
to
him
she
ordered
him
trembling
and
beside
herself

at
once
or
ill
poison
myself
thats
why
i
sent
for
you
and
she
slammed
the
door
quickly
the
bolt
clicked
alyosha
put
the
note
in
his
pocket
and
went
straight
downstairs
without
going
back
to
madame
hohlakov
forgetting
her
in
fact
as
soon
as
alyosha
had
gone
lise
unbolted
the
door
opened
it
a
little
put
her
finger
in
the
crack
and
slammed
the
door
with
all
her
might
pinching
her
finger
ten
seconds
after
releasing
her
finger
she
walked
softly
slowly
to
her
chair
sat
up
straight
in
it
and
looked
intently
at
her
blackened
finger
and
at
the
blood
that
oozed
from
under
the
nail
her
lips
were
quivering
and
she
kept
whispering
rapidly
to
herself
i
am
a
wretch
wretch
wretch
wretch
chapter
iv
a
hymn
and
a
secret
it
was
quite
late
days
are
short
in
november
when
alyosha
rang
at
the
prison
gate
it
was
beginning
to
get
dusk
but
alyosha
knew
that
he
would
be
admitted
without
difficulty
things
were
managed
in
our
little
town
as
everywhere
else
at
first
of
course
on
the
conclusion
of
the
preliminary
inquiry
relations
and
a
few
other
persons
could
only
obtain
interviews
with
mitya
by
going
through
certain
inevitable
formalities
but
later
though
the
formalities
were
not
relaxed
exceptions
were
made
for
some
at
least
of
mityas
visitors
so
much
so
that
sometimes
the
interviews
with
the
prisoner
in
the
room
set
aside
for
the
purpose
were
practically
ttette
these
exceptions
however
were
few
in
number
only
grushenka
alyosha
and
rakitin
were
treated
like
this
but
the
captain
of
the
police
mihail
mihailovitch
was
very
favorably
disposed
to
grushenka
his
abuse
of
her
at
mokroe
weighed
on
the
old
mans
conscience
and
when
he
learned
the
whole
story
he
completely
changed
his
view
of
her
and
strange
to
say
though
he
was
firmly
persuaded
of
his
guilt
yet
after
mitya
was
once
in
prison
the
old
man
came
to
take
a
more
and
more
lenient
view
of
him
he
was
a
man
of
good
heart
perhaps
he
thought
who
had
come
to
grief
from
drinking
and
dissipation
his
first
horror
had
been
succeeded
by
pity
as
for
alyosha
the
police
captain
was
very
fond
of
him
and
had
known
him
for
a
long
time
rakitin
who
had
of
late
taken
to
coming
very
often
to
see
the
prisoner
was
one
of
the
most
intimate
acquaintances
of
the
police
captains
young
ladies
as
he
called
them
and
was
always
hanging
about
their
house
he
gave
lessons
in
the
house
of
the
prison
superintendent
too
who
though
scrupulous
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
was
a
kind
hearted
old
man
alyosha
again
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
long
standing
with
the
superintendent
who
was
fond
of
talking
to
him
generally
on
sacred
subjects
he
respected
ivan
fyodorovitch
and
stood
in
awe
of
his
opinion
though
he
was
a
great
philosopher
himself
self
taught
of
course
but
alyosha
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
him
during
the
last
year
the
old
man
had
taken
to
studying
the
apocryphal
gospels
and
constantly
talked
over
his
impressions
with
his
young
friend
he
used
to
come
and
see
him
in
the
monastery
and
discussed
for
hours
together
with
him
and
with
the
monks
so
even
if
alyosha
were
late
at
the
prison
he
had
only
to
go
to
the
superintendent
and
everything
was
made
easy
besides
every
one
in
the
prison
down
to
the
humblest
warder
had
grown
used
to
alyosha
the
sentry
of
course
did
not
trouble
him
so
long
as
the
authorities
were
satisfied
when
mitya
was
summoned
from
his
cell
he
always
went
downstairs
to
the
place
set
aside
for
interviews
as
alyosha
entered
the
room
he
came
upon
rakitin
who
was
just
taking
leave
of
mitya
they
were
both
talking
loudly
mitya
was
laughing
heartily
as
he
saw
him
out
while
rakitin
seemed
grumbling
rakitin
did
not
like
meeting
alyosha
especially
of
late
he
scarcely
spoke
to
him
and
bowed
to
him
stiffly
seeing
alyosha
enter
now
he
frowned
and
looked
away
as
though
he
were
entirely
absorbed
in
buttoning
his
big
warm
furtrimmed
overcoat
then
he
began
looking
at
once
for
his
umbrella
i
must
mind
not
to
forget
my
belongings
he
muttered
simply
to
say
something
mind
you
dont
forget
other
peoples
belongings
said
mitya
as
a
joke
and
laughed
at
once
at
his
own
wit
rakitin
fired
up
instantly
youd
better
give
that
advice
to
your
own
family
whove
always
been
a
slavedriving
lot
and
not
to
rakitin
he
cried
suddenly
trembling
with
anger
whats
the
matter
i
was
joking
cried
mitya
damn
it
all
they
are
all
like
that
he
turned
to
alyosha
nodding
towards
rakitins
hurriedly
retreating
figure
he
was
sitting
here
laughing
and
cheerful
and
all
at
once
he
boils
up
like
that
he
didnt
even
nod
to
you
have
you
broken
with
him
completely
why
are
you
so
late
ive
not
been
simply
waiting
but
thirsting
for
you
the
whole
morning
but
never
mind
well
make
up
for
it
now
why
does
he
come
here
so
often
surely
you
are
not
such
great
friends
asked
alyosha
he
too
nodded
at
the
door
through
which
rakitin
had
disappeared
great
friends
with
rakitin
no
not
as
much
as
that
is
it
likelya
pig
like
that
he
considers
i
am

a
blackguard
they
cant
understand
a
joke
either
thats
the
worst
of
such
people
they
never
understand
a
joke
and
their
souls
are
dry
dry
and
flat
they
remind
me
of
prison
walls
when
i
was
first
brought
here
but
he
is
a
clever
fellow
very
clever
well
alexey
its
all
over
with
me
now
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
made
alyosha
sit
down
beside
him
yes
the
trials
tomorrow
are
you
so
hopeless
brother
alyosha
said
with
an
apprehensive
feeling
what
are
you
talking
about
said
mitya
looking
at
him
rather
uncertainly
oh
you
mean
the
trial
damn
it
all
till
now
weve
been
talking
of
things
that

matter
about
this
trial
but
i
havent
said
a
word
to
you
about
the
chief
thing
yes
the
trial
is
tomorrow
but
it
wasnt
the
trial
i
meant
when
i
said
it
was
all
over

me

alyosha
wondering

but

i
confess

in
for
criticism
of

elevating
tendency

his
own
career

ough

firstrate
these
people
at
making

love
you

my
heart
yearn
to
look
at
you
who
was
karl
bernard
karl
bernard
alyosha
was
surprised
again
no
not
karl
stay
i
made
a
mistake
claude
bernard
what
was
he
chemist
or
what
he
must
be
a
savant
answered
alyosha
but
i
confess
i
cant
tell
you
much
about
him
either
ive
heard
of
him
as
a
savant
but
what
sort
i
dont
know
well
damn
him
then
i
dont
know
either
swore
mitya
a
scoundrel
of
some
sort
most
likely
they
are
all
scoundrels
and
rakitin
will
make
his
way
rakitin
will
get
on
anywhere
he
is
another
bernard
ugh
these
bernards
they
are
all
over
the
place
but
what
is
the
matter
alyosha
asked
insistently
he
wants
to
write
an
article
about
me
about
my
case
and
so
begin
his
literary
career
thats
what
he
comes
for
he
said
so
himself
he
wants
to
prove
some
theory
he
wants
to
say
he
couldnt
help
murdering
his
father
he
was
corrupted
by
his
environment
and
so
on
he
explained
it
all
to
me
he
is
going
to
put
in
a
tinge
of
socialism
he
says
but
there
damn
the
fellow
he
can
put
in
a
tinge
if
he
likes
i
dont
care
he
cant
bear
ivan
he
hates
him
hes
not
fond
of
you
either
but
i
dont
turn
him
out
for
he
is
a
clever
fellow
awfully
conceited
though
i
said
to
him
just
now
the
karamazovs
are
not
blackguards
but
philosophers
for
all
true
russians
are
philosophers
and
though
youve
studied
you
are
not
a
philosopheryou
are
a
low
fellow
he
laughed
so
maliciously
and
i
said
to
him
de
ideabus
non
est
disputandum
isnt
that
rather
good
i
can
set
up
for
being
a
classic
you
see
mitya
laughed
suddenly
why
is
it
all
over
with
you
you
said
so
just
now
alyosha
interposed
why
is
it
all
over
with
me
hm
the
fact
of
it
is

if
you
take
it
as
a
whole
i
am
sorry
to
lose
godthats
why
it
is
what
do
you
mean
by
sorry
to
lose
god
imagine
inside
in
the
nerves
in
the
headthat
is
these
nerves
are
there
in
the
brain

damn
them
there
are
sort
of
little
tails
the
little
tails
of
those
nerves
and
as
soon
as
they
begin
quivering

that
is
you
see
i
look
at
something
with
my
eyes
and
then
they
begin
quivering
those
little
tails

and
when
they
quiver
then
an
image
appears

it
doesnt
appear
at
once
but
an
instant
a
second
passes

and
then
something
like
a
moment
appears
that
is
not
a
momentdevil
take
the
momentbut
an
image
that
is
an
object
or
an
action
damn
it
thats
why
i
see
and
then
think
because
of
those
tails
not
at
all
because
ive
got
a
soul
and
that
i
am
some
sort
of
image
and
likeness
all
that
is
nonsense
rakitin
explained
it
all
to
me
yesterday
brother
and
it
simply
bowled
me
over
its
magnificent
alyosha
this
science
a
new
mans
arisingthat
i
understand
and
yet
i
am
sorry
to
lose
god
well
thats
a
good
thing
anyway
said
alyosha
that
i
am
sorry
to
lose
god
its
chemistry
brother
chemistry
theres
no
help
for
it
your
reverence
you
must
make
way
for
chemistry
and
rakitin
does
dislike
god
ough
doesnt
he
dislike
him
thats
the
sore
point
with
all
of
them
but
they
conceal
it
they
tell
lies
they
pretend
will
you
preach
this
in
your
reviews
i
asked
him
oh
well
if
i
did
it
openly
they
wont
let
it
through
he
said
he
laughed
but
what
will
become
of
men
then
i
asked
him
without
god
and
immortal
life
all
things
are
lawful
then
they
can
do
what
they
like
didnt
you
know
he
said
laughing
a
clever
man
can
do
what
he
likes
he
said
a
clever
man
knows
his
way
about
but
youve
put
your
foot
in
it
committing
a
murder
and
now
you
are
rotting
in
prison
he
says
that
to
my
face
a
regular
pig
i
used
to
kick
such
people
out
but
now
i
listen
to
them
he
talks
a
lot
of
sense
too
writes
well
he
began
reading
me
an
article
last
week
i
copied
out
three
lines
of
it
wait
a
minute
here
it
is
mitya
hurriedly
pulled
out
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
read

in
order
to
determine
this
question
it
is
above
all
essential
to
put
ones
personality
in
contradiction
to
ones
reality
do
you
understand
that
no
i
dont
said
alyosha
he
looked
at
mitya
and
listened
to
him
with
curiosity
i
dont
understand
either
its
dark
and
obscure
but
intellectual
every
one
writes
like
that
now
he
says
its
the
effect
of
their
environment
they
are
afraid
of
the
environment
he
writes
poetry
too
the
rascal
hes
written
in
honor
of
madame
hohlakovs
foot
ha
ha
ha
ive
heard
about
it
said
alyosha
have
you
and
have
you
heard
the
poem
no
ive
got
it
here
it
is
ill
read
it
to
you
you
dont
knowi
havent
told
youtheres
quite
a
story
about
it
hes
a
rascal
three
weeks
ago
he
began
to
tease
me
youve
got
yourself
into
a
mess
like
a
fool
for
the
sake
of
three
thousand
but
im
going
to
collar
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
i
am
going
to
marry
a
widow
and
buy
a
house
in
petersburg
and
he
told
me
he
was
courting
madame
hohlakov
she
hadnt
much
brains
in
her
youth
and
now
at
forty
she
has
lost
what
she
had
but
shes
awfully
sentimental
he
says
thats
how
i
shall
get
hold
of
her
when
i
marry
her
i
shall
take
her
to
petersburg
and
there
i
shall
start
a
newspaper
and
his
mouth
was
simply
watering
the
beast
not
for
the
widow
but
for
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
he
made
me
believe
it
he
came
to
see
me
every
day
she
is
coming
round
he
declared
he
was
beaming
with
delight
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
turned
out
of
the
house
perhotins
carrying
everything
before
him
bravo
i
could
kiss
the
silly
old
noodle
for
turning
him
out
of
the
house
and
he
had
written
this
doggerel
its
the
first
time
ive
soiled
my
hands
with
writing
poetry
he
said
its
to
win
her
heart
so
its
in
a
good
cause
when
i
get
hold
of
the
silly
womans
fortune
i
can
be
of
great
social
utility
they
have
this
social
justification
for
every
nasty
thing
they
do
anyway
its
better
than
your
pushkins
poetry
he
said
for
ive
managed
to
advocate
enlightenment
even
in
that
i
understand
what
he
means
about
pushkin
i
quite
see
that
if
he
really
was
a
man
of
talent
and
only
wrote
about
womens
feet
but
wasnt
rakitin
stuck
up
about
his
doggerel
the
vanity
of
these
fellows
on
the
convalescence
of
the
swollen
foot
of
the
object
of
my
affectionshe
thought
of
that
for
a
title
hes
a
waggish
fellow
a
captivating
little
foot
though
swollen
and
red
and
tender
the
doctors
come
and
plasters
put
but
still
they
cannot
mend
her
yet
tis
not
for
her
foot
i
dread
a
theme
for
pushkins
muse
more
fit
its
not
her
foot
it

room
with
a
harassed
air
brother
i
cannot
stay
long
alyosha
said
after
a
pause

great
and
awful
day

of
that
stinking
dog
of
the
murderer
weve
talked

of
him
i
dont
want
to
say
more
of
the
stinking
son
of
stinking
lizaveta
god

he
went
up
to
alyosha
excitedly
and
kissed
him
his
eyes
glowed
rakitin
wouldnt
understand
it
he
began
in
a
sort
of
exaltation
but
you
youll
understand
it
all
thats
why
i
was
thirsting
for
you
you
see
theres
so
much
ive
been
wanting
to
tell
you
for
ever
so
long
here
within
these
peeling
walls
but
i
havent
said
a
word
about
what
matters
most
the
moment
never
seems
to
have
come
now
i
can
wait
no
longer
i
must
pour
out
my
heart
to
you
brother
these
last
two
months
ive
found
in
myself
a
new
man
a
new
man
has
risen
up
in
me
he
was
hidden
in
me
but
would
never
have
come
to
the
surface
if
it
hadnt
been
for
this
blow
from
heaven
i
am
afraid
and
what
do
i
care
if
i
spend
twenty
years
in
the
mines
breaking
ore
with
a
hammer
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
thatits
something
else
i
am
afraid
of
now
that
that
new
man
may
leave
me
even
there
in
the
mines
underground
i
may
find
a
human
heart
in
another
convict
and
murderer
by
my
side
and
i
may
make
friends
with
him
for
even
there
one
may
live
and
love
and
suffer
one
may
thaw
and
revive
a
frozen
heart
in
that
convict
one
may
wait
upon
him
for
years
and
at
last
bring
up
from
the
dark
depths
a
lofty
soul
a
feeling
suffering
creature
one
may
bring
forth
an
angel
create
a
hero
there
are
so
many
of
them
hundreds
of
them
and
we
are
all
to
blame
for
them
why
was
it
i
dreamed
of
that
babe
at
such
a
moment
why
is
the
babe
so
poor
that
was
a
sign
to
me
at
that
moment
its
for
the
babe
im
going
because
we
are
all
responsible
for
all
for
all
the
babes
for
there
are
big
children
as
well
as
little
children
all
are
babes
i
go
for
all
because
some
one
must
go
for
all
i
didnt
kill
father
but
ive
got
to
go
i
accept
it
its
all
come
to
me
here
here
within
these
peeling
walls
there
are
numbers
of
them
there
hundreds
of
them
underground
with
hammers
in
their
hands
oh
yes
we
shall
be
in
chains
and
there
will
be
no
freedom
but
then
in
our
great
sorrow
we
shall
rise
again
to
joy
without
which
man
cannot
live
nor
god
exist
for
god
gives
joy
its
his
privilegea
grand
one
ah
man
should
be
dissolved
in
prayer
what
should
i
be
underground
there
without
god
rakitins
laughing
if
they
drive
god
from
the
earth
we
shall
shelter
him
underground
one
cannot
exist
in
prison
without
god
its
even
more
impossible
than
out
of
prison
and
then
we
men
underground
will
sing
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
a
glorious
hymn
to
god
with
whom
is
joy
hail
to
god
and
his
joy
i
love
him
mitya
was
almost
gasping
for
breath
as
he
uttered
his
wild
speech
he
turned
pale
his
lips
quivered
and
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
yes
life
is
full
there
is
life
even
underground
he
began
again
you
wouldnt
believe
alexey
how
i
want
to
live
now
what
a
thirst
for
existence
and
consciousness
has
sprung
up
in
me
within
these
peeling
walls
rakitin
doesnt
understand
that
all
he
cares
about
is
building
a
house
and
letting
flats
but
ive
been
longing
for
you
and
what
is
suffering
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
even
if
it
were
beyond
reckoning
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
now
i
was
afraid
of
it
before
do
you
know
perhaps
i
wont
answer
at
the
trial
at
all
and
i
seem
to
have
such
strength
in
me
now
that
i
think
i
could
stand
anything
any
suffering
only
to
be
able
to
say
and
to
repeat
to
myself
every
moment
i
exist
in
thousands
of
agoniesi
exist
im
tormented
on
the
rackbut
i
exist
though
i
sit
alone
on
a
pillari
exist
i
see
the
sun
and
if
i
dont
see
the
sun
i
know
its
there
and
theres
a
whole
life
in
that
in
knowing
that
the
sun
is
there
alyosha
my
angel
all
these
philosophies
are
the
death
of
me
damn
them
brother
ivan
what
of
brother
ivan
interrupted
alyosha
but
mitya
did
not
hear
you
see
i
never
had
any
of
these
doubts
before
but
it
was
all
hidden
away
in
me
it
was
perhaps
just
because
ideas
i
did
not
understand
were
surging
up
in
me
that
i
used
to
drink
and
fight
and
rage
it
was
to
stifle
them
in
myself
to
still
them
to
smother
them
ivan
is
not
rakitin
there
is
an
idea
in
him
ivan
is
a
sphinx
and
is
silent
he
is
always
silent
its
god
thats
worrying
me
thats
the
only
thing
thats
worrying
me
what
if
he
doesnt
exist
what
if
rakitins
rightthat
its
an
idea
made
up
by
men
then
if
he
doesnt
exist
man
is
the
chief
of
the
earth
of
the
universe
magnificent
only
how
is
he
going
to
be
good
without
god
thats
the
question
i
always
come
back
to
that
for
whom
is
man
going
to
love
then
to
whom
will
he
be
thankful
to
whom
will
he
sing
the
hymn
rakitin
laughs
rakitin
says
that
one
can
love
humanity
without
god
well
only
a
sniveling
idiot
can
maintain
that
i
cant
understand
it
lifes
easy
for
rakitin
youd
better
think
about
the
extension
of
civic
rights
or
even
of
keeping
down
the
price
of
meat
you
will
show
your
love
for
humanity
more
simply
and
directly
by
that
than
by
philosophy
i
answered
him
well
but
you
without
a
god
are
more
likely
to
raise
the
price
of
meat
if
it
suits
you
and
make
a
rouble
on
every
copeck
he
lost
his
temper
but
after
all
what
is
goodness
answer
me
that
alexey
goodness
is
one
thing
with
me
and
another
with
a
chinaman
so
its
a
relative
thing
or
isnt
it
is
it
not
relative
a
treacherous
question
you
wont
laugh
if
i
tell
you
its
kept
me
awake
two
nights
i
only
wonder
now
how
people
can
live
and
think
nothing
about
it
vanity
ivan
has
no
god
he
has
an
idea
its
beyond
me
but
he
is
silent
i
believe
he
is
a
freemason
i
asked
him
but
he
is
silent
i
wanted
to
drink
from
the
springs
of
his
soulhe
was
silent
but
once
he
did
drop
a
word
what
did
he
say
alyosha
took
it
up
quickly
i
said
to
him
then
everything
is
lawful
if
it
is
so
he
frowned
fyodor
pavlovitch
our
papa
he
said
was
a
pig
but
his
ideas
were
right
enough
that
was
what
he
dropped
that
was
all
he
said
that
was
going
one
better
than
rakitin
yes
alyosha
assented
bitterly
when
was
he
with
you
of
that
later
now
i
must
speak
of
something
else
i
have
said
nothing
about
ivan
to
you
before
i
put
it
off
to
the
last
when
my
business
here
is
over
and
the
verdict
has
been
given
then
ill
tell
you
something
ill
tell
you
everything
weve
something
tremendous
on
hand
and
you
shall
be
my
judge
in
it
but
dont
begin
about
that
now
be
silent
you
talk
of
tomorrow
of
the
trial
but
would
you
believe
it
i
know
nothing
about
it
have
you
talked
to
the
counsel
whats
the
use
of
the
counsel
i
told
him
all
about
it
hes
a
soft
citybred
roguea
bernard
but
he
doesnt
believe
menot
a
bit
of
it
only
imagine
he
believes
i
did
it
i
see
it
in
that
case
i
asked
him
why
have
you
come
to
defend
me
hang
them
all
theyve
got
a
doctor
down
too
want
to
prove
im
mad
i
wont
have
that
katerina
ivanovna
wants
to
do
her
duty
to
the
end
whatever
the
strain
mitya
smiled
bitterly
the
cat
hardhearted
creature
she
knows
that
i
said
of
her
at
mokroe
that
she
was
a
woman
of
great
wrath
they
repeated
it
yes
the
facts
against
me
have
grown
numerous
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
grigory
sticks
to
his
point
grigorys
honest
but
a
fool
many
people
are
honest
because
they
are
fools
thats
rakitins
idea
grigorys
my
enemy
and
there
are
some
people
who
are
better
as
foes
than
friends
i
mean
katerina
ivanovna
i
am
afraid
oh
i
am
afraid
she
will
tell
how
she
bowed
to
the
ground
after
that
four
thousand
shell
pay
it
back
to
the
last
farthing
i
dont
want
her
sacrifice
theyll
put
me
to
shame
at
the
trial
i
wonder
how
i
can
stand
it
go
to
her
alyosha
ask
her
not
to
speak
of
that
in
the
court

you
but
damn

all
it
doesnt
matter

shall
get
through
somehow
i
dont
pity
her
its
her
own
doing
she
deserves
what
she
gets
i
shall
have
my
own
story
to
tell
alexey
he
smiled
bitterly
again
only

only
grusha
grusha
good
lord
why
should
she
have
such
suffering
to
bear
he
exclaimed
suddenly
with
tears
grushas
killing
me
the
thought
of
hers
killing
me
killing
me
she
was
with
me
just
now

told
me

very
much
grieved
by
you
today
i
know
confound
my
temper
it
was
jealousy

was
sorry

kissed
her
as
she
was
going
i
didnt
ask
her
forgiveness

you
exclaimed
alyosha
suddenly
mitya
laughed
almost
mirthfully
god

you
my
dear
boy
from
ever
asking
forgiveness
for
a
fault
from
a
woman

sorry

me
and
a
shower
of
reproaches

simply
and
directly

to
the
dust

forward
things
that

never
happened

something
of
her

and
only
then

the
best

best
of
them

and
openly

be
under
some
womans
thumb

my
convictionnot

she
tortures
me
tortures
me
with
her
love
the
past

nothing
in
the
past
it
was
only
those
infernal
curves
of
hers
that
tortured
me
but
now
ive
taken
all
her
soul
into

through
her
ive
become
a
man

repeated
all
grushenka
had
said
to
him
that
day
mitya
listened
made
him
repeat
things
and
seemed
pleased
then
she
is
not
angry
at
my
being
jealous
he
exclaimed
she
is
a
regular
woman
ive
a
fierce
heart
myself

fierce
hearts

any
ones
being
jealous
of
me
i
cant
endure
it
we
shall
fight

they
let
convicts

thats
the
question
and
without
her
i
cant
exist
mitya
walked
frowning
across
the
room
it
was
almost
dark
he
suddenly
seemed
terribly
worried
so
theres
a
secret
she
says
a
secret
we
have
got
up
a
plot
against
her
and
katya
is
mixed
up
in
it
she
thinks
no
my
good
grushenka
thats
not
it
you
are
very
wide
of
the
mark
in
your
foolish
feminine
way
alyosha
darling
well
here
goes
ill
tell
you
our
secret
he
looked
round
went
close
up
quickly
to
alyosha
who
was
standing
before
him
and
whispered
to
him
with
an
air
of
mystery
though
in
reality
no
one
could
hear
them
the
old
warder
was
dozing
in
the
corner
and
not
a
word
could
reach
the
ears
of
the
soldiers
on
guard
i
will
tell
you
all
our
secret
mitya
whispered
hurriedly
i
meant
to
tell
you
later
for
how
could
i
decide
on
anything
without
you
you
are
everything
to
me
though
i
say
that
ivan
is
superior
to
us
you
are
my
angel
its
your
decision
will
decide
it
perhaps
its
you
that
is
superior
and
not
ivan
you
see
its
a
question
of
conscience
question
of
the
higher
consciencethe
secret
is
so
important
that
i
cant
settle
it
myself
and
ive
put
it
off
till
i
could
speak
to
you
but
anyway
its
too
early
to
decide
now
for
we
must
wait
for
the
verdict
as
soon
as
the
verdict
is
given
you
shall
decide
my
fate
dont
decide
it
now
ill
tell
you
now
you
listen
but
dont
decide
stand
and
keep
quiet
i
wont
tell
you
everything
ill
only
tell
you
the
idea
without
details
and
you
keep
quiet
not
a
question
not
a
movement
you
agree
but
goodness
what
shall
i
do
with
your
eyes
im
afraid
your
eyes
will
tell
me
your
decision
even
if
you
dont
speak
oo
im
afraid
alyosha
listen
ivan
suggests
my
escaping
i
wont
tell
you
the
details
its
all
been
thought
out
it
can
all
be
arranged
hush
dont
decide
i
should
go
to
america
with
grusha
you
know
i
cant
live
without
grusha
what
if
they
wont
let
her
follow
me
to
siberia
do
they
let
convicts
get
married
ivan
thinks
not
and
without
grusha
what
should
i
do
there
underground
with
a
hammer
i
should
only
smash
my
skull
with
the
hammer
but
on
the
other
hand
my
conscience
i
should
have
run
away
from
suffering
a
sign
has
come
i
reject
the
sign
i
have
a
way
of
salvation
and
i
turn
my
back
on
it
ivan
says
that
in
america
with
the
goodwill
i
can
be
of
more
use
than
underground
but
what
becomes
of
our
hymn
from
underground
whats
america
america
is
vanity
again
and
theres
a
lot
of
swindling
in
america
too
i
expect
i
should
have
run
away
from
crucifixion
i
tell
you
you
know
alexey
because
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
understand
this
theres
no
one
else
its
folly
madness
to
others
all
ive
told
you
of
the
hymn
theyll
say
im
out
of
my
mind
or
a
fool
i
am
not
out
of
my
mind
and
i
am
not
a
fool
ivan
understands
about
the
hymn
too
he
understands
only
he
doesnt
answerhe
doesnt
speak
he
doesnt
believe
in
the
hymn
dont
speak
dont
speak
i
see
how
you
look
you
have
already
decided
dont
decide
spare
me
i
cant
live
without
grusha
wait
till
after
the
trial
mitya
ended
beside
himself
he
held
alyosha
with
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
his
yearning
feverish
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
brothers
they
dont
let
convicts
marry
do
they
he
repeated
for
the
third
time
in
a
supplicating
voice
alyosha
listened
with
extreme
surprise
and
was
deeply
moved
tell
me
one
thing
he
said
is
ivan
very
keen
on
it
and
whose
idea
was
it
his
his
and
he
is
very
keen
on
it
he
didnt
come
to
see
me
at
first
then
he
suddenly
came
a
week
ago
and
he
began
about
it
straight
away
he
is
awfully
keen
on
it
he
doesnt
ask
me
but
orders
me
to
escape
he
doesnt
doubt
of
my
obeying
him
though
i
showed
him
all
my
heart
as
i
have
to
you
and
told
him
about
the
hymn
too
he
told
me
hed
arrange
it
hes
found
out
about
everything
but
of
that
later
hes
simply
set
on
it
its
all
a
matter
of
money
hell
pay
ten
thousand
for
escape
and
give
me
twenty
thousand
for
america
and
he
says
we
can
arrange
a
magnificent
escape
for
ten
thousand
and
he
told
you
on
no
account
to
tell
me
alyosha
asked
again
to
tell
no
one
and
especially
not
you
on
no
account
to
tell
you
he
is
afraid
no
doubt
that
youll
stand
before
me
as
my
conscience
dont
tell
him
i
told
you
dont
tell
him
for
anything
you
are
right
alyosha
pronounced
its
impossible
to
decide
anything
before
the
trial
is
over
after
the
trial
youll
decide
of
yourself
then
youll
find
that
new
man
in
yourself
and
he
will
decide
a
new
man
or
a
bernard
wholl
decide

la
bernard
for
i
believe
im
a
contemptible
bernard
myself
said
mitya
with
a
bitter
grin
but
brother
have
you
no
hope
then
of
being
acquitted
mitya
shrugged
his
shoulders
nervously
and
shook
his
head
alyosha
darling
its
time
you
were
going
he
said
with
a
sudden
haste
theres
the
superintendent
shouting
in
the
yard
hell
be
here
directly
we
are
late
its
irregular
embrace
me
quickly
kiss
me
sign
me
with
the
cross
darling
for
the
cross
i
have
to
bear
tomorrow
they
embraced
and
kissed
ivan
said
mitya
suddenly
suggests
my
escaping
but
of
course
he
believes
i
did
it
a
mournful
smile
came
on
to
his
lips
have
you
asked
him
whether
he
believes
it
asked
alyosha
no
i
havent
i
wanted
to
but
i
couldnt
i
hadnt
the
courage
but
i
saw
it
from
his
eyes
well
goodby
once
more
they
kissed
hurriedly
and
alyosha
was
just
going
out
when
mitya
suddenly
called
him
back
stand
facing
me
thats
right
and
again
he
seized
alyosha
putting
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
his
face
became
suddenly
quite
pale
so
that
it
was
dreadfully
apparent
even
through
the
gathering
darkness
his
lips
twitched
his
eyes
fastened
upon
alyosha
alyosha
tell
me
the
whole
truth
as
you
would
before
god
do
you
believe
i
did
it
do
you
do
you
in
yourself
believe
it
the
whole
truth
dont
lie
he
cried
desperately
everything
seemed
heaving
before
alyosha
and
he
felt
something
like
a
stab
at
his
heart
hush
what
do
you
mean
he
faltered
helplessly
the
whole
truth
the
whole
dont
lie
repeated
mitya
ive
never
for
one
instant
believed
that
you
were
the
murderer
broke
in
a
shaking
voice
from
alyoshas
breast
and
he
raised
his
right
hand
in
the
air
as
though
calling
god
to
witness
his
words
mityas
whole
face
was
lighted
up
with
bliss
thank
you
he
articulated
slowly
as
though
letting
a
sigh
escape
him
after
fainting
now
you
have
given
me
new
life
would
you
believe
it
till
this
moment
ive
been
afraid
to
ask
you
you
even
you
well
go
youve
given
me
strength
for
tomorrow
god
bless
you
come
go
along
love
ivan
was
mityas
last
word
alyosha
went
out
in
tears
such
distrustfulness
in
mitya
such
lack
of
confidence
even
to
him
to
alyoshaall
this
suddenly
opened
before
alyosha
an
unsuspected
depth
of
hopeless
grief
and
despair
in
the
soul
of
his
unhappy
brother
intense
infinite
compassion
overwhelmed
him
instantly
there
was
a
poignant
ache
in
his
torn
heart
love
ivanhe
suddenly
recalled
mityas
words
and
he
was
going
to
ivan
he
badly
wanted
to
see
ivan
all
day
he
was
as
much
worried
about
ivan
as
about
mitya
and
more
than
ever
now
chapter
v
not
you
not
you
on
the
way
to
ivan
he
had
to
pass
the
house
where
katerina
ivanovna
was
living
there
was
light
in
the
windows
he
suddenly
stopped
and
resolved
to
go
in
he
had
not
seen
katerina
ivanovna
for
more
than
a
week
but
now
it
struck
him
that
ivan
might
be
with
her
especially
on
the
eve
of
the
terrible
day
ringing
and
mounting
the
staircase
which
was
dimly
lighted
by
a
chinese
lantern
he
saw
a
man
coming
down
and
as
they
met
he
recognized
him
as
his
brother
so
he
was
just
coming
from
katerina
ivanovna
ah
its
only
you
said
ivan
dryly
well
goodby
you
are
going
to
her
yes
i
dont
advise
you
to
shes
upset
and
youll
upset
her
more
a
door
was
instantly
flung
open
above
and
a
voice
cried
suddenly
no
no
alexey
fyodorovitch
have
you
come
from
him
yes
i
have
been
with
him
has
he
sent
me
any
message
come
up
alyosha
and
you
ivan
fyodorovitch
you
must
come
back
you
must
do
you
hear
there
was
such
a
peremptory
note
in
katyas
voice
that
ivan
after
a
moments
hesitation
made
up
his
mind
to
go
back
with
alyosha
she
was
listening
he
murmured
angrily
to
himself
but
alyosha
heard
it
excuse
my
keeping
my
greatcoat
on
said
ivan
going
into
the
drawing
room
i
wont
sit
down
i
wont
stay
more
than
a
minute
sit
down
alexey
fyodorovitch
said
katerina
ivanovna
though
she
remained
standing
she
had
changed
very
little
during
this
time
but
there
was
an
ominous
gleam
in
her
dark
eyes
alyosha
remembered
afterwards
that
she
had
struck
him
as
particularly
handsome
at
that
moment
what
did
he
ask
you
to
tell
me
only
one
thing
said
alyosha
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
that
you
would
spare
yourself
and
say
nothing
at
the
trial
of
what
he
was
a
little
confused

passed
between
you

at
the
time
of
your
first
acquaintance

in
that
town
ah
that
i
bowed
down
to
the
ground
for
that
money
she
broke
into
a
bitter
laugh
why
is
he
afraid
for
me
or
for
himself
he
asks
me
to
sparewhom
him
or
myself
tell
me
alexey
fyodorovitch
alyosha
watched
her
intently
trying
to
understand
her
both
yourself
and
him
he
answered
softly
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
she
snapped
out
maliciously
and
she
suddenly
blushed
you
dont
know
me
yet
alexey
fyodorovitch
she
said
menacingly
and
i
dont
know
myself
yet
perhaps
youll
want
to
trample
me
under
foot
after
my
examination
tomorrow
you
will
give
your
evidence
honorably
said
alyosha
thats
all
thats
wanted
women
are
often
dishonorable
she
snarled
only
an
hour
ago
i
was
thinking
i
felt
afraid
to
touch
that
monster

as
though
he
were
a
reptile

but
no
he
is
still
a
human
being
to
me
but
did
he
do
it
is
he
the
murderer
she
cried
all
of
a
sudden
hysterically
turning
quickly
to
ivan
alyosha
saw
at
once
that
she
had
asked
ivan
that
question
before
perhaps
only
a
moment
before
he
came
in
and
not
for
the
first
time
but
for
the
hundredth
and
that
they
had
ended
by
quarreling
ive
been
to
see
smerdyakov
it
was
you
you
who
persuaded
me
that
he
murdered
his
father
its
only
you
i
believed
she
continued
still
addressing
ivan
he
gave
her
a
sort
of
strained
smile
alyosha
started
at
her
tone
he
had
not
suspected
such
familiar
intimacy
between
them
well
thats
enough
anyway
ivan
cut
short
the
conversation
i
am
going
ill
come
tomorrow
and
turning
at
once
he
walked
out
of
the
room
and
went
straight
downstairs
with
an
imperious
gesture
katerina
ivanovna
seized
alyosha
by
both
hands
follow
him
overtake
him
dont
leave
him
alone
for
a
minute
she
said
in
a
hurried
whisper
hes
mad
dont
you
know
that
hes
mad
he
is
in
a
fever
nervous
fever
the
doctor
told
me
so
go
run
after
him
alyosha
jumped
up
and
ran
after
ivan
who
was
not
fifty
paces
ahead
of
him
what
do
you
want
he
turned
quickly
on
alyosha
seeing
that
he
was
running
after
him
she
told
you
to
catch
me
up
because
im
mad
i
know
it
all
by
heart
he
added
irritably
she
is
mistaken
of
course
but
she
is
right
that
you
are
ill
said
alyosha
i
was
looking
at
your
face
just
now
you
look
very
ill
ivan
ivan
walked
on
without
stopping
alyosha
followed
him
and
do
you
know
alexey
fyodorovitch
how
people
do
go
out
of
their
mind
ivan
asked
in
a
voice
suddenly
quiet
without
a
trace
of
irritation
with
a
note
of
the
simplest
curiosity
no
i
dont
i
suppose
there
are
all
kinds
of
insanity
and
can
one
observe
that
ones
going
mad
oneself
i
imagine
one
cant
see
oneself
clearly
in
such
circumstances
alyosha
answered
with
surprise
ivan
paused
for
half
a
minute
if
you
want
to
talk
to
me
please
change
the
subject
he
said
suddenly
oh
while
i
think
of
it
i
have
a
letter
for
you
said
alyosha
timidly
and
he
took
lises
note
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
ivan
they
were
just
under
a
lamppost
ivan
recognized
the
handwriting
at
once
ah
from
that
little
demon
he
laughed
maliciously
and
without
opening
the
envelope
he
tore
it
into
bits
and
threw
it
in
the
air
the
bits
were
scattered
by
the
wind
shes
not
sixteen
yet
i
believe
and
already
offering
herself
he
said
contemptuously
striding
along
the
street
again
how
do
you
mean
offering
herself
exclaimed
alyosha
as
wanton
women
offer
themselves
to
be
sure
how
can
you
ivan
how
can
you
alyosha
cried
warmly
in
a
grieved
voice
she
is
a
child
you
are
insulting
a
child
she
is
ill
she
is
very
ill
too
she
is
on
the
verge
of
insanity
too
perhaps
i
had
hoped
to
hear
something
from
you

that
would
save
her
youll
hear
nothing
from
me
if
she
is
a
child
i
am
not
her
nurse
be
quiet
alexey
dont
go
on
about
her
i
am
not
even
thinking
about
it
they
were
silent
again
for
a
moment
she
will
be
praying
all
night
now
to
the
mother
of
god
to
show
her
how
to
act
tomorrow
at
the
trial
he
said
sharply
and
angrily
again
you

you
mean
katerina
ivanovna
yes
whether
shes
to
save
mitya
or
ruin
him
shell
pray
for
light
from
above
she
cant
make
up
her
mind
for
herself
you
see
she
has
not
had
time
to
decide
yet
she
takes
me
for
her
nurse
too
she
wants
me
to
sing
lullabies
to
her
katerina
ivanovna
loves
you
brother
said
alyosha
sadly
perhaps
but
i
am
not
very
keen
on
her
she
is
suffering
why
do
you

sometimes
say
things
to
her
that
give
her
hope
alyosha
went
on
with
timid
reproach
i
know
that
youve
given
her
hope
forgive
me
for
speaking
to
you
like
this
he
added
i
cant
behave
to
her
as
i
oughtbreak
off
altogether
and
tell
her
so
straight
out
said
ivan
irritably
i
must
wait
till
sentence
is
passed
on
the
murderer
if
i
break
off
with
her
now
she
will
avenge
herself
on
me
by
ruining
that
scoundrel
tomorrow
at
the
trial
for
she
hates
him
and
knows
she
hates
him
its
all
a
lielie
upon
lie
as
long
as
i
dont
break
off
with
her
she
goes
on
hoping
and
she
wont
ruin
that
monster
knowing
how
i
want
to
get
him
out
of
trouble
if
only
that
damned
verdict
would
come
the
words
murderer
and
monster
echoed
painfully
in
alyoshas
heart
but
how
can
she
ruin
mitya
he
asked
pondering
on
ivans
words
what
evidence
can
she
give
that
would
ruin
mitya
you
dont
know
that
yet
shes
got
a
document
in
her
hands
in
mityas
own
writing
that
proves
conclusively
that
he
did
murder
fyodor
pavlovitch
thats
impossible
cried
alyosha
why
is
it
impossible
ive
read
it
myself
there
cant
be
such
a
document
alyosha
repeated
warmly
there
cant
be
because
hes
not
the
murderer
its
not
he
murdered
father
not
he
ivan
suddenly
stopped
who
is
the
murderer
then
according
to
you
he
asked
with
apparent
coldness
there
was
even
a
supercilious
note
in
his
voice
you
know
who
alyosha
pronounced
in
a
low
penetrating
voice
who
you
mean
the
myth
about
that
crazy
idiot
the
epileptic
smerdyakov
alyosha
suddenly
felt
himself
trembling
all
over
you
know
who
broke
helplessly
from
him
he
could
scarcely
breathe
who
who
ivan
cried
almost
fiercely
all
his
restraint
suddenly
vanished
i
only
know
one
thing
alyosha
went
on
still
almost
in
a
whisper
it
wasnt
you
killed
father

not
you
what
do
you
mean
by
not
you
ivan
was
thunderstruck
it
was
not
you
killed
father
not
you
alyosha
repeated
firmly
the
silence
lasted
for
half
a
minute
i
know
i
didnt
are
you
raving
said
ivan
with
a
pale
distorted
smile
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
alyosha
they
were
standing
again
under
a
lamppost
no
ivan
youve
told
yourself
several
times
that
you
are
the
murderer
when
did
i
say
so
i
was
in
moscow
when
have
i
said
so
ivan
faltered
helplessly
youve
said
so
to
yourself
many
times
when
youve
been
alone
during
these
two
dreadful
months
alyosha
went
on
softly
and
distinctly
as
before
yet
he
was
speaking
now
as
it
were
not
of
himself
not
of
his
own
will
but
obeying
some
irresistible
command
you
have
accused
yourself
and
have
confessed
to
yourself
that
you
are
the
murderer
and
no
one
else
but
you
didnt
do
it
you
are
mistaken
you
are
not
the
murderer
do
you
hear
it
was
not
you
god
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
so
they
were
both
silent
the
silence
lasted
a
whole
long
minute
they
were
both
standing
still
gazing
into
each
others
eyes
they
were
both
pale
suddenly
ivan
began
trembling
all
over
and
clutched
alyoshas
shoulder
youve
been
in
my
room
he
whispered
hoarsely
youve
been
there
at
night
when
he
came
confess

have
you
seen
him
have
you
seen
him
whom
do
you
meanmitya
alyosha
asked
bewildered
not
him
damn
the
monster
ivan
shouted
in
a
frenzy
do
you
know
that
he
visits
me
how
did
you
find
out
speak
who
is
he
i
dont
know
whom
you
are
talking
about
alyosha
faltered
beginning
to
be
alarmed
yes
you
do
know

or
how
could
you
its
impossible
that
you
dont
know
suddenly
he
seemed
to
check
himself
he
stood
still
and
seemed
to
reflect
a
strange
grin
contorted
his
lips
brother
alyosha
began
again
in
a
shaking
voice
i
have
said
this
to
you
because
youll
believe
my
word
i
know
that
i
tell
you
once
and
for
all
its
not
you
you
hear
once
for
all
god
has
put
it
into
my
heart
to
say
this
to
you
even
though
it
may
make
you
hate
me
from
this
hour
but
by
now
ivan
had
apparently
regained
his
selfcontrol
alexey
fyodorovitch
he
said
with
a
cold
smile
i
cant
endure
prophets
and
epilepticsmessengers
from
god
especiallyand
you
know
that
only
too
well
i
break
off
all
relations
with
you
from
this
moment
and
probably
for
ever
i
beg
you
to
leave
me
at
this
turning
its
the
way
to
your
lodgings
too
youd
better
be
particularly
careful
not
to
come
to
me
today
do
you
hear
he
turned
and
walked
on
with
a
firm
step
not
looking
back
brother
alyosha
called
after
him
if
anything
happens
to
you
today
turn
to
me
before
any
one
but
ivan
made
no
reply
alyosha
stood
under
the
lamppost
at
the
cross
roads
till
ivan
had
vanished
into
the
darkness
then
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
homewards
both
alyosha
and
ivan
were
living
in
lodgings
neither
of
them
was
willing
to
live
in
fyodor
pavlovitchs
empty
house
alyosha
had
a
furnished
room
in
the
house
of
some
working
people
ivan
lived
some
distance
from
him
he
had
taken
a
roomy
and
fairly
comfortable
lodge
attached
to
a
fine
house
that
belonged
to
a
welltodo
lady
the
widow
of
an
official
but
his
only
attendant
was
a
deaf
and
rheumatic
old
crone
who
went
to
bed
at
six
oclock
every
evening
and
got
up
at
six
in
the
morning
ivan
had
become
remarkably
indifferent
to
his
comforts
of
late
and
very
fond
of
being
alone
he
did
everything
for
himself
in
the
one
room
he
lived
in
and
rarely
entered
any
of
the
other
rooms
in
his
abode
he
reached
the
gate
of
the
house
and
had
his
hand
on
the
bell
when
he
suddenly
stopped
he
felt
that
he
was
trembling
all
over
with
anger
suddenly
he
let
go
of
the
bell
turned
back
with
a
curse
and
walked
with
rapid
steps
in
the
opposite
direction
he
walked
a
mile
and
a
half
to
a
tiny
slanting
wooden
house
almost
a
hut
where
marya
kondratyevna
the
neighbor
who
used
to
come
to
fyodor
pavlovitchs
kitchen
for
soup
and
to
whom
smerdyakov
had
once
sung
his
songs
and
played
on
the
guitar
was
now
lodging
she
had
sold
their
little
house
and
was
now
living
here
with
her
mother
smerdyakov
who
was
illalmost
dyinghad
been
with
them
ever
since
fyodor
pavlovitchs
death
it
was
to
him
ivan
was
going
now
drawn
by
a
sudden
and
irresistible
prompting
chapter
vi
the
first
interview
with
smerdyakov
this
was
the
third
time
that
ivan
had
been
to
see
smerdyakov
since
his
return
from
moscow
the
first
time
he
had
seen
him
and
talked
to
him
was
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
then
he
had
visited
him
once
more
a
fortnight
later
but
his
visits
had
ended
with
that
second
one
so
that
it
was
now
over
a
month
since
he
had
seen
him
and
he
had
scarcely
heard
anything
of
him
ivan
had
only
returned
five
days
after
his
fathers
death
so
that
he
was
not
present
at
the
funeral
which
took
place
the
day
before
he
came
back
the
cause
of
his
delay
was
that
alyosha
not
knowing
his
moscow
address
had
to
apply
to
katerina
ivanovna
to
telegraph
to
him
and
she
not
knowing
his
address
either
telegraphed
to
her
sister
and
aunt
reckoning
on
ivans
going
to
see
them
as
soon
as
he
arrived
in
moscow
but
he
did
not
go
to
them
till
four
days
after
his
arrival
when
he
got
the
telegram
he
had
of
course
set
off
posthaste
to
our
town
the
first
to
meet
him
was
alyosha
and
ivan
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
in
opposition
to
the
general
opinion
of
the
town
he
refused
to
entertain
a
suspicion
against
mitya
and
spoke
openly
of
smerdyakov
as
the
murderer
later
on
after
seeing
the
police
captain
and
the
prosecutor
and
hearing
the
details
of
the
charge
and
the
arrest
he
was
still
more
surprised
at
alyosha
and
ascribed
his
opinion
only
to
his
exaggerated
brotherly
feeling
and
sympathy
with
mitya
of
whom
alyosha
as
ivan
knew
was
very
fond
by
the
way
let
us
say
a
word
or
two
of
ivans
feeling
to
his
brother
dmitri
he
positively
disliked
him
at
most
felt
sometimes
a
compassion
for
him
and
even
that
was
mixed
with
great
contempt
almost
repugnance
mityas
whole
personality
even
his
appearance
was
extremely
unattractive
to
him
ivan
looked
with
indignation
on
katerina
ivanovnas
love
for
his
brother
yet
he
went
to
see
mitya
on
the
first
day
of
his
arrival
and
that
interview
far
from
shaking
ivans
belief
in
his
guilt
positively
strengthened
it
he
found
his
brother
agitated
nervously
excited
mitya
had
been
talkative
but
very
absentminded
and
incoherent
he
used
violent
language
accused
smerdyakov
and
was
fearfully
muddled
he
talked
principally
about
the
three
thousand
roubles
which
he
said
had
been
stolen
from
him
by
his
father
the
money
was
mine
it
was
my
money
mitya
kept
repeating
even
if
i
had
stolen
it
i
should
have
had
the
right
he
hardly
contested
the
evidence
against
him
and
if
he
tried
to
turn
a
fact
to
his
advantage
it
was
in
an
absurd
and
incoherent
way
he
hardly
seemed
to
wish
to
defend
himself
to
ivan
or
any
one
else
quite
the
contrary
he
was
angry
and
proudly
scornful
of
the
charges
against
him
he
was
continually
firing
up
and
abusing
every
one
he
only
laughed
contemptuously
at
grigorys
evidence
about
the
open
door
and
declared
that
it
was
the
devil
that
opened
it
but
he
could
not
bring
forward
any
coherent
explanation
of
the
fact
he
even
succeeded
in
insulting
ivan
during
their
first
interview
telling
him
sharply
that
it
was
not
for
people
who
declared
that
everything
was
lawful
to
suspect
and
question
him
altogether
he
was
anything
but
friendly
with
ivan
on
that
occasion
immediately
after
that
interview
with
mitya
ivan
went
for
the
first
time
to
see
smerdyakov
in
the
railway
train
on
his
way
from
moscow
he
kept
thinking
of
smerdyakov
and
of
his
last
conversation
with
him
on
the
evening
before
he
went
away
many
things
seemed
to
him
puzzling
and
suspicious
but
when
he
gave
his
evidence
to
the
investigating
lawyer
ivan
said
nothing
for
the
time
of
that
conversation
he
put
that
off
till
he
had
seen
smerdyakov
who
was
at
that
time
in
the
hospital
doctor
herzenstube
and
varvinsky
the
doctor
he
met
in
the
hospital
confidently
asserted
in
reply
to
ivans
persistent
questions
that
smerdyakovs
epileptic
attack
was
unmistakably
genuine
and
were
surprised
indeed
at
ivan
asking
whether
he
might
not
have
been
shamming
on
the
day
of
the
catastrophe
they
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
attack
was
an
exceptional
one
the
fits
persisting
and
recurring
several
times
so
that
the
patients
life
was
positively
in
danger
and
it
was
only
now
after
they
had
applied
remedies
that
they
could
assert
with
confidence
that
the
patient
would
survive
though
it
might
well
be
added
doctor
herzenstube
that
his
reason
would
be
impaired
for
a
considerable
period
if
not
permanently
on
ivans
asking
impatiently
whether
that
meant
that
he
was
now
mad
they
told
him
that
this
was
not
yet
the
case
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
but
that
certain
abnormalities
were
perceptible
ivan
decided
to
find
out
for
himself
what
those
abnormalities
were
at
the
hospital
he
was
at
once
allowed
to
see
the
patient
smerdyakov
was
lying
on
a
trucklebed
in
a
separate
ward
there
was
only
one
other
bed
in
the
room
and
in
it
lay
a
tradesman
of
the
town
swollen
with
dropsy
who
was
obviously
almost
dying
he
could
be
no
hindrance
to
their
conversation
smerdyakov
grinned
uncertainly
on
seeing
ivan
and
for
the
first
instant
seemed
nervous
so
at
least
ivan
fancied
but
that
was
only
momentary
for
the
rest
of
the
time
he
was
struck
on
the
contrary
by
smerdyakovs
composure
from
the
first
glance
ivan
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
very
ill
he
was
very
weak
he
spoke
slowly
seeming
to
move
his
tongue
with
difficulty
he
was
much
thinner
and
sallower
throughout
the
interview
which
lasted
twenty
minutes
he
kept
complaining
of
headache
and
of
pain
in
all
his
limbs
his
thin
emasculate
face
seemed
to
have
become
so
tiny
his
hair
was
ruffled
and
his
crest
of
curls
in
front
stood
up
in
a
thin
tuft
but
in
the
left
eye
which
was
screwed
up
and
seemed
to
be
insinuating
something
smerdyakov
showed
himself
unchanged
its
always
worth
while
speaking
to
a
clever
man
ivan
was
reminded
of
that
at
once
he
sat
down
on
the
stool
at
his
feet
smerdyakov
with
painful
effort
shifted
his
position
in
bed
but
he
was
not
the
first
to
speak
he
remained
dumb
and
did
not
even
look
much
interested
can
you
talk
to
me
asked
ivan
i
wont
tire
you
much
certainly
i
can
mumbled
smerdyakov
in
a
faint
voice
has
your
honor
been
back
long
he
added
patronizingly
as
though
encouraging
a
nervous
visitor
i
only
arrived
today
to
see
the
mess
you
are
in
here
smerdyakov
sighed
why
do
you
sigh
you
knew
of
it
all
along
ivan
blurted
out
smerdyakov
was
stolidly
silent
for
a
while
how
could
i
help
knowing
it
was
clear
beforehand
but
how
could
i
tell
it
would
turn
out
like
that
what
would
turn
out
dont
prevaricate
youve
foretold
youd
have
a
fit
on
the
way
down
to
the
cellar
you
know
you
mentioned
the
very
spot
have
you
said
so
at
the
examination
yet
smerdyakov
queried
with
composure
ivan
felt
suddenly
angry
no
i
havent
yet
but
i
certainly
shall
you
must
explain
a
great
deal
to
me
my
man
and
let
me
tell
you
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
play
with
me
why
should
i
play
with
you
when
i
put
my
whole
trust
in
you
as
in
god
almighty
said
smerdyakov
with
the
same
composure
only
for
a
moment
closing
his
eyes
in
the
first
place
began
ivan
i
know
that
epileptic
fits
cant
be
told
beforehand
ive
inquired
dont
try
and
take
me
in
you
cant
foretell
the
day
and
the
hour
how
was
it
you
told
me
the
day
and
the
hour
beforehand
and
about
the
cellar
too
how
could
you
tell
that
you
would
fall
down
the
cellar
stairs
in
a
fit
if
you
didnt
sham
a
fit
on
purpose
i
had
to
go
to
the
cellar
anyway
several
times
a
day
indeed
smerdyakov
drawled
deliberately
i
fell
from
the
garret
just
in
the
same
way
a
year
ago
its
quite
true
you
cant
tell
the
day
and
hour
of
a
fit
beforehand
but
you
can
always
have
a
presentiment
of
it
but
you
did
foretell
the
day
and
the
hour
in
regard
to
my
epilepsy
sir
you
had
much
better
inquire
of
the
doctors
here
you
can
ask
them
whether
it
was
a
real
fit
or
a
sham
its
no
use
my
saying
any
more
about
it
and
the
cellar
how
could
you
know
beforehand
of
the
cellar
you
dont
seem
able
to
get
over
that
cellar
as
i
was
going
down
to
the
cellar
i
was
in
terrible
dread
and
doubt
what
frightened
me
most
was
losing
you
and
being
left
without
defense
in
all
the
world
so
i
went
down
into
the
cellar
thinking
here
itll
come
on
directly
itll
strike
me
down
directly
shall
i
fall
and
it
was
through
this
fear
that
i
suddenly
felt
the
spasm
that
always
comes

and
so
i
went
flying
all
that
and
all
my
previous
conversation
with
you
at
the
gate
the
evening
before
when
i
told
you
how
frightened
i
was
and
spoke
of
the
cellar
i
told
all
that
to
doctor
herzenstube
and
nikolay
parfenovitch
the
investigating
lawyer
and
its
all
been
written
down
in
the
protocol
and
the
doctor
here
mr
varvinsky
maintained
to
all
of
them
that
it
was
just
the
thought
of
it
brought
it
on
the
apprehension
that
i
might
fall
it
was
just
then
that
the
fit
seized
me
and
so
theyve
written
it
down
that
its
just
how
it
must
have
happened
simply
from
my
fear
as
he
finished
smerdyakov
drew
a
deep
breath
as
though
exhausted
then
you
have
said
all
that
in
your
evidence
said
ivan
somewhat
taken
aback
he
had
meant
to
frighten
him
with
the
threat
of
repeating
their
conversation
and
it
appeared
that
smerdyakov
had
already
reported
it
all
himself
what
have
i
to
be
afraid
of
let
them
write
down
the
whole
truth
smerdyakov
pronounced
firmly
and
have
you
told
them
every
word
of
our
conversation
at
the
gate
no
not
to
say
every
word
and
did
you
tell
them
that
you
can
sham
fits
as
you
boasted
then
no
i
didnt
tell
them
that
either
tell
me
now
why
did
you
send
me
then
to
tchermashnya
i
was
afraid
youd
go
away
to
moscow
tchermashnya
is
nearer
anyway
you
are
lying
you
suggested
my
going
away
yourself
you
told
me
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
trouble
that
was
simply
out
of
affection
and
my
sincere
devotion
to
you
foreseeing
trouble
in
the
house
to
spare
you
only
i
wanted
to
spare
myself
even
more
thats
why
i
told
you
to
get
out
of
harms
way
that
you
might
understand
that
there
would
be
trouble
in
the
house
and
would
remain
at
home
to
protect
your
father
you
might
have
said
it
more
directly
you
blockhead
ivan
suddenly
fired
up
how
could
i
have
said
it
more
directly
then
it
was
simply
my
fear
that
made
me
speak
and
you
might
have
been
angry
too
i
might
well
have
been
apprehensive
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
would
make
a
scene
and
carry
away
that
money
for
he
considered
it
as
good
as
his
own
but
who
could
tell
that
it
would
end
in
a
murder
like
this
i
thought
that
he
would
only
carry
off
the
three
thousand
that
lay
under
the
masters
mattress
in
the
envelope
and
you
see
hes
murdered
him
how
could
you
guess
it
either
sir
but
if
you
say
yourself
that
it
couldnt
be
guessed
how
could
i
have
guessed
and
stayed
at
home
you
contradict
yourself
said
ivan
pondering
you
might
have
guessed
from
my
sending
you
to
tchermashnya
and
not
to
moscow
how
could
i
guess
it
from
that
smerdyakov
seemed
much
exhausted
and
again
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
you
might
have
guessed
from
the
fact
of
my
asking
you
not
to
go
to
moscow
but
to
tchermashnya
that
i
wanted
to
have
you
nearer
for
moscows
a
long
way
off
and
dmitri
fyodorovitch
knowing
you
are
not
far
off
would
not
be
so
bold
and
if
anything
had
happened
you
might
have
come
to
protect
me
too
for
i
warned
you
of
grigory
vassilyevitchs
illness
and
that
i
was
afraid
of
having
a
fit
and
when
i
explained
those
knocks
to
you
by
means
of
which
one
could
go
in
to
the
deceased
and
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
knew
them
all
through
me
i
thought
that
you
would
guess
yourself
that
he
would
be
sure
to
do
something
and
so
wouldnt
go
to
tchermashnya
even
but
would
stay
he
talks
very
coherently
thought
ivan
though
he
does
mumble
whats
the
derangement
of
his
faculties
that
herzenstube
talked
of
you
are
cunning
with
me
damn
you
he
exclaimed
getting
angry
but
i
thought
at
the
time
that
you
quite
guessed
smerdyakov
parried
with
the
simplest
air
if
id
guessed
i
should
have
stayed
cried
ivan
why
i
thought
that
it
was
because
you
guessed
that
you
went
away
in
such
a
hurry
only
to
get
out
of
trouble
only
to
run
away
and
save
yourself
in
your
fright
you
think
that
every
one
is
as
great
a
coward
as
yourself
forgive
me
i
thought
you
were
like
me
of
course
i
ought
to
have
guessed
ivan
said
in
agitation
and
i
did
guess
there
was
some
mischief
brewing
on
your
part

only
you
are
lying
you
are
lying
again
he
cried
suddenly
recollecting
do
you
remember
how
you
went
up
to
the
carriage
and
said
to
me
its
always
worth
while
speaking
to
a
clever
man
so
you
were
glad
i
went
away
since
you
praised
me
smerdyakov
sighed
again
and
again
a
trace
of
color
came
into
his
face
if
i
was
pleased
he
articulated
rather
breathlessly
it
was
simply
because
you
agreed
not
to
go
to
moscow
but
to
tchermashnya
for
it
was
nearer
anyway
only
when
i
said
these
words
to
you
it
was
not
by
way
of
praise
but
of
reproach
you
didnt
understand
it
what
reproach
why
that
foreseeing
such
a
calamity
you
deserted
your
own
father
and
would
not
protect
us
for
i
might
have
been
taken
up
any
time
for
stealing
that
three
thousand
damn
you
ivan
swore
again
stay
did
you
tell
the
prosecutor
and
the
investigating
lawyer
about
those
knocks
i
told
them
everything
just
as
it
was
ivan
wondered
inwardly
again
if
i
thought
of
anything
then
he
began
again
it
was
solely
of
some
wickedness
on
your
part
dmitri
might
kill
him
but
that
he
would
steali
did
not
believe
that
then
but
i
was
prepared
for
any
wickedness
from
you
you
told
me
yourself
you
could
sham
a
fit
what
did
you
say
that
for
it
was
just
through
my
simplicity
and
i
never
have
shammed
a
fit
on
purpose
in
my
life
and
i
only
said
so
then
to
boast
to
you
it
was
just
foolishness
i
liked
you
so
much
then
and
was
openhearted
with
you
my
brother
directly
accuses
you
of
the
murder
and
theft
what
else
is
left
for
him
to
do
said
smerdyakov
with
a
bitter
grin
and
who
will
believe
him
with
all
the
proofs
against
him
grigory
vassilyevitch
saw
the
door
open
what
can
he
say
after
that
but
never
mind
him
he
is
trembling
to
save
himself
he
slowly
ceased
speaking
then
suddenly
as
though
on
reflection
added
and
look
here
again
he
wants
to
throw
it
on
me
and
make
out
that
it
is
the
work
of
my
handsive
heard
that
already
but
as
to
my
being
clever
at
shamming
a
fit
should
i
have
told
you
beforehand
that
i
could
sham
one
if
i
really
had
had
such
a
design
against
your
father
if
i
had
been
planning
such
a
murder
could
i
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
give
such
evidence
against
myself
beforehand
and
to
his
son
too
upon
my
word
is
that
likely
as
if
that
could
be
such
a
thing
has
never
happened
no
one
hears
this
talk
of
ours
now
except
providence
itself
and
if
you
were
to
tell
of
it
to
the
prosecutor
and
nikolay
parfenovitch
you
might
defend
me
completely
by
doing
so
for
who
would
be
likely
to
be
such
a
criminal
if
he
is
so
openhearted
beforehand
any
one
can
see
that
well
and
ivan
got
up
to
cut
short
the
conversation
struck
by
smerdyakovs
last
argument
i
dont
suspect
you
at
all
and
i
think
its
absurd
indeed
to
suspect
you
on
the
contrary
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
setting
my
mind
at
rest
now
i
am
going
but
ill
come
again
meanwhile
goodby
get
well
is
there
anything
you
want
i
am
very
thankful
for
everything
marfa
ignatyevna
does
not
forget
me
and
provides
me
anything
i
want
according
to
her
kindness
good
people
visit
me
every
day
goodby
but
i
shant
say
anything
of
your
being
able
to
sham
a
fit
and
i
dont
advise
you
to
either
something
made
ivan
say
suddenly
i
quite
understand
and
if
you
dont
speak
of
that
i
shall
say
nothing
of
that
conversation
of
ours
at
the
gate
then
it
happened
that
ivan
went
out
and
only
when
he
had
gone
a
dozen
steps
along
the
corridor
he
suddenly
felt
that
there
was
an
insulting
significance
in
smerdyakovs
last
words
he
was
almost
on
the
point
of
turning
back
but
it
was
only
a
passing
impulse
and
muttering
nonsense
he
went
out
of
the
hospital
his
chief
feeling
was
one
of
relief
at
the
fact
that
it
was
not
smerdyakov
but
mitya
who
had
committed
the
murder
though
he
might
have
been
expected
to
feel
the
opposite
he
did
not
want
to
analyze
the
reason
for
this
feeling
and
even
felt
a
positive
repugnance
at
prying
into
his
sensations
he
felt
as
though
he
wanted
to
make
haste
to
forget
something
in
the
following
days
he
became
convinced
of
mityas
guilt
as
he
got
to
know
all
the
weight
of
evidence
against
him
there
was
evidence
of
people
of
no
importance
fenya
and
her
mother
for
instance
but
the
effect
of
it
was
almost
overpowering
as
to
perhotin
the
people
at
the
tavern
and
at
plotnikovs
shop
as
well
as
the
witnesses
at
mokroe
their
evidence
seemed
conclusive
it
was
the
details
that
were
so
damning
the
secret
of
the
knocks
impressed
the
lawyers
almost
as
much
as
grigorys
evidence
as
to
the
open
door
grigorys
wife
marfa
in
answer
to
ivans
questions
declared
that
smerdyakov
had
been
lying
all
night
the
other
side
of
the
partition
wall
he
was
not
three
paces
from
our
bed
and
that
although
she
was
a
sound
sleeper
she
waked
several
times
and
heard
him
moaning
he
was
moaning
the
whole
time
moaning
continually
talking
to
herzenstube
and
giving
it
as
his
opinion
that
smerdyakov
was
not
mad
but
only
rather
weak
ivan
only
evoked
from
the
old
man
a
subtle
smile
do
you
know
how
he
spends
his
time
now
he
asked
learning
lists
of
french
words
by
heart
he
has
an
exercisebook
under
his
pillow
with
the
french
words
written
out
in
russian
letters
for
him
by
some
one
he
he
he
ivan
ended
by
dismissing
all
doubts
he
could
not
think
of
dmitri
without
repulsion
only
one
thing
was
strange
however
alyosha
persisted
that
dmitri
was
not
the
murderer
and
that
in
all
probability
smerdyakov
was
ivan
always
felt
that
alyoshas
opinion
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
and
so
he
was
astonished
at
it
now
another
thing
that
was
strange
was
that
alyosha
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
talk
about
mitya
with
ivan
that
he
never
began
on
the
subject
and
only
answered
his
questions
this
too
struck
ivan
particularly
but
he
was
very
much
preoccupied
at
that
time
with
something
quite
apart
from
that
on
his
return
from
moscow
he
abandoned
himself
hopelessly
to
his
mad
and
consuming
passion
for
katerina
ivanovna
this
is
not
the
time
to
begin
to
speak
of
this
new
passion
of
ivans
which
left
its
mark
on
all
the
rest
of
his
life
this
would
furnish
the
subject
for
another
novel
which
i
may
perhaps
never
write
but
i
cannot
omit
to
mention
here
that
when
ivan
on
leaving
katerina
ivanovna
with
alyosha
as
ive
related
already
told
him
i
am
not
keen
on
her
it
was
an
absolute
lie
he
loved
her
madly
though
at
times
he
hated
her
so
that
he
might
have
murdered
her
many
causes
helped
to
bring
about
this
feeling
shattered
by
what
had
happened
with
mitya
she
rushed
on
ivans
return
to
meet
him
as
her
one
salvation
she
was
hurt
insulted
and
humiliated
in
her
feelings
and
here
the
man
had
come
back
to
her
who
had
loved
her
so
ardently
before
oh
she
knew
that
very
well
and
whose
heart
and
intellect
she
considered
so
superior
to
her
own
but
the
sternly
virtuous
girl
did
not
abandon
herself
altogether
to
the
man
she
loved
in
spite
of
the
karamazov
violence
of
his
passions
and
the
great
fascination
he
had
for
her
she
was
continually
tormented
at
the
same
time
by
remorse
for
having
deserted
mitya
and
in
moments
of
discord
and
violent
anger
and
they
were
numerous
she
told
ivan
so
plainly
this
was
what
he
had
called
to
alyosha
lies
upon
lies
there
was
of
course
much
that
was
false
in
it
and
that
angered
ivan
more
than
anything
but
of
all
this
later
he
did
in
fact
for
a
time
almost
forget
smerdyakovs
existence
and
yet
a
fortnight
after
his
first
visit
to
him
he
began
to
be
haunted
by
the
same
strange
thoughts
as
before
its
enough
to
say
that
he
was
continually
asking
himself
why
was
it
that
on
that
last
night
in
fyodor
pavlovitchs
house
he
had
crept
out
on
to
the
stairs
like
a
thief
and
listened
to
hear
what
his
father
was
doing
below
why
had
he
recalled
that
afterwards
with
repulsion
why
next
morning
had
he
been
suddenly
so
depressed
on
the
journey
why
as
he
reached
moscow
had
he
said
to
himself
i
am
a
scoundrel
and
now
he
almost
fancied
that
these
tormenting
thoughts
would
make
him
even
forget
katerina
ivanovna
so
completely
did
they
take
possession
of
him
again
it
was
just
after
fancying
this
that
he
met
alyosha
in
the
street
he
stopped
him
at
once
and
put
a
question
to
him
do
you
remember
when
dmitri
burst
in
after
dinner
and
beat
father
and
afterwards
i
told
you
in
the
yard
that
i
reserved
the
right
to
desire
tell
me
did
you
think
then
that
i
desired
fathers
death
or
not
i
did
think
so
answered
alyosha
softly
it
was
so
too
it
was
not
a
matter
of
guessing
but
didnt
you
fancy
then
that
what
i
wished
was
just
that
one
reptile
should
devour
another
that
is
just
that
dmitri
should
kill
father
and
as
soon
as
possible

and
that
i
myself
was
even
prepared
to
help
to
bring
that
about
alyosha
turned
rather
pale
and
looked
silently
into
his
brothers
face
speak
cried
ivan
i
want
above
everything
to
know
what
you
thought
then
i
want
the
truth
the
truth
he
drew
a
deep
breath
looking
angrily
at
alyosha
before
his
answer
came
forgive
me
i
did
think
that
too
at
the
time
whispered
alyosha
and
he
did
not
add
one
softening
phrase
thanks
snapped
ivan
and
leaving
alyosha
he
went
quickly
on
his
way
from
that
time
alyosha
noticed
that
ivan
began
obviously
to
avoid
him
and
seemed
even
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
him
so
much
so
that
alyosha
gave
up
going
to
see
him
immediately
after
that
meeting
with
him
ivan
had
not
gone
home
but
went
straight
to
smerdyakov
again
chapter
vii
the
second
visit
to
smerdyakov
by
that
time
smerdyakov
had
been
discharged
from
the
hospital
ivan
knew
his
new
lodging
the
dilapidated
little
wooden
house
divided
in
two
by
a
passage
on
one
side
of
which
lived
marya
kondratyevna
and
her
mother
and
on
the
other
smerdyakov
no
one
knew
on
what
terms
he
lived
with
them
whether
as
a
friend
or
as
a
lodger
it
was
supposed
afterwards
that
he
had
come
to
stay
with
them
as
marya
kondratyevnas
betrothed
and
was
living
there
for
a
time
without
paying
for
board
or
lodging
both
mother
and
daughter
had
the
greatest
respect
for
him
and
looked
upon
him
as
greatly
superior
to
themselves
ivan
knocked
and
on
the
door
being
opened
went
straight
into
the
passage
by
marya
kondratyevnas
directions
he
went
straight
to
the
better
room
on
the
left
occupied
by
smerdyakov
there
was
a
tiled
stove
in
the
room
and
it
was
extremely
hot
the
walls
were
gay
with
blue
paper
which
was
a
good
deal
used
however
and
in
the
cracks
under
it
cockroaches
swarmed
in
amazing
numbers
so
that
there
was
a
continual
rustling
from
them
the
furniture
was
very
scanty
two
benches
against
each
wall
and
two
chairs
by
the
table
the
table
of
plain
wood
was
covered
with
a
cloth
with
pink
patterns
on
it
there
was
a
pot
of
geranium
on
each
of
the
two
little
windows
in
the
corner
there
was
a
case
of
ikons
on
the
table
stood
a
little
copper
samovar
with
many
dents
in
it
and
a
tray
with
two
cups
but
smerdyakov
had
finished
tea
and
the
samovar
was
out
he
was
sitting
at
the
table
on
a
bench
he
was
looking
at
an
exercisebook
and
slowly
writing
with
a
pen
there
was
a
bottle
of
ink
by
him
and
a
flat
iron
candlestick
but
with
a
composite
candle
ivan
saw
at
once
from
smerdyakovs
face
that
he
had
completely
recovered
from
his
illness
his
face
was
fresher
fuller
his
hair
stood
up
jauntily
in
front
and
was
plastered
down
at
the
sides
he
was
sitting
in
a
particolored
wadded
dressinggown
rather
dirty
and
frayed
however
he
had
spectacles
on
his
nose
which
ivan
had
never
seen
him
wearing
before
this
trifling
circumstance
suddenly
redoubled
ivans
anger
a
creature
like
that
and
wearing
spectacles
smerdyakov
slowly
raised
his
head
and
looked
intently
at
his
visitor
through
his
spectacles
then
he
slowly
took
them
off
and
rose
from
the
bench
but
by
no
means
respectfully
almost
lazily
doing
the
least
possible
required
by
common
civility
all
this
struck
ivan
instantly
he
took
it
all
in
and
noted
it
at
oncemost
of
all
the
look
in
smerdyakovs
eyes
positively
malicious
churlish
and
haughty
what
do
you
want
to
intrude
for
it
seemed
to
say
we
settled
everything
then
why
have
you
come
again
ivan
could
scarcely
control
himself
its
hot
here
he
said
still
standing
and
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
take
off
your
coat
smerdyakov
conceded
ivan
took
off
his
coat
and
threw
it
on
a
bench
with
trembling
hands
he
took
a
chair
moved
it
quickly
to
the
table
and
sat
down
smerdyakov
managed
to
sit
down
on
his
bench
before
him
to
begin
with
are
we
alone
ivan
asked
sternly
and
impulsively
can
they
overhear
us
in
there
no
one
can
hear
anything
youve
seen
for
yourself
theres
a
passage
listen
my
good
fellow
what
was
that
you
babbled
as
i
was
leaving
the
hospital
that
if
i
said
nothing
about
your
faculty
of
shamming
fits
you
wouldnt
tell
the
investigating
lawyer
all
our
conversation
at
the
gate
what
do
you
mean
by
all
what
could
you
mean
by
it
were
you
threatening
me
have
i
entered
into
some
sort
of
compact
with
you
do
you
suppose
i
am
afraid
of
you
ivan
said
this
in
a
perfect
fury
giving
him
to
understand
with
obvious
intention
that
he
scorned
any
subterfuge
or
indirectness
and
meant
to
show
his
cards
smerdyakovs
eyes
gleamed
resentfully
his
left
eye
winked
and
he
at
once
gave
his
answer
with
his
habitual
composure
and
deliberation
you
want
to
have
everything
aboveboard
very
well
you
shall
have
it
he
seemed
to
say
this
is
what
i
meant
then
and
this
is
why
i
said
that
that
you
knowing
beforehand
of
this
murder
of
your
own
parent
left
him
to
his
fate
and
that
people
mightnt
after
that
conclude
any
evil
about
your
feelings
and
perhaps
of
something
else
toothats
what
i
promised
not
to
tell
the
authorities
though
smerdyakov
spoke
without
haste
and
obviously
controlling
himself
yet
there
was
something
in
his
voice
determined
and
emphatic
resentful
and
insolently
defiant
he
stared
impudently
at
ivan
a
mist
passed
before
ivans
eyes
for
the
first
moment
how
what
are
you
out
of
your
mind
im
perfectly
in
possession
of
all
my
faculties
do
you
suppose
i
knew
of
the
murder
ivan
cried
at
last
and
he
brought
his
fist
violently
on
the
table
what
do
you
mean
by
something
else
too
speak
scoundrel
smerdyakov
was
silent
and
still
scanned
ivan
with
the
same
insolent
stare
speak
you
stinking
rogue
what
is
that
something
else
too
the
something
else
i
meant
was
that
you
probably
too
were
very
desirous
of
your
parents
death
ivan
jumped
up
and
struck
him
with
all
his
might
on
the
shoulder
so
that
he
fell
back
against
the
wall
in
an
instant
his
face
was
bathed
in
tears
saying
its
a
shame
sir
to
strike
a
sick
man
he
dried
his
eyes
with
a
very
dirty
blue
check
handkerchief
and
sank
into
quiet
weeping
a
minute
passed
thats
enough
leave
off
ivan
said
peremptorily
sitting
down
again
dont
put
me
out
of
all
patience
smerdyakov
took
the
rag
from
his
eyes
every
line
of
his
puckered
face
reflected
the
insult
he
had
just
received
so
you
thought
then
you
scoundrel
that
together
with
dmitri
i
meant
to
kill
my
father
i
didnt
know
what
thoughts
were
in
your
mind
then
said
smerdyakov
resentfully
and
so
i
stopped
you
then
at
the
gate
to
sound
you
on
that
very
point
to
sound
what
what
why
that
very
circumstance
whether
you
wanted
your
father
to
be
murdered
or
not
what
infuriated
ivan
more
than
anything
was
the
aggressive
insolent
tone
to
which
smerdyakov
persistently
adhered
it
was
you
murdered
him
he
cried
suddenly
smerdyakov
smiled
contemptuously
you
know
of
yourself
for
a
fact
that
it
wasnt
i
murdered
him
and
i
should
have
thought
that
there
was
no
need
for
a
sensible
man
to
speak
of
it
again
but
why
why
had
you
such
a
suspicion
about
me
at
the
time
as
you
know
already
it
was
simply
from
fear
for
i
was
in
such
a
position
shaking
with
fear
that
i
suspected
every
one
i
resolved
to
sound
you
too
for
i
thought
if
you
wanted
the
same
as
your
brother
then
the
business
was
as
good
as
settled
and
i
should
be
crushed
like
a
fly
too
look
here
you
didnt
say
that
a
fortnight
ago
i
meant
the
same
when
i
talked
to
you
in
the
hospital
only
i
thought
youd
understand
without
wasting
words
and
that
being
such
a
sensible
man
you
wouldnt
care
to
talk
of
it
openly
what
next
come
answer
answer
i
insist
what
was
it

what
could
i
have
done
to
put
such
a
degrading
suspicion
into
your
mean
soul
as
for
the
murder
you
couldnt
have
done
that
and
didnt
want
to
but
as
for
wanting
some
one
else
to
do
it
that
was
just
what
you
did
want
and
how
coolly
how
coolly
he
speaks
but
why
should
i
have
wanted
it
what
grounds
had
i
for
wanting
it
what
grounds
had
you
what
about
the
inheritance
said
smerdyakov
sarcastically
and
as
it
were
vindictively
why
after
your
parents
death
there
was
at
least
forty
thousand
to
come
to
each
of
you
and
very
likely
more
but
if
fyodor
pavlovitch
got
married
then
to
that
lady
agrafena
alexandrovna
she
would
have
had
all
his
capital
made
over
to
her
directly
after
the
wedding
for
shes
plenty
of
sense
so
that
your
parent
would
not
have
left
you
two
roubles
between
the
three
of
you
and
were
they
far
from
a
wedding
either
not
a
hairsbreadth
that
lady
had
only
to
lift
her
little
finger
and
he
would
have
run
after
her
to
church
with
his
tongue
out
ivan
restrained
himself
with
painful
effort
very
good
he
commented
at
last
you
see
i
havent
jumped
up
i
havent
knocked
you
down
i
havent
killed
you
speak
on
so
according
to
you
i
had
fixed
on
dmitri
to
do
it
i
was
reckoning
on
him
how
could
you
help
reckoning
on
him
if
he
killed
him
then
he
would
lose
all
the
rights
of
a
nobleman
his
rank
and
property
and
would
go
off
to
exile
so
his
share
of
the
inheritance
would
come
to
you
and
your
brother
alexey
fyodorovitch
in
equal
parts
so
youd
each
have
not
forty
but
sixty
thousand
each
theres
not
a
doubt
you
did
reckon
on
dmitri
fyodorovitch
what
i
put
up
with
from
you
listen
scoundrel
if
i
had
reckoned
on
any
one
then
it
would
have
been
on
you
not
on
dmitri
and
i
swear
i
did
expect
some
wickedness
from
you

at
the
time
i
remember
my
impression
i
thought
too
for
a
minute
at
the
time
that
you
were
reckoning
on
me
as
well
said
smerdyakov
with
a
sarcastic
grin
so
that
it
was
just
by
that
more
than
anything
you
showed
me
what
was
in
your
mind
for
if
you
had
a
foreboding
about
me
and
yet
went
away
you
as
good
as
said
to
me
you
can
murder
my
parent
i
wont
hinder
you

you
scoundrel
so
thats
how
you
understood
it
it
was
all
that
going
to
tchermashnya
why
you
were
meaning
to
go
to
moscow
and
refused
all
your
fathers
entreaties
to
go
to
tchermashnyaand
simply
at
a
foolish
word
from
me
you
consented
at
once
what
reason
had
you
to
consent
to
tchermashnya
since
you
went
to
tchermashnya
with
no
reason
simply
at
my
word
it
shows
that
you
must
have
expected
something
from
me
no
i
swear
i
didnt
shouted
ivan
grinding
his
teeth
you
didnt
then
you
ought
as
your
fathers
son
to
have
had
me
taken
to
the
lockup
and
thrashed
at
once
for
my
words
then

or
at
least
to
have
given
me
a
punch
in
the
face
on
the
spot
but
you
were
not
a
bit
angry
if
you
please
and
at
once
in
a
friendly
way
acted
on
my
foolish
word
and
went
away
which
was
utterly
absurd
for
you
ought
to
have
stayed
to
save
your
parents
life
how
could
i
help
drawing
my
conclusions
ivan
sat
scowling
both
his
fists
convulsively
pressed
on
his
knees
yes
i
am
sorry
i
didnt
punch
you
in
the
face
he
said
with
a
bitter
smile
i
couldnt
have
taken
you
to
the
lockup
just
then
who
would
have
believed
me
and
what
charge
could
i
bring
against
you
but
the
punch
in
the
face

oh
im
sorry
i
didnt
think
of
it
though
blows
are
forbidden
i
should
have
pounded
your
ugly
face
to
a
jelly
smerdyakov
looked
at
him
almost
with
relish
in
the
ordinary
occasions
of
life
he
said
in
the
same
complacent
and
sententious
tone
in
which
he
had
taunted
grigory
and
argued
with
him
about
religion
at
fyodor
pavlovitchs
table
in
the
ordinary
occasions
of
life
blows
on
the
face
are
forbidden
nowadays
by
law
and
people
have
given
them
up
but
in
exceptional
occasions
of
life
people
still
fly
to
blows
not
only
among
us
but
all
over
the
world
be
it
even
the
fullest
republic
of
france
just
as
in
the
time
of
adam
and
eve
and
they
never
will
leave
off
but
you
even
in
an
exceptional
case
did
not
dare
what
are
you
learning
french
words
for
ivan
nodded
towards
the
exercisebook
lying
on
the
table
why
shouldnt
i
learn
them
so
as
to
improve
my
education
supposing
that
i
may
myself
chance
to
go
some
day
to
those
happy
parts
of
europe
listen
monster
ivans
eyes
flashed
and
he
trembled
all
over
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
accusations
you
can
say
what
you
like
about
me
and
if
i
dont
beat
you
to
death
its
simply
because
i
suspect
you
of
that
crime
and
ill
drag
you
to
justice
ill
unmask
you
to
my
thinking
youd
better
keep
quiet
for
what
can
you
accuse
me
of
considering
my
absolute
innocence
and
who
would
believe
you
only
if
you
begin
i
shall
tell
everything
too
for
i
must
defend
myself
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
you
now
if
the
court
doesnt
believe
all
ive
said
to
you
just
now
the
public
will
and
you
will
be
ashamed
thats
as
much
as
to
say
its
always
worth
while
speaking
to
a
sensible
man
eh
snarled
ivan
you
hit
the
mark
indeed
and
youd
better
be
sensible
ivan
got
up
shaking
all
over
with
indignation
put
on
his
coat
and
without
replying
further
to
smerdyakov
without
even
looking
at
him
walked
quickly
out
of
the
cottage
the
cool
evening
air
refreshed
him
there
was
a
bright
moon
in
the
sky
a
nightmare
of
ideas
and
sensations
filled
his
soul
shall
i
go
at
once
and
give
information
against
smerdyakov
but
what
information
can
i
give
he
is
not
guilty
anyway
on
the
contrary
hell
accuse
me
and
in
fact
why
did
i
set
off
for
tchermashnya
then
what
for
what
for
ivan
asked
himself
yes
of
course
i
was
expecting
something
and
he
is
right
and
he
remembered
for
the
hundredth
time
how
on
the
last
night
in
his
fathers
house
he
had
listened
on
the
stairs
but
he
remembered
it
now
with
such
anguish
that
he
stood
still
on
the
spot
as
though
he
had
been
stabbed
yes
i
expected
it
then
thats
true
i
wanted
the
murder
i
did
want
the
murder
did
i
want
the
murder
did
i
want
it
i
must
kill
smerdyakov
if
i
dont
dare
kill
smerdyakov
now
life
is
not
worth
living
ivan
did
not
go
home
but
went
straight
to
katerina
ivanovna
and
alarmed
her
by
his
appearance
he
was
like
a
madman
he
repeated
all
his
conversation
with
smerdyakov
every
syllable
of
it
he
couldnt
be
calmed
however
much
she
tried
to
soothe
him
he
kept
walking
about
the
room
speaking
strangely
disconnectedly
at
last
he
sat
down
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
and
pronounced
this
strange
sentence
if
its
not
dmitri
but
smerdyakov
whos
the
murderer
i
share
his
guilt
for
i
put
him
up
to
it
whether
i
did
i
dont
know
yet
but
if
he
is
the
murderer
and
not
dmitri
then
of
course
i
am
the
murderer
too
when
katerina
ivanovna
heard
that
she
got
up
from
her
seat
without
a
word
went
to
her
writingtable
opened
a
box
standing
on
it
took
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
laid
it
before
ivan
this
was
the
document
of
which
ivan
spoke
to
alyosha
later
on
as
a
conclusive
proof
that
dmitri
had
killed
his
father
it
was
the
letter
written
by
mitya
to
katerina
ivanovna
when
he
was
drunk
on
the
very
evening
he
met
alyosha
at
the
crossroads
on
the
way
to
the
monastery
after
the
scene
at
katerina
ivanovnas
when
grushenka
had
insulted
her
then
parting
from
alyosha
mitya
had
rushed
to
grushenka
i
dont
know
whether
he
saw
her
but
in
the
evening
he
was
at
the
metropolis
where
he
got
thoroughly
drunk
then
he
asked
for
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
a
document
of
weighty
consequences
to
himself
it
was
a
wordy
disconnected
frantic
letter
a
drunken
letter
in
fact
it
was
like
the
talk
of
a
drunken
man
who
on
his
return
home
begins
with
extraordinary
heat
telling
his
wife
or
one
of
his
household
how
he
has
just
been
insulted
what
a
rascal
had
just
insulted
him
what
a
fine
fellow
he
is
on
the
other
hand
and
how
he
will
pay
that
scoundrel
out
and
all
that
at
great
length
with
great
excitement
and
incoherence
with
drunken
tears
and
blows
on
the
table
the
letter
was
written
on
a
dirty
piece
of
ordinary
paper
of
the
cheapest
kind
it
had
been
provided
by
the
tavern
and
there
were
figures
scrawled
on
the
back
of
it
there
was
evidently
not
space
enough
for
his
drunken
verbosity
and
mitya
not
only
filled
the
margins
but
had
written
the
last
line
right
across
the
rest
the
letter
ran
as
follows
fatal
katya
tomorrow
i
will
get
the
money
and
repay
your
three
thousand

d
karamazov
when
ivan
read
this
document
he
was
convinced
so
then
it
was
his
brother
not
smerdyakov
and
if
not
smerdyakov
then
not
he
ivan
this
letter
at
once
assumed
in
his
eyes
the
aspect
of
a
logical
proof
there
could
be
no
longer
the
slightest
doubt
of
mityas
guilt
the
suspicion
never
occurred
to
ivan
by
the
way
that
mitya
might
have
committed
the
murder
in
conjunction
with
smerdyakov
and
indeed
such
a
theory
did
not
fit
in
with
the
facts
ivan
was
completely
reassured
the
next
morning
he
only
thought
of
smerdyakov
and
his
gibes
with
contempt
a
few
days
later
he
positively
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
so
horribly
distressed
at
his
suspicions
he
resolved
to
dismiss
him
with
contempt
and
forget
him
so
passed
a
month
he
made
no
further
inquiry
about
smerdyakov
but
twice
he
happened
to
hear
that
he
was
very
ill
and
out
of
his
mind
hell
end
in
madness
the
young
doctor
varvinsky
observed
about
him
and
ivan
remembered
this
during
the
last
week
of
that
month
ivan
himself
began
to
feel
very
ill
he
went
to
consult
the
moscow
doctor
who
had
been
sent
for
by
katerina
ivanovna
just
before
the
trial
and
just
at
that
time
his
relations
with
katerina
ivanovna
became
acutely
strained
they
were
like
two
enemies
in
love
with
one
another
katerina
ivanovnas
returns
to
mitya
that
is
her
brief
but
violent
revulsions
of
feeling
in
his
favor
drove
ivan
to
perfect
frenzy
strange
to
say
until
that
last
scene
described
above
when
alyosha
came
from
mitya
to
katerina
ivanovna
ivan
had
never
once
during
that
month
heard
her
express
a
doubt
of
mityas
guilt
in
spite
of
those
returns
that
were
so
hateful
to
him
it
is
remarkable
too
that
while
he
felt
that
he
hated
mitya
more
and
more
every
day
he
realized
that
it
was
not
on
account
of
katyas
returns
that
he
hated
him
but
just
because
he
was
the
murderer
of
his
father
he
was
conscious
of
this
and
fully
recognized
it
to
himself
nevertheless
he
went
to
see
mitya
ten
days
before
the
trial
and
proposed
to
him
a
plan
of
escapea
plan
he
had
obviously
thought
over
a
long
time
he
was
partly
impelled
to
do
this
by
a
sore
place
still
left
in
his
heart
from
a
phrase
of
smerdyakovs
that
it
was
to
his
ivans
advantage
that
his
brother
should
be
convicted
as
that
would
increase
his
inheritance
and
alyoshas
from
forty
to
sixty
thousand
roubles
he
determined
to
sacrifice
thirty
thousand
on
arranging
mityas
escape
on
his
return
from
seeing
him
he
was
very
mournful
and
dispirited
he
suddenly
began
to
feel
that
he
was
anxious
for
mityas
escape
not
only
to
heal
that
sore
place
by
sacrificing
thirty
thousand
but
for
another
reason
is
it
because
i
am
as
much
a
murderer
at
heart
he
asked
himself
something
very
deep
down
seemed
burning
and
rankling
in
his
soul
his
pride
above
all
suffered
cruelly
all
that
month
but
of
that
later
when
after
his
conversation
with
alyosha
ivan
suddenly
decided
with
his
hand
on
the
bell
of
his
lodging
to
go
to
smerdyakov
he
obeyed
a
sudden
and
peculiar
impulse
of
indignation
he
suddenly
remembered
how
katerina
ivanovna
had
only
just
cried
out
to
him
in
alyoshas
presence
it
was
you
you
persuaded
me
of
his
that
is
mityas
guilt
ivan
was
thunderstruck
when
he
recalled
it
he
had
never
once
tried
to
persuade
her
that
mitya
was
the
murderer
on
the
contrary
he
had
suspected
himself
in
her
presence
that
time
when
he
came
back
from
smerdyakov
it
was
she
she
who
had
produced
that
document
and
proved
his
brothers
guilt
and
now
she
suddenly
exclaimed
ive
been
at
smerdyakovs
myself
when
had
she
been
there
ivan
had
known
nothing
of
it
so
she
was
not
at
all
so
sure
of
mityas
guilt
and
what
could
smerdyakov
have
told
her
what
what
had
he
said
to
her
his
heart
burned
with
violent
anger
he
could
not
understand
how
he
could
half
an
hour
before
have
let
those
words
pass
and
not
have
cried
out
at
the
moment
he
let
go
of
the
bell
and
rushed
off
to
smerdyakov
i
shall
kill
him
perhaps
this
time
he
thought
on
the
way
chapter
viii
the
third
and
last
interview
with
smerdyakov
when
he
was
halfway
there
the
keen
dry
wind
that
had
been
blowing
early
that
morning
rose
again
and
a
fine
dry
snow
began
falling
thickly
it
did
not
lie
on
the
ground
but
was
whirled
about
by
the
wind
and
soon
there
was
a
regular
snowstorm
there
were
scarcely
any
lampposts
in
the
part
of
the
town
where
smerdyakov
lived
ivan
strode
alone
in
the
darkness
unconscious
of
the
storm
instinctively
picking
out
his
way
his
head
ached
and
there
was
a
painful
throbbing
in
his
temples
he
felt
that
his
hands
were
twitching
convulsively
not
far
from
marya
kondratyevnas
cottage
ivan
suddenly
came
upon
a
solitary
drunken
little
peasant
he
was
wearing
a
coarse
and
patched
coat
and
was
walking
in
zigzags
grumbling
and
swearing
to
himself
then
suddenly
he
would
begin
singing
in
a
husky
drunken
voice
ach
vankas
gone
to
petersburg
i
wont
wait
till
he
comes
back
but
he
broke
off
every
time
at
the
second
line
and
began
swearing
again
then
he
would
begin
the
same
song
again
ivan
felt
an
intense
hatred
for
him
before
he
had
thought
about
him
at
all
suddenly
he
realized
his
presence
and
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
knock
him
down
at
that
moment
they
met
and
the
peasant
with
a
violent
lurch
fell
full
tilt
against
ivan
who
pushed
him
back
furiously
the
peasant
went
flying
backwards
and
fell
like
a
log
on
the
frozen
ground
he
uttered
one
plaintive
ooh
and
then
was
silent
ivan
stepped
up
to
him
he
was
lying
on
his
back
without
movement
or
consciousness
he
will
be
frozen
thought
ivan
and
he
went
on
his
way
to
smerdyakovs
in
the
passage
marya
kondratyevna
who
ran
out
to
open
the
door
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
whispered
that
smerdyakov
was
very
ill
its
not
that
hes
laid
up
but
he
seems
not
himself
and
he
even
told
us
to
take
the
tea
away
he
wouldnt
have
any
why
does
he
make
a
row
asked
ivan
coarsely
oh
dear
no
quite
the
contrary
hes
very
quiet
only
please
dont
talk
to
him
too
long
marya
kondratyevna
begged
him
ivan
opened
the
door
and
stepped
into
the
room
it
was
overheated
as
before
but
there
were
changes
in
the
room
one
of
the
benches
at
the
side
had
been
removed
and
in
its
place
had
been
put
a
large
old
mahogany
leather
sofa
on
which
a
bed
had
been
made
up
with
fairly
clean
white
pillows
smerdyakov
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
wearing
the
same
dressinggown
the
table
had
been
brought
out
in
front
of
the
sofa
so
that
there
was
hardly
room
to
move
on
the
table
lay
a
thick
book
in
yellow
cover
but
smerdyakov
was
not
reading
it
he
seemed
to
be
sitting
doing
nothing
he
met
ivan
with
a
slow
silent
gaze
and
was
apparently
not
at
all
surprised
at
his
coming
there
was
a
great
change
in
his
face
he
was
much
thinner
and
sallower
his
eyes
were
sunken
and
there
were
blue
marks
under
them
why
you
really
are
ill
ivan
stopped
short
i
wont
keep
you
long
i
wont
even
take
off
my
coat
where
can
one
sit
down
he
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
moved
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
on
it
why
do
you
look
at
me
without
speaking
ive
only
come
with
one
question
and
i
swear
i
wont
go
without
an
answer
has
the
young
lady
katerina
ivanovna
been
with
you
smerdyakov
still
remained
silent
looking
quietly
at
ivan
as
before
suddenly
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
he
turned
his
face
away
whats
the
matter
with
you
cried
ivan
nothing
what
do
you
mean
by
nothing
yes
she
has
its
no
matter
to
you
let
me
alone
no
i
wont
let
you
alone
tell
me
when
was
she
here
why
id
quite
forgotten
about
her
said
smerdyakov
with
a
scornful
smile
and
turning
his
face
to
ivan
again
he
stared
at
him
with
a
look
of
frenzied
hatred
the
same
look
that
he
had
fixed
on
him
at
their
last
interview
a
month
before
you
seem
very
ill
yourself
your
face
is
sunken
you
dont
look
like
yourself
he
said
to
ivan
never
mind
my
health
tell
me
what
i
ask
you
but
why
are
your
eyes
so
yellow
the
whites
are
quite
yellow
are
you
so
worried
he
smiled
contemptuously
and
suddenly
laughed
outright
listen
ive
told
you
i
wont
go
away
without
an
answer
ivan
cried
intensely
irritated
why
do
you
keep
pestering
me
why
do
you
torment
me
said
smerdyakov
with
a
look
of
suffering
damn
it
ive
nothing
to
do
with
you
just
answer
my
question
and
ill
go
away
ive
no
answer
to
give
you
said
smerdyakov
looking
down
again
you
may
be
sure
ill
make
you
answer
why
are
you
so
uneasy
smerdyakov
stared
at
him
not
simply
with
contempt
but
almost
with
repulsion
is
this
because
the
trial
begins
to
morrow
nothing
will
happen
to
you
cant
you
believe
that
at
last
go
home
go
to
bed
and
sleep
in
peace
dont
be
afraid
of
anything
i
dont
understand
you
what
have
i
to
be
afraid
of
tomorrow
ivan
articulated
in
astonishment
and
suddenly
a
chill
breath
of
fear
did
in
fact
pass
over
his
soul
smerdyakov
measured
him
with
his
eyes
you
dont
understand
he
drawled
reproachfully
its
a
strange
thing
a
sensible
man
should
care
to
play
such
a
farce
ivan
looked
at
him
speechless
the
startling
incredibly
supercilious
tone
of
this
man
who
had
once
been
his
valet
was
extraordinary
in
itself
he
had
not
taken
such
a
tone
even
at
their
last
interview
i
tell
you
youve
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
wont
say
anything
about
you
theres
no
proof
against
you
i
say
how
your
hands
are
trembling
why
are
your
fingers
moving
like
that
go
home
you
did
not
murder
him
ivan
started
he
remembered
alyosha
i
know
it
was
not
i
he
faltered
do
you
smerdyakov
caught
him
up
again
ivan
jumped
up
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
tell
me
everything
you
viper
tell
me
everything
smerdyakov
was
not
in
the
least
scared
he
only
riveted
his
eyes
on
ivan
with
insane
hatred
well
it
was
you
who
murdered
him
if
thats
it
he
whispered
furiously
ivan
sank
back
on
his
chair
as
though
pondering
something
he
laughed
malignantly
you
mean
my
going
away
what
you
talked
about
last
time
you
stood
before
me
last
time
and
understood
it
all
and
you
understand
it
now
all
i
understand
is
that
you
are
mad
arent
you
tired
of
it
here
we
are
face
to
face
whats
the
use
of
going
on
keeping
up
a
farce
to
each
other
are
you
still
trying
to
throw
it
all
on
me
to
my
face
you
murdered
him
you
are
the
real
murderer
i
was
only
your
instrument
your
faithful
servant
and
it
was
following
your
words
i
did
it
did
it
why
did
you
murder
him
ivan
turned
cold
something
seemed
to
give
way
in
his
brain
and
he
shuddered
all
over
with
a
cold
shiver
then
smerdyakov
himself
looked
at
him
wonderingly
probably
the
genuineness
of
ivans
horror
struck
him
you
dont
mean
to
say
you
really
did
not
know
he
faltered
mistrustfully
looking
with
a
forced
smile
into
his
eyes
ivan
still
gazed
at
him
and
seemed
unable
to
speak
ach
vankas
gone
to
petersburg
i
wont
wait
till
he
comes
back
suddenly
echoed
in
his
head
do
you
know
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
a
dream
a
phantom
sitting
before
me
he
muttered
theres
no
phantom
here
but
only
us
two
and
one
other
no
doubt
he
is
here
that
third
between
us
who
is
he
who
is
here
what
third
person
ivan
cried
in
alarm
looking
about
him
his
eyes
hastily
searching
in
every
corner
that
third
is
god
himselfprovidence
he
is
the
third
beside
us
now
only
dont
look
for
him
you
wont
find
him
its
a
lie
that
you
killed
him
ivan
cried
madly
you
are
mad
or
teasing
me
again
smerdyakov
as
before
watched
him
curiously
with
no
sign
of
fear
he
could
still
scarcely
get
over
his
incredulity
he
still
fancied
that
ivan
knew
everything
and
was
trying
to
throw
it
all
on
him
to
his
face
wait
a
minute
he
said
at
last
in
a
weak
voice
and
suddenly
bringing
up
his
left
leg
from
under
the
table
he
began
turning
up
his
trouser
leg
he
was
wearing
long
white
stockings
and
slippers
slowly
he
took
off
his
garter
and
fumbled
to
the
bottom
of
his
stocking
ivan
gazed
at
him
and
suddenly
shuddered
in
a
paroxysm
of
terror
hes
mad
he
cried
and
rapidly
jumping
up
he
drew
back
so
that
he
knocked
his
back
against
the
wall
and
stood
up
against
it
stiff
and
straight
he
looked
with
insane
terror
at
smerdyakov
who
entirely
unaffected
by
his
terror
continued
fumbling
in
his
stocking
as
though
he
were
making
an
effort
to
get
hold
of
something
with
his
fingers
and
pull
it
out
at
last
he
got
hold
of
it
and
began
pulling
it
out
ivan
saw
that
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
or
perhaps
a
roll
of
papers
smerdyakov
pulled
it
out
and
laid
it
on
the
table
here
he
said
quietly
what
is
it
asked
ivan
trembling
kindly
look
at
it
smerdyakov
answered
still
in
the
same
low
tone
ivan
stepped
up
to
the
table
took
up
the
roll
of
paper
and
began
unfolding
it
but
suddenly
he
drew
back
his
fingers
as
though
from
contact
with
a
loathsome
reptile
your
hands
keep
twitching
observed
smerdyakov
and
he
deliberately
unfolded
the
bundle
himself
under
the
wrapper
were
three
packets
of
hundredrouble
notes
they
are
all
here
all
the
three
thousand
roubles
you
need
not
count
them
take
them
smerdyakov
suggested
to
ivan
nodding
at
the
notes
ivan
sank
back
in
his
chair
he
was
as
white
as
a
handkerchief
you
frightened
me

with
your
stocking
he
said
with
a
strange
grin
can
you
really
not
have
known
till
now
smerdyakov
asked
once
more
no
i
did
not
know
i
kept
thinking
of
dmitri
brother
brother
ach
he
suddenly
clutched
his
head
in
both
hands
listen
did
you
kill
him
alone
with
my
brothers
help
or
without
it
was
only
with
you
with
your
help
i
killed
him
and
dmitri
fyodorovitch
is
quite
innocent
all
right
all
right
talk
about
me
later
why
do
i
keep
on
trembling
i
cant
speak
properly
you
were
bold
enough
then
you
said
everything
was
lawful
and
how
frightened
you
are
now
smerdyakov
muttered
in
surprise
wont
you
have
some
lemonade
ill
ask
for
some
at
once
its
very
refreshing
only
i
must
hide
this
first
and
again
he
motioned
at
the
notes
he
was
just
going
to
get
up
and
call
at
the
door
to
marya
kondratyevna
to
make
some
lemonade
and
bring
it
them
but
looking
for
something
to
cover
up
the
notes
that
she
might
not
see
them
he
first
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
as
it
turned
out
to
be
very
dirty
took
up
the
big
yellow
book
that
ivan
had
noticed
at
first
lying
on
the
table
and
put
it
over
the
notes
the
book
was
the
sayings
of
the
holy
father
isaac
the
syrian
ivan
read
it
mechanically
i
wont
have
any
lemonade
he
said
talk
of
me
later
sit
down
and
tell
me
how
you
did
it
tell
me
all
about
it
youd
better
take
off
your
greatcoat
or
youll
be
too
hot
ivan
as
though
hed
only
just
thought
of
it
took
off
his
coat
and
without
getting
up
from
his
chair
threw
it
on
the
bench
speak
please
speak
he
seemed
calmer
he
waited
feeling
sure
that
smerdyakov
would
tell
him
all
about
it
how
it
was
done
sighed
smerdyakov
it
was
done
in
a
most
natural
way
following
your
very
words
of
my
words
later
ivan
broke
in
again
apparently
with
complete
self
possession
firmly
uttering
his
words
and
not
shouting
as
before
only
tell
me
in
detail
how
you
did
it
everything
as
it
happened
dont
forget
anything
the
details
above
everything
the
details
i
beg
you
youd
gone
away
then
i
fell
into
the
cellar
in
a
fit
or
in
a
sham
one
a
sham
one
naturally
i
shammed
it
all
i
went
quietly
down
the
steps
to
the
very
bottom
and
lay
down
quietly
and
as
i
lay
down
i
gave
a
scream
and
struggled
till
they
carried
me
out
stay
and
were
you
shamming
all
along
afterwards
and
in
the
hospital
no
not
at
all
next
day
in
the
morning
before
they
took
me
to
the
hospital
i
had
a
real
attack
and
a
more
violent
one
than
ive
had
for
years
for
two
days
i
was
quite
unconscious
all
right
all
right
go
on
they
laid
me
on
the
bed
i
knew
id
be
the
other
side
of
the
partition
for
whenever
i
was
ill
marfa
ignatyevna
used
to
put
me
there
near
them
shes
always
been
very
kind
to
me
from
my
birth
up
at
night
i
moaned
but
quietly
i
kept
expecting
dmitri
fyodorovitch
to
come
expecting
him
to
come
to
you
not
to
me
i
expected
him
to
come
into
the
house
for
id
no
doubt
that
hed
come
that
night
for
being
without
me
and
getting
no
news
hed
be
sure
to
come
and
climb
over
the
fence
as
he
used
to
and
do
something
and
if
he
hadnt
come
then
nothing
would
have
happened
i
should
never
have
brought
myself
to
it
without
him
all
right
all
right

speak
more
intelligibly
dont
hurry
above
all
dont
leave
anything
out
i
expected
him
to
kill
fyodor
pavlovitch
i
thought
that
was
certain
for
i
had
prepared
him
for
it

during
the
last
few
days
he
knew
about
the
knocks
that
was
the
chief
thing
with
his
suspiciousness
and
the
fury
which
had
been
growing
in
him
all
those
days
he
was
bound
to
get
into
the
house
by
means
of
those
taps
that
was
inevitable
so
i
was
expecting
him
stay
ivan
interrupted
if
he
had
killed
him
he
would
have
taken
the
money
and
carried
it
away
you
must
have
considered
that
what
would
you
have
got
by
it
afterwards
i
dont
see
but
he
would
never
have
found
the
money
that
was
only
what
i
told
him
that
the
money
was
under
the
mattress
but
that
wasnt
true
it
had
been
lying
in
a
box
and
afterwards
i
suggested
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
as
i
was
the
only
person
he
trusted
to
hide
the
envelope
with
the
notes
in
the
corner
behind
the
ikons
for
no
one
would
have
guessed
that
place
especially
if
they
came
in
a
hurry
so
thats
where
the
envelope
lay
in
the
corner
behind
the
ikons
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
keep
it
under
the
mattress
the
box
anyway
could
be
locked
but
all
believe
it
was
under
the
mattress
a
stupid
thing
to
believe
so
if
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
committed
the
murder
finding
nothing
he
would
either
have
run
away
in
a
hurry
afraid
of
every
sound
as
always
happens
with
murderers
or
he
would
have
been
arrested
so
i
could
always
have
clambered
up
to
the
ikons
and
have
taken
away
the
money
next
morning
or
even
that
night
and
it
would
have
all
been
put
down
to
dmitri
fyodorovitch
i
could
reckon
upon
that
but
what
if
he
did
not
kill
him
but
only
knocked
him
down
if
he
did
not
kill
him
of
course
i
would
not
have
ventured
to
take
the
money
and
nothing
would
have
happened
but
i
calculated
that
he
would
beat
him
senseless
and
i
should
have
time
to
take
it
then
and
then
id
make
out
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
that
it
was
no
one
but
dmitri
fyodorovitch
who
had
taken
the
money
after
beating
him
stop

i
am
getting
mixed
then
it
was
dmitri
after
all
who
killed
him
you
only
took
the
money
no
he
didnt
kill
him
well
i
might
as
well
have
told
you
now
that
he
was
the
murderer
but
i
dont
want
to
lie
to
you
now
because

because
if
you
really
havent
understood
till
now
as
i
see
for
myself
and
are
not
pretending
so
as
to
throw
your
guilt
on
me
to
my
very
face
you
are
still
responsible
for
it
all
since
you
knew
of
the
murder
and
charged
me
to
do
it
and
went
away
knowing
all
about
it
and
so
i
want
to
prove
to
your
face
this
evening
that
you
are
the
only
real
murderer
in
the
whole
affair
and
i
am
not
the
real
murderer
though
i
did
kill
him
you
are
the
rightful
murderer
why
why
am
i
a
murderer
oh
god
ivan
cried
unable
to
restrain
himself
at
last
and
forgetting
that
he
had
put
off
discussing
himself
till
the
end
of
the
conversation
you
still
mean
that
tchermashnya
stay
tell
me
why
did
you
want
my
consent
if
you
really
took
tchermashnya
for
consent
how
will
you
explain
that
now
assured
of
your
consent
i
should
have
known
that
you
wouldnt
have
made
an
outcry
over
those
three
thousand
being
lost
even
if
id
been
suspected
instead
of
dmitri
fyodorovitch
or
as
his
accomplice
on
the
contrary
you
would
have
protected
me
from
others
and
when
you
got
your
inheritance
you
would
have
rewarded
me
when
you
were
able
all
the
rest
of
your
life
for
youd
have
received
your
inheritance
through
me
seeing
that
if
he
had
married
agrafena
alexandrovna
you
wouldnt
have
had
a
farthing
ah
then
you
intended
to
worry
me
all
my
life
afterwards
snarled
ivan
and
what
if
i
hadnt
gone
away
then
but
had
informed
against
you
what
could
you
have
informed
that
i
persuaded
you
to
go
to
tchermashnya
thats
all
nonsense
besides
after
our
conversation
you
would
either
have
gone
away
or
have
stayed
if
you
had
stayed
nothing
would
have
happened
i
should
have
known
that
you
didnt
want
it
done
and
should
have
attempted
nothing
as
you
went
away
it
meant
you
assured
me
that
you
wouldnt
dare
to
inform
against
me
at
the
trial
and
that
youd
overlook
my
having
the
three
thousand
and
indeed
you
couldnt
have
prosecuted
me
afterwards
because
then
i
should
have
told
it
all
in
the
court
that
is
not
that
i
had
stolen
the
money
or
killed
himi
shouldnt
have
said
thatbut
that
youd
put
me
up
to
the
theft
and
the
murder
though
i
didnt
consent
to
it
thats
why
i
needed
your
consent
so
that
you
couldnt
have
cornered
me
afterwards
for
what
proof
could
you
have
had
i
could
always
have
cornered
you
revealing
your
eagerness
for
your
fathers
death
and
i
tell
you
the
public
would
have
believed
it
all
and
you
would
have
been
ashamed
for
the
rest
of
your
life
was
i
then
so
eager
was
i
ivan
snarled
again
to
be
sure
you
were
and
by
your
consent
you
silently
sanctioned
my
doing
it
smerdyakov
looked
resolutely
at
ivan
he
was
very
weak
and
spoke
slowly
and
wearily
but
some
hidden
inner
force
urged
him
on
he
evidently
had
some
design
ivan
felt
that
go
on
he
said
tell
me
what
happened
that
night
what
more
is
there
to
tell
i
lay
there
and
i
thought
i
heard
the
master
shout
and
before
that
grigory
vassilyevitch
had
suddenly
got
up
and
came
out
and
he
suddenly
gave
a
scream
and
then
all
was
silence
and
darkness
i
lay
there
waiting
my
heart
beating
i
couldnt
bear
it
i
got
up
at
last
went
out
i
saw
the
window
open
on
the
left
into
the
garden
and
i
stepped
to
the
left
to
listen
whether
he
was
sitting
there
alive
and
i
heard
the
master
moving
about
sighing
so
i
knew
he
was
alive
ech
i
thought
i
went
to
the
window
and
shouted
to
the
master
its
i
and
he
shouted
to
me
hes
been
hes
been
hes
run
away
he
meant
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
been
hes
killed
grigory
where
i
whispered
there
in
the
corner
he
pointed
he
was
whispering
too
wait
a
bit
i
said
i
went
to
the
corner
of
the
garden
to
look
and
there
i
came
upon
grigory
vassilyevitch
lying
by
the
wall
covered
with
blood
senseless
so
its
true
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
has
been
here
was
the
thought
that
came
into
my
head
and
i
determined
on
the
spot
to
make
an
end
of
it
as
grigory
vassilyevitch
even
if
he
were
alive
would
see
nothing
of
it
as
he
lay
there
senseless
the
only
risk
was
that
marfa
ignatyevna
might
wake
up
i
felt
that
at
the
moment
but
the
longing
to
get
it
done
came
over
me
till
i
could
scarcely
breathe
i
went
back
to
the
window
to
the
master
and
said
shes
here
shes
come
agrafena
alexandrovna
has
come
wants
to
be
let
in
and
he
started
like
a
baby
where
is
she
he
fairly
gasped
but
couldnt
believe
it
shes
standing
there
said
i
open
he
looked
out
of
the
window
at
me
half
believing
and
half
distrustful
but
afraid
to
open
why
he
is
afraid
of
me
now
i
thought
and
it
was
funny
i
bethought
me
to
knock
on
the
windowframe
those
taps
wed
agreed
upon
as
a
signal
that
grushenka
had
come
in
his
presence
before
his
eyes
he
didnt
seem
to
believe
my
word
but
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
taps
he
ran
at
once
to
open
the
door
he
opened
it
i
would
have
gone
in
but
he
stood
in
the
way
to
prevent
me
passing
where
is
she
where
is
she
he
looked
at
me
all
of
a
tremble
well
thought
i
if
hes
so
frightened
of
me
as
all
that
its
a
bad
look
out
and
my
legs
went
weak
with
fright
that
he
wouldnt
let
me
in
or
would
call
out
or
marfa
ignatyevna
would
run
up
or
something
else
might
happen
i
dont
remember
now
but
i
must
have
stood
pale
facing
him
i
whispered
to
him
why
shes
there
there
under
the
window
how
is
it
you
dont
see
her
i
said
bring
her
then
bring
her
shes
afraid
said
i
she
was
frightened
at
the
noise
shes
hidden
in
the
bushes
go
and
call
to
her
yourself
from
the
study
he
ran
to
the
window
put
the
candle
in
the
window
grushenka
he
cried
grushenka
are
you
here
though
he
cried
that
he
didnt
want
to
lean
out
of
the
window
he
didnt
want
to
move
away
from
me
for
he
was
panicstricken
he
was
so
frightened
he
didnt
dare
to
turn
his
back
on
me
why
here
she
is
said
i
i
went
up
to
the
window
and
leaned
right
out
of
it
here
she
is
shes
in
the
bush
laughing
at
you
dont
you
see
her
he
suddenly
believed
it
he
was
all
of
a
shakehe
was
awfully
crazy
about
herand
he
leaned
right
out
of
the
window
i
snatched
up
that
iron
paperweight
from
his
table
do
you
remember
weighing
about
three
pounds
i
swung
it
and
hit
him
on
the
top
of
the
skull
with
the
corner
of
it
he
didnt
even
cry
out
he
only
sank
down
suddenly
and
i
hit
him
again
and
a
third
time
and
the
third
time
i
knew
id
broken
his
skull
he
suddenly
rolled
on
his
back
face
upwards
covered
with
blood
i
looked
round
there
was
no
blood
on
me
not
a
spot
i
wiped
the
paperweight
put
it
back
went
up
to
the
ikons
took
the
money
out
of
the
envelope
and
flung
the
envelope
on
the
floor
and
the
pink
ribbon
beside
it
i
went
out
into
the
garden
all
of
a
tremble
straight
to
the
appletree
with
a
hollow
in
ityou
know
that
hollow
id
marked
it
long
before
and
put
a
rag
and
a
piece
of
paper
ready
in
it
i
wrapped
all
the
notes
in
the
rag
and
stuffed
it
deep
down
in
the
hole
and
there
it
stayed
for
over
a
fortnight
i
took
it
out
later
when
i
came
out
of
the
hospital
i
went
back
to
my
bed
lay
down
and
thought
if
grigory
vassilyevitch
has
been
killed
outright
it
may
be
a
bad
job
for
me
but
if
he
is
not
killed
and
recovers
it
will
be
firstrate
for
then
hell
bear
witness
that
dmitri
fyodorovitch
has
been
here
and
so
he
must
have
killed
him
and
taken
the
money
then
i
began
groaning
with
suspense
and
impatience
so
as
to
wake
marfa
ignatyevna
as
soon
as
possible
at
last
she
got
up
and
she
rushed
to
me
but
when
she
saw
grigory
vassilyevitch
was
not
there
she
ran
out
and
i
heard
her
scream
in
the
garden
and
that
set
it
all
going
and
set
my
mind
at
rest
he
stopped
ivan
had
listened
all
the
time
in
dead
silence
without
stirring
or
taking
his
eyes
off
him
as
he
told
his
story
smerdyakov
glanced
at
him
from
time
to
time
but
for
the
most
part
kept
his
eyes
averted
when
he
had
finished
he
was
evidently
agitated
and
was
breathing
hard
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
face
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
it
was
remorse
he
was
feeling
or
what
stay
cried
ivan
pondering
what
about
the
door
if
he
only
opened
the
door
to
you
how
could
grigory
have
seen
it
open
before
for
grigory
saw
it
before
you
went
it
was
remarkable
that
ivan
spoke
quite
amicably
in
a
different
tone
not
angry
as
before
so
if
any
one
had
opened
the
door
at
that
moment
and
peeped
in
at
them
he
would
certainly
have
concluded
that
they
were
talking
peaceably
about
some
ordinary
though
interesting
subject
as
for
that
door
and
grigory
vassilyevitchs
having
seen
it
open
thats
only
his
fancy
said
smerdyakov
with
a
wry
smile
he
is
not
a
man
i
assure
you
but
an
obstinate
mule
he
didnt
see
it
but
fancied
he
had
seen
it
and
theres
no
shaking
him
its
just
our
luck
he
took
that
notion
into
his
head
for
they
cant
fail
to
convict
dmitri
fyodorovitch
after
that
listen

said
ivan
beginning
to
seem
bewildered
again
and
making
an
effort
to
grasp
something
listen
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
i
want
to
ask
you
but
i
forget
them

i
keep
forgetting
and
getting
mixed
up
yes
tell
me
this
at
least
why
did
you
open
the
envelope
and
leave
it
there
on
the
floor
why
didnt
you
simply
carry
off
the
envelope
when
you
were
telling
me
i
thought
you
spoke
about
it
as
though
it
were
the
right
thing
to
do

but
why
i
cant
understand
i
did
that
for
a
good
reason
for
if
a
man
had
known
all
about
it
as
i
did
for
instance
if
hed
seen
those
notes
before
and
perhaps
had
put
them
in
that
envelope
himself
and
had
seen
the
envelope
sealed
up
and
addressed
with
his
own
eyes
if
such
a
man
had
done
the
murder
what
should
have
made
him
tear
open
the
envelope
afterwards
especially
in
such
desperate
haste
since
hed
know
for
certain
the
notes
must
be
in
the
envelope
no
if
the
robber
had
been
some
one
like
me
hed
simply
have
put
the
envelope
straight
in
his
pocket
and
got
away
with
it
as
fast
as
he
could
but
itd
be
quite
different
with
dmitri
fyodorovitch
he
only
knew
about
the
envelope
by
hearsay
he
had
never
seen
it
and
if
hed
found
it
for
instance
under
the
mattress
hed
have
torn
it
open
as
quickly
as
possible
to
make
sure
the
notes
were
in
it
and
hed
have
thrown
the
envelope
down
without
having
time
to
think
that
it
would
be
evidence
against
him
because
he
was
not
an
habitual
thief
and
had
never
directly
stolen
anything
before
for
he
is
a
gentleman
born
and
if
he
did
bring
himself
to
steal
it
would
not
be
regular
stealing
but
simply
taking
what
was
his
own
for
hed
told
the
whole
town
he
meant
to
before
and
had
even
bragged
aloud
before
every
one
that
hed
go
and
take
his
property
from
fyodor
pavlovitch
i
didnt
say
that
openly
to
the
prosecutor
when
i
was
being
examined
but
quite
the
contrary
i
brought
him
to
it
by
a
hint
as
though
i
didnt
see
it
myself
and
as
though
hed
thought
of
it
himself
and
i
hadnt
prompted
him
so
that
mr
prosecutors
mouth
positively
watered
at
my
suggestion
but
can
you
possibly
have
thought
of
all
that
on
the
spot
cried
ivan
overcome
with
astonishment
he
looked
at
smerdyakov
again
with
alarm
mercy
on
us
could
any
one
think
of
it
all
in
such
a
desperate
hurry
it
was
all
thought
out
beforehand
well

well
it
was
the
devil
helped
you
ivan
cried
again
no
you
are
not
a
fool
you
are
far
cleverer
than
i
thought
he
got
up
obviously
intending
to
walk
across
the
room
he
was
in
terrible
distress
but
as
the
table
blocked
his
way
and
there
was
hardly
room
to
pass
between
the
table
and
the
wall
he
only
turned
round
where
he
stood
and
sat
down
again
perhaps
the
impossibility
of
moving
irritated
him
as
he
suddenly
cried
out
almost
as
furiously
as
before
listen
you
miserable
contemptible
creature
dont
you
understand
that
if
i
havent
killed
you
its
simply
because
i
am
keeping
you
to
answer
tomorrow
at
the
trial
god
sees
ivan
raised
his
hand
perhaps
i
too
was
guilty
perhaps
i
really
had
a
secret
desire
for
my
fathers

death
but
i
swear
i
was
not
as
guilty
as
you
think
and
perhaps
i
didnt
urge
you
on
at
all
no
no
i
didnt
urge
you
on
but
no
matter
i
will
give
evidence
against
myself
tomorrow
at
the
trial
im
determined
to
i
shall
tell
everything
everything
but
well
make
our
appearance
together
and
whatever
you
may
say
against
me
at
the
trial
whatever
evidence
you
give
ill
face
it
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
ill
confirm
it
all
myself
but
you
must
confess
too
you
must
you
must
well
go
together
thats
how
it
shall
be
ivan
said
this
solemnly
and
resolutely
and
from
his
flashing
eyes
alone
it
could
be
seen
that
it
would
be
so
you
are
ill
i
see
you
are
quite
ill
your
eyes
are
yellow
smerdyakov
commented
without
the
least
irony
with
apparent
sympathy
in
fact
well
go
together
ivan
repeated
and
if
you
wont
go
no
matter
ill
go
alone
smerdyakov
paused
as
though
pondering
therell
be
nothing
of
the
sort
and
you
wont
go
he
concluded
at
last
positively
you
dont
understand
me
ivan
exclaimed
reproachfully
youll
be
too
much
ashamed
if
you
confess
it
all
and
whats
more
it
will
be
no
use
at
all
for
i
shall
say
straight
out
that
i
never
said
anything
of
the
sort
to
you
and
that
you
are
either
ill
and
it
looks
like
it
too
or
that
youre
so
sorry
for
your
brother
that
you
are
sacrificing
yourself
to
save
him
and
have
invented
it
all
against
me
for
youve
always
thought
no
more
of
me
than
if
id
been
a
fly
and
who
will
believe
you
and
what
single
proof
have
you
got
listen
you
showed
me
those
notes
just
now
to
convince
me
smerdyakov
lifted
the
book
off
the
notes
and
laid
it
on
one
side
take
that
money
away
with
you
smerdyakov
sighed
of
course
i
shall
take
it
but
why
do
you
give
it
to
me
if
you
committed
the
murder
for
the
sake
of
it
ivan
looked
at
him
with
great
surprise
i
dont
want
it
smerdyakov
articulated
in
a
shaking
voice
with
a
gesture
of
refusal
i
did
have
an
idea
of
beginning
a
new
life
with
that
money
in
moscow
or
better
still
abroad
i
did
dream
of
it
chiefly
because
all
things
are
lawful
that
was
quite
right
what
you
taught
me
for
you
talked
a
lot
to
me
about
that
for
if
theres
no
everlasting
god
theres
no
such
thing
as
virtue
and
theres
no
need
of
it
you
were
right
there
so
thats
how
i
looked
at
it
did
you
come
to
that
of
yourself
asked
ivan
with
a
wry
smile
with
your
guidance
and
now
i
suppose
you
believe
in
god
since
you
are
giving
back
the
money
no
i
dont
believe
whispered
smerdyakov
then
why
are
you
giving
it
back
leave
off

thats
enough
smerdyakov
waved
his
hand
again
you
used
to
say
yourself
that
everything
was
lawful
so
now
why
are
you
so
upset
too
you
even
want
to
go
and
give
evidence
against
yourself
only
therell
be
nothing
of
the
sort
you
wont
go
to
give
evidence
smerdyakov
decided
with
conviction
youll
see
said
ivan
it
isnt
possible
you
are
very
clever
you
are
fond
of
money
i
know
that
you
like
to
be
respected
too
for
youre
very
proud
you
are
far
too
fond
of
female
charms
too
and
you
mind
most
of
all
about
living
in
undisturbed
comfort
without
having
to
depend
on
any
onethats
what
you
care
most
about
you
wont
want
to
spoil
your
life
for
ever
by
taking
such
a
disgrace
on
yourself
you
are
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
you
are
more
like
him
than
any
of
his
children
youve
the
same
soul
as
he
had
you
are
not
a
fool
said
ivan
seeming
struck
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
you
are
serious
now
he
observed
looking
suddenly
at
smerdyakov
with
a
different
expression
it
was
your
pride
made
you
think
i
was
a
fool
take
the
money
ivan
took
the
three
rolls
of
notes
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
without
wrapping
them
in
anything
i
shall
show
them
at
the
court
tomorrow
he
said
nobody
will
believe
you
as
youve
plenty
of
money
of
your
own
you
may
simply
have
taken
it
out
of
your
cashbox
and
brought
it
to
the
court
ivan
rose
from
his
seat
i
repeat
he
said
the
only
reason
i
havent
killed
you
is
that
i
need
you
for
tomorrow
remember
that
dont
forget
it
well
kill
me
kill
me
now
smerdyakov
said
all
at
once
looking
strangely
at
ivan
you
wont
dare
do
that
even
he
added
with
a
bitter
smile
you
wont
dare
to
do
anything
you
who
used
to
be
so
bold
till
tomorrow
cried
ivan
and
moved
to
go
out
stay
a
moment
show
me
those
notes
again
ivan
took
out
the
notes
and
showed
them
to
him
smerdyakov
looked
at
them
for
ten
seconds
well
you
can
go
he
said
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
ivan
fyodorovitch
he
called
after
him
again
what
do
you
want
ivan
turned
without
stopping
goodby
till
tomorrow
ivan
cried
again
and
he
walked
out
of
the
cottage
the
snowstorm
was
still
raging
he
walked
the
first
few
steps
boldly
but
suddenly
began
staggering
its
something
physical
he
thought
with
a
grin
something
like
joy
was
springing
up
in
his
heart
he
was
conscious
of
unbounded
resolution
he
would
make
an
end
of
the
wavering
that
had
so
tortured
him
of
late
his
determination
was
taken
and
now
it
will
not
be
changed
he
thought
with
relief
at
that
moment
he
stumbled
against
something
and
almost
fell
down
stopping
short
he
made
out
at
his
feet
the
peasant
he
had
knocked
down
still
lying
senseless
and
motionless
the
snow
had
almost
covered
his
face
ivan
seized
him
and
lifted
him
in
his
arms
seeing
a
light
in
the
little
house
to
the
right
he
went
up
knocked
at
the
shutters
and
asked
the
man
to
whom
the
house
belonged
to
help
him
carry
the
peasant
to
the
policestation
promising
him
three
roubles
the
man
got
ready
and
came
out
i
wont
describe
in
detail
how
ivan
succeeded
in
his
object
bringing
the
peasant
to
the
policestation
and
arranging
for
a
doctor
to
see
him
at
once
providing
with
a
liberal
hand
for
the
expenses
i
will
only
say
that
this
business
took
a
whole
hour
but
ivan
was
well
content
with
it
his
mind
wandered
and
worked
incessantly
if
i
had
not
taken
my
decision
so
firmly
for
tomorrow
he
reflected
with
satisfaction
i
should
not
have
stayed
a
whole
hour
to
look
after
the
peasant
but
should
have
passed
by
without
caring
about
his
being
frozen
i
am
quite
capable
of
watching
myself
by
the
way
he
thought
at
the
same
instant
with
still
greater
satisfaction
although
they
have
decided
that
i
am
going
out
of
my
mind
just
as
he
reached
his
own
house
he
stopped
short
asking
himself
suddenly
hadnt
he
better
go
at
once
to
the
prosecutor
and
tell
him
everything
he
decided
the
question
by
turning
back
to
the
house
everything
together
tomorrow
he
whispered
to
himself
and
strange
to
say
almost
all
his
gladness
and
selfsatisfaction
passed
in
one
instant
as
he
entered
his
own
room
he
felt
something
like
a
touch
of
ice
on
his
heart
like
a
recollection
or
more
exactly
a
reminder
of
something
agonizing
and
revolting
that
was
in
that
room
now
at
that
moment
and
had
been
there
before
he
sank
wearily
on
his
sofa
the
old
woman
brought
him
a
samovar
he
made
tea
but
did
not
touch
it
he
sat
on
the
sofa
and
felt
giddy
he
felt
that
he
was
ill
and
helpless
he
was
beginning
to
drop
asleep
but
got
up
uneasily
and
walked
across
the
room
to
shake
off
his
drowsiness
at
moments
he
fancied
he
was
delirious
but
it
was
not
illness
that
he
thought
of
most
sitting
down
again
he
began
looking
round
as
though
searching
for
something
this
happened
several
times
at
last
his
eyes
were
fastened
intently
on
one
point
ivan
smiled
but
an
angry
flush
suffused
his
face
he
sat
a
long
time
in
his
place
his
head
propped
on
both
arms
though
he
looked
sideways
at
the
same
point
at
the
sofa
that
stood
against
the
opposite
wall
there
was
evidently
something
some
object
that
irritated
him
there
worried
him
and
tormented
him
chapter
ix
the
devil
ivans
nightmare
i
am
not
a
doctor
but
yet
i
feel
that
the
moment
has
come
when
i
must
inevitably
give
the
reader
some
account
of
the
nature
of
ivans
illness
anticipating
events
i
can
say
at
least
one
thing
he
was
at
that
moment
on
the
very
eve
of
an
attack
of
brain
fever
though
his
health
had
long
been
affected
it
had
offered
a
stubborn
resistance
to
the
fever
which
in
the
end
gained
complete
mastery
over
it
though
i
know
nothing
of
medicine
i
venture
to
hazard
the
suggestion
that
he
really
had
perhaps
by
a
terrible
effort
of
will
succeeded
in
delaying
the
attack
for
a
time
hoping
of
course
to
check
it
completely
he
knew
that
he
was
unwell
but
he
loathed
the
thought
of
being
ill
at
that
fatal
time
at
the
approaching
crisis
in
his
life
when
he
needed
to
have
all
his
wits
about
him
to
say
what
he
had
to
say
boldly
and
resolutely
and
to
justify
himself
to
himself
he
had
however
consulted
the
new
doctor
who
had
been
brought
from
moscow
by
a
fantastic
notion
of
katerina
ivanovnas
to
which
i
have
referred
already
after
listening
to
him
and
examining
him
the
doctor
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
actually
suffering
from
some
disorder
of
the
brain
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
by
an
admission
which
ivan
had
reluctantly
made
him
hallucinations
are
quite
likely
in
your
condition
the
doctor
opined
though
it
would
be
better
to
verify
them

you
must
take
steps
at
once
without
a
moments
delay
or
things
will
go
badly
with
you
but
ivan
did
not
follow
this
judicious
advice
and
did
not
take
to
his
bed
to
be
nursed
i
am
walking
about
so
i
am
strong
enough
if
i
drop
itll
be
different
then
any
one
may
nurse
me
who
likes
he
decided
dismissing
the
subject
and
so
he
was
sitting
almost
conscious
himself
of
his
delirium
and
as
i
have
said
already
looking
persistently
at
some
object
on
the
sofa
against
the
opposite
wall
some
one
appeared
to
be
sitting
there
though
goodness
knows
how
he
had
come
in
for
he
had
not
been
in
the
room
when
ivan
came
into
it
on
his
return
from
smerdyakov
this
was
a
person
or
more
accurately
speaking
a
russian
gentleman
of
a
particular
kind
no
longer
young
qui
faisait
la
cinquantaine
as
the
french
say
with
rather
long
still
thick
dark
hair
slightly
streaked
with
gray
and
a
small
pointed
beard
he
was
wearing
a
brownish
reefer
jacket
rather
shabby
evidently
made
by
a
good
tailor
though
and
of
a
fashion
at
least
three
years
old
that
had
been
discarded
by
smart
and
welltodo
people
for
the
last
two
years
his
linen
and
his
long
scarflike
necktie
were
all
such
as
are
worn
by
people
who
aim
at
being
stylish
but
on
closer
inspection
his
linen
was
not
overclean
and
his
wide
scarf
was
very
threadbare
the
visitors
check
trousers
were
of
excellent
cut
but
were
too
light
in
color
and
too
tight
for
the
present
fashion
his
soft
fluffy
white
hat
was
out
of
keeping
with
the
season
in
brief
there
was
every
appearance
of
gentility
on
straitened
means
it
looked
as
though
the
gentleman
belonged
to
that
class
of
idle
landowners
who
used
to
flourish
in
the
times
of
serfdom
he
had
unmistakably
been
at
some
time
in
good
and
fashionable
society
had
once
had
good
connections
had
possibly
preserved
them
indeed
but
after
a
gay
youth
becoming
gradually
impoverished
on
the
abolition
of
serfdom
he
had
sunk
into
the
position
of
a
poor
relation
of
the
best
class
wandering
from
one
good
old
friend
to
another
and
received
by
them
for
his
companionable
and
accommodating
disposition
and
as
being
after
all
a
gentleman
who
could
be
asked
to
sit
down
with
any
one
though
of
course
not
in
a
place
of
honor
such
gentlemen
of
accommodating
temper
and
dependent
position
who
can
tell
a
story
take
a
hand
at
cards
and
who
have
a
distinct
aversion
for
any
duties
that
may
be
forced
upon
them
are
usually
solitary
creatures
either
bachelors
or
widowers
sometimes
they
have
children
but
if
so
the
children
are
always
being
brought
up
at
a
distance
at
some
aunts
to
whom
these
gentlemen
never
allude
in
good
society
seeming
ashamed
of
the
relationship
they
gradually
lose
sight
of
their
children
altogether
though
at
intervals
they
receive
a
birthday
or
christmas
letter
from
them
and
sometimes
even
answer
it
the
countenance
of
the
unexpected
visitor
was
not
so
much
goodnatured
as
accommodating
and
ready
to
assume
any
amiable
expression
as
occasion
might
arise
he
had
no
watch
but
he
had
a
tortoiseshell
lorgnette
on
a
black
ribbon
on
the
middle
finger
of
his
right
hand
was
a
massive
gold
ring
with
a
cheap
opal
stone
in
it
ivan
was
angrily
silent
and
would
not
begin
the
conversation
the
visitor
waited
and
sat
exactly
like
a
poor
relation
who
had
come
down
from
his
room
to
keep
his
host
company
at
tea
and
was
discreetly
silent
seeing
that
his
host
was
frowning
and
preoccupied
but
he
was
ready
for
any
affable
conversation
as
soon
as
his
host
should
begin
it
all
at
once
his
face
expressed
a
sudden
solicitude
i
say
he
began
to
ivan
excuse
me
i
only
mention
it
to
remind
you
you
went
to
smerdyakovs
to
find
out
about
katerina
ivanovna
but
you
came
away
without
finding
out
anything
about
her
you
probably
forgot
ah
yes
broke
from
ivan
and
his
face
grew
gloomy
with
uneasiness
yes
id
forgotten

but
it
doesnt
matter
now
never
mind
till
tomorrow
he
muttered
to
himself
and
you
he
added
addressing
his
visitor
i
should
have
remembered
that
myself
in
a
minute
for
that
was
just
what
was
tormenting
me
why
do
you
interfere
as
if
i
should
believe
that
you
prompted
me
and
that
i
didnt
remember
it
of
myself
dont
believe
it
then
said
the
gentleman
smiling
amicably
whats
the
good
of
believing
against
your
will
besides
proofs
are
no
help
to
believing
especially
material
proofs
thomas
believed
not
because
he
saw
christ
risen
but
because
he
wanted
to
believe
before
he
saw
look
at
the
spiritualists
for
instance
i
am
very
fond
of
them

only
fancy
they
imagine
that
they
are
serving
the
cause
of
religion
because
the
devils
show
them
their
horns
from
the
other
world
that
they
say
is
a
material
proof
so
to
speak
of
the
existence
of
another
world
the
other
world
and
material
proofs
what
next
and
if
you
come
to
that
does
proving
theres
a
devil
prove
that
theres
a
god
i
want
to
join
an
idealist
society
ill
lead
the
opposition
in
it
ill
say
i
am
a
realist
but
not
a
materialist
he
he
listen
ivan
suddenly
got
up
from
the
table
i
seem
to
be
delirious
i
am
delirious
in
fact
talk
any
nonsense
you
like
i
dont
care
you
wont
drive
me
to
fury
as
you
did
last
time
but
i
feel
somehow
ashamed
i
want
to
walk
about
the
room
i
sometimes
dont
see
you
and
dont
even
hear
your
voice
as
i
did
last
time
but
i
always
guess
what
you
are
prating
for
its
i
i
myself
speaking
not
you
only
i
dont
know
whether
i
was
dreaming
last
time
or
whether
i
really
saw
you
ill
wet
a
towel
and
put
it
on
my
head
and
perhaps
youll
vanish
into
air
ivan
went
into
the
corner
took
a
towel
and
did
as
he
said
and
with
a
wet
towel
on
his
head
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
i
am
so
glad
you
treat
me
so
familiarly
the
visitor
began
fool
laughed
ivan
do
you
suppose
i
should
stand
on
ceremony
with
you
i
am
in
good
spirits
now
though
ive
a
pain
in
my
forehead

and
in
the
top
of
my
head

only
please
dont
talk
philosophy
as
you
did
last
time
if
you
cant
take
yourself
off
talk
of
something
amusing
talk
gossip
you
are
a
poor
relation
you
ought
to
talk
gossip
what
a
nightmare
to
have
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
ill
get
the
better
of
you
i
wont
be
taken
to
a
madhouse
cest
charmant
poor
relation
yes
i
am
in
my
natural
shape
for
what
am
i
on
earth
but
a
poor
relation
by
the
way
i
am
listening
to
you
and
am
rather
surprised
to
find
you
are
actually
beginning
to
take
me
for
something
real
not
simply
your
fancy
as
you
persisted
in
declaring
last
time
never
for
one
minute
have
i
taken
you
for
reality
ivan
cried
with
a
sort
of
fury
you
are
a
lie
you
are
my
illness
you
are
a
phantom
its
only
that
i
dont
know
how
to
destroy
you
and
i
see
i
must
suffer
for
a
time
you
are
my
hallucination
you
are
the
incarnation
of
myself
but
only
of
one
side
of
me

of
my
thoughts
and
feelings
but
only
the
nastiest
and
stupidest
of
them
from
that
point
of
view
you
might
be
of
interest
to
me
if
only
i
had
time
to
waste
on
you
excuse
me
excuse
me
ill
catch
you
when
you
flew
out
at
alyosha
under
the
lamppost
this
evening
and
shouted
to
him
you
learnt
it
from
him
how
do
you
know
that
he
visits
me
you
were
thinking
of
me
then
so
for
one
brief
moment
you
did
believe
that
i
really
exist
the
gentleman
laughed
blandly
yes
that
was
a
moment
of
weakness

but
i
couldnt
believe
in
you
i
dont
know
whether
i
was
asleep
or
awake
last
time
perhaps
i
was
only
dreaming
then
and
didnt
see
you
really
at
all
and
why
were
you
so
surly
with
alyosha
just
now
he
is
a
dear
ive
treated
him
badly
over
father
zossima
dont
talk
of
alyosha
how
dare
you
you
flunkey
ivan
laughed
again
you
scold
me
but
you
laughthats
a
good
sign
but
you
are
ever
so
much
more
polite
than
you
were
last
time
and
i
know
why
that
great
resolution
of
yours
dont
speak
of
my
resolution
cried
ivan
savagely
i
understand
i
understand
cest
noble
cest
charmant
you
are
going
to
defend
your
brother
and
to
sacrifice
yourself

cest
chevaleresque
hold
your
tongue
ill
kick
you
i
shant

altogether
sorry
for
then
my
object
will
be
attained

me
you
must
believe
in
my
reality
for
people
dont
kick
ghosts
joking
apart
it
doesnt
matter
to
me
scold
if
you
like
though
its
better
to
be
a
trifle
more
polite
even
to
me
fool
flunkey
what
words
scolding
you
i
scold
myself
ivan
laughed
again
you
are
myself
myself
only
with
a
different
face
you
just
say
what
i
am
thinking

and
are
incapable
of
saying
anything
new
if
i
am
like
you
in
my
way
of
thinking
its
all
to
my
credit
the
gentleman
declared
with
delicacy
and
dignity
you
choose
out
only
my
worst
thoughts
and
whats
more
the
stupid
ones
you
are
stupid
and
vulgar
you
are
awfully
stupid
no
i
cant
put
up
with
you
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
do
ivan
said
through
his
clenched
teeth
my
dear
friend
above
all
things
i
want
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
and
to
be
recognized
as
such
the
visitor
began
in
an
excess
of
deprecating
and
simplehearted
pride
typical
of
a
poor
relation
i
am
poor
but

i
wont
say
very
honest
but

its
an
axiom
generally
accepted
in
society
that
i
am
a
fallen
angel
i
certainly
cant
conceive
how
i
can
ever
have
been
an
angel
if
i
ever
was
it
must
have
been
so
long
ago
that
theres
no
harm
in
forgetting
it
now
i
only
prize
the
reputation
of
being
a
gentlemanly
person
and
live
as
i
can
trying
to
make
myself
agreeable
i
love
men
genuinely
ive
been
greatly
calumniated
here
when
i
stay
with
you
from
time
to
time
my
life
gains
a
kind
of
reality
and
thats
what
i
like
most
of
all
you
see
like
you
i
suffer
from
the
fantastic
and
so
i
love
the
realism
of
earth
here
with
you
everything
is
circumscribed
here
all
is
formulated
and
geometrical
while
we
have
nothing
but
indeterminate
equations
i
wander
about
here
dreaming
i
like
dreaming
besides
on
earth
i
become
superstitious
please
dont
laugh
thats
just
what
i
like
to
become
superstitious
i
adopt
all
your
habits
here
ive
grown
fond
of
going
to
the
public
baths
would
you
believe
it
and
i
go
and
steam
myself
with
merchants
and
priests
what
i
dream
of
is
becoming
incarnate
once
for
all
and
irrevocably
in
the
form
of
some
merchants
wife
weighing
eighteen
stone
and
of
believing
all
she
believes
my
ideal
is
to
go
to
church
and
offer
a
candle
in
simplehearted
faith
upon
my
word
it
is
then
there
would
be
an
end
to
my
sufferings
i
like
being
doctored
too
in
the
spring
there
was
an
outbreak
of
smallpox
and
i
went
and
was
vaccinated
in
a
foundling
hospitalif
only
you
knew
how
i
enjoyed
myself
that
day
i
subscribed
ten
roubles
in
the
cause
of
the
slavs
but
you
are
not
listening
do
you
know
you
are
not
at
all
well
this
evening
i
know
you
went
yesterday
to
that
doctor

well
what
about
your
health
what
did
the
doctor
say
fool
ivan
snapped
out
but
you
are
clever
anyway
you
are
scolding
again
i
didnt
ask
out
of
sympathy
you
neednt
answer
now
rheumatism
has
come
in
again
fool
repeated
ivan
you
keep
saying
the
same
thing
but
i
had
such
an
attack
of
rheumatism
last
year
that
i
remember
it
to
this
day
the
devil
have
rheumatism
why
not
if
i
sometimes
put
on
fleshly
form
i
put
on
fleshly
form
and
i
take
the
consequences
satan
sum
et
nihil
humanum
a
me
alienum
puto
what
what
satan
sum
et
nihil
humanum

thats
not
bad
for
the
devil
i
am
glad
ive
pleased
you
at
last
but
you
didnt
get
that
from
me
ivan
stopped
suddenly
seeming
struck
that
never
entered
my
head
thats
strange

this
time
ill
act
honestly
and
explain
to
you
listen
in
dreams
and
especially
in
nightmares
from
indigestion
or
anything
a
man
sees
sometimes
such
artistic
visions
such
complex
and
real
actuality
such
events
even
a
whole
world
of
events
woven
into
such
a
plot
with
such
unexpected
details
from
the
most
exalted
matters
to
the
last
button
on
a
cuff
as
i
swear
leo
tolstoy
has
never
invented
yet
such
dreams
are
sometimes
seen
not
by
writers
but
by
the
most
ordinary
people
officials
journalists
priests
the
subject
is
a
complete
enigma
a
statesman
confessed
to
me
indeed
that
all
his
best
ideas
came
to
him
when
he
was
asleep
well
thats
how
it
is
now
though
i
am
your
hallucination
yet
just
as
in
a
nightmare
i
say
original
things
which
had
not
entered
your
head
before
so
i
dont
repeat
your
ideas
yet
i
am
only
your
nightmare
nothing
more
you
are
lying
your
aim
is
to
convince
me
you
exist
apart
and
are
not
my
nightmare
and
now
you
are
asserting
you
are
a
dream
my
dear
fellow
ive
adopted
a
special
method
today
ill
explain
it
to
you
afterwards
stay
where
did
i
break
off
oh
yes
i
caught
cold
then
only
not
here
but
yonder
where
is
yonder
tell
me
will
you
be
here
long
cant
you
go
away
ivan
exclaimed
almost
in
despair
he
ceased
walking
to
and
fro
sat
down
on
the
sofa
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
again
and
held
his
head
tight
in
both
hands
he
pulled
the
wet
towel
off
and
flung
it
away
in
vexation
it
was
evidently
of
no
use
your
nerves
are
out
of
order
observed
the
gentleman
with
a
carelessly
easy
though
perfectly
polite
air
you
are
angry
with
me
even
for
being
able
to
catch
cold
though
it
happened
in
a
most
natural
way
i
was
hurrying
then
to
a
diplomatic
soire
at
the
house
of
a
lady
of
high
rank
in
petersburg
who
was
aiming
at
influence
in
the
ministry
well
an
evening
suit
white
tie
gloves
though
i
was
god
knows
where
and
had
to
fly
through
space
to
reach
your
earth
of
course
it
took
only
an
instant
but
you
know
a
ray
of
light
from
the
sun
takes
full
eight
minutes
and
fancy
in
an
evening
suit
and
open
waistcoat
spirits
dont
freeze
but
when
ones
in
fleshly
form
well

in
brief
i
didnt
think
and
set
off
and
you
know
in
those
ethereal
spaces
in
the
water
that
is
above
the
firmament
theres
such
a
frost

at
least
one
cant
call
it
frost
you
can
fancy
150
degrees
below
zero
you
know
the
game
the
village
girls
playthey
invite
the
unwary
to
lick
an
ax
in
thirty
degrees
of
frost
the
tongue
instantly
freezes
to
it
and
the
dupe
tears
the
skin
off
so
it
bleeds
but
thats
only
in
30
degrees
in
150
degrees
i
imagine
it
would
be
enough
to
put
your
finger
on
the
ax
and
it
would
be
the
end
of
it

if
only
there
could
be
an
ax
there
and
can
there
be
an
ax
there
ivan
interrupted
carelessly
and
disdainfully
he
was
exerting
himself
to
the
utmost
not
to
believe
in
the
delusion
and
not
to
sink
into
complete
insanity
an
ax
the
guest
interrupted
in
surprise
yes
what
would
become
of
an
ax
there
ivan
cried
suddenly
with
a
sort
of
savage
and
insistent
obstinacy
what
would
become
of
an
ax
in
space
quelle
ide
if
it
were
to
fall
to
any
distance
it
would
begin
i
think
flying
round
the
earth
without
knowing
why
like
a
satellite
the
astronomers
would
calculate
the
rising
and
the
setting
of
the
ax
gatzuk
would
put
it
in
his
calendar
thats
all
you
are
stupid
awfully
stupid
said
ivan
peevishly
fib
more
cleverly
or
i
wont
listen
you
want
to
get
the
better
of
me
by
realism
to
convince
me
that
you
exist
but
i
dont
want
to
believe
you
exist
i
wont
believe
it
but
i
am
not
fibbing
its
all
the
truth
the
truth
is
unhappily
hardly
ever
amusing
i
see
you
persist
in
expecting
something
big
of
me
and
perhaps
something
fine
thats
a
great
pity
for
i
only
give
what
i
can
dont
talk
philosophy
you
ass
philosophy
indeed
when
all
my
right
side
is
numb
and
i
am
moaning
and
groaning
ive
tried
all
the
medical
faculty
they
can
diagnose
beautifully
they
have
the
whole
of
your
disease
at
their
fingertips
but
theyve
no
idea
how
to
cure
you
there
was
an
enthusiastic
little
student
here
you
may
die
said
he
but
youll
know
perfectly
what
disease
you
are
dying
of
and
then
what
a
way
they
have
sending
people
to
specialists
we
only
diagnose
they
say
but
go
to
suchandsuch
a
specialist
hell
cure
you
the
old
doctor
who
used
to
cure
all
sorts
of
disease
has
completely
disappeared
i
assure
you
now
there
are
only
specialists
and
they
all
advertise
in
the
newspapers
if
anything
is
wrong
with
your
nose
they
send
you
to
paris
there
they
say
is
a
european
specialist
who
cures
noses
if
you
go
to
paris
hell
look
at
your
nose
i
can
only
cure
your
right
nostril
hell
tell
you
for
i
dont
cure
the
left
nostril
thats
not
my
speciality
but
go
to
vienna
there
theres
a
specialist
who
will
cure
your
left
nostril
what
are
you
to
do
i
fell
back
on
popular
remedies
a
german
doctor
advised
me
to
rub
myself
with
honey
and
salt
in
the
bathhouse
solely
to
get
an
extra
bath
i
went
smeared
myself
all
over
and
it
did
me
no
good
at
all
in
despair
i
wrote
to
count
mattei
in
milan
he
sent
me
a
book
and
some
drops
bless
him
and
only
fancy
hoffs
malt
extract
cured
me
i
bought
it
by
accident
drank
a
bottle
and
a
half
of
it
and
i
was
ready
to
dance
it
took
it
away
completely
i
made
up
my
mind
to
write
to
the
papers
to
thank
him
i
was
prompted
by
a
feeling
of
gratitude
and
only
fancy
it
led
to
no
end
of
a
bother
not
a
single
paper
would
take
my
letter
it
would
be
very
reactionary
they
said
no
one
will
believe
it
le
diable
nexiste
point
youd
better
remain
anonymous
they
advised
me
what
use
is
a
letter
of
thanks
if
its
anonymous
i
laughed
with
the
men
at
the
newspaper
office
its
reactionary
to
believe
in
god
in
our
days
i
said
but
i
am
the
devil
so
i
may
be
believed
in
we
quite
understand
that
they
said
who
doesnt
believe
in
the
devil
yet
it
wont
do
it
might
injure
our
reputation
as
a
joke
if
you
like
but
i
thought
as
a
joke
it
wouldnt
be
very
witty
so
it
wasnt
printed
and
do
you
know
i
have
felt
sore
about
it
to
this
day
my
best
feelings
gratitude
for
instance
are
literally
denied
me
simply
from
my
social
position
philosophical
reflections
again
ivan
snarled
malignantly
god
preserve
me
from
it
but
one
cant
help
complaining
sometimes
i
am
a
slandered
man
you
upbraid
me
every
moment
with
being
stupid
one
can
see
you
are
young
my
dear
fellow
intelligence
isnt
the
only
thing
i
have
naturally
a
kind
and
merry
heart
i
also
write
vaudevilles
of
all
sorts
you
seem
to
take
me
for
hlestakov
grown
old
but
my
fate
is
a
far
more
serious
one
before
time
was
by
some
decree
which
i
could
never
make
out
i
was
predestined
to
deny
and
yet
i
am
genuinely
goodhearted
and
not
at
all
inclined
to
negation
no
you
must
go
and
deny
without
denial
theres
no
criticism
and
what
would
a
journal
be
without
a
column
of
criticism
without
criticism
it
would
be
nothing
but
one
hosannah
but
nothing
but
hosannah
is
not
enough
for
life
the
hosannah
must
be
tried
in
the
crucible
of
doubt
and
so
on
in
the
same
style
but
i
dont
meddle
in
that
i
didnt
create
it
i
am
not
answerable
for
it
well
theyve
chosen
their
scapegoat
theyve
made
me
write
the
column
of
criticism
and
so
life
was
made
possible
we
understand
that
comedy
i
for
instance
simply
ask
for
annihilation
no
live
i
am
told
for
thered
be
nothing
without
you
if
everything
in
the
universe
were
sensible
nothing
would
happen
there
would
be
no
events
without
you
and
there
must
be
events
so
against
the
grain
i
serve
to
produce
events
and
do
whats
irrational
because
i
am
commanded
to
for
all
their
indisputable
intelligence
men
take
this
farce
as
something
serious
and
that
is
their
tragedy
they
suffer
of
course

but
then
they
live
they
live
a
real
life
not
a
fantastic
one
for
suffering
is
life
without
suffering
what
would
be
the
pleasure
of
it
it
would
be
transformed
into
an
endless
church
service
it
would
be
holy
but
tedious
but
what
about
me
i
suffer
but
still
i
dont
live
i
am
x
in
an
indeterminate
equation
i
am
a
sort
of
phantom
in
life
who
has
lost
all
beginning
and
end
and
who
has
even
forgotten
his
own
name
you
are
laughing
no
you
are
not
laughing
you
are
angry
again
you
are
for
ever
angry
all
you
care
about
is
intelligence
but
i
repeat
again
that
i
would
give
away
all
this
superstellar
life
all
the
ranks
and
honors
simply
to
be
transformed
into
the
soul
of
a
merchants
wife
weighing
eighteen
stone
and
set
candles
at
gods
shrine
then
even
you
dont
believe
in
god
said
ivan
with
a
smile
of
hatred
what
can
i
saythat
is
if
you
are
in
earnest
is
there
a
god
or
not
ivan
cried
with
the
same
savage
intensity
ah
then
you
are
in
earnest
my
dear
fellow
upon
my
word
i
dont
know
there
ive
said
it
now
you
dont
know
but
you
see
god
no
you
are
not
some
one
apart
you
are
myself
you
are
i
and
nothing
more
you
are
rubbish
you
are
my
fancy
well
if
you
like
i
have
the
same
philosophy
as
you
that
would
be
true
je
pense
donc
je
suis
i
know
that
for
a
fact
all
the
rest
all
these
worlds
god
and
even
satanall
that
is
not
proved
to
my
mind
does
all
that
exist
of
itself
or
is
it
only
an
emanation
of
myself
a
logical
development
of
my
ego
which
alone
has
existed
for
ever
but
i
make
haste
to
stop
for
i
believe
you
will
be
jumping
up
to
beat
me
directly
youd
better
tell
me
some
anecdote
said
ivan
miserably
there
is
an
anecdote
precisely
on
our
subject
or
rather
a
legend
not
an
anecdote
you
reproach
me
with
unbelief
you
see
you
say
yet
you
dont
believe
but
my
dear
fellow
i
am
not
the
only
one
like
that
we
are
all
in
a
muddle
over
there
now
and
all
through
your
science
once
there
used
to
be
atoms
five
senses
four
elements
and
then
everything
hung
together
somehow
there
were
atoms
in
the
ancient
world
even
but
since
weve
learned
that
youve
discovered
the
chemical
molecule
and
protoplasm
and
the
devil
knows
what
we
had
to
lower
our
crest
theres
a
regular
muddle
and
above
all
superstition
scandal
theres
as
much
scandal
among
us
as
among
you
you
know
a
little
more
in
fact
and
spying
indeed
for
we
have
our
secret
police
department
where
private
information
is
received
well
this
wild
legend
belongs
to
our
middle
agesnot
yours
but
oursand
no
one
believes
it
even
among
us
except
the
old
ladies
of
eighteen
stone
not
your
old
ladies
i
mean
but
ours
weve
everything
you
have
i
am
revealing
one
of
our
secrets
out
of
friendship
for
you
though
its
forbidden
this
legend
is
about
paradise
there
was
they
say
here
on
earth
a
thinker
and
philosopher
he
rejected
everything
laws
conscience
faith
and
above
all
the
future
life
he
died
he
expected
to
go
straight
to
darkness
and
death
and
he
found
a
future
life
before
him
he
was
astounded
and
indignant
this
is
against
my
principles
he
said
and
he
was
punished
for
that

that
is
you
must
excuse
me
i
am
just
repeating
what
i
heard
myself
its
only
a
legend

he
was
sentenced
to
walk
a
quadrillion
kilometers
in
the
dark
weve
adopted
the
metric
system
you
know
and
when
he
has
finished
that
quadrillion
the
gates
of
heaven
would
be
opened
to
him
and
hell
be
forgiven
and
what
tortures
have
you
in
the
other
world
besides
the
quadrillion
kilometers
asked
ivan
with
a
strange
eagerness
what
tortures
ah
dont
ask
in
old
days
we
had
all
sorts
but
now
they
have
taken
chiefly
to
moral
punishmentsthe
stings
of
conscience
and
all
that
nonsense
we
got
that
too
from
you
from
the
softening
of
your
manners
and
whos
the
better
for
it
only
those
who
have
got
no
conscience
for
how
can
they
be
tortured
by
conscience
when
they
have
none
but
decent
people
who
have
conscience
and
a
sense
of
honor
suffer
for
it
reforms
when
the
ground
has
not
been
prepared
for
them
especially
if
they
are
institutions
copied
from
abroad
do
nothing
but
mischief
the
ancient
fire
was
better
well
this
man
who
was
condemned
to
the
quadrillion
kilometers
stood
still
looked
round
and
lay
down
across
the
road
i
wont
go
i
refuse
on
principle
take
the
soul
of
an
enlightened
russian
atheist
and
mix
it
with
the
soul
of
the
prophet
jonah
who
sulked
for
three
days
and
nights
in
the
belly
of
the
whale
and
you
get
the
character
of
that
thinker
who
lay
across
the
road
what
did
he
lie
on
there
well
i
suppose
there
was
something
to
lie
on
you
are
not
laughing
bravo
cried
ivan
still
with
the
same
strange
eagerness
now
he
was
listening
with
an
unexpected
curiosity
well
is
he
lying
there
now
thats
the
point
that
he
isnt
he
lay
there
almost
a
thousand
years
and
then
he
got
up
and
went
on
what
an
ass
cried
ivan
laughing
nervously
and
still
seeming
to
be
pondering
something
intently
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
he
lies
there
for
ever
or
walks
the
quadrillion
kilometers
it
would
take
a
billion
years
to
walk
it
much
more
than
that
i
havent
got
a
pencil
and
paper
or
i
could
work
it
out
but
he
got
there
long
ago
and
thats
where
the
story
begins
what
he
got
there
but
how
did
he
get
the
billion
years
to
do
it
why
you
keep
thinking
of
our
present
earth
but
our
present
earth
may
have
been
repeated
a
billion
times
why
its
become
extinct
been
frozen
cracked
broken
to
bits
disintegrated
into
its
elements
again
the
water
above
the
firmament
then
again
a
comet
again
a
sun
again
from
the
sun
it
becomes
earthand
the
same
sequence
may
have
been
repeated
endlessly
and
exactly
the
same
to
every
detail
most
unseemly
and
insufferably
tedious
well
well
what
happened
when
he
arrived
why
the
moment
the
gates
of
paradise
were
open
and
he
walked
in
before
he
had
been
there
two
seconds
by
his
watch
though
to
my
thinking
his
watch
must
have
long
dissolved
into
its
elements
on
the
way
he
cried
out
that
those
two
seconds
were
worth
walking
not
a
quadrillion
kilometers
but
a
quadrillion
of
quadrillions
raised
to
the
quadrillionth
power
in
fact
he
sang
hosannah
and
overdid
it
so
that
some
persons
there
of
lofty
ideas
wouldnt
shake
hands
with
him
at
firsthed
become
too
rapidly
reactionary
they
said
the
russian
temperament
i
repeat
its
a
legend
i
give
it
for
what
its
worth
so
thats
the
sort
of
ideas
we
have
on
such
subjects
even
now
ive
caught
you
ivan
cried
with
an
almost
childish
delight
as
though
he
had
succeeded
in
remembering
something
at
last
that
anecdote
about
the
quadrillion
years
i
made
up
myself
i
was
seventeen
then
i
was
at
the
high
school
i
made
up
that
anecdote
and
told
it
to
a
schoolfellow
called
korovkin
it
was
at
moscow
the
anecdote
is
so
characteristic
that
i
couldnt
have
taken
it
from
anywhere
i
thought
id
forgotten
it

but
ive
unconsciously
recalled
iti
recalled
it
myselfit
was
not
you
telling
it
thousands
of
things
are
unconsciously
remembered
like
that
even
when
people
are
being
taken
to
execution

its
come
back
to
me
in
a
dream
you
are
that
dream
you
are
a
dream
not
a
living
creature
from
the
vehemence
with
which
you
deny
my
existence
laughed
the
gentleman
i
am
convinced
that
you
believe
in
me
not
in
the
slightest
i
havent
a
hundredth
part
of
a
grain
of
faith
in
you
but
you
have
the
thousandth
of
a
grain
homeopathic
doses
perhaps
are
the
strongest
confess
that
you
have
faith
even
to
the
tenthousandth
of
a
grain
not
for
one
minute
cried
ivan
furiously
but
i
should
like
to
believe
in
you
he
added
strangely
aha
theres
an
admission
but
i
am
goodnatured
ill
come
to
your
assistance
again
listen
it
was
i
caught
you
not
you
me
i
told
you
your
anecdote
youd
forgotten
on
purpose
so
as
to
destroy
your
faith
in
me
completely
you
are
lying
the
object
of
your
visit
is
to
convince
me
of
your
existence
just
so
but
hesitation
suspense
conflict
between
belief
and
disbeliefis
sometimes
such
torture
to
a
conscientious
man
such
as
you
are
that
its
better
to
hang
oneself
at
once
knowing
that
you
are
inclined
to
believe
in
me
i
administered
some
disbelief
by
telling
you
that
anecdote
i
lead
you
to
belief
and
disbelief
by
turns
and
i
have
my
motive
in
it
its
the
new
method
as
soon
as
you
disbelieve
in
me
completely
youll
begin
assuring
me
to
my
face
that
i
am
not
a
dream
but
a
reality
i
know
you
then
i
shall
have
attained
my
object
which
is
an
honorable
one
i
shall
sow
in
you
only
a
tiny
grain
of
faith
and
it
will
grow
into
an
oaktreeand
such
an
oaktree
that
sitting
on
it
you
will
long
to
enter
the
ranks
of
the
hermits
in
the
wilderness
and
the
saintly
women
for
that
is
what
you
are
secretly
longing
for
youll
dine
on
locusts
youll
wander
into
the
wilderness
to
save
your
soul
then
its
for
the
salvation
of
my
soul
you
are
working
is
it
you
scoundrel
one
must
do
a
good
work
sometimes
how
illhumored
you
are
fool
did
you
ever
tempt
those
holy
men
who
ate
locusts
and
prayed
seventeen
years
in
the
wilderness
till
they
were
overgrown
with
moss
my
dear
fellow
ive
done
nothing
else
one
forgets
the
whole
world
and
all
the
worlds
and
sticks
to
one
such
saint
because
he
is
a
very
precious
diamond
one
such
soul
you
know
is
sometimes
worth
a
whole
constellation
we
have
our
system
of
reckoning
you
know
the
conquest
is
priceless
and
some
of
them
on
my
word
are
not
inferior
to
you
in
culture
though
you
wont
believe
it
they
can
contemplate
such
depths
of
belief
and
disbelief
at
the
same
moment
that
sometimes
it
really
seems
that
they
are
within
a
hairsbreadth
of
being
turned
upside
down
as
the
actor
gorbunov
says
well
did
you
get
your
nose
pulled8
my
dear
fellow
observed
the
visitor
sententiously
its
better
to
get
off
with
your
nose
pulled
than
without
a
nose
at
all
as
an
afflicted
marquis
observed
not
long
ago
he
must
have
been
treated
by
a
specialist
in
confession
to
his
spiritual
fathera
jesuit
i
was
present
it
was
simply
charming
give
me
back
my
nose
he
said
and
he
beat
his
breast
my
son
said
the
priest
evasively
all
things
are
accomplished
in
accordance
with
the
inscrutable
decrees
of
providence
and
what
seems
a
misfortune
sometimes
leads
to
extraordinary
though
unapparent
benefits
if
stern
destiny
has
deprived
you
of
your
nose
its
to
your
advantage
that
no
one
can
ever
pull
you
by
your
nose
holy
father
thats
no
comfort
cried
the
despairing
marquis
id
be
delighted
to
have
my
nose
pulled
every
day
of
my
life
if
it
were
only
in
its
proper
place
my
son
sighs
the
priest
you
cant
expect
every
blessing
at
once
this
is
murmuring
against
providence
who
even
in
this
has
not
forgotten
you
for
if
you
repine
as
you
repined
just
now
declaring
youd
be
glad
to
have
your
nose
pulled
for
the
rest
of
your
life
your
desire
has
already
been
fulfilled
indirectly
for
when
you
lost
your
nose
you
were
led
by
the
nose

fool
how
stupid
cried
ivan
my
dear
friend
i
only
wanted
to
amuse
you
but
i
swear
thats
the
genuine
jesuit
casuistry
and
i
swear
that
it
all
happened
word
for
word
as
ive
told
you
it
happened
lately
and
gave
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
unhappy
young
man
shot
himself
that
very
night
when
he
got
home
i
was
by
his
side
till
the
very
last
moment
those
jesuit
confessionals
are
really
my
most
delightful
diversion
at
melancholy
moments
heres
another
incident
that
happened
only
the
other
day
a
little
blonde
norman
girl
of
twentya
buxom
unsophisticated
beauty
that
would
make
your
mouth
watercomes
to
an
old
priest
she
bends
down
and
whispers
her
sin
into
the
grating
why
my
daughter
have
you
fallen
again
already
cries
the
priest
o
sancta
maria
what
do
i
hear
not
the
same
man
this
time
how
long
is
this
going
on
arent
you
ashamed
ah
mon
pre
answers
the
sinner
with
tears
of
penitence
a
lui
fait
tant
de
plaisir
et

moi
si
peu
de
peine
fancy
such
an
answer
i
drew
back
it
was
the
cry
of
nature
better
than
innocence
itself
if
you
like
i
absolved
her
sin
on
the
spot
and
was
turning
to
go
but
i
was
forced
to
turn
back
i
heard
the
priest
at
the
grating
making
an
appointment
with
her
for
the
eveningthough
he
was
an
old
man
hard
as
flint
he
fell
in
an
instant
it
was
nature
the
truth
of
nature
asserted
its
rights
what
you
are
turning
up
your
nose
again
angry
again
i
dont
know
how
to
please
you
leave
me
alone
you
are
beating
on
my
brain
like
a
haunting
nightmare
ivan
moaned
miserably
helpless
before
his
apparition
i
am
bored
with
you
agonizingly
and
insufferably
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
shake
you
off
i
repeat
moderate
your
expectations
dont
demand
of
me
everything
great
and
noble
and
youll
see
how
well
we
shall
get
on
said
the
gentleman
impressively
you
are
really
angry
with
me
for
not
having
appeared
to
you
in
a
red
glow
with
thunder
and
lightning
with
scorched
wings
but
have
shown
myself
in
such
a
modest
form
you
are
wounded
in
the
first
place
in
your
esthetic
feelings
and
secondly
in
your
pride
how
could
such
a
vulgar
devil
visit
such
a
great
man
as
you
yes
there
is
that
romantic
strain
in
you
that
was
so
derided
by
byelinsky
i
cant
help
it
young
man
as
i
got
ready
to
come
to
you
i
did
think
as
a
joke
of
appearing
in
the
figure
of
a
retired
general
who
had
served
in
the
caucasus
with
a
star
of
the
lion
and
the
sun
on
my
coat
but
i
was
positively
afraid
of
doing
it
for
youd
have
thrashed
me
for
daring
to
pin
the
lion
and
the
sun
on
my
coat
instead
of
at
least
the
polar
star
or
the
sirius
and
you
keep
on
saying
i
am
stupid
but
mercy
on
us
i
make
no
claim
to
be
equal
to
you
in
intelligence
mephistopheles
declared
to
faust
that
he
desired
evil
but
did
only
good
well
he
can
say
what
he
likes
its
quite
the
opposite
with
me
i
am
perhaps
the
one
man
in
all
creation
who
loves
the
truth
and
genuinely
desires
good
i
was
there
when
the
word
who
died
on
the
cross
rose
up
into
heaven
bearing
on
his
bosom
the
soul
of
the
penitent
thief
i
heard
the
glad
shrieks
of
the
cherubim
singing
and
shouting
hosannah
and
the
thunderous
rapture
of
the
seraphim
which
shook
heaven
and
all
creation
and
i
swear
to
you
by
all
thats
sacred
i
longed
to
join
the
choir
and
shout
hosannah
with
them
all
the
word
had
almost
escaped
me
had
almost
broken
from
my
lips

you
know
how
susceptible
and
esthetically
impressionable
i
am
but
common
senseoh
a
most
unhappy
trait
in
my
characterkept
me
in
due
bounds
and
i
let
the
moment
pass
for
what
would
have
happened
i
reflected
what
would
have
happened
after
my
hosannah
everything
on
earth
would
have
been
extinguished
at
once
and
no
events
could
have
occurred
and
so
solely
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
my
social
position
i
was
forced
to
suppress
the
good
moment
and
to
stick
to
my
nasty
task
somebody
takes
all
the
credit
of
whats
good
for
himself
and
nothing
but
nastiness
is
left
for
me
but
i
dont
envy
the
honor
of
a
life
of
idle
imposture
i
am
not
ambitious
why
am
i
of
all
creatures
in
the
world
doomed
to
be
cursed
by
all
decent
people
and
even
to
be
kicked
for
if
i
put
on
mortal
form
i
am
bound
to
take
such
consequences
sometimes
i
know
of
course
theres
a
secret
in
it
but
they
wont
tell
me
the
secret
for
anything
for
then
perhaps
seeing
the
meaning
of
it
i
might
bawl
hosannah
and
the
indispensable
minus
would
disappear
at
once
and
good
sense
would
reign
supreme
throughout
the
whole
world
and
that
of
course
would
mean
the
end
of
everything
even
of
magazines
and
newspapers
for
who
would
take
them
in
i
know
that
at
the
end
of
all
things
i
shall
be
reconciled
i
too
shall
walk
my
quadrillion
and
learn
the
secret
but
till
that
happens
i
am
sulking
and
fulfill
my
destiny
though
its
against
the
grainthat
is
to
ruin
thousands
for
the
sake
of
saving
one
how
many
souls
have
had
to
be
ruined
and
how
many
honorable
reputations
destroyed
for
the
sake
of
that
one
righteous
man
job
over
whom
they
made
such
a
fool
of
me
in
old
days
yes
till
the
secret
is
revealed
there
are
two
sorts
of
truths
for
meone
their
truth
yonder
which
i
know
nothing
about
so
far
and
the
other
my
own
and
theres
no
knowing
which
will
turn
out
the
better
are
you
asleep
i
might
well
be
ivan
groaned
angrily
all
my
stupid
ideasoutgrown
thrashed
out
long
ago
and
flung
aside
like
a
dead
carcassyou
present
to
me
as
something
new
theres
no
pleasing
you
and
i
thought
i
should
fascinate
you
by
my
literary
style
that
hosannah
in
the
skies
really
wasnt
bad
was
it
and
then
that
ironical
tone

la
heine
eh
no
i
was
never
such
a
flunkey
how
then
could
my
soul
beget
a
flunkey
like
you
my
dear
fellow
i
know
a
most
charming
and
attractive
young
russian
gentleman
a
young
thinker
and
a
great
lover
of
literature
and
art
the
author
of
a
promising
poem
entitled
the
grand
inquisitor
i
was
only
thinking
of
him
i
forbid
you
to
speak
of
the
grand
inquisitor
cried
ivan
crimson
with
shame
and
the
geological
cataclysm
do
you
remember
that
was
a
poem
now
hold
your
tongue
or
ill
kill
you
youll
kill
me
no
excuse
me
i
will
speak
i
came
to
treat
myself
to
that
pleasure
oh
i
love
the
dreams
of
my
ardent
young
friends
quivering
with
eagerness
for
life
there
are
new
men
you
decided
last
spring
when
you
were
meaning
to
come
here
they
propose
to
destroy
everything
and
begin
with
cannibalism
stupid
fellows
they
didnt
ask
my
advice
i
maintain
that
nothing
need
be
destroyed
that
we
only
need
to
destroy
the
idea
of
god
in
man
thats
how
we
have
to
set
to
work
its
that
that
we
must
begin
with
oh
blind
race
of
men
who
have
no
understanding
as
soon
as
men
have
all
of
them
denied
godand
i
believe
that
period
analogous
with
geological
periods
will
come
to
passthe
old
conception
of
the
universe
will
fall
of
itself
without
cannibalism
and
whats
more
the
old
morality
and
everything
will
begin
anew
men
will
unite
to
take
from
life
all
it
can
give
but
only
for
joy
and
happiness
in
the
present
world
man
will
be
lifted
up
with
a
spirit
of
divine
titanic
pride
and
the
man
god
will
appear
from
hour
to
hour
extending
his
conquest
of
nature
infinitely
by
his
will
and
his
science
man
will
feel
such
lofty
joy
from
hour
to
hour
in
doing
it
that
it
will
make
up
for
all
his
old
dreams
of
the
joys
of
heaven
every
one
will
know
that
he
is
mortal
and
will
accept
death
proudly
and
serenely
like
a
god
his
pride
will
teach
him
that
its
useless
for
him
to
repine
at
lifes
being
a
moment
and
he
will
love
his
brother
without
need
of
reward
love
will
be
sufficient
only
for
a
moment
of
life
but
the
very
consciousness
of
its
momentariness
will
intensify
its
fire
which
now
is
dissipated
in
dreams
of
eternal
love
beyond
the
grave
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
the
same
style
charming
ivan
sat
with
his
eyes
on
the
floor
and
his
hands
pressed
to
his
ears
but
he
began
trembling
all
over
the
voice
continued
the
question
now
is
my
young
thinker
reflected
is
it
possible
that
such
a
period
will
ever
come
if
it
does
everything
is
determined
and
humanity
is
settled
for
ever
but
as
owing
to
mans
inveterate
stupidity
this
cannot
come
about
for
at
least
a
thousand
years
every
one
who
recognizes
the
truth
even
now
may
legitimately
order
his
life
as
he
pleases
on
the
new
principles
in
that
sense
all
things
are
lawful
for
him
whats
more
even
if
this
period
never
comes
to
pass
since
there
is
anyway
no
god
and
no
immortality
the
new
man
may
well
become
the
mangod
even
if
he
is
the
only
one
in
the
whole
world
and
promoted
to
his
new
position
he
may
lightheartedly
overstep
all
the
barriers
of
the
old
morality
of
the
old
slaveman
if
necessary
there
is
no
law
for
god
where
god
stands
the
place
is
holy
where
i
stand
will
be
at
once
the
foremost
place

all
things
are
lawful
and
thats
the
end
of
it
thats
all
very
charming
but
if
you
want
to
swindle
why
do
you
want
a
moral
sanction
for
doing
it
but
thats
our
modern
russian
all
over
he
cant
bring
himself
to
swindle
without
a
moral
sanction
he
is
so
in
love
with
truth
the
visitor
talked
obviously
carried
away
by
his
own
eloquence
speaking
louder
and
louder
and
looking
ironically
at
his
host
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
finishing
ivan
suddenly
snatched
a
glass
from
the
table
and
flung
it
at
the
orator
ah
mais
cest
bte
enfin
cried
the
latter
jumping
up
from
the
sofa
and
shaking
the
drops
of
tea
off
himself
he
remembers
luthers
inkstand
he
takes
me
for
a
dream
and
throws
glasses
at
a
dream
its
like
a
woman
i
suspected
you
were
only
pretending
to
stop
up
your
ears
a
loud
persistent
knocking
was
suddenly
heard
at
the
window
ivan
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
do
you
hear
youd
better
open
cried
the
visitor
its
your
brother
alyosha
with
the
most
interesting
and
surprising
news
ill
be
bound
be
silent
deceiver
i
knew
it
was
alyosha
i
felt
he
was
coming
and
of
course
he
has
not
come
for
nothing
of
course
he
brings
news

ivan
exclaimed
frantically
open
open
to
him
theres
a
snowstorm
and
he
is
your
brother
monsieur
saitil
le
temps
quil
fait
cest

ne
pas
mettre
un
chien
dehors
the
knocking
continued
ivan
wanted
to
rush
to
the
window
but
something
seemed
to
fetter
his
arms
and
legs
he
strained
every
effort
to
break
his
chains
but
in
vain
the
knocking
at
the
window
grew
louder
and
louder
at
last
the
chains
were
broken
and
ivan
leapt
up
from
the
sofa
he
looked
round
him
wildly
both
candles
had
almost
burnt
out
the
glass
he
had
just
thrown
at
his
visitor
stood
before
him
on
the
table
and
there
was
no
one
on
the
sofa
opposite
the
knocking
on
the
window
frame
went
on
persistently
but
it
was
by
no
means
so
loud
as
it
had
seemed
in
his
dream
on
the
contrary
it
was
quite
subdued
it
was
not
a
dream
no
i
swear
it
was
not
a
dream
it
all
happened
just
now
cried
ivan
he
rushed
to
the
window
and
opened
the
movable
pane
alyosha
i
told
you
not
to
come
he
cried
fiercely
to
his
brother
in
two
words
what
do
you
want
in
two
words
do
you
hear
an
hour
ago
smerdyakov
hanged
himself
alyosha
answered
from
the
yard
come
round
to
the
steps
ill
open
at
once
said
ivan
going
to
open
the
door
to
alyosha
chapter
x
it
was
he
who
said
that
alyosha
coming
in
told
ivan
that
a
little
over
an
hour
ago
marya
kondratyevna
had
run
to
his
rooms
and
informed
him
smerdyakov
had
taken
his
own
life
i
went
in
to
clear
away
the
samovar
and
he
was
hanging
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
on
alyoshas
inquiring
whether
she
had
informed
the
police
she
answered
that
she
had
told
no
one
but
i
flew
straight
to
you
ive
run
all
the
way
she
seemed
perfectly
crazy
alyosha
reported
and
was
shaking
like
a
leaf
when
alyosha
ran
with
her
to
the
cottage
he
found
smerdyakov
still
hanging
on
the
table
lay
a
note
i
destroy
my
life
of
my
own
will
and
desire
so
as
to
throw
no
blame
on
any
one
alyosha
left
the
note
on
the
table
and
went
straight
to
the
police
captain
and
told
him
all
about
it
and
from
him
ive
come
straight
to
you
said
alyosha
in
conclusion
looking
intently
into
ivans
face
he
had
not
taken
his
eyes
off
him
while
he
told
his
story
as
though
struck
by
something
in
his
expression
brother
he
cried
suddenly
you
must
be
terribly
ill
you
look
and
dont
seem
to
understand
what
i
tell
you
its
a
good
thing
you
came
said
ivan
as
though
brooding
and
not
hearing
alyoshas
exclamation
i
knew
he
had

ivan
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
still
spoke
in
the
same
brooding
tone
looking
at
the
ground

he
asked
alyosha
involuntarily
looking
round
hes
slipped
away
ivan
raised
his
head
and
smiled
softly
he
was
afraid

constellation
but
perhaps
that
constellation
is
only

chemical
molecule

clean
towel
folded
up
and
unused
by
ivans
dressing
table
in
the
other
corner
of
the
room
ivan
looked
strangely
at
the
towel

to

back
to
him
for
an
instant
stayhe

up
from

sofaan

hour

it

not
a
dream
he
was
here
he
was
sitting
here
on
that
sofa
when
you
knocked
at
the
window
i
threw
a
glass
at
him

this
one
wait
a
minute
i
was
asleep
last
time
but
this
dream

not
a
dream
it
has
happened
before
i
have
dreams
now
alyosha

yet
they
are
not
dreams
but
reality
i
walk
about
talk
and
see

though
i
am
asleep
but
he
was
sitting
here
on
that
sofa
there
he
is
frightfully
stupid
alyosha
frightfully
stupid
ivan
laughed
suddenly
and
began
pacing
about
the
room
who
is
stupid
of
whom
are
you
talking
brother
alyosha
asked
anxiously
again
the
devil
hes
taken
to
visiting
me
hes
been
here
twice
almost
three
times
he
taunted
me
with
being
angry
at
his
being
a
simple
devil
and
not
satan
with
scorched
wings
in
thunder
and
lightning
but
he
is
not
satan
thats
a
lie
he
is
an
impostor
he
is
simply
a
devila
paltry
trivial
devil
he
goes
to
the
baths
if
you
undressed
him
youd
be
sure
to
find
he
had
a
tail
long
and
smooth
like
a
danish
dogs
a
yard
long
dun
color
alyosha

alyosha
ran
to
the
washingstand
wetted
the
towel
persuaded
ivan
to
sit
down
again
and
put
the
wet
towel
round
his
head
he
sat
down
beside
him
what
were
you
telling
me
just
now
about
lise
ivan
began
again
he
was
becoming
very
talkative
i
like
lise
i
said
something
nasty
about
her
it
was
a
lie
i
like
her

i
am
afraid
for
katya
tomorrow
i
am
more
afraid
of
her
than
of
anything
on
account
of
the
future
she
will
cast
me
off
tomorrow
and
trample
me
under
foot
she
thinks
that
i
am
ruining
mitya
from
jealousy
on
her
account
yes
she
thinks
that
but
its
not
so
tomorrow

cross
but
not
the
gallows
no
i
shant
hang
myself
do
you
know
i
can
never
commit
suicide
alyosha
is
it
because
i
am
base
i
am
not
a
coward
is
it
from
love
of
life
how
did
i
know
that
smerdyakov
had
hanged
himself
yes
it
was
he
told
me
so
and
you
are
quite
convinced
that
there
has
been
some
one
here
asked
alyosha
yes
on
that
sofa
in
the
corner
you
would
have
driven
him
away
you
did
drive
him
away
he
disappeared
when
you
arrived
i
love
your
face
alyosha
did
you
know
that
i
loved
your
face
and
he
is
myself
alyosha
all
thats
base
in
me
all
thats
mean
and
contemptible
yes
i
am
a
romantic
he
guessed
it

though
its
a
libel
he
is
frightfully
stupid
but
its
to
his
advantage
he
has
cunning
animal
cunninghe
knew
how
to
infuriate
me
he
kept
taunting
me
with
believing
in
him
and
that
was
how
he
made
me
listen
to
him
he
fooled
me
like
a
boy
he
told
me
a
great
deal
that
was
true
about
myself
though
i
should
never
have
owned
it
to
myself
do
you
know
alyosha
ivan
added
in
an
intensely
earnest
and
confidential
tone
i
should
be
awfully
glad
to
think
that
it
was
he
and
not
i
he
has
worn
you
out
said
alyosha
looking
compassionately
at
his
brother
hes
been
teasing
me
and
you
know
he
does
it
so
cleverly
so
cleverly
conscience
what
is
conscience
i
make
it
up
for
myself
why
am
i
tormented
by
it
from
habit
from
the
universal
habit
of
mankind
for
the
seven
thousand
years
so
let
us
give
it
up
and
we
shall
be
gods
it
was
he
said
that
it
was
he
said
that
and
not
you
not
you
alyosha
could
not
help
crying
looking
frankly
at
his
brother
never
mind
him
anyway
have
done
with
him
and
forget
him
and
let
him
take
with
him
all
that
you
curse
now
and
never
come
back
yes
but
he
is
spiteful
he
laughed
at
me
he
was
impudent
alyosha
ivan
said
with
a
shudder
of
offense
but
he
was
unfair
to
me
unfair
to
me
about
lots
of
things
he
told
lies
about
me
to
my
face
oh
you
are
going
to
perform
an
act
of
heroic
virtue
to
confess
you
murdered
your
father
that
the
valet
murdered
him
at
your
instigation

brother
alyosha
interposed
restrain
yourself

was
not
you
murdered
him
its
not
true
thats
what
he
says
he
and
he
knows
it
you
are
going
to
perform
an
act
of
heroic
virtue
and
you
dont
believe
in
virtue
thats
what
tortures
you
and
makes
you
angry
thats
why
you
are
so
vindictive
he
said
that
to
me
about
me
and
he
knows
what
he
says
its
you
say
that
not
he
exclaimed
alyosha
mournfully
and
you
say
it
because
you
are
ill
and
delirious
tormenting
yourself
no
he
knows
what
he
says
you
are
going
from
pride
he
says
youll
stand
up
and
say
it
was
i
killed
him
and
why
do
you
writhe
with
horror
you
are
lying
i
despise
your
opinion
i
despise
your
horror
he
said
that
about
me
and
do
you
know
you
are
longing
for
their
praisehe
is
a
criminal
a
murderer
but
what
a
generous
soul
he
wanted
to
save
his
brother
and
he
confessed

thats
a
lie
alyosha
ivan
cried
suddenly
with
flashing
eyes
i
dont
want
the
low
rabble
to
praise
me
i
swear
i
dont
thats
a
lie
thats
why
i
threw
the
glass
at
him
and
it
broke
against
his
ugly
face
brother
calm
yourself
stop
alyosha
entreated
him
yes
he
knows
how
to
torment
one
hes
cruel
ivan
went
on
unheeding
i
had
an
inkling
from
the
first
what
he
came
for
granting
that
you
go
through
pride
still
you
had
a
hope
that
smerdyakov
might
be
convicted
and
sent
to
siberia
and
mitya
would
be
acquitted
while
you
would
only
be
punished
with
moral
condemnation
do
you
hear
he
laughed
thenand
some
people
will
praise
you
but
now
smerdyakovs
dead
he
has
hanged
himself
and
wholl
believe
you
alone
but
yet
you
are
going
you
are
going
youll
go
all
the
same
youve
decided
to
go
what
are
you
going
for
now
thats
awful
alyosha
i
cant
endure
such
questions
who
dare
ask
me
such
questions
brother
interposed
alyoshahis
heart
sank
with
terror
but
he
still
seemed
to
hope
to
bring
ivan
to
reasonhow
could
he
have
told
you
of
smerdyakovs
death
before
i
came
when
no
one
knew
of
it
and
there
was
no
time
for
any
one
to
know
of
it
he
told
me
said
ivan
firmly
refusing
to
admit
a
doubt
it
was
all
he
did
talk
about
if
you
come
to
that
and
it
would
be
all
right
if
you
believed
in
virtue
he
said
no
matter
if
they
disbelieve
you
you
are
going
for
the
sake
of
principle
but
you
are
a
little
pig
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
what
do
you
want
with
virtue
why
do
you
want
to
go
meddling
if
your
sacrifice
is
of
no
use
to
any
one
because
you
dont
know
yourself
why
you
go
oh
youd
give
a
great
deal
to
know
yourself
why
you
go
and
can
you
have
made
up
your
mind
youve
not
made
up
your
mind
youll
sit
all
night
deliberating
whether
to
go
or
not
but
you
will
go
you
know
youll
go
you
know
that
whichever
way
you
decide
the
decision
does
not
depend
on
you
youll
go
because
you
wont
dare
not
to
go
why
wont
you
dare
you
must
guess
that
for
yourself
thats
a
riddle
for
you
he
got
up
and
went
away
you
came
and
he
went
he
called
me
a
coward
alyosha
le
mot
de
lnigme
is
that
i
am
a
coward
it
is
not
for
such
eagles
to
soar
above
the
earth
it
was
he
added
thathe
and
smerdyakov
said
the
same
he
must
be
killed
katya
despises
me
ive
seen
that
for
a
month
past
even
lise
will
begin
to
despise
me
you
are
going
in
order
to
be
praised
thats
a
brutal
lie
and
you
despise
me
too
alyosha
now
i
am
going
to
hate
you
again
and
i
hate
the
monster
too
i
hate
the
monster
i
dont
want
to

the
monster
let
him
rot
in
siberia
hes
begun
singing
a
hymn
oh
tomorrow
ill
go
stand
before
them
and
spit
in
their
faces
he
jumped
up
in
a
frenzy
flung
off
the
towel
and
fell
to
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
again
alyosha
recalled
what
he
had
just
said
i
seem
to
be
sleeping
awake
i
walk
i
speak
i
see
but
i
am
asleep
it
seemed
to
be
just
like
that
now
alyosha
did
not
leave
him
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
to
run
for
a
doctor
but
he
was
afraid
to
leave
his
brother
alone
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
could
leave
him
by
degrees
ivan
lost
consciousness
completely
at
last
he
still
went
on
talking
talking
incessantly
but
quite
incoherently
and
even
articulated
his
words
with
difficulty
suddenly
he
staggered
violently
but
alyosha
was
in
time
to
support
him
ivan
let
him
lead
him
to
his
bed
alyosha
undressed
him
somehow
and
put
him
to
bed
he
sat
watching
over
him
for
another
two
hours
the
sick
man
slept
soundly
without
stirring
breathing
softly
and
evenly
alyosha
took
a
pillow
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
without
undressing
as
he
fell
asleep
he
prayed
for
mitya
and
ivan
he
began
to
understand
ivans
illness
the
anguish
of
a
proud
determination
an
earnest
conscience
god
in
whom
he
disbelieved
and
his
truth
were
gaining
mastery
over
his
heart
which
still
refused
to
submit
yes
the
thought
floated
through
alyoshas
head
as
it
lay
on
the
pillow
yes
if
smerdyakov
is
dead
no
one
will
believe
ivans
evidence
but
he
will
go
and
give
it
alyosha
smiled
softly
god
will
conquer
he
thought
he
will
either
rise
up
in
the
light
of
truth
or

hell
perish
in
hate
revenging
on
himself
and
on
every
one
his
having
served
the
cause
he
does
not

the
fatal
day
at
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
of
the
day
following
the
events
i
have
described
the
trial
of
dmitri
karamazov
began
in
our
district
court
i
hasten
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
i
am
far
from
esteeming
myself
capable
of
reporting
all
that
took
place
at
the
trial
in
full
detail
or
even
in
the
actual
order
of
events
i
imagine
that
to
mention
everything
with
full
explanation
would
fill
a
volume
even
a
very
large
one
and
so
i
trust
i
may
not
be
reproached
for
confining
myself
to
what
struck
me
i
may
have
selected
as
of
most
interest
what
was
of
secondary
importance
and
may
have
omitted
the
most
prominent
and
essential
details
but
i
see
i
shall
do
better
not
to
apologize
i
will
do
my
best
and
the
reader
will
see
for
himself
that
i
have
done
all
i
can
and
to
begin
with
before
entering
the
court
i
will
mention
what
surprised
me
most
on
that
day
indeed
as
it
appeared
later
every
one
was
surprised
at
it
too
we
all
knew
that
the
affair
had
aroused
great
interest
that
every
one
was
burning
with
impatience
for
the
trial
to
begin
that
it
had
been
a
subject
of
talk
conjecture
exclamation
and
surmise
for
the
last
two
months
in
local
society
every
one
knew
too
that
the
case
had
become
known
throughout
russia
but
yet
we
had
not
imagined
that
it
had
aroused
such
burning
such
intense
interest
in
every
one
not
only
among
ourselves
but
all
over
russia
this
became
evident
at
the
trial
this
day
visitors
had
arrived
not
only
from
the
chief
town
of
our
province
but
from
several
other
russian
towns
as
well
as
from
moscow
and
petersburg
among
them
were
lawyers
ladies
and
even
several
distinguished
personages
every
ticket
of
admission
had
been
snatched
up
a
special
place
behind
the
table
at
which
the
three
judges
sat
was
set
apart
for
the
most
distinguished
and
important
of
the
men
visitors
a
row
of
armchairs
had
been
placed
theresomething
exceptional
which
had
never
been
allowed
before
a
large
proportionnot
less
than
half
of
the
publicwere
ladies
there
was
such
a
large
number
of
lawyers
from
all
parts
that
they
did
not
know
where
to
seat
them
for
every
ticket
had
long
since
been
eagerly
sought
for
and
distributed
i
saw
at
the
end
of
the
room
behind
the
platform
a
special
partition
hurriedly
put
up
behind
which
all
these
lawyers
were
admitted
and
they
thought
themselves
lucky
to
have
standing
room
there
for
all
chairs
had
been
removed
for
the
sake
of
space
and
the
crowd
behind
the
partition
stood
throughout
the
case
closely
packed
shoulder
to
shoulder
some
of
the
ladies
especially
those
who
came
from
a
distance
made
their
appearance
in
the
gallery
very
smartly
dressed
but
the
majority
of
the
ladies
were
oblivious
even
of
dress
their
faces
betrayed
hysterical
intense
almost
morbid
curiosity
a
peculiar
factestablished
afterwards
by
many
observationswas
that
almost
all
the
ladies
or
at
least
the
vast
majority
of
them
were
on
mityas
side
and
in
favor
of
his
being
acquitted
this
was
perhaps
chiefly
owing
to
his
reputation
as
a
conqueror
of
female
hearts
it
was
known
that
two
women
rivals
were
to
appear
in
the
case
one
of
themkaterina
ivanovnawas
an
object
of
general
interest
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
tales
were
told
about
her
amazing
anecdotes
of
her
passion
for
mitya
in
spite
of
his
crime
her
pride
and
aristocratic
connections
were
particularly
insisted
upon
she
had
called
upon
scarcely
any
one
in
the
town
people
said
she
intended
to
petition
the
government
for
leave
to
accompany
the
criminal
to
siberia
and
to
be
married
to
him
somewhere
in
the
mines
the
appearance
of
grushenka
in
court
was
awaited
with
no
less
impatience
the
public
was
looking
forward
with
anxious
curiosity
to
the
meeting
of
the
two
rivalsthe
proud
aristocratic
girl
and
the
hetaira
but
grushenka
was
a
more
familiar
figure
to
the
ladies
of
the
district
than
katerina
ivanovna
they
had
already
seen
the
woman
who
had
ruined
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
his
unhappy
son
and
all
almost
without
exception
wondered
how
father
and
son
could
be
so
in
love
with
such
a
very
common
ordinary
russian
girl
who
was
not
even
pretty
in
brief
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
i
know
for
a
fact
that
there
were
several
serious
family
quarrels
on
mityas
account
in
our
town
many
ladies
quarreled
violently
with
their
husbands
over
differences
of
opinion
about
the
dreadful
case
and
it
was
only
natural
that
the
husbands
of
these
ladies
far
from
being
favorably
disposed
to
the
prisoner
should
enter
the
court
bitterly
prejudiced
against
him
in
fact
one
may
say
pretty
certainly
that
the
masculine
as
distinguished
from
the
feminine
part
of
the
audience
were
biased
against
the
prisoner
there
were
numbers
of
severe
frowning
even
vindictive
faces
mitya
indeed
had
managed
to
offend
many
people
during
his
stay
in
the
town
some
of
the
visitors
were
of
course
in
excellent
spirits
and
quite
unconcerned
as
to
the
fate
of
mitya
personally
but
all
were
interested
in
the
trial
and
the
majority
of
the
men
were
certainly
hoping
for
the
conviction
of
the
criminal
except
perhaps
the
lawyers
who
were
more
interested
in
the
legal
than
in
the
moral
aspect
of
the
case
everybody
was
excited
at
the
presence
of
the
celebrated
lawyer
fetyukovitch
his
talent
was
well
known
and
this
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
defended
notorious
criminal
cases
in
the
provinces
and
if
he
defended
them
such
cases
became
celebrated
and
long
remembered
all
over
russia
there
were
stories
too
about
our
prosecutor
and
about
the
president
of
the
court
it
was
said
that
ippolit
kirillovitch
was
in
a
tremor
at
meeting
fetyukovitch
and
that
they
had
been
enemies
from
the
beginning
of
their
careers
in
petersburg
that
though
our
sensitive
prosecutor
who
always
considered
that
he
had
been
aggrieved
by
some
one
in
petersburg
because
his
talents
had
not
been
properly
appreciated
was
keenly
excited
over
the
karamazov
case
and
was
even
dreaming
of
rebuilding
his
flagging
fortunes
by
means
of
it
fetyukovitch
they
said
was
his
one
anxiety
but
these
rumors
were
not
quite
just
our
prosecutor
was
not
one
of
those
men
who
lose
heart
in
face
of
danger
on
the
contrary
his
selfconfidence
increased
with
the
increase
of
danger
it
must
be
noted
that
our
prosecutor
was
in
general
too
hasty
and
morbidly
impressionable
he
would
put
his
whole
soul
into
some
case
and
work
at
it
as
though
his
whole
fate
and
his
whole
fortune
depended
on
its
result
this
was
the
subject
of
some
ridicule
in
the
legal
world
for
just
by
this
characteristic
our
prosecutor
had
gained
a
wider
notoriety
than
could
have
been
expected
from
his
modest
position
people
laughed
particularly
at
his
passion
for
psychology
in
my
opinion
they
were
wrong
and
our
prosecutor
was
i
believe
a
character
of
greater
depth
than
was
generally
supposed
but
with
his
delicate
health
he
had
failed
to
make
his
mark
at
the
outset
of
his
career
and
had
never
made
up
for
it
later
as
for
the
president
of
our
court
i
can
only
say
that
he
was
a
humane
and
cultured
man
who
had
a
practical
knowledge
of
his
work
and
progressive
views
he
was
rather
ambitious
but
did
not
concern
himself
greatly
about
his
future
career
the
great
aim
of
his
life
was
to
be
a
man
of
advanced
ideas
he
was
too
a
man
of
connections
and
property
he
felt
as
we
learnt
afterwards
rather
strongly
about
the
karamazov
case
but
from
a
social
not
from
a
personal
standpoint
he
was
interested
in
it
as
a
social
phenomenon
in
its
classification
and
its
character
as
a
product
of
our
social
conditions
as
typical
of
the
national
character
and
so
on
and
so
on
his
attitude
to
the
personal
aspect
of
the
case
to
its
tragic
significance
and
the
persons
involved
in
it
including
the
prisoner
was
rather
indifferent
and
abstract
as
was
perhaps
fitting
indeed
the
court
was
packed
and
overflowing
long
before
the
judges
made
their
appearance
our
court

dont
remember
in
the
body
of
the
hall
at
some
distance
came
the
seats
for
the
public
but
in
front
of
the
balustrade
a
few
chairs
had
been
placed
for
witnesses
who
remained
in
the
court
after
giving
their
evidence
at
ten
oclock
the
three
judges
arrivedthe
president
one
honorary
justice
of
the
peace
and
one
other
the
prosecutor
of
course
entered
immediately
after
the
president
was
a
short
stout
thickset
man
of
fifty
with
a
dyspeptic
complexion
dark
hair
turning
gray
and
cut
short
and
a
red
ribbon
of
what
order
i
dont
remember
the
prosecutor
struck
me
and
the
others
too
as
looking
particularly
pale
almost
green
his
face
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
thinner
perhaps
in
a
single
night
for
i
had
seen
him
looking
as
usual
only
two
days
before
the
president
began
with
asking
the
court
whether
all
the
jury
were
present
but
i
see
i
cant
go
on
like
this
partly
because
some
things
i
did
not
hear
others
i
did
not
notice
and
others
i
have
forgotten
but
most
of
all
because
as
i
have
said
before
i
have
literally
no
time
or
space
to
mention
everything
that
was
said
and
done
i
only
know
that
neither
side
objected
to
very
many
of
the
jurymen
i
remember
the
twelve
jurymenfour
were
petty
officials
of
the
town
two
were
merchants
and
six
peasants
and
artisans
of
the
town
i
remember
long
before
the
trial
questions
were
continually
asked
with
some
surprise
especially
by
ladies
can
such
a
delicate
complex
and
psychological
case
be
submitted
for
decision
to
petty
officials
and
even
peasants
and
what
can
an
official
still
more
a
peasant
understand
in
such
an
affair
all
the
four
officials
in
the
jury
were
in
fact
men
of
no
consequence
and
of
low
rank
except
one
who
was
rather
younger
they
were
grayheaded
men
little
known
in
society
who
had
vegetated
on
a
pitiful
salary
and
who
probably
had
elderly
unpresentable
wives
and
crowds
of
children
perhaps
even
without
shoes
and
stockings
at
most
they
spent
their
leisure
over
cards
and
of
course
had
never
read
a
single
book
the
two
merchants
looked
respectable
but
were
strangely
silent
and
stolid
one
of
them
was
closeshaven
and
was
dressed
in
european
style
the
other
had
a
small
gray
beard
and
wore
a
red
ribbon
with
some
sort
of
a
medal
upon
it
on
his
neck
there
is
no
need
to
speak
of
the
artisans
and
the
peasants
the
artisans
of
skotoprigonyevsk
are
almost
peasants
and
even
work
on
the
land
two
of
them
also
wore
european
dress
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
were
dirtier
and
more
uninvitinglooking
than
the
others
so
that
one
might
well
wonder
as
i
did
as
soon
as
i
had
looked
at
them
what
men
like
that
could
possibly
make
of
such
a
case
yet
their
faces
made
a
strangely
imposing
almost
menacing
impression
they
were
stern
and
frowning
at
last
the
president
opened
the
case
of
the
murder
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
karamazov
i
dont
quite
remember
how
he
described
him
the
court
usher
was
told
to
bring
in
the
prisoner
and
mitya
made
his
appearance
there
was
a
hush
through
the
court
one
could
have
heard
a
fly
i
dont
know
how
it
was
with
others
but
mitya
made
a
most
unfavorable
impression
on
me
he
looked
an
awful
dandy
in
a
brandnew
frockcoat
i
heard
afterwards
that
he
had
ordered
it
in
moscow
expressly
for
the
occasion
from
his
own
tailor
who
had
his
measure
he
wore
immaculate
black
kid
gloves
and
exquisite
linen
he
walked
in
with
his
yardlong
strides
looking
stiffly
straight
in
front
of
him
and
sat
down
in
his
place
with
a
most
unperturbed
air
at
the
same
moment
the
counsel
for
defense
the
celebrated
fetyukovitch
entered
and
a
sort
of
subdued
hum
passed
through
the
court
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
with
long
thin
legs
with
extremely
long
thin
pale
fingers
cleanshaven
face
demurely
brushed
rather
short
hair
and
thin
lips
that
were
at
times
curved
into
something
between
a
sneer
and
a
smile
he
looked
about
forty
his
face
would
have
been
pleasant
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
eyes
which
in
themselves
small
and
inexpressive
were
set
remarkably
close
together
with
only
the
thin
long
nose
as
a
dividing
line
between
them
in
fact
there
was
something
strikingly
birdlike
about
his
face
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
white
tie
i
remember
the
presidents
first
questions
to
mitya
about
his
name
his
calling
and
so
on
mitya
answered
sharply
and
his
voice
was
so
unexpectedly
loud
that
it
made
the
president
start
and
look
at
the
prisoner
with
surprise
then
followed
a
list
of
persons
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
proceedingsthat
is
of
the
witnesses
and
experts
it
was
a
long
list
four
of
the
witnesses
were
not
presentmisov
who
had
given
evidence
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
but
was
now
in
paris
madame
hohlakov
and
maximov
who
were
absent
through
illness
and
smerdyakov
through
his
sudden
death
of
which
an
official
statement
from
the
police
was
presented
the
news
of
smerdyakovs
death
produced
a
sudden
stir
and
whisper
in
the
court
many
of
the
audience
of
course
had
not
heard
of
the
sudden
suicide
what
struck
people
most
was
mityas
sudden
outburst
as
soon
as
the
statement
of
smerdyakovs
death
was
made
he
cried
out
aloud
from
his
place
he
was
a
dog
and
died
like
a
dog
i
remember
how
his
counsel
rushed
to
him
and
how
the
president
addressed
him
threatening
to
take
stern
measures
if
such
an
irregularity
were
repeated
mitya
nodded
and
in
a
subdued
voice
repeated
several
times
abruptly
to
his
counsel
with
no
show
of
regret
i
wont
again
i
wont
it
escaped
me
i
wont
do
it
again
and
of
course
this
brief
episode
did
him
no
good
with
the
jury
or
the
public
his
character
was
displayed
and
it
spoke
for
itself
it
was
under
the
influence
of
this
incident
that
the
opening
statement
was
read
it
was
rather
short
but
circumstantial
it
only
stated
the
chief
reasons
why
he
had
been
arrested
why
he
must
be
tried
and
so
on
yet
it
made
a
great
impression
on
me
the
clerk
read
it
loudly
and
distinctly
the
whole
tragedy
was
suddenly
unfolded
before
us
concentrated
in
bold
relief
in
a
fatal
and
pitiless
light
i
remember
how
immediately
after
it
had
been
read
the
president
asked
mitya
in
a
loud
impressive
voice
prisoner
do
you
plead
guilty
mitya
suddenly
rose
from
his
seat
i
plead
guilty
to
drunkenness
and
dissipation
he
exclaimed
again
in
a
startling
almost
frenzied
voice
to
idleness
and
debauchery
i
meant
to
become
an
honest
man
for
good
just
at
the
moment
when
i
was
struck
down
by
fate
but
i
am
not
guilty
of
the
death
of
that
old
man
my
enemy
and
my
father
no
no
i
am
not
guilty
of
robbing
him
i
could
not
be
dmitri
karamazov
is
a
scoundrel
but
not
a
thief
he
sat
down
again
visibly
trembling
all
over
the
president
again
briefly
but
impressively
admonished
him
to
answer
only
what
was
asked
and
not
to
go
off
into
irrelevant
exclamations
then
he
ordered
the
case
to
proceed
all
the
witnesses
were
led
up
to
take
the
oath
then
i
saw
them
all
together
the
brothers
of
the
prisoner
were
however
allowed
to
give
evidence
without
taking
the
oath
after
an
exhortation
from
the
priest
and
the
president
the
witnesses
were
led
away
and
were
made
to
sit
as
far
as
possible
apart
from
one
another
then
they
began
calling
them
up
one
by
one
chapter
ii
dangerous
witnesses
i
do
not
know
whether
the
witnesses
for
the
defense
and
for
the
prosecution
were
separated
into
groups
by
the
president
and
whether
it
was
arranged
to
call
them
in
a
certain
order
but
no
doubt
it
was
so
i
only
know
that
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
were
called
first
i
repeat
i
dont
intend
to
describe
all
the
questions
step
by
step
besides
my
account
would
be
to
some
extent
superfluous
because
in
the
speeches
for
the
prosecution
and
for
the
defense
the
whole
course
of
the
evidence
was
brought
together
and
set
in
a
strong
and
significant
light
and
i
took
down
parts
of
those
two
remarkable
speeches
in
full
and
will
quote
them
in
due
course
together
with
one
extraordinary
and
quite
unexpected
episode
which
occurred
before
the
final
speeches
and
undoubtedly
influenced
the
sinister
and
fatal
outcome
of
the
trial
i
will
only
observe
that
from
the
first
moments
of
the
trial
one
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
case
was
conspicuous
and
observed
by
all
that
is
the
overwhelming
strength
of
the
prosecution
as
compared
with
the
arguments
the
defense
had
to
rely
upon
every
one
realized
it
from
the
first
moment
that
the
facts
began
to
group
themselves
round
a
single
point
and
the
whole
horrible
and
bloody
crime
was
gradually
revealed
every
one
perhaps
felt
from
the
first
that
the
case
was
beyond
dispute
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
that
there
could
be
really
no
discussion
and
that
the
defense
was
only
a
matter
of
form
and
that
the
prisoner
was
guilty
obviously
and
conclusively
guilty
i
imagine
that
even
the
ladies
who
were
so
impatiently
longing
for
the
acquittal
of
the
interesting
prisoner
were
at
the
same
time
without
exception
convinced
of
his
guilt
whats
more
i
believe
they
would
have
been
mortified
if
his
guilt
had
not
been
so
firmly
established
as
that
would
have
lessened
the
effect
of
the
closing
scene
of
the
criminals
acquittal
that
he
would
be
acquitted
all
the
ladies
strange
to
say
were
firmly
persuaded
up
to
the
very
last
moment
he
is
guilty
but
he
will
be
acquitted
from
motives
of
humanity
in
accordance
with
the
new
ideas
the
new
sentiments
that
had
come
into
fashion
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
that
was
why
they
had
crowded
into
the
court
so
impatiently
the
men
were
more
interested
in
the
contest
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
famous
fetyukovitch
all
were
wondering
and
asking
themselves
what
could
even
a
talent
like
fetyukovitchs
make
of
such
a
desperate
case
and
so
they
followed
his
achievements
step
by
step
with
concentrated
attention
but
fetyukovitch
remained
an
enigma
to
all
up
to
the
very
end
up
to
his
speech
persons
of
experience
suspected
that
he
had
some
design
that
he
was
working
towards
some
object
but
it
was
almost
impossible
to
guess
what
it
was
his
confidence
and
selfreliance
were
unmistakable
however
every
one
noticed
with
pleasure
moreover
that
he
after
so
short
a
stay
not
more
than
three
days
perhaps
among
us
had
so
wonderfully
succeeded
in
mastering
the
case
and
had
studied
it
to
a
nicety
people
described
with
relish
afterwards
how
cleverly
he
had
taken
down
all
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
and
as
far
as
possible
perplexed
them
and
whats
more
had
aspersed
their
reputation
and
so
depreciated
the
value
of
their
evidence
but
it
was
supposed
that
he
did
this
rather
by
way
of
sport
so
to
speak
for
professional
glory
to
show
nothing
had
been
omitted
of
the
accepted
methods
for
all
were
convinced
that
he
could
do
no
real
good
by
such
disparagement
of
the
witnesses
and
probably
was
more
aware
of
this
than
any
one
having
some
idea
of
his
own
in
the
background
some
concealed
weapon
of
defense
which
he
would
suddenly
reveal
when
the
time
came
but
meanwhile
conscious
of
his
strength
he
seemed
to
be
diverting
himself
so
for
instance
when
grigory
fyodor
pavlovitchs
old
servant
who
had
given
the
most
damning
piece
of
evidence
about
the
open
door
was
examined
the
counsel
for
the
defense
positively
fastened
upon
him
when
his
turn
came
to
question
him
it
must
be
noted
that
grigory
entered
the
hall
with
a
composed
and
almost
stately
air
not
the
least
disconcerted
by
the
majesty
of
the
court
or
the
vast
audience
listening
to
him
he
gave
evidence
with
as
much
confidence
as
though
he
had
been
talking
with
his
marfa
only
perhaps
more
respectfully
it
was
impossible
to
make
him
contradict
himself
the
prosecutor
questioned
him
first
in
detail
about
the
family
life
of
the
karamazovs
the
family
picture
stood
out
in
lurid
colors
it
was
plain
to
ear
and
eye
that
the
witness
was
guileless
and
impartial
in
spite
of
his
profound
reverence
for
the
memory
of
his
deceased
master
he
yet
bore
witness
that
he
had
been
unjust
to
mitya
and
hadnt
brought
up
his
children
as
he
should
hed
have
been
devoured
by
lice
when
he
was
little
if
it
hadnt
been
for
me
he
added
describing
mityas
early
childhood
it
wasnt
fair
either
of
the
father
to
wrong
his
son
over
his
mothers
property
which
was
by
right
his
in
reply
to
the
prosecutors
question
what
grounds
he
had
for
asserting
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
wronged
his
son
in
their
money
relations
grigory
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
had
no
proof
at
all
to
bring
forward
but
he
still
persisted
that
the
arrangement
with
the
son
was
unfair
and
that
he
ought
to
have
paid
him
several
thousand
roubles
more
i
must
note
by
the
way
that
the
prosecutor
asked
this
question
whether
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
really
kept
back
part
of
mityas
inheritance
with
marked
persistence
of
all
the
witnesses
who
could
be
asked
it
not
excepting
alyosha
and
ivan
but
he
obtained
no
exact
information
from
any
one
all
alleged
that
it
was
so
but
were
unable
to
bring
forward
any
distinct
proof
grigorys
description
of
the
scene
at
the
dinnertable
when
dmitri
had
burst
in
and
beaten
his
father
threatening
to
come
back
to
kill
him
made
a
sinister
impression
on
the
court
especially
as
the
old
servants
composure
in
telling
it
his
parsimony
of
words
and
peculiar
phraseology
were
as
effective
as
eloquence
he
observed
that
he
was
not
angry
with
mitya
for
having
knocked
him
down
and
struck
him
on
the
face
he
had
forgiven
him
long
ago
he
said
of
the
deceased
smerdyakov
he
observed
crossing
himself
that
he
was
a
lad
of
ability
but
stupid
and
afflicted
and
worse
still
an
infidel
and
that
it
was
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
his
elder
son
who
had
taught
him
to
be
so
but
he
defended
smerdyakovs
honesty
almost
with
warmth
and
related
how
smerdyakov
had
once
found
the
masters
money
in
the
yard
and
instead
of
concealing
it
had
taken
it
to
his
master
who
had
rewarded
him
with
a
gold
piece
for
it
and
trusted
him
implicitly
from
that
time
forward
he
maintained
obstinately
that
the
door
into
the
garden
had
been
open
but
he
was
asked
so
many
questions
that
i
cant
recall
them
all
at
last
the
counsel
for
the
defense
began
to
crossexamine
him
and
the
first
question
he
asked
was
about
the
envelope
in
which
fyodor
pavlovitch
was
supposed
to
have
put
three
thousand
roubles
for
a
certain
person
have
you
ever
seen
it
you
who
were
for
so
many
years
in
close
attendance
on
your
master
grigory
answered
that
he
had
not
seen
it
and
had
never
heard
of
the
money
from
any
one
till
everybody
was
talking
about
it
this
question
about
the
envelope
fetyukovitch
put
to
every
one
who
could
conceivably
have
known
of
it
as
persistently
as
the
prosecutor
asked
his
question
about
dmitris
inheritance
and
got
the
same
answer
from
all
that
no
one
had
seen
the
envelope
though
many
had
heard
of
it
from
the
beginning
every
one
noticed
fetyukovitchs
persistence
on
this
subject
now
with
your
permission
ill
ask
you
a
question
fetyukovitch
said
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
of
what
was
that
balsam
or
rather
decoction
made
which
as
we
learn
from
the
preliminary
inquiry
you
used
on
that
evening
to
rub
your
lumbago
in
the
hope
of
curing
it
grigory
looked
blankly
at
the
questioner
and
after
a
brief
silence
muttered
there
was
saffron
in
it
nothing
but
saffron
dont
you
remember
any
other
ingredient
there
was
milfoil
in
it
too
and
pepper
perhaps
fetyukovitch
queried
yes
there
was
pepper
too
etcetera
and
all
dissolved
in
vodka
in
spirit
there
was
a
faint
sound
of
laughter
in
the
court
you
see
in
spirit
after
rubbing
your
back
i
believe
you
drank
what
was
left
in
the
bottle
with
a
certain
pious
prayer
only
known
to
your
wife
i
did
did
you
drink
much
roughly
speaking
a
wineglass
or
two
it
might
have
been
a
tumblerfull
a
tumblerfull
even
perhaps
a
tumbler
and
a
half
grigory
did
not
answer
he
seemed
to
see
what
was
meant
a
glass
and
a
half
of
neat
spiritis
not
at
all
bad
dont
you
think
you
might
see
the
gates
of
heaven
open
not
only
the
door
into
the
garden
grigory
remained
silent
there
was
another
laugh
in
the
court
the
president
made
a
movement
do
you
know
for
a
fact
fetyukovitch
persisted
whether
you
were
awake
or
not
when
you
saw
the
open
door
i
was
on
my
legs
thats
not
a
proof
that
you
were
awake
there
was
again
laughter
in
the
court
could
you
have
answered
at
that
moment
if
any
one
had
asked
you
a
questionfor
instance
what
year
it
is
i
dont
know
and
what
year
is
it
anno
domini
do
you
know
grigory
stood
with
a
perplexed
face
looking
straight
at
his
tormentor
strange
to
say
it
appeared
he
really
did
not
know
what
year
it
was
but
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
how
many
fingers
you
have
on
your
hands
i
am
a
servant
grigory
said
suddenly
in
a
loud
and
distinct
voice
if
my
betters
think
fit
to
make
game
of
me
it
is
my
duty
to
suffer
it
fetyukovitch
was
a
little
taken
aback
and
the
president
intervened
reminding
him
that
he
must
ask
more
relevant
questions
fetyukovitch
bowed
with
dignity
and
said
that
he
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
of
the
witness
the
public
and
the
jury
of
course
were
left
with
a
grain
of
doubt
in
their
minds
as
to
the
evidence
of
a
man
who
might
while
undergoing
a
certain
cure
have
seen
the
gates
of
heaven
and
who
did
not
even
know
what
year
he
was
living
in
but
before
grigory
left
the
box
another
episode
occurred
the
president
turning
to
the
prisoner
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
comment
to
make
on
the
evidence
of
the
last
witness
except
about
the
door
all
he
has
said
is
true
cried
mitya
in
a
loud
voice
for
combing
the
lice
off
me
i
thank
him
for
forgiving
my
blows
i
thank
him
the
old
man
has
been
honest
all
his
life
and
as
faithful
to
my
father
as
seven
hundred
poodles
prisoner
be
careful
in
your
language
the
president
admonished
him
i
am
not
a
poodle
grigory
muttered
all
right
its
i
am
a
poodle
myself
cried
mitya
if
its
an
insult
i
take
it
to
myself
and
i
beg
his
pardon
i
was
a
beast
and
cruel
to
him
i
was
cruel
to
sop
too
what
sop
the
president
asked
sternly
again
oh
pierrot

my
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
the
president
again
and
again
warned
mitya
impressively
and
very
sternly
to
be
more
careful
in
his
language
you
are
injuring
yourself
in
the
opinion
of
your
judges
the
counsel
for
the
defense
was
equally
clever
in
dealing
with
the
evidence
of
rakitin
i
may
remark
that
rakitin
was
one
of
the
leading
witnesses
and
one
to
whom
the
prosecutor
attached
great
significance
it
appeared
that
he
knew
everything
his
knowledge
was
amazing
he
had
been
everywhere
seen
everything
talked
to
everybody
knew
every
detail
of
the
biography
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
all
the
karamazovs
of
the
envelope
it
is
true
he
had
only
heard
from
mitya
himself
but
he
described
minutely
mityas
exploits
in
the
metropolis
all
his
compromising
doings
and
sayings
and
told
the
story
of
captain
snegiryovs
wisp
of
tow
but
even
rakitin
could
say
nothing
positive
about
mityas
inheritance
and
confined
himself
to
contemptuous
generalities
who
could
tell
which
of
them
was
to
blame
and
which
was
in
debt
to
the
other
with
their
crazy
karamazov
way
of
muddling
things
so
that
no
one
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
he
attributed
the
tragic
crime
to
the
habits
that
had
become
ingrained
by
ages
of
serfdom
and
the
distressed
condition
of
russia
due
to
the
lack
of
appropriate
institutions
he
was
in
fact
allowed
some
latitude
of
speech
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
rakitin
showed
what
he
could
do
and
attracted
notice
the
prosecutor
knew
that
the
witness
was
preparing
a
magazine
article
on
the
case
and
afterwards
in
his
speech
as
we
shall
see
later
quoted
some
ideas
from
the
article
showing
that
he
had
seen
it
already
the
picture
drawn
by
the
witness
was
a
gloomy
and
sinister
one
and
greatly
strengthened
the
case
for
the
prosecution
altogether
rakitins
discourse
fascinated
the
public
by
its
independence
and
the
extraordinary
nobility
of
its
ideas
there
were
even
two
or
three
outbreaks
of
applause
when
he
spoke
of
serfdom
and
the
distressed
condition
of
russia
but
rakitin
in
his
youthful
ardor
made
a
slight
blunder
of
which
the
counsel
for
the
defense
at
once
adroitly
took
advantage
answering
certain
questions
about
grushenka
and
carried
away
by
the
loftiness
of
his
own
sentiments
and
his
success
of
which
he
was
of
course
conscious
he
went
so
far
as
to
speak
somewhat
contemptuously
of
agrafena
alexandrovna
as
the
kept
mistress
of
samsonov
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
take
back
his
words
afterwards
for
fetyukovitch
caught
him
out
over
it
at
once
and
it
was
all
because
rakitin
had
not
reckoned
on
the
lawyer
having
been
able
to
become
so
intimately
acquainted
with
every
detail
in
so
short
a
time
allow
me
to
ask
began
the
counsel
for
the
defense
with
the
most
affable
and
even
respectful
smile
you
are
of
course
the
same
mr
rakitin
whose
pamphlet
the
life
of
the
deceased
elder
father
zossima
published
by
the
diocesan
authorities
full
of
profound
and
religious
reflections
and
preceded
by
an
excellent
and
devout
dedication
to
the
bishop
i
have
just
read
with
such
pleasure
i
did
not
write
it
for
publication

it
was
published
afterwards
muttered
rakitin
for
some
reason
fearfully
disconcerted
and
almost
ashamed
oh
thats
excellent
a
thinker
like
you
can
and
indeed
ought
to
take
the
widest
view
of
every
social
question
your
most
instructive
pamphlet
has
been
widely
circulated
through
the
patronage
of
the
bishop
and
has
been
of
appreciable
service
but
this
is
the
chief
thing
i
should
like
to
learn
from
you
you
stated
just
now
that
you
were
very
intimately
acquainted
with
madame
svyetlov
it
must
be
noted
that
grushenkas
surname
was
svyetlov
i
heard
it
for
the
first
time
that
day
during
the
case
i
cannot
answer
for
all
my
acquaintances
i
am
a
young
man

and
who
can
be
responsible
for
every
one
he
meets
cried
rakitin
flushing
all
over
i
understand
i
quite
understand
cried
fetyukovitch
as
though
he
too
were
embarrassed
and
in
haste
to
excuse
himself
you
like
any
other
might
well
be
interested
in
an
acquaintance
with
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
who
would
readily
entertain
the
lite
of
the
youth
of
the
neighborhood
but

i
only
wanted
to
know

it
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
madame
svyetlov
was
particularly
anxious
a
couple
of
months
ago
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
younger
karamazov
alexey
fyodorovitch
and
promised
you
twentyfive
roubles
if
you
would
bring
him
to
her
in
his
monastic
dress
and
that
actually
took
place
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
the
terrible
crime
which
is
the
subject
of
the
present
investigation
was
committed
you
brought
alexey
karamazov
to
madame
svyetlov
and
did
you
receive
the
twentyfive
roubles
from
madame
svyetlov
as
a
reward
thats
what
i
wanted
to
hear
from
you
it
was
a
joke
i
dont
see
of
what
interest
that
can
be
to
you
i
took
it
for
a
joke

meaning
to
give
it
back
later
then
you
did
take
but
you
have
not
given
it
back
yet

or
have
you
thats
of
no
consequence
muttered
rakitin
i
refuse
to
answer
such
questions
of
course
i
shall
give
it
back
the
president
intervened
but
fetyukovitch
declared
he
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
of
the
witness
mr
rakitin
left
the
witnessbox
not
absolutely
without
a
stain
upon
his
character
the
effect
left
by
the
lofty
idealism
of
his
speech
was
somewhat
marred
and
fetyukovitchs
expression
as
he
watched
him
walk
away
seemed
to
suggest
to
the
public
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
loftyminded
persons
who
accuse
him
i
remember
that
this
incident
too
did
not
pass
off
without
an
outbreak
from
mitya
enraged
by
the
tone
in
which
rakitin
had
referred
to
grushenka
he
suddenly
shouted
bernard
when
after
rakitins
cross
examination
the
president
asked
the
prisoner
if
he
had
anything
to
say
mitya
cried
loudly
since
ive
been
arrested
he
has
borrowed
money
from
me
he
is
a
contemptible
bernard
and
opportunist
and
he
doesnt
believe
in
god
he
took
the
bishop
in
mitya
of
course
was
pulled
up
again
for
the
intemperance
of
his
language
but
rakitin
was
done
for
captain
snegiryovs
evidence
was
a
failure
too
but
from
quite
a
different
reason
he
appeared
in
ragged
and
dirty
clothes
muddy
boots
and
in
spite
of
the
vigilance
and
expert
observation
of
the
police
officers
he
turned
out
to
be
hopelessly
drunk
on
being
asked
about
mityas
attack
upon
him
he
refused
to
answer
god
bless
him
ilusha
told
me
not
to
god
will
make
it
up
to
me
yonder
who
told
you
not
to
tell
of
whom
are
you
talking
ilusha
my
little
son
father
father
how
he
insulted
you
he
said
that
at
the
stone
now
he
is
dying
the
captain
suddenly
began
sobbing
and
plumped
down
on
his
knees
before
the
president
he
was
hurriedly
led
away
amidst
the
laughter
of
the
public
the
effect
prepared
by
the
prosecutor
did
not
come
off
at
all
fetyukovitch
went
on
making
the
most
of
every
opportunity
and
amazed
people
more
and
more
by
his
minute
knowledge
of
the
case
thus
for
example
trifon
borissovitch
made
a
great
impression
of
course
very
prejudicial
to
mitya
he
calculated
almost
on
his
fingers
that
on
his
first
visit
to
mokroe
mitya
must
have
spent
three
thousand
roubles
or
very
little
less
just
think
what
he
squandered
on
those
gypsy
girls
alone
and
as
for
our
lousy
peasants
it
wasnt
a
case
of
flinging
half
a
rouble
in
the
street
he
made
them
presents
of
twentyfive
roubles
each
at
least
he
didnt
give

stolen
from

and
if
any

did
steal
he
did
not

he

doing
his
best
to
satisfy
his
betters
when
fetyukovitch
had
to
crossexamine
him
he
scarcely
tried
to
refute
his
evidence
but
began
asking
him
about
an
incident
at
the
first
carousal
at
mokroe
a
month
before
the
arrest
when
timofey
and
another
peasant
called
akim
had
picked
up
on
the
floor
in
the
passage
a
hundred
roubles
dropped
by
mitya
when
he
was
drunk
and
had
given
them
to
trifon
borissovitch
and
received
a
rouble
each
from
him
for
doing
so
well
asked
the
lawyer
did
you
give
that
hundred
roubles
back
to
mr
karamazov
trifon
borissovitch
shuffled
in
vain
he
was
obliged
after
the
peasants
had
been
examined
to
admit
the
finding
of
the
hundred
roubles
only
adding
that
he
had
religiously
returned
it
all
to
dmitri
fyodorovitch
in
perfect
honesty
and
its
only
because
his
honor
was
in
liquor
at
the
time
he
wouldnt
remember
it
but
as
he
had
denied
the
incident
of
the
hundred
roubles
till
the
peasants
had
been
called
to
prove
it
his
evidence
as
to
returning
the
money
to
mitya
was
naturally
regarded
with
great
suspicion
so
one
of
the
most
dangerous
witnesses
brought
forward
by
the
prosecution
was
again
discredited
the
same
thing
happened
with
the
poles
they
took
up
an
attitude
of
pride
and
independence
they
vociferated
loudly
that
they
had
both
been
in
the
service
of
the
crown
and
that
pan
mitya
had
offered
them
three
thousand
to
buy
their
honor
and
that
they
had
seen
a
large
sum
of
money
in
his
hands
pan
mussyalovitch
introduced
a
terrible
number
of
polish
words
into
his
sentences
and
seeing
that
this
only
increased
his
consequence
in
the
eyes
of
the
president
and
the
prosecutor
grew
more
and
more
pompous
and
ended
by
talking
in
polish
altogether
but
fetyukovitch
caught
them
too
in
his
snares
trifon
borissovitch
recalled
was
forced
in
spite
of
his
evasions
to
admit
that
pan
vrublevsky
had
substituted
another
pack
of
cards
for
the
one
he
had
provided
and
that
pan
mussyalovitch
had
cheated
during
the
game
kalganov
confirmed
this
and
both
the
poles
left
the
witnessbox
with
damaged
reputations
amidst
laughter
from
the
public
then
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
with
almost
all
the
most
dangerous
witnesses
fetyukovitch
succeeded
in
casting
a
slur
on
all
of
them
and
dismissing
them
with
a
certain
derision
the
lawyers
and
experts
were
lost
in
admiration
and
were
only
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
good
purpose
could
be
served
by
it
for
all
i
repeat
felt
that
the
case
for
the
prosecution
could
not
be
refuted
but
was
growing
more
and
more
tragically
overwhelming
but
from
the
confidence
of
the
great
magician
they
saw
that
he
was
serene
and
they
waited
feeling
that
such
a
man
had
not
come
from
petersburg
for
nothing
and
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
return

the
medical
experts
and
a
pound
of
nuts
the
evidence
of
the
medical
experts
too
was
of
little
use
to
the
prisoner
and
it
appeared
later
that
fetyukovitch
had
not
reckoned
much
upon
it
the
medical
line
of
defense
had
only
been
taken
up
through
the
insistence
of
katerina
ivanovna
who
had
sent
for
a
celebrated
doctor
from
moscow
on
purpose
the
case
for
the
defense
could
of
course
lose
nothing
by
it
and
might
with
luck
gain
something
from
it
there
was
however
an
element
of
comedy
about
it
through
the
difference
of
opinion
of
the
doctors
the
medical
experts
were
the
famous
doctor
from
moscow
our
doctor
herzenstube
and
the
young
doctor
varvinsky
the
two
latter
appeared
also
as
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
the
first
to
be
called
in
the
capacity
of
expert
was
doctor
herzenstube
he
was
a
gray
and
bald
old
man
of
seventy
of
middle
height
and
sturdy
build
he
was
much
esteemed
and
respected
by
every
one
in
the
town
he
was
a
conscientious
doctor
and
an
excellent
and
pious
man
a
hernguter
or
moravian
brother
i
am
not
quite
sure
which
he
had
been
living
amongst
us
for
many
years
and
behaved
with
wonderful
dignity
he
was
a
kindhearted
and
humane
man
he
treated
the
sick
poor
and
peasants
for
nothing
visited
them
in
their
slums
and
huts
and
left
money
for
medicine
but
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
if
once
he
had
taken
an
idea
into
his
head
there
was
no
shaking
it
almost
every
one
in
the
town
was
aware
by
the
way
that
the
famous
doctor
had
within
the
first
two
or
three
days
of
his
presence
among
us
uttered
some
extremely
offensive
allusions
to
doctor
herzenstubes
qualifications
though
the
moscow
doctor
asked
twentyfive
roubles
for
a
visit
several
people
in
the
town
were
glad
to
take
advantage
of
his
arrival
and
rushed
to
consult
him
regardless
of
expense
all
these
had
of
course
been
previously
patients
of
doctor
herzenstube
and
the
celebrated
doctor
had
criticized
his
treatment
with
extreme
harshness
finally
he
had
asked
the
patients
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
well
who
has
been
cramming
you
with
nostrums
herzenstube
he
he
doctor
herzenstube
of
course
heard
all
this
and
now
all
the
three
doctors
made
their
appearance
one
after
another
to
be
examined
doctor
herzenstube
roundly
declared
that
the
abnormality
of
the
prisoners
mental
faculties
was
selfevident
then
giving
his
grounds
for
this
opinion
which
i
omit
here
he
added
that
the
abnormality
was
not
only
evident
in
many
of
the
prisoners
actions
in
the
past
but
was
apparent
even
now
at
this
very
moment
when
he
was
asked
to
explain
how
it
was
apparent
now
at
this
moment
the
old
doctor
with
simplehearted
directness
pointed
out
that
the
prisoner
on
entering
the
court
had
an
extraordinary
air
remarkable
in
the
circumstances
that
he
had
marched
in
like
a
soldier
looking
straight
before
him
though
it
would
have
been
more
natural
for
him
to
look
to
the
left
where
among
the
public
the
ladies
were
sitting
seeing
that
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
and
must
be
thinking
much
of
what
the
ladies
are
saying
of
him
now
the
old
man
concluded
in
his
peculiar
language
i
must
add
that
he
spoke
russian
readily
but
every
phrase
was
formed
in
german
style
which
did
not
however
trouble
him
for
it
had
always
been
a
weakness
of
his
to
believe
that
he
spoke
russian
perfectly
better
indeed
than
russians
and
he
was
very
fond
of
using
russian
proverbs
always
declaring
that
the
russian
proverbs
were
the
best
and
most
expressive
sayings
in
the
whole
world
i
may
remark
too
that
in
conversation
through
absentmindedness
he
often
forgot
the
most
ordinary
words
which
sometimes
went
out
of
his
head
though
he
knew
them
perfectly
the
same
thing
happened
though
when
he
spoke
german
and
at
such
times
he
always
waved
his
hand
before
his
face
as
though
trying
to
catch
the
lost
word
and
no
one
could
induce
him
to
go
on
speaking
till
he
had
found
the
missing
word
his
remark
that
the
prisoner
ought
to
have
looked
at
the
ladies
on
entering
roused
a
whisper
of
amusement
in
the
audience
all
our
ladies
were
very
fond
of
our
old
doctor
they
knew
too
that
having
been
all
his
life
a
bachelor
and
a
religious
man
of
exemplary
conduct
he
looked
upon
women
as
lofty
creatures
and
so
his
unexpected
observation
struck
every
one
as
very
queer
the
moscow
doctor
being
questioned
in
his
turn
definitely
and
emphatically
repeated
that
he
considered
the
prisoners
mental
condition
abnormal
in
the
highest
degree
he
talked
at
length
and
with
erudition
of
aberration
and
mania
and
argued
that
from
all
the
facts
collected
the
prisoner
had
undoubtedly
been
in
a
condition
of
aberration
for
several
days
before
his
arrest
and
if
the
crime
had
been
committed
by
him
it
must
even
if
he
were
conscious
of
it
have
been
almost
involuntary
as
he
had
not
the
power
to
control
the
morbid
impulse
that
possessed
him
but
apart
from
temporary
aberration
the
doctor
diagnosed
mania
which
premised
in
his
words
to
lead
to
complete
insanity
in
the
future
it
must
be
noted
that
i
report
this
in
my
own
words
the
doctor
made
use
of
very
learned
and
professional
language
all
his
actions
are
in
contravention
of
common
sense
and
logic
he
continued
not
to
refer
to
what
i
have
not
seen
that
is
the
crime
itself
and
the
whole
catastrophe
the
day
before
yesterday
while
he
was
talking
to
me
he
had
an
unaccountably
fixed
look
in
his
eye
he
laughed
unexpectedly
when
there
was
nothing
to
laugh
at
he
showed
continual
and
inexplicable
irritability
using
strange
words
bernard
ethics
and
others
equally
inappropriate
but
the
doctor
detected
mania
above
all
in
the
fact
that
the
prisoner
could
not
even
speak
of
the
three
thousand
roubles
of
which
he
considered
himself
to
have
been
cheated
without
extraordinary
irritation
though
he
could
speak
comparatively
lightly
of
other
misfortunes
and
grievances
according
to
all
accounts
he
had
even
in
the
past
whenever
the
subject
of
the
three
thousand
roubles
was
touched
on
flown
into
a
perfect
frenzy
and
yet
he
was
reported
to
be
a
disinterested
and
not
grasping
man
as
to
the
opinion
of
my
learned
colleague
the
moscow
doctor
added
ironically
in
conclusion
that
the
prisoner
would
on
entering
the
court
have
naturally
looked
at
the
ladies
and
not
straight
before
him
i
will
only
say
that
apart
from
the
playfulness
of
this
theory
it
is
radically
unsound
for
though
i
fully
agree
that
the
prisoner
on
entering
the
court
where
his
fate
will
be
decided
would
not
naturally
look
straight
before
him
in
that
fixed
way
and
that
that
may
really
be
a
sign
of
his
abnormal
mental
condition
at
the
same
time
i
maintain
that
he
would
naturally
not
look
to
the
left
at
the
ladies
but
on
the
contrary
to
the
right
to
find
his
legal
adviser
on
whose
help
all
his
hopes
rest
and
on
whose
defense
all
his
future
depends
the
doctor
expressed
his
opinion
positively
and
emphatically
but
the
unexpected
pronouncement
of
doctor
varvinsky
gave
the
last
touch
of
comedy
to
the
difference
of
opinion
between
the
experts
in
his
opinion
the
prisoner
was
now
and
had
been
all
along
in
a
perfectly
normal
condition
and
although
he
certainly
must
have
been
in
a
nervous
and
exceedingly
excited
state
before
his
arrest
this
might
have
been
due
to
several
perfectly
obvious
causes
jealousy
anger
continual
drunkenness
and
so
on
but
this
nervous
condition
would
not
involve
the
mental
aberration
of
which
mention
had
just
been
made
as
to
the
question
whether
the
prisoner
should
have
looked
to
the
left
or
to
the
right
on
entering
the
court
in
his
modest
opinion
the
prisoner
would
naturally
look
straight
before
him
on
entering
the
court
as
he
had
in
fact
done
as
that
was
where
the
judges
on
whom
his
fate
depended
were
sitting
so
that
it
was
just
by
looking
straight
before
him
that
he
showed
his
perfectly
normal
state
of
mind
at
the
present
the
young
doctor
concluded
his
modest
testimony
with
some
heat
bravo
doctor
cried
mitya
from
his
seat
just
so
mitya
of
course
was
checked
but
the
young
doctors
opinion
had
a
decisive
influence
on
the
judges
and
on
the
public
and
as
appeared
afterwards
every
one
agreed
with
him
but
doctor
herzenstube
when
called
as
a
witness
was
quite
unexpectedly
of
use
to
mitya
as
an
old
resident
in
the
town
who
had
known
the
karamazov
family
for
years
he
furnished
some
facts
of
great
value
for
the
prosecution
and
suddenly
as
though
recalling
something
he
added
but
the
poor
young
man
might
have
had
a
very
different
life
for
he
had
a
good
heart
both
in
childhood
and
after
childhood
that
i
know
but
the
russian
proverb
says
if
a
man
has
one
head
its
good
but
if
another
clever
man
comes
to
visit
him
it
would
be
better
still
for
then
there
will
be
two
heads
and
not
only
one

one
head
is
good
but
two
are
better
the
prosecutor
put
in
impatiently
he
knew
the
old
mans
habit
of
talking
slowly
and
deliberately
regardless
of
the
impression
he
was
making
and
of
the
delay
he
was
causing
and
highly
prizing
his
flat
dull
and
always
gleefully
complacent
german
wit
the
old
man
was
fond
of
making
jokes
oh
yes
thats
what
i
say
he
went
on
stubbornly
one
head
is
good
but
two
are
much
better
but
he
did
not
meet
another
head
with
wits
and
his
wits
went
where
did
they
go
ive
forgotten
the
word
he
went
on
passing
his
hand
before
his
eyes
oh
yes
spazieren
wandering
oh
yes
wandering
thats
what
i
say
well
his
wits
went
wandering
and
fell
in
such
a
deep
hole
that
he
lost
himself
and
yet
he
was
a
grateful
and
sensitive
boy
oh
i
remember
him
very
well
a
little
chap
so
high
left
neglected
by
his
father
in
the
back
yard
when
he
ran
about
without
boots
on
his
feet
and
his
little
breeches
hanging
by
one
button
a
note
of
feeling
and
tenderness
suddenly
came
into
the
honest
old
mans
voice
fetyukovitch
positively
started
as
though
scenting
something
and
caught
at
it
instantly
oh
yes
i
was
a
young
man
then
i
was

well
i
was
fortyfive
then
and
had
only
just
come
here
and
i
was
so
sorry
for
the
boy
then
i
asked
myself
why
shouldnt
i
buy
him
a
pound
of

a
pound
of
what
ive
forgotten
what
its
called
a
pound
of
what
children
are
very
fond
of
what
is
it
what
is
it
the
doctor
began
waving
his
hands
again
it
grows
on
a
tree
and
is
gathered
and
given
to
every
one
apples
oh
no
no
you
have
a
dozen
of
apples
not
a
pound
no
there
are
a
lot
of
them
and
all
little
you
put
them
in
the
mouth
and
crack
nuts
quite
so
nuts
i
say
so
the
doctor
repeated
in
the
calmest
way
as
though
he
had
been
at
no
loss
for
a
word
and
i
bought
him
a
pound
of
nuts
for
no
one
had
ever
bought
the
boy
a
pound
of
nuts
before
and
i
lifted
my
finger
and
said
to
him
boy
gott
der
vater
he
laughed
and
said
gott
der
vater
gott
der
sohn
he
laughed
again
and
lisped
gott
der
sohn
gott
der
heilige
geist
then
he
laughed
and
said
as
best
he
could
gott
der
heilige
geist
i
went
away
and
two
days
after
i
happened
to
be
passing
and
he
shouted
to
me
of
himself
uncle
gott
der
vater
gott
der
sohn
and
he
had
only
forgotten
gott
der
heilige
geist
but
i
reminded
him
of
it
and
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
again
but
he
was
taken
away
and
i
did
not
see
him
again
twenty
three
years
passed
i
am
sitting
one
morning
in
my
study
a
whitehaired
old
man
when
there
walks
into
the
room
a
blooming
young
man
whom
i
should
never
have
recognized
but
he
held
up
his
finger
and
said
laughing
gott
der
vater
gott
der
sohn
and
gott
der
heilige
geist
i
have
just
arrived
and
have
come
to
thank
you
for
that
pound
of
nuts
for
no
one
else
ever
bought
me
a
pound
of
nuts
you
are
the
only
one
that
ever
did
and
then
i
remembered
my
happy
youth
and
the
poor
child
in
the
yard
without
boots
on
his
feet
and
my
heart
was
touched
and
i
said
you
are
a
grateful
young
man
for
you
have
remembered
all
your
life
the
pound
of
nuts
i
bought
you
in
your
childhood
and
i
embraced
him
and
blessed
him
and
i
shed
tears
he
laughed
but
he
shed
tears
too

for
the
russian
often
laughs
when
he
ought
to
be
weeping
but
he
did
weep
i
saw
it
and
now
alas
and
i
am
weeping
now
german
i
am
weeping
now
too
you
saintly
man
mitya
cried
suddenly
in
any
case
the
anecdote
made
a
certain
favorable
impression
on
the
public
but
the
chief
sensation
in
mityas
favor
was
created
by
the
evidence
of
katerina
ivanovna
which
i
will
describe
directly
indeed
when
the
witnesses

dcharge
that
is
called
by
the
defense
began
giving
evidence
fortune
seemed
all
at
once
markedly
more
favorable
to
mitya
and
what
was
particularly
striking
this
was
a
surprise
even
to
the
counsel
for
the
defense
but
before
katerina
ivanovna
was
called
alyosha
was
examined
and
he
recalled
a
fact
which
seemed
to
furnish
positive
evidence
against
one
important
point
made
by
the
prosecution
chapter
iv
fortune
smiles
on
mitya
it
came
quite
as
a
surprise
even
to
alyosha
himself
he
was
not
required
to
take
the
oath
and
i
remember
that
both
sides
addressed
him
very
gently
and
sympathetically
it
was
evident
that
his
reputation
for
goodness
had
preceded
him
alyosha
gave
his
evidence
modestly
and
with
restraint
but
his
warm
sympathy
for
his
unhappy
brother
was
unmistakable
in
answer
to
one
question
he
sketched
his
brothers
character
as
that
of
a
man
violenttempered
perhaps
and
carried
away
by
his
passions
but
at
the
same
time
honorable
proud
and
generous
capable
of
selfsacrifice
if
necessary
he
admitted
however
that
through
his
passion
for
grushenka
and
his
rivalry
with
his
father
his
brother
had
been
of
late
in
an
intolerable
position
but
he
repelled
with
indignation
the
suggestion
that
his
brother
might
have
committed
a
murder
for
the
sake
of
gain
though
he
recognized
that
the
three
thousand
roubles
had
become
almost
an
obsession
with
mitya
that
he
looked
upon
them
as
part
of
the
inheritance
he
had
been
cheated
of
by
his
father
and
that
indifferent
as
he
was
to
money
as
a
rule
he
could
not
even
speak
of
that
three
thousand
without
fury
as
for
the
rivalry
of
the
two
ladies
as
the
prosecutor
expressed
itthat
is
of
grushenka
and
katyahe
answered
evasively
and
was
even
unwilling
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
altogether
did
your
brother
tell
you
anyway
that
he
intended
to
kill
your
father
asked
the
prosecutor
you
can
refuse
to
answer
if
you
think
necessary
he
added
he
did
not
tell
me
so
directly
answered
alyosha
how
so
did
he
indirectly
he
spoke
to
me
once
of
his
hatred
for
our
father
and
his
fear
that
at
an
extreme
moment

at
a
moment
of
fury
he
might
perhaps
murder
him
and
you
believed
him
i
am
afraid
to
say
that
i
did
but
i
never
doubted
that
some
higher
feeling
would
always
save
him
at
the
fatal
moment
as
it
has
indeed
saved
him
for
it
was
not
he
killed
my
father
alyosha
said
firmly
in
a
loud
voice
that
was
heard
throughout
the
court
the
prosecutor
started
like
a
warhorse
at
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
let
me
assure
you
that
i
fully
believe
in
the
complete
sincerity
of
your
conviction
and
do
not
explain
it
by
or
identify
it
with
your
affection
for
your
unhappy
brother
your
peculiar
view
of
the
whole
tragic
episode
is
known
to
us
already
from
the
preliminary
investigation
i
wont
attempt
to
conceal
from
you
that
it
is
highly
individual
and
contradicts
all
the
other
evidence
collected
by
the
prosecution
and
so
i
think
it
essential
to
press
you
to
tell
me
what
facts
have
led
you
to
this
conviction
of
your
brothers
innocence
and
of
the
guilt
of
another
person
against
whom
you
gave
evidence
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
i
only
answered
the
questions
asked
me
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
replied
alyosha
slowly
and
calmly
i
made
no
accusation
against
smerdyakov
of
myself
yet
you
gave
evidence
against
him
i
was
led
to
do
so
by
my
brother
dmitris
words
i
was
told
what
took
place
at
his
arrest
and
how
he
had
pointed
to
smerdyakov
before
i
was
examined
i
believe
absolutely
that
my
brother
is
innocent
and
if
he
didnt
commit
the
murder
then
then
smerdyakov
why
smerdyakov
and
why
are
you
so
completely
persuaded
of
your
brothers
innocence
i
cannot
help
believing
my
brother
i
know
he
wouldnt
lie
to
me
i
saw
from
his
face
he
wasnt
lying
only
from
his
face
is
that
all
the
proof
you
have
i
have
no
other
proof
and
of
smerdyakovs
guilt
you
have
no
proof
whatever
but
your
brothers
word
and
the
expression
of
his
face
no
i
have
no
other
proof
the
prosecutor
dropped
the
examination
at
this
point
the
impression
left
by
alyoshas
evidence
on
the
public
was
most
disappointing
there
had
been
talk
about
smerdyakov
before
the
trial
some
one
had
heard
something
some
one
had
pointed
out
something
else
it
was
said
that
alyosha
had
gathered
together
some
extraordinary
proofs
of
his
brothers
innocence
and
smerdyakovs
guilt
and
after
all
there
was
nothing
no
evidence
except
certain
moral
convictions
so
natural
in
a
brother
but
fetyukovitch
began
his
crossexamination
on
his
asking
alyosha
when
it
was
that
the
prisoner
had
told
him
of
his
hatred
for
his
father
and
that
he
might
kill
him
and
whether
he
had
heard
it
for
instance
at
their
last
meeting
before
the
catastrophe
alyosha
started
as
he
answered
as
though
only
just
recollecting
and
understanding
something
i
remember
one
circumstance
now
which
id
quite
forgotten
myself
it
wasnt
clear
to
me
at
the
time
but
now
and
obviously
only
now
for
the
first
time
struck
by
an
idea
he
recounted
eagerly
how
at
his
last
interview
with
mitya
that
evening
under
the
tree
on
the
road
to
the
monastery
mitya
had
struck
himself
on
the
breast
the
upper
part
of
the
breast
and
had
repeated
several
times
that
he
had
a
means
of
regaining
his
honor
that
that
means
was
here
here
on
his
breast
i
thought
when
he
struck
himself
on
the
breast
he
meant
that
it
was
in
his
heart
alyosha
continued
that
he
might
find
in
his
heart
strength
to
save
himself
from
some
awful
disgrace
which
was
awaiting
him
and
which
he
did
not
dare
confess
even
to
me
i
must
confess
i
did
think
at
the
time
that
he
was
speaking
of
our
father
and
that
the
disgrace
he
was
shuddering
at
was
the
thought
of
going
to
our
father
and
doing
some
violence
to
him
yet
it
was
just
then
that
he
pointed
to
something
on
his
breast
so
that
i
remember
the
idea
struck
me
at
the
time
that
the
heart
is
not
on
that
part
of
the
breast
but
below
and
that
he
struck
himself
much
too
high
just
below
the
neck
and
kept
pointing
to
that
place
my
idea
seemed
silly
to
me
at
the
time
but
he
was
perhaps
pointing
then
to
that
little
bag
in
which
he
had
fifteen
hundred
roubles
just
so
mitya
cried
from
his
place
thats
right
alyosha
it
was
the
little
bag
i
struck
with
my
fist
fetyukovitch
flew
to
him
in
hot
haste
entreating
him
to
keep
quiet
and
at
the
same
instant
pounced
on
alyosha
alyosha
carried
away
himself
by
his
recollection
warmly
expressed
his
theory
that
this
disgrace
was
probably
just
that
fifteen
hundred
roubles
on
him
which
he
might
have
returned
to
katerina
ivanovna
as
half
of
what
he
owed
her
but
which
he
had
yet
determined
not
to
repay
her
and
to
use
for
another
purposenamely
to
enable
him
to
elope
with
grushenka
if
she
consented
it
is
so
it
must
be
so
exclaimed
alyosha
in
sudden
excitement
my
brother
cried
several
times
that
half
of
the
disgrace
half
of
it
he
said
half
several
times
he
could
free
himself
from
at
once
but
that
he
was
so
unhappy
in
his
weakness
of
will
that
he
wouldnt
do
it

that
he
knew
beforehand
he
was
incapable
of
doing
it
and
you
clearly
confidently
remember
that
he
struck
himself
just
on
this
part
of
the
breast
fetyukovitch
asked
eagerly
clearly
and
confidently
for
i
thought
at
the
time
why
does
he
strike
himself
up
there
when
the
heart
is
lower
down
and
the
thought
seemed
stupid
to
me
at
the
time

i
remember
its
seeming
stupid

it
flashed
through
my
mind
thats
what
brought
it
back
to
me
just
now
how
could
i
have
forgotten
it
till
now
it
was
that
little
bag
he
meant
when
he
said
he
had
the
means
but
wouldnt
give
back
that
fifteen
hundred
and
when
he
was
arrested
at
mokroe
he
cried
outi
know
i
was
told
itthat
he
considered
it
the
most
disgraceful
act
of
his
life
that
when
he
had
the
means
of
repaying
katerina
ivanovna
half
half
note
what
he
owed
her
he
yet
could
not
bring
himself
to
repay
the
money
and
preferred
to
remain
a
thief
in
her
eyes
rather
than
part
with
it
and
what
torture
what
torture
that
debt
has
been
to
him
alyosha
exclaimed
in
conclusion
the
prosecutor
of
course
intervened
he
asked
alyosha
to
describe
once
more
how
it
had
all
happened
and
several
times
insisted
on
the
question
had
the
prisoner
seemed
to
point
to
anything
perhaps
he
had
simply
struck
himself
with
his
fist
on
the
breast
but
it
was
not
with
his
fist
cried
alyosha
he
pointed
with
his
fingers
and
pointed
here
very
high
up
how
could
i
have
so
completely
forgotten
it
till
this
moment
the
president
asked
mitya
what
he
had
to
say
to
the
last
witnesss
evidence
mitya
confirmed
it
saying
that
he
had
been
pointing
to
the
fifteen
hundred
roubles
which
were
on
his
breast
just
below
the
neck
and
that
that
was
of
course
the
disgrace
a
disgrace
i
cannot
deny
the
most
shameful
act
of
my
whole
life
cried
mitya
i
might
have
repaid
it
and
didnt
repay
it
i
preferred
to
remain
a
thief
in
her
eyes
rather
than
give
it
back
and
the
most
shameful
part
of
it
was
that
i
knew
beforehand
i
shouldnt
give
it
back
you
are
right
alyosha
thanks
alyosha
so
alyoshas
crossexamination
ended
what
was
important
and
striking
about
it
was
that
one
fact
at
least
had
been
found
and
even
though
this
were
only
one
tiny
bit
of
evidence
a
mere
hint
at
evidence
it
did
go
some
little
way
towards
proving
that
the
bag
had
existed
and
had
contained
fifteen
hundred
roubles
and
that
the
prisoner
had
not
been
lying
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
when
he
alleged
at
mokroe
that
those
fifteen
hundred
roubles
were
his
own
alyosha
was
glad
with
a
flushed
face
he
moved
away
to
the
seat
assigned
to
him
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
how
was
it
i
forgot
how
could
i
have
forgotten
it
and
what
made
it
come
back
to
me
now
katerina
ivanovna
was
called
to
the
witnessbox
as
she
entered
something
extraordinary
happened
in
the
court
the
ladies
clutched
their
lorgnettes
and
operaglasses
there
was
a
stir
among
the
men
some
stood
up
to
get
a
better
view
everybody
alleged
afterwards
that
mitya
had
turned
white
as
a
sheet
on
her
entrance
all
in
black
she
advanced
modestly
almost
timidly
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
her
face
that
she
was
agitated
but
there
was
a
resolute
gleam
in
her
dark
and
gloomy
eyes
i
may
remark
that
many
people
mentioned
that
she
looked
particularly
handsome
at
that
moment
she
spoke
softly
but
clearly
so
that
she
was
heard
all
over
the
court
she
expressed
herself
with
composure
or
at
least
tried
to
appear
composed
the
president
began
his
examination
discreetly
and
very
respectfully
as
though
afraid
to
touch
on
certain
chords
and
showing
consideration
for
her
great
unhappiness
but
in
answer
to
one
of
the
first
questions
katerina
ivanovna
replied
firmly
that
she
had
been
formerly
betrothed
to
the
prisoner
until
he
left
me
of
his
own
accord
she
added
quietly
when
they
asked
her
about
the
three
thousand
she
had
entrusted
to
mitya
to
post
to
her
relations
she
said
firmly
i
didnt
give
him
the
money
simply
to
send
it
off
i
felt
at
the
time
that
he
was
in
great
need
of
money
i
gave
him
the
three
thousand
on
the
understanding
that
he
should
post
it
within
the
month
if
he
cared
to
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
worry
himself
about
that
debt
afterwards
i
will
not
repeat
all
the
questions
asked
her
and
all
her
answers
in
detail
i
will
only
give
the
substance
of
her
evidence
i
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
would
send
off
that
sum
as
soon
as
he
got
money
from
his
father
she
went
on
i
have
never
doubted
his
disinterestedness
and
his
honesty

his
scrupulous
honesty

in
money
matters
he
felt
quite
certain
that
he
would
receive
the
money
from
his
father
and
spoke
to
me
several
times
about
it
i
knew
he
had
a
feud
with
his
father
and
have
always
believed
that
he
had
been
unfairly
treated
by
his
father
i
dont
remember
any
threat
uttered
by
him
against
his
father
he
certainly
never
uttered
any
such
threat
before
me
if
he
had
come
to
me
at
that
time
i
should
have
at
once
relieved
his
anxiety
about
that
unlucky
three
thousand
roubles
but
he
had
given
up
coming
to
see
me

and
i
myself
was
put
in
such
a
position

that
i
could
not
invite
him
and
i
had
no
right
indeed
to
be
exacting
as
to
that
money
she
added
suddenly
and
there
was
a
ring
of
resolution
in
her
voice
i
was
once
indebted
to
him
for
assistance
in
money
for
more
than
three
thousand
and
i
took
it
although
i
could
not
at
that
time
foresee
that
i
should
ever
be
in
a
position
to
repay
my
debt
there
was
a
note
of
defiance
in
her
voice
it
was
then
fetyukovitch
began
his
crossexamination
did
that
take
place
not
here
but
at
the
beginning
of
your
acquaintance
fetyukovitch
suggested
cautiously
feeling
his
way
instantly
scenting
something
favorable
i
must
mention
in
parenthesis
that
though
fetyukovitch
had
been
brought
from
petersburg
partly
at
the
instance
of
katerina
ivanovna
herself
he
knew
nothing
about
the
episode
of
the
four
thousand
roubles
given
her
by
mitya
and
of
her
bowing
to
the
ground
to
him
she
concealed
this
from
him
and
said
nothing
about
it
and
that
was
strange
it
may
be
pretty
certainly
assumed
that
she
herself
did
not
know
till
the
very
last
minute
whether
she
would
speak
of
that
episode
in
the
court
and
waited
for
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
no
i
can
never
forget
those
moments
she
began
telling
her
story
she
told
everything
the
whole
episode
that
mitya
had
told
alyosha
and
her
bowing
to
the
ground
and
her
reason
she
told
about
her
father
and
her
going
to
mitya
and
did
not
in
one
word
in
a
single
hint
suggest
that
mitya
had
himself
through
her
sister
proposed
they
should
send
him
katerina
ivanovna
to
fetch
the
money
she
generously
concealed
that
and
was
not
ashamed
to
make
it
appear
as
though
she
had
of
her
own
impulse
run
to
the
young
officer
relying
on
something

to
beg
him
for
the
money
it
was
something
tremendous
i
turned
cold
and
trembled
as
i
listened
the
court
was
hushed
trying
to
catch
each
word
it
was
something
unexampled
even
from
such
a
selfwilled
and
contemptuously
proud
girl
as
she
was
such
an
extremely
frank
avowal
such
sacrifice
such
selfimmolation
seemed
incredible
and
for
what
for
whom
to
save
the
man
who
had
deceived
and
insulted
her
and
to
help
in
however
small
a
degree
in
saving
him
by
creating
a
strong
impression
in
his
favor
and
indeed
the
figure
of
the
young
officer
who
with
a
respectful
bow
to
the
innocent
girl
handed
her
his
last
four
thousand
roublesall
he
had
in
the
worldwas
thrown
into
a
very
sympathetic
and
attractive
light
but

i
had
a
painful
misgiving
at
heart
i
felt
that
calumny
might
come
of
it
later
and
it
did
in
fact
it
did
it
was
repeated
all
over
the
town
afterwards
with
spiteful
laughter
that
the
story
was
perhaps
not
quite
completethat
is
in
the
statement
that
the
officer
had
let
the
young
lady
depart
with
nothing
but
a
respectful
bow
it
was
hinted
that
something
was
here
omitted
and
even
if
nothing
had
been
omitted
if
this
were
the
whole
story
the
most
highly
respected
of
our
ladies
maintained
even
then
its
very
doubtful
whether
it
was
creditable
for
a
young
girl
to
behave
in
that
way
even
for
the
sake
of
saving
her
father
and
can
katerina
ivanovna
with
her
intelligence
her
morbid
sensitiveness
have
failed
to
understand
that
people
would
talk
like
that
she
must
have
understood
it
yet
she
made
up
her
mind
to
tell
everything
of
course
all
these
nasty
little
suspicions
as
to
the
truth
of
her
story
only
arose
afterwards
and
at
the
first
moment
all
were
deeply
impressed
by
it
as
for
the
judges
and
the
lawyers
they
listened
in
reverent
almost
shamefaced
silence
to
katerina
ivanovna
the
prosecutor
did
not
venture
upon
even
one
question
on
the
subject
fetyukovitch
made
a
low
bow
to
her
oh
he
was
almost
triumphant
much
ground
had
been
gained
for
a
man
to
give
his
last
four
thousand
on
a
generous
impulse
and
then
for
the
same
man
to
murder
his
father
for
the
sake
of
robbing
him
of
three
thousandthe
idea
seemed
too
incongruous
fetyukovitch
felt
that
now
the
charge
of
theft
at
least
was
as
good
as
disproved
the
case
was
thrown
into
quite
a
different
light
there
was
a
wave
of
sympathy
for
mitya
as
for
him
i
was
told
that
once
or
twice
while
katerina
ivanovna
was
giving
her
evidence
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
sank
back
again
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
but
when
she
had
finished
he
suddenly
cried
in
a
sobbing
voice
katya
why
have
you
ruined
me
and
his
sobs
were
audible
all
over
the
court
but
he
instantly
restrained
himself
and
cried
again
now
i
am
condemned
then
he
sat
rigid
in
his
place
with
his
teeth
clenched
and
his
arms
across
his
chest
katerina
ivanovna
remained
in
the
court
and
sat
down
in
her
place
she
was
pale
and
sat
with
her
eyes
cast
down
those
who
were
sitting
near
her
declared
that
for
a
long
time
she
shivered
all
over
as
though
in
a
fever
grushenka
was
called
i
am
approaching
the
sudden
catastrophe
which
was
perhaps
the
final
cause
of
mityas
ruin
for
i
am
convinced
so
is
every
oneall
the
lawyers
said
the
same
afterwardsthat
if
the
episode
had
not
occurred
the
prisoner
would
at
least
have
been
recommended
to
mercy
but
of
that
later
a
few
words
first
about
grushenka
she
too
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
with
her
magnificent
black
shawl
on
her
shoulders
she
walked
to
the
witnessbox
with
her
smooth
noiseless
tread
with
the
slightly
swaying
gait
common
in
women
of
full
figure
she
looked
steadily
at
the
president
turning
her
eyes
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
to
my
thinking
she
looked
very
handsome
at
that
moment
and
not
at
all
pale
as
the
ladies
alleged
afterwards
they
declared
too
that
she
had
a
concentrated
and
spiteful
expression
i
believe
that
she
was
simply
irritated
and
painfully
conscious
of
the
contemptuous
and
inquisitive
eyes
of
our
scandalloving
public
she
was
proud
and
could
not
stand
contempt
she
was
one
of
those
people
who
flare
up
angry
and
eager
to
retaliate
at
the
mere
suggestion
of
contempt
there
was
an
element
of
timidity
too
of
course
and
inward
shame
at
her
own
timidity
so
it
was
not
strange
that
her
tone
kept
changing
at
one
moment
it
was
angry
contemptuous
and
rough
and
at
another
there
was
a
sincere
note
of
self
condemnation
sometimes
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
taking
a
desperate
plunge
as
though
she
felt
i
dont
care
what
happens
ill
say
it
apropos
of
her
acquaintance
with
fyodor
pavlovitch
she
remarked
curtly
thats
all
nonsense
and
was
it
my
fault
that
he
would
pester
me
but
a
minute
later
she
added
it
was
all
my
fault
i
was
laughing
at
them
bothat
the
old
man
and
at
him
tooand
i
brought
both
of
them
to
this
it
was
all
on
account
of
me
it
happened
samsonovs
name
came
up
somehow
thats
nobodys
business
she
snapped
at
once
with
a
sort
of
insolent
defiance
he
was
my
benefactor
he
took
me
when
i
hadnt
a
shoe
to
my
foot
when
my
family
had
turned
me
out
the
president
reminded
her
though
very
politely
that
she
must
answer
the
questions
directly
without
going
off
into
irrelevant
details
grushenka
crimsoned
and
her
eyes
flashed
the
envelope
with
the
notes
in
it
she
had
not
seen
but
had
only
heard
from
that
wicked
wretch
that
fyodor
pavlovitch
had
an
envelope
with
notes
for
three
thousand
in
it
but
that
was
all
foolishness
i
was
only
laughing
i
wouldnt
have
gone
to
him
for
anything
to
whom
are
you
referring
as
that
wicked
wretch
inquired
the
prosecutor
the
lackey
smerdyakov
who
murdered
his
master
and
hanged
himself
last
night
she
was
of
course
at
once
asked
what
ground
she
had
for
such
a
definite
accusation
but
it
appeared
that
she
too
had
no
grounds
for
it
dmitri
fyodorovitch
told
me
so
himself
you
can
believe
him
the
woman
who
came
between
us
has
ruined
him
she
is
the
cause
of
it
all
let
me
tell
you
grushenka
added
she
seemed
to
be
quivering
with
hatred
and
there
was
a
vindictive
note
in
her
voice
she
was
again
asked
to
whom
she
was
referring
the
young
lady
katerina
ivanovna
there
she
sent
for
me
offered
me
chocolate
tried
to
fascinate
me
theres
not
much
true
shame
about
her
i
can
tell
you
that
at
this
point
the
president
checked
her
sternly
begging
her
to
moderate
her
language
but
the
jealous
womans
heart
was
burning
and
she
did
not
care
what
she
did
when
the
prisoner
was
arrested
at
mokroe
the
prosecutor
asked
every
one
saw
and
heard
you
run
out
of
the
next
room
and
cry
out
its
all
my
fault
well
go
to
siberia
together
so
you
already
believed
him
to
have
murdered
his
father
i
dont
remember
what
i
felt
at
the
time
answered
grushenka
every
one
was
crying
out
that
he
had
killed
his
father
and
i
felt
that
it
was
my
fault
that
it
was
on
my
account
he
had
murdered
him
but
when
he
said
he
wasnt
guilty
i
believed
him
at
once
and
i
believe
him
now
and
always
shall
believe
him
he
is
not
the
man
to
tell
a
lie
fetyukovitch
began
his
crossexamination
i
remember
that
among
other
things
he
asked
about
rakitin
and
the
twentyfive
roubles
you
paid
him
for
bringing
alexey
fyodorovitch
karamazov
to
see
you
there
was
nothing
strange
about
his
taking
the
money
sneered
grushenka
with
angry
contempt
he
was
always
coming
to
me
for
money
he
used
to
get
thirty
roubles
a
month
at
least
out
of
me
chiefly
for
luxuries
he
had
enough
to
keep
him
without
my
help
what
led
you
to
be
so
liberal
to
mr
rakitin
fetyukovitch
asked
in
spite
of
an
uneasy
movement
on
the
part
of
the
president
why
he
is
my
cousin
his
mother
was
my
mothers
sister
but
hes
always
besought
me
not
to
tell
any
one
here
of
it
he
is
so
dreadfully
ashamed
of
me
this
fact
was
a
complete
surprise
to
every
one
no
one
in
the
town
nor
in
the
monastery
not
even
mitya
knew
of
it
i
was
told
that
rakitin
turned
purple
with
shame
where
he
sat
grushenka
had
somehow
heard
before
she
came
into
the
court
that
he
had
given
evidence
against
mitya
and
so
she
was
angry
the
whole
effect
on
the
public
of
rakitins
speech
of
his
noble
sentiments
of
his
attacks
upon
serfdom
and
the
political
disorder
of
russia
was
this
time
finally
ruined
fetyukovitch
was
satisfied
it
was
another
godsend
grushenkas
crossexamination
did
not
last
long
and
of
course
there
could
be
nothing
particularly
new
in
her
evidence
she
left
a
very
disagreeable
impression
on
the
public
hundreds
of
contemptuous
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
as
she
finished
giving
her
evidence
and
sat
down
again
in
the
court
at
a
good
distance
from
katerina
ivanovna
mitya
was
silent
throughout
her
evidence
he
sat
as
though
turned
to
stone
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
ivan
was
called
to
give
evidence
chapter
v
a
sudden
catastrophe
i
may
note
that
he
had
been
called
before
alyosha
but
the
usher
of
the
court
announced
to
the
president
that
owing
to
an
attack
of
illness
or
some
sort
of
fit
the
witness
could
not
appear
at
the
moment
but
was
ready
to
give
his
evidence
as
soon
as
he
recovered
but
no
one
seemed
to
have
heard
it
and
it
only
came
out
later
his
entrance
was
for
the
first
moment
almost
unnoticed
the
principal
witnesses
especially
the
two
rival
ladies
had
already
been
questioned
curiosity
was
satisfied
for
the
time
the
public
was
feeling
almost
fatigued
several
more
witnesses
were
still
to
be
heard
who
probably
had
little
information
to
give
after
all
that
had
been
given
time
was
passing
ivan
walked
up
with
extraordinary
slowness
looking
at
no
one
and
with
his
head
bowed
as
though
plunged
in
gloomy
thought
he
was
irreproachably
dressed
but
his
face
made
a
painful
impression
on
me
at
least
there
was
an
earthy
look
in
it
a
look
like
a
dying
mans
his
eyes
were
lusterless
he
raised
them
and
looked
slowly
round
the
court
alyosha
jumped
up
from
his
seat
and
moaned
ah
i
remember
that
but
it
was
hardly
noticed
the
president
began
by
informing
him
that
he
was
a
witness
not
on
oath
that
he
might
answer
or
refuse
to
answer
but
that
of
course
he
must
bear
witness
according
to
his
conscience
and
so
on
and
so
on
ivan
listened
and
looked
at
him
blankly
but
his
face
gradually
relaxed
into
a
smile
and
as
soon
as
the
president
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
finished
he
laughed
outright
well
and
what
else
he
asked
in
a
loud
voice
there
was
a
hush
in
the
court
there
was
a
feeling
of
something
strange
the
president
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
you

are
perhaps
still
unwell
he
began
looking
everywhere
for
the
usher
dont
trouble
yourself
your
excellency
i
am
well
enough
and
can
tell
you
something
interesting
ivan
answered
with
sudden
calmness
and
respectfulness
you
have
some
special
communication
to
make
the
president
went
on
still
mistrustfully
ivan
looked
down
waited
a
few
seconds
and
raising
his
head
answered
almost
stammering
no

i
havent
i
have
nothing
particular
they
began
asking
him
questions
he
answered
as
it
were
reluctantly
with
extreme
brevity
with
a
sort
of
disgust
which
grew
more
and
more
marked
though
he
answered
rationally
to
many
questions
he
answered
that
he
did
not
know
he
knew
nothing
of
his
fathers
money
relations
with
dmitri
i
wasnt
interested
in
the
subject
he
added
threats
to
murder
his
father
he
had
heard
from
the
prisoner
of
the
money
in
the
envelope
he
had
heard
from
smerdyakov
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
he
interrupted
suddenly
with
a
look
of
weariness
i
have
nothing
particular
to
tell
the
court
i
see
you
are
unwell
and
understand
your
feelings
the
president
began
he
turned
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
the
defense
to
invite
them
to
examine
the
witness
if
necessary
when
ivan
suddenly
asked
in
an
exhausted
voice
let
me
go
your
excellency
i
feel
very
ill
and
with
these
words
without
waiting
for
permission
he
turned
to
walk
out
of
the
court
but
after
taking
four
steps
he
stood
still
as
though
he
had
reached
a
decision
smiled
slowly
and
went
back
i
am
like
the
peasant
girl
your
excellency

you
know
how
does
it
go
ill
stand
up
if
i
like
and
i
wont
if
i
dont
they
were
trying
to
put
on
her
sarafan
to
take
her
to
church
to
be
married
and
she
said
ill
stand
up
if
i
like
and
i
wont
if
i
dont
its
in
some
book
about
the
peasantry
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
president
asked
severely
why
this
ivan
suddenly
pulled
out
a
roll
of
notes
heres
the
money

the
notes
that
lay
in
that
envelope
he
nodded
towards
the
table
on
which
lay
the
material
evidence
for
the
sake
of
which
our
father
was
murdered
where
shall
i
put
them
mr
superintendent
take
them
the
usher
of
the
court
took
the
whole
roll
and
handed
it
to
the
president
how
could
this
money
have
come
into
your
possession
if
it
is
the
same
money
the
president
asked
wonderingly
i
got
them
from
smerdyakov
from
the
murderer
yesterday
i
was
with
him
just
before
he
hanged
himself
it
was
he
not
my
brother
killed
our
father
he
murdered
him
and
i
incited
him
to
do
it

who
doesnt
desire
his
fathers
death
are
you
in
your
right
mind
broke
involuntarily
from
the
president
i
should
think
i
am
in
my
right
mind

in
the
same
nasty
mind
as
all
of
you

as
all
these

ugly
faces
he
turned
suddenly
to
the
audience
my
father
has
been
murdered
and
they
pretend
they
are
horrified
he
snarled
with
furious
contempt
they
keep
up
the
sham
with
one
another
liars
they
all
desire
the
death
of
their
fathers
one
reptile
devours
another
if
there
hadnt
been
a
murder
theyd
have
been
angry
and
gone
home
illhumored
its
a
spectacle
they
want
panem
et
circenses
though
i
am
one
to
talk
have
you
any
water
give
me
a
drink
for
christs
sake
he
suddenly
clutched
his
head
the
usher
at
once
approached
him
alyosha
jumped
up
and
cried
he
is
ill
dont
believe
him
he
has
brain
fever
katerina
ivanovna
rose
impulsively
from
her
seat
and
rigid
with
horror
gazed
at
ivan
mitya
stood
up
and
greedily
looked
at
his
brother
and
listened
to
him
with
a
wild
strange
smile
dont
disturb
yourselves
i
am
not
mad
i
am
only
a
murderer
ivan
began
again
you
cant
expect
eloquence
from
a
murderer
he
added
suddenly
for
some
reason
and
laughed
a
queer
laugh
the
prosecutor
bent
over
to
the
president
in
obvious
dismay
the
two
other
judges
communicated
in
agitated
whispers
fetyukovitch
pricked
up
his
ears
as
he
listened
the
hall
was
hushed
in
expectation
the
president
seemed
suddenly
to
recollect
himself
witness
your
words
are
incomprehensible
and
impossible
here
calm
yourself
if
you
can
and
tell
your
story

if
you
really
have
something
to
tell
how
can
you
confirm
your
statement

if
indeed
you
are
not
delirious
thats
just
it
i
have
no
proof
that
cur
smerdyakov
wont
send
you
proofs
from
the
other
world

in
an
envelope
you
think
of
nothing
but
envelopesone
is
enough
ive
no
witnesses

except
one
perhaps
he
smiled
thoughtfully
who
is
your
witness
he
has
a
tail
your
excellency
and
that
would
be
irregular
le
diable
nexiste
point
dont
pay
attention
he
is
a
paltry
pitiful
devil
he
added
suddenly
he
ceased
laughing
and
spoke
as
it
were
confidentially
he
is
here
somewhere
no
doubtunder
that
table
with
the
material
evidence
on
it
perhaps
where
should
he
sit
if
not
there
you
see
listen
to
me
i
told
him
i
dont
want
to
keep
quiet
and
he
talked
about
the
geological
cataclysm

idiocy
come
release
the
monster

hes
been
singing
a
hymn
thats
because
his
heart
is
light
its
like
a
drunken
man
in
the
street
bawling
how
vanka
went
to
petersburg
and
i
would
give
a
quadrillion
quadrillions
for
two
seconds
of
joy
you
dont
know
me
oh
how
stupid
all
this
business
is
come
take
me
instead
of
him
i
didnt
come
for
nothing
why
why
is
everything
so
stupid
and
he
began
slowly
and
as
it
were
reflectively
looking
round
him
again
but
the
court
was
all
excitement
by
now
alyosha
rushed
towards
him
but
the
court
usher
had
already
seized
ivan
by
the
arm
what
are
you
about
he
cried
staring
into
the
mans
face
and
suddenly
seizing
him
by
the
shoulders
he
flung
him
violently
to
the
floor
but
the
police
were
on
the
spot
and
he
was
seized
he
screamed
furiously
and
all
the
time
he
was
being
removed
he
yelled
and
screamed
something
incoherent
the
whole
court
was
thrown
into
confusion
i
dont
remember
everything
as
it
happened
i
was
excited
myself
and
could
not
follow
i
only
know
that
afterwards
when
everything
was
quiet
again
and
every
one
understood
what
had
happened
the
court
usher
came
in
for
a
reprimand
though
he
very
reasonably
explained
that
the
witness
had
been
quite
well
that
the
doctor
had
seen
him
an
hour
ago
when
he
had
a
slight
attack
of
giddiness
but
that
until
he
had
come
into
the
court
he
had
talked
quite
consecutively
so
that
nothing
could
have
been
foreseenthat
he
had
in
fact
insisted
on
giving
evidence
but
before
every
one
had
completely
regained
their
composure
and
recovered
from
this
scene
it
was
followed
by
another
katerina
ivanovna
had
an
attack
of
hysterics
she
sobbed
shrieking
loudly
but
refused
to
leave
the
court
struggled
and
besought
them
not
to
remove
her
suddenly
she
cried
to
the
president
there
is
more
evidence
i
must
give
at
once

at
once
here
is
a
document
a
letter

take
it
read
it
quickly
quickly
its
a
letter
from
that
monster

that
man
there
there
she
pointed
to
mitya
it
was
he
killed
his
father
you
will
see
that
directly
he
wrote
to
me
how
he
would
kill
his
father
but
the
other
one
is
ill
he
is
ill
he
is
delirious
she
kept
crying
out
beside
herself
the
court
usher
took
the
document
she
held
out
to
the
president
and
she
dropping
into
her
chair
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
began
convulsively
and
noiselessly
sobbing
shaking
all
over
and
stifling
every
sound
for
fear
she
should
be
ejected
from
the
court
the
document
she
had
handed
up
was
that
letter
mitya
had
written
at
the
metropolis
tavern
which
ivan
had
spoken
of
as
a
mathematical
proof
alas
its
mathematical
conclusiveness
was
recognized
and
had
it
not
been
for
that
letter
mitya
might
have
escaped
his
doom
or
at
least
that
doom
would
have
been
less
terrible
it
was
i
repeat
difficult
to
notice
every
detail
what
followed
is
still
confused
to
my
mind
the
president
must
i
suppose
have
at
once
passed
on
the
document
to
the
judges
the
jury
and
the
lawyers
on
both
sides
i
only
remember
how
they
began
examining
the
witness
on
being
gently
asked
by
the
president
whether
she
had
recovered
sufficiently
katerina
ivanovna
exclaimed
impetuously
i
am
ready
i
am
ready
i
am
quite
equal
to
answering
you
she
added
evidently
still
afraid
that
she
would
somehow
be
prevented
from
giving
evidence
she
was
asked
to
explain
in
detail
what
this
letter
was
and
under
what
circumstances
she
received
it
i
received
it
the
day
before
the
crime
was
committed
but
he
wrote
it
the
day
before
that
at
the
tavernthat
is
two
days
before
he
committed
the
crime
look
it
is
written
on
some
sort
of
bill
she
cried
breathlessly
he
hated
me
at
that
time
because
he
had
behaved
contemptibly
and
was
running
after
that
creature

and
because
he
owed
me
that
three
thousand
oh
he
was
humiliated
by
that
three
thousand
on
account
of
his
own
meanness
this
is
how
it
happened
about
that
three
thousand
i
beg
you
i
beseech
you
to
hear
me
three
weeks
before
he
murdered
his
father
he
came
to
me
one
morning
i
knew
he
was
in
want
of
money
and
what
he
wanted
it
for
yes
yesto
win
that
creature
and
carry
her
off
i
knew
then
that
he
had
been
false
to
me
and
meant
to
abandon
me
and
it
was
i
i
who
gave
him
that
money
who
offered
it
to
him
on
the
pretext
of
his
sending
it
to
my
sister
in
moscow
and
as
i
gave
it
him
i
looked
him
in
the
face
and
said
that
he
could
send
it
when
he
liked
in
a
months
time
would
do
how
how
could
he
have
failed
to
understand
that
i
was
practically
telling
him
to
his
face
you
want
money
to
be
false
to
me
with
your
creature
so
heres
the
money
for
you
i
give
it
to
you
myself
take
it
if
you
have
so
little
honor
as
to
take
it
i
wanted
to
prove
what
he
was
and
what
happened
he
took
it
he
took
it
and
squandered
it
with
that
creature
in
one
night
but
he
knew
he
knew
that
i
knew
all
about
it
i
assure
you
he
understood
too
that
i
gave
him
that
money
to
test
him
to
see
whether
he
was
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
honor
as
to
take
it
from
me
i
looked
into
his
eyes
and
he
looked
into
mine
and
he
understood
it
all
and
he
took
ithe
carried
off
my
money
thats
true
katya
mitya
roared
suddenly
i
looked
into
your
eyes
and
i
knew
that
you
were
dishonoring
me
and
yet
i
took
your
money
despise
me
as
a
scoundrel
despise
me
all
of
you
ive
deserved
it
prisoner
cried
the
president
another
word
and
i
will
order
you
to
be
removed
that
money
was
a
torment
to
him
katya
went
on
with
impulsive
haste
he
wanted
to
repay
it
me
he
wanted
to
thats
true
but
he
needed
money
for
that
creature
too
so
he
murdered
his
father
but
he
didnt
repay
me
and
went
off
with
her
to
that
village
where
he
was
arrested
there
again
he
squandered
the
money
he
had
stolen
after
the
murder
of
his
father
and
a
day
before
the
murder
he
wrote
me
this
letter
he
was
drunk
when
he
wrote
it
i
saw
it
at
once
at
the
time
he
wrote
it
from
spite
and
feeling
certain
positively
certain
that
i
should
never
show
it
to
any
one
even
if
he
did
kill
him
or
else
he
wouldnt
have
written
it
for
he
knew
i
shouldnt
want
to
revenge
myself
and
ruin
him
but
read
it
read
it
attentivelymore
attentively
pleaseand
you
will
see
that
he
had
described
it
all
in
his
letter
all
beforehand
how
he
would
kill
his
father
and
where
his
money
was
kept
look
please
dont
overlook
that
theres
one
phrase
there
i
shall
kill
him
as
soon
as
ivan
has
gone
away
so
he
thought
it
all
out
beforehand
how
he
would
kill
him
katerina
ivanovna
pointed
out
to
the
court
with
venomous
and
malignant
triumph
oh
it
was
clear
she
had
studied
every
line
of
that
letter
and
detected
every
meaning
underlining
it
if
he
hadnt
been
drunk
he
wouldnt
have
written
to
me
but
look
everything
is
written
there
beforehand
just
as
he
committed
the
murder
after
a
complete
program
of
it
she
exclaimed
frantically
she
was
reckless
now
of
all
consequences
to
herself
though
no
doubt
she
had
foreseen
them
even
a
month
ago
for
even
then
perhaps
shaking
with
anger
she
had
pondered
whether
to
show
it
at
the
trial
or
not
now
she
had
taken
the
fatal
plunge
i
remember
that
the
letter
was
read
aloud
by
the
clerk
directly
afterwards
i
believe
it
made
an
overwhelming
impression
they
asked
mitya
whether
he
admitted
having
written
the
letter
its
mine
mine
cried
mitya
i
shouldnt
have
written
it
if
i
hadnt
been
drunk
weve
hated
each
other
for
many
things
katya
but
i
swear
i
swear
i
loved
you
even
while
i
hated
you
and
you
didnt
love
me
he
sank
back
on
his
seat
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
the
prosecutor
and
counsel
for
the
defense
began
crossexamining
her
chiefly
to
ascertain
what
had
induced
her
to
conceal
such
a
document
and
to
give
her
evidence
in
quite
a
different
tone
and
spirit
just
before
yes
yes
i
was
telling
lies
just
now
i
was
lying
against
my
honor
and
my
conscience
but
i
wanted
to
save
him
for
he
has
hated
and
despised
me
so
katya
cried
madly
oh
he
has
despised
me
horribly
he
has
always
despised
me
and
do
you
know
he
has
despised
me
from
the
very
moment
that
i
bowed
down
to
him
for
that
money
i
saw
that
i
felt
it
at
once
at
the
time
but
for
a
long
time
i
wouldnt
believe
it
how
often
i
have
read
it
in
his
eyes
you
came
of
yourself
though
oh
he
didnt
understand
he
had
no
idea
why
i
ran
to
him
he
can
suspect
nothing
but
baseness
he
judged
me
by
himself
he
thought
every
one
was
like
himself
katya
hissed
furiously
in
a
perfect
frenzy
and
he
only
wanted
to
marry
me
because
id
inherited
a
fortune
because
of
that
because
of
that
i
always
suspected
it
was
because
of
that
oh
he
is
a
brute
he
was
always
convinced
that
i
should
be
trembling
with
shame
all
my
life
before
him
because
i
went
to
him
then
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
despise
me
for
ever
for
it
and
so
to
be
superior
to
methats
why
he
wanted
to
marry
me
thats
so
thats
all
so
i
tried
to
conquer
him
by
my
lovea
love
that
knew
no
bounds
i
even
tried
to
forgive
his
faithlessness
but
he
understood
nothing
nothing
how
could
he
understand
indeed
he
is
a
monster
i
only
received
that
letter
the
next
evening
it
was
brought
me
from
the
tavernand
only
that
morning
only
that
morning
i
wanted
to
forgive
him
everything
everythingeven
his
treachery
the
president
and
the
prosecutor
of
course
tried
to
calm
her
i
cant
help
thinking
that
they
felt
ashamed
of
taking
advantage
of
her
hysteria
and
of
listening
to
such
avowals
i
remember
hearing
them
say
to
her
we
understand
how
hard
it
is
for
you
be
sure
we
are
able
to
feel
for
you
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
yet
they
dragged
the
evidence
out
of
the
raving
hysterical
woman
she
described
at
last
with
extraordinary
clearness
which
is
so
often
seen
though
only
for
a
moment
in
such
overwrought
states
how
ivan
had
been
nearly
driven
out
of
his
mind
during
the
last
two
months
trying
to
save
the
monster
and
murderer
his
brother
he
tortured
himself
she
exclaimed
he
was
always
trying
to
minimize
his
brothers
guilt
and
confessing
to
me
that
he
too
had
never
loved
his
father
and
perhaps
desired
his
death
himself
oh
he
has
a
tender
over
tender
conscience
he
tormented
himself
with
his
conscience
he
told
me
everything
everything
he
came
every
day
and
talked
to
me
as
his
only
friend
i
have
the
honor
to
be
his
only
friend
she
cried
suddenly
with
a
sort
of
defiance
and
her
eyes
flashed
he
had
been
twice
to
see
smerdyakov
one
day
he
came
to
me
and
said
if
it
was
not
my
brother
but
smerdyakov
committed
the
murder
for
the
legend
was
circulating
everywhere
that
smerdyakov
had
done
it
perhaps
i
too
am
guilty
for
smerdyakov
knew
i
didnt
like
my
father
and
perhaps
believed
that
i
desired
my
fathers
death
then
i
brought
out
that
letter
and
showed
it
him
he
was
entirely
convinced
that
his
brother
had
done
it
and
he
was
overwhelmed
by
it
he
couldnt
endure
the
thought
that
his
own
brother
was
a
parricide
only
a
week
ago
i
saw
that
it
was
making
him
ill
during
the
last
few
days
he
has
talked
incoherently
in
my
presence
i
saw
his
mind
was
giving
way
he
walked
about
raving
he
was
seen
muttering
in
the
streets
the
doctor
from
moscow
at
my
request
examined
him
the
day
before
yesterday
and
told
me
that
he
was
on
the
eve
of
brain
feverand
all
on
his
account
on
account
of
this
monster
and
last
night
he
learnt
that
smerdyakov
was
dead
it
was
such
a
shock
that
it
drove
him
out
of
his
mind

and
all
through
this
monster
all
for
the
sake
of
saving
the
monster
oh
of
course
such
an
outpouring
such
an
avowal
is
only
possible
once
in
a
lifetimeat
the
hour
of
death
for
instance
on
the
way
to
the
scaffold
but
it
was
in
katyas
character
and
it
was
such
a
moment
in
her
life
it
was
the
same
impetuous
katya
who
had
thrown
herself
on
the
mercy
of
a
young
profligate
to
save
her
father
the
same
katya
who
had
just
before
in
her
pride
and
chastity
sacrificed
herself
and
her
maidenly
modesty
before
all
these
people
telling
of
mityas
generous
conduct
in
the
hope
of
softening
his
fate
a
little
and
now
again
she
sacrificed
herself
but
this
time
it
was
for
another
and
perhaps
only
nowperhaps
only
at
this
momentshe
felt
and
knew
how
dear
that
other
was
to
her
she
had
sacrificed
herself
in
terror
for
him
conceiving
all
of
a
sudden
that
he
had
ruined
himself
by
his
confession
that
it
was
he
who
had
committed
the
murder
not
his
brother
she
had
sacrificed
herself
to
save
him
to
save
his
good
name
his
reputation
and
yet
one
terrible
doubt
occurred
to
onewas
she
lying
in
her
description
of
her
former
relations
with
mityathat
was
the
question
no
she
had
not
intentionally
slandered
him
when
she
cried
that
mitya
despised
her
for
her
bowing
down
to
him
she
believed
it
herself
she
had
been
firmly
convinced
perhaps
ever
since
that
bow
that
the
simplehearted
mitya
who
even
then
adored
her
was
laughing
at
her
and
despising
her
she
had
loved
him
with
an
hysterical
lacerated
love
only
from
pride
from
wounded
pride
and
that
love
was
not
like
love
but
more
like
revenge
oh
perhaps
that
lacerated
love
would
have
grown
into
real
love
perhaps
katya
longed
for
nothing
more
than
that
but
mityas
faithlessness
had
wounded
her
to
the
bottom
of
her
heart
and
her
heart
could
not
forgive
him
the
moment
of
revenge
had
come
upon
her
suddenly
and
all
that
had
been
accumulating
so
long
and
so
painfully
in
the
offended
womans
breast
burst
out
all
at
once
and
unexpectedly
she
betrayed
mitya
but
she
betrayed
herself
too
and
no
sooner
had
she
given
full
expression
to
her
feelings
than
the
tension
of
course
was
over
and
she
was
overwhelmed
with
shame
hysterics
began
again
she
fell
on
the
floor
sobbing
and
screaming
she
was
carried
out
at
that
moment
grushenka
with
a
wail
rushed
towards
mitya
before
they
had
time
to
prevent
her
mitya
she
wailed
your
serpent
has
destroyed
you
there
she
has
shown
you
what
she
is
she
shouted
to
the
judges
shaking
with
anger
at
a
signal
from
the
president
they
seized
her
and
tried
to
remove
her
from
the
court
she
wouldnt
allow
it
she
fought
and
struggled
to
get
back
to
mitya
mitya
uttered
a
cry
and
struggled
to
get
to
her
he
was
overpowered
yes
i
think
the
ladies
who
came
to
see
the
spectacle
must
have
been
satisfiedthe
show
had
been
a
varied
one
then
i
remember
the
moscow
doctor
appeared
on
the
scene
i
believe
the
president
had
previously
sent
the
court
usher
to
arrange
for
medical
aid
for
ivan
the
doctor
announced
to
the
court
that
the
sick
man
was
suffering
from
a
dangerous
attack
of
brain
fever
and
that
he
must
be
at
once
removed
in
answer
to
questions
from
the
prosecutor
and
the
counsel
for
the
defense
he
said
that
the
patient
had
come
to
him
of
his
own
accord
the
day
before
yesterday
and
that
he
had
warned
him
that
he
had
such
an
attack
coming
on
but
he
had
not
consented
to
be
looked
after
he
was
certainly
not
in
a
normal
state
of
mind
he
told
me
himself
that
he
saw
visions
when
he
was
awake
that
he
met
several
persons
in
the
street
who
were
dead
and
that
satan
visited
him
every
evening
said
the
doctor
in
conclusion
having
given
his
evidence
the
celebrated
doctor
withdrew
the
letter
produced
by
katerina
ivanovna
was
added
to
the
material
proofs
after
some
deliberation
the
judges
decided
to
proceed
with
the
trial
and
to
enter
both
the
unexpected
pieces
of
evidence
given
by
ivan
and
katerina
ivanovna
on
the
protocol
but
i
will
not
detail
the
evidence
of
the
other
witnesses
who
only
repeated
and
confirmed
what
had
been
said
before
though
all
with
their
characteristic
peculiarities
i
repeat
all
was
brought
together
in
the
prosecutors
speech
which
i
shall
quote
immediately
every
one
was
excited
every
one
was
electrified
by
the
late
catastrophe
and
all
were
awaiting
the
speeches
for
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
with
intense
impatience
fetyukovitch
was
obviously
shaken
by
katerina
ivanovnas
evidence
but
the
prosecutor
was
triumphant
when
all
the
evidence
had
been
taken
the
court
was
adjourned
for
almost
an
hour
i
believe
it
was
just
eight
oclock
when
the
president
returned
to
his
seat
and
our
prosecutor
ippolit
kirillovitch
began
his
speech
chapter
vi
the
prosecutors
speech
sketches
of
character
ippolit
kirillovitch
began
his
speech
trembling
with
nervousness
with
cold
sweat
on
his
forehead
feeling
hot
and
cold
all
over
by
turns
he
described
this
himself
afterwards
he
regarded
this
speech
as
his
chefduvre
the
chefduvre
of
his
whole
life
as
his
swansong
he
died
it
is
true
nine
months
later
of
rapid
consumption
so
that
he
had
the
right
as
it
turned
out
to
compare
himself
to
a
swan
singing
his
last
song
he
had
put
his
whole
heart
and
all
the
brain
he
had
into
that
speech
and
poor
ippolit
kirillovitch
unexpectedly
revealed
that
at
least
some
feeling
for
the
public
welfare
and
the
eternal
question
lay
concealed
in
him
where
his
speech
really
excelled
was
in
its
sincerity
he
genuinely
believed
in
the
prisoners
guilt
he
was
accusing
him
not
as
an
official
duty
only
and
in
calling
for
vengeance
he
quivered
with
a
genuine
passion
for
the
security
of
society
even
the
ladies
in
the
audience
though
they
remained
hostile
to
ippolit
kirillovitch
admitted
that
he
made
an
extraordinary
impression
on
them
he
began
in
a
breaking
voice
but
it
soon
gained
strength
and
filled
the
court
to
the
end
of
his
speech
but
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
he
almost
fainted
gentlemen
of
the
jury
began
the
prosecutor
this
case
has
made
a
stir
throughout
russia
but
what
is
there
to
wonder
at
what
is
there
so
peculiarly
horrifying
in
it
for
us
we
are
so
accustomed
to
such
crimes
thats
whats
so
horrible
that
such
dark
deeds
have
ceased
to
horrify
us
what
ought
to
horrify
us
is
that
we
are
so
accustomed
to
it
and
not
this
or
that
isolated
crime
what
are
the
causes
of
our
indifference
our
lukewarm
attitude
to
such
deeds
to
such
signs
of
the
times
ominous
of
an
unenviable
future
is
it
our
cynicism
is
it
the
premature
exhaustion
of
intellect
and
imagination
in
a
society
that
is
sinking
into
decay
in
spite
of
its
youth
is
it
that
our
moral
principles
are
shattered
to
their
foundations
or
is
it
perhaps
a
complete
lack
of
such
principles
among
us
i
cannot
answer
such
questions
nevertheless
they
are
disturbing
and
every
citizen
not
only
must
but
ought
to
be
harassed
by
them
our
newborn
and
still
timid
press
has
done
good
service
to
the
public
already
for
without
it
we
should
never
have
heard
of
the
horrors
of
unbridled
violence
and
moral
degradation
which
are
continually
made
known
by
the
press
not
merely
to
those
who
attend
the
new
jury
courts
established
in
the
present
reign
but
to
every
one
and
what
do
we
read
almost
daily
of
things
beside
which
the
present
case
grows
pale
and
seems
almost
commonplace
but
what
is
most
important
is
that
the
majority
of
our
national
crimes
of
violence
bear
witness
to
a
widespread
evil
now
so
general
among
us
that
it
is
difficult
to
contend
against
it
one
day
we
see
a
brilliant
young
officer
of
high
society
at
the
very
outset
of
his
career
in
a
cowardly
underhand
way
without
a
pang
of
conscience
murdering
an
official
who
had
once
been
his
benefactor
and
the
servant
girl
to
steal
his
own
iou
and
what
ready
money
he
could
find
on
him
it
will
come
in
handy
for
my
pleasures
in
the
fashionable
world
and
for
my
career
in
the
future
after
murdering
them
he
puts
pillows
under
the
head
of
each
of
his
victims
he
goes
away
next
a
young
hero
decorated
for
bravery
kills
the
mother
of
his
chief
and
benefactor
like
a
highwayman
and
to
urge
his
companions
to
join
him
he
asserts
that
she
loves
him
like
a
son
and
so
will
follow
all
his
directions
and
take
no
precautions
granted
that
he
is
a
monster
yet
i
dare
not
say
in
these
days
that
he
is
unique
another
man
will
not
commit
the
murder
but
will
feel
and
think
like
him
and
is
as
dishonorable
in
soul
in
silence
alone
with
his
conscience
he
asks
himself
perhaps
what
is
honor
and
isnt
the
condemnation
of
bloodshed
a
prejudice
perhaps
people
will
cry
out
against
me
that
i
am
morbid
hysterical
that
it
is
a
monstrous
slander
that
i
am
exaggerating
let
them
say
soand
heavens
i
should
be
the
first
to
rejoice
if
it
were
so
oh
dont
believe
me
think
of
me
as
morbid
but
remember
my
words
if
only
a
tenth
if
only
a
twentieth
part
of
what
i
say
is
trueeven
so
its
awful
look
how
our
young
people
commit
suicide
without
asking
themselves
hamlets
question
what
there
is
beyond
without
a
sign
of
such
a
question
as
though
all
that
relates
to
the
soul
and
to
what
awaits
us
beyond
the
grave
had
long
been
erased
in
their
minds
and
buried
under
the
sands
look
at
our
vice
at
our
profligates
fyodor
pavlovitch
the
luckless
victim
in
the
present
case
was
almost
an
innocent
babe
compared
with
many
of
them
and
yet
we
all
knew
him
he
lived
among
us
yes
one
day
perhaps
the
leading
intellects
of
russia
and
of
europe
will
study
the
psychology
of
russian
crime
for
the
subject
is
worth
it
but
this
study
will
come
later
at
leisure
when
all
the
tragic
topsyturvydom
of
today
is
farther
behind
us
so
that
its
possible
to
examine
it
with
more
insight
and
more
impartiality
than
i
can
do
now
we
are
either
horrified
or
pretend
to
be
horrified
though
we
really
gloat
over
the
spectacle
and
love
strong
and
eccentric
sensations
which
tickle
our
cynical
pampered
idleness
or
like
little
children
we
brush
the
dreadful
ghosts
away
and
hide
our
heads
in
the
pillow
so
as
to
return
to
our
sports
and
merriment
as
soon
as
they
have
vanished
but
we
must
one
day
begin
life
in
sober
earnest
we
must
look
at
ourselves
as
a
society
its
time
we
tried
to
grasp
something
of
our
social
position
or
at
least
to
make
a
beginning
in
that
direction
a
great
writer9
of
the
last
epoch
comparing
russia
to
a
swift
troika
galloping
to
an
unknown
goal
exclaims
oh
troika
birdlike
troika
who
invented
thee
and
adds
in
proud
ecstasy
that
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
stand
aside
respectfully
to
make
way
for
the
recklessly
galloping
troika
to
pass
that
may
be
they
may
stand
aside
respectfully
or
no
but
in
my
poor
opinion
the
great
writer
ended
his
book
in
this
way
either
in
an
access
of
childish
and
nave
optimism
or
simply
in
fear
of
the
censorship
of
the
day
for
if
the
troika
were
drawn
by
his
heroes
sobakevitch
nozdryov
tchitchikov
it
could
reach
no
rational
goal
whoever
might
be
driving
it
and
those
were
the
heroes
of
an
older
generation
ours
are
worse
specimens
still
at
this
point
ippolit
kirillovitchs
speech
was
interrupted
by
applause
the
liberal
significance
of
this
simile
was
appreciated
the
applause
was
its
true
of
brief
duration
so
that
the
president
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
caution
the
public
and
only
looked
severely
in
the
direction
of
the
offenders
but
ippolit
kirillovitch
was
encouraged
he
had
never
been
applauded
before
he
had
been
all
his
life
unable
to
get
a
hearing
and
now
he
suddenly
had
an
opportunity
of
securing
the
ear
of
all
russia
what
after
all
is
this
karamazov
family
which
has
gained
such
an
unenviable
notoriety
throughout
russia
he
continued
perhaps
i
am
exaggerating
but
it
seems
to
me
that
certain
fundamental
features
of
the
educated
class
of
today
are
reflected
in
this
family
pictureonly
of
course
in
miniature
like
the
sun
in
a
drop
of
water
think
of
that
unhappy
vicious
unbridled
old
man
who
has
met
with
such
a
melancholy
end
the
head
of
a
family
beginning
life
of
noble
birth
but
in
a
poor
dependent
position
through
an
unexpected
marriage
he
came
into
a
small
fortune
a
petty
knave
a
toady
and
buffoon
of
fairly
good
though
undeveloped
intelligence
he
was
above
all
a
moneylender
who
grew
bolder
with
growing
prosperity
his
abject
and
servile
characteristics
disappeared
his
malicious
and
sarcastic
cynicism
was
all
that
remained
on
the
spiritual
side
he
was
undeveloped
while
his
vitality
was
excessive
he
saw
nothing
in
life
but
sensual
pleasure
and
he
brought
his
children
up
to
be
the
same
he
had
no
feelings
for
his
duties
as
a
father
he
ridiculed
those
duties
he
left
his
little
children
to
the
servants
and
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
forgot
about
them
completely
the
old
mans
maxim
was
aprs
moi
le
dluge
he
was
an
example
of
everything
that
is
opposed
to
civic
duty
of
the
most
complete
and
malignant
individualism
the
world
may
burn
for
aught
i
care
so
long
as
i
am
all
right
and
he
was
all
right
he
was
content
he
was
eager
to
go
on
living
in
the
same
way
for
another
twenty
or
thirty
years
he
swindled
his
own
son
and
spent
his
money
his
maternal
inheritance
on
trying
to
get
his
mistress
from
him
no
i
dont
intend
to
leave
the
prisoners
defense
altogether
to
my
talented
colleague
from
petersburg
i
will
speak
the
truth
myself
i
can
well
understand
what
resentment
he
had
heaped
up
in
his
sons
heart
against
him
but
enough
enough
of
that
unhappy
old
man
he
has
paid
the
penalty
let
us
remember
however
that
he
was
a
father
and
one
of
the
typical
fathers
of
today
am
i
unjust
indeed
in
saying
that
he
is
typical
of
many
modern
fathers
alas
many
of
them
only
differ
in
not
openly
professing
such
cynicism
for
they
are
better
educated
more
cultured
but
their
philosophy
is
essentially
the
same
as
his
perhaps
i
am
a
pessimist
but
you
have
agreed
to
forgive
me
let
us
agree
beforehand
you
need
not
believe
me
but
let
me
speak
let
me
say
what
i
have
to
say
and
remember
something
of
my
words
now
for
the
children
of
this
father
this
head
of
a
family
one
of
them
is
the
prisoner
before
us
all
the
rest
of
my
speech
will
deal
with
him
of
the
other
two
i
will
speak
only
cursorily
the
elder
is
one
of
those
modern
young
men
of
brilliant
education
and
vigorous
intellect
who
has
lost
all
faith
in
everything
he
has
denied
and
rejected
much
already
like
his
father
we
have
all
heard
him
he
was
a
welcome
guest
in
local
society
he
never
concealed
his
opinions
quite
the
contrary
in
fact
which
justifies
me
in
speaking
rather
openly
of
him
now
of
course
not
as
an
individual
but
as
a
member
of
the
karamazov
family
another
personage
closely
connected
with
the
case
died
here
by
his
own
hand
last
night
i
mean
an
afflicted
idiot
formerly
the
servant
and
possibly
the
illegitimate
son
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
smerdyakov
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
he
told
me
with
hysterical
tears
how
the
young
ivan
karamazov
had
horrified
him
by
his
spiritual
audacity
everything
in
the
world
is
lawful
according
to
him
and
nothing
must
be
forbidden
in
the
futurethat
is
what
he
always
taught
me
i
believe
that
idiot
was
driven
out
of
his
mind
by
this
theory
though
of
course
the
epileptic
attacks
from
which
he
suffered
and
this
terrible
catastrophe
have
helped
to
unhinge
his
faculties
but
he
dropped
one
very
interesting
observation
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
more
intelligent
observer
and
that
is
indeed
why
ive
mentioned
it
if
there
is
one
of
the
sons
that
is
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
character
it
is
ivan
fyodorovitch
with
that
remark
i
conclude
my
sketch
of
his
character
feeling
it
indelicate
to
continue
further
oh
i
dont
want
to
draw
any
further
conclusions
and
croak
like
a
raven
over
the
young
mans
future
weve
seen
today
in
this
court
that
there
are
still
good
impulses
in
his
young
heart
that
family
feeling
has
not
been
destroyed
in
him
by
lack
of
faith
and
cynicism
which
have
come
to
him
rather
by
inheritance
than
by
the
exercise
of
independent
thought
then
the
third
son
oh
he
is
a
devout
and
modest
youth
who
does
not
share
his
elder
brothers
gloomy
and
destructive
theory
of
life
he
has
sought
to
cling
to
the
ideas
of
the
people
or
to
what
goes
by
that
name
in
some
circles
of
our
intellectual
classes
he
clung
to
the
monastery
and
was
within
an
ace
of
becoming
a
monk
he
seems
to
me
to
have
betrayed
unconsciously
and
so
early
that
timid
despair
which
leads
so
many
in
our
unhappy
society
who
dread
cynicism
and
its
corrupting
influences
and
mistakenly
attribute
all
the
mischief
to
european
enlightenment
to
return
to
their
native
soil
as
they
say
to
the
bosom
so
to
speak
of
their
mother
earth
like
frightened
children
yearning
to
fall
asleep
on
the
withered
bosom
of
their
decrepit
mother
and
to
sleep
there
for
ever
only
to
escape
the
horrors
that
terrify
them
for
my
part
i
wish
the
excellent
and
gifted
young
man
every
success
i
trust
that
his
youthful
idealism
and
impulse
towards
the
ideas
of
the
people
may
never
degenerate
as
often
happens
on
the
moral
side
into
gloomy
mysticism
and
on
the
political
into
blind
chauvinismtwo
elements
which
are
even
a
greater
menace
to
russia
than
the
premature
decay
due
to
misunderstanding
and
gratuitous
adoption
of
european
ideas
from
which
his
elder
brother
is
suffering
two
or
three
people
clapped
their
hands
at
the
mention
of
chauvinism
and
mysticism
ippolit
kirillovitch
had
been
indeed
carried
away
by
his
own
eloquence
all
this
had
little
to
do
with
the
case
in
hand
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
of
its
being
somewhat
vague
but
the
sickly
and
consumptive
man
was
overcome
by
the
desire
to
express
himself
once
in
his
life
people
said
afterwards
that
he
was
actuated
by
unworthy
motives
in
his
criticism
of
ivan
because
the
latter
had
on
one
or
two
occasions
got
the
better
of
him
in
argument
and
ippolit
kirillovitch
remembering
it
tried
now
to
take
his
revenge
but
i
dont
know
whether
it
was
true
all
this
was
only
introductory
however
and
the
speech
passed
to
more
direct
consideration
of
the
case
but
to
return
to
the
eldest
son
ippolit
kirillovitch
went
on
he
is
the
prisoner
before
us
we
have
his
life
and
his
actions
too
before
us
the
fatal
day
has
come
and
all
has
been
brought
to
the
surface
while
his
brothers
seem
to
stand
for
europeanism
and
the
principles
of
the
people
he
seems
to
represent
russia
as
she
is
oh
not
all
russia
not
all
god
preserve
us
if
it
were
yet
here
we
have
her
our
mother
russia
the
very
scent
and
sound
of
her
oh
he
is
spontaneous
he
is
a
marvelous
mingling
of
good
and
evil
he
is
a
lover
of
culture
and
schiller
yet
he
brawls
in
taverns
and
plucks
out
the
beards
of
his
boon
companions
oh
he
too
can
be
good
and
noble
but
only
when
all
goes
well
with
him
what
is
more
he
can
be
carried
off
his
feet
positively
carried
off
his
feet
by
noble
ideals
but
only
if
they
come
of
themselves
if
they
fall
from
heaven
for
him
if
they
need
not
be
paid
for
he
dislikes
paying
for
anything
but
is
very
fond
of
receiving
and
thats
so
with
him
in
everything
oh
give
him
every
possible
good
in
life
he
couldnt
be
content
with
less
and
put
no
obstacle
in
his
way
and
he
will
show
that
he
too
can
be
noble
he
is
not
greedy
no
but
he
must
have
money
a
great
deal
of
money
and
you
will
see
how
generously
with
what
scorn
of
filthy
lucre
he
will
fling
it
all
away
in
the
reckless
dissipation
of
one
night
but
if
he
has
not
money
he
will
show
what
he
is
ready
to
do
to
get
it
when
he
is
in
great
need
of
it
but
all
this
later
let
us
take
events
in
their
chronological
order
first
we
have
before
us
a
poor
abandoned
child
running
about
the
back
yard
without
boots
on
his
feet
as
our
worthy
and
esteemed
fellow
citizen
of
foreign
origin
alas
expressed
it
just
now
i
repeat
it
again
i
yield
to
no
one
the
defense
of
the
criminal
i
am
here
to
accuse
him
but
to
defend
him
also
yes
i
too
am
human
i
too
can
weigh
the
influence
of
home
and
childhood
on
the
character
but
the
boy
grows
up
and
becomes
an
officer
for
a
duel
and
other
reckless
conduct
he
is
exiled
to
one
of
the
remote
frontier
towns
of
russia
there
he
led
a
wild
life
as
an
officer
and
of
course
he
needed
money
money
before
all
things
and
so
after
prolonged
disputes
he
came
to
a
settlement
with
his
father
and
the
last
six
thousand
was
sent
him
a
letter
is
in
existence
in
which
he
practically
gives
up
his
claim
to
the
rest
and
settles
his
conflict
with
his
father
over
the
inheritance
on
the
payment
of
this
six
thousand
then
came
his
meeting
with
a
young
girl
of
lofty
character
and
brilliant
education
oh
i
do
not
venture
to
repeat
the
details
you
have
only
just
heard
them
honor
selfsacrifice
were
shown
there
and
i
will
be
silent
the
figure
of
the
young
officer
frivolous
and
profligate
doing
homage
to
true
nobility
and
a
lofty
ideal
was
shown
in
a
very
sympathetic
light
before
us
but
the
other
side
of
the
medal
was
unexpectedly
turned
to
us
immediately
after
in
this
very
court
again
i
will
not
venture
to
conjecture
why
it
happened
so
but
there
were
causes
the
same
lady
bathed
in
tears
of
longconcealed
indignation
alleged
that
he
he
of
all
men
had
despised
her
for
her
action
which
though
incautious
reckless
perhaps
was
still
dictated
by
lofty
and
generous
motives
he
he
the
girls
betrothed
looked
at
her
with
that
smile
of
mockery
which
was
more
insufferable
from
him
than
from
any
one
and
knowing
that
he
had
already
deceived
her
he
had
deceived
her
believing
that
she
was
bound
to
endure
everything
from
him
even
treachery
she
intentionally
offered
him
three
thousand
roubles
and
clearly
too
clearly
let
him
understand
that
she
was
offering
him
money
to
deceive
her
well
will
you
take
it
or
not
are
you
so
lost
to
shame
was
the
dumb
question
in
her
scrutinizing
eyes
he
looked
at
her
saw
clearly
what
was
in
her
mind
hes
admitted
here
before
you
that
he
understood
it
all
appropriated
that
three
thousand
unconditionally
and
squandered
it
in
two
days
with
the
new
object
of
his
affections
what
are
we
to
believe
then
the
first
legend
of
the
young
officer
sacrificing
his
last
farthing
in
a
noble
impulse
of
generosity
and
doing
reverence
to
virtue
or
this
other
revolting
picture
as
a
rule
between
two
extremes
one
has
to
find
the
mean
but
in
the
present
case
this
is
not
true
the
probability
is
that
in
the
first
case
he
was
genuinely
noble
and
in
the
second
as
genuinely
base
and
why
because
he
was
of
the
broad
karamazov
characterthats
just
what
i
am
leading
up
tocapable
of
combining
the
most
incongruous
contradictions
and
capable
of
the
greatest
heights
and
of
the
greatest
depths
remember
the
brilliant
remark
made
by
a
young
observer
who
has
seen
the
karamazov
family
at
close
quartersmr
rakitin
the
sense
of
their
own
degradation
is
as
essential
to
those
reckless
unbridled
natures
as
the
sense
of
their
lofty
generosity
and
thats
true
they
need
continually
this
unnatural
mixture
two
extremes
at
the
same
moment
or
they
are
miserable
and
dissatisfied
and
their
existence
is
incomplete
they
are
wide
wide
as
mother
russia
they
include
everything
and
put
up
with
everything
by
the
way
gentlemen
of
the
jury
weve
just
touched
upon
that
three
thousand
roubles
and
i
will
venture
to
anticipate
things
a
little
can
you
conceive
that
a
man
like
that
on
receiving
that
sum
and
in
such
a
way
at
the
price
of
such
shame
such
disgrace
such
utter
degradation
could
have
been
capable
that
very
day
of
setting
apart
half
that
sum
that
very
day
and
sewing
it
up
in
a
little
bag
and
would
have
had
the
firmness
of
character
to
carry
it
about
with
him
for
a
whole
month
afterwards
in
spite
of
every
temptation
and
his
extreme
need
of
it
neither
in
drunken
debauchery
in
taverns
nor
when
he
was
flying
into
the
country
trying
to
get
from
god
knows
whom
the
money
so
essential
to
him
to
remove
the
object
of
his
affections
from
being
tempted
by
his
father
did
he
bring
himself
to
touch
that
little
bag
why
if
only
to
avoid
abandoning
his
mistress
to
the
rival
of
whom
he
was
so
jealous
he
would
have
been
certain
to
have
opened
that
bag
and
to
have
stayed
at
home
to
keep
watch
over
her
and
to
await
the
moment
when
she
would
say
to
him
at
last
i
am
yours
and
to
fly
with
her
far
from
their
fatal
surroundings
but
no
he
did
not
touch
his
talisman
and
what
is
the
reason
he
gives
for
it
the
chief
reason
as
i
have
just
said
was
that
when
she
would
say
i
am
yours
take
me
where
you
will
he
might
have
the
wherewithal
to
take
her
but
that
first
reason
in
the
prisoners
own
words
was
of
little
weight
beside
the
second
while
i
have
that
money
on
me
he
said
i
am
a
scoundrel
not
a
thief
for
i
can
always
go
to
my
insulted
betrothed
and
laying
down
half
the
sum
i
have
fraudulently
appropriated
i
can
always
say
to
her
you
see
ive
squandered
half
your
money
and
shown
i
am
a
weak
and
immoral
man
and
if
you
like
a
scoundrel
i
use
the
prisoners
own
expressions
but
though
i
am
a
scoundrel
i
am
not
a
thief
for
if
i
had
been
a
thief
i
shouldnt
have
brought
you
back
this
half
of
the
money
but
should
have
taken
it
as
i
did
the
other
half
a
marvelous
explanation
this
frantic
but
weak
man
who
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
accepting
the
three
thousand
roubles
at
the
price
of
such
disgrace
this
very
man
suddenly
develops
the
most
stoical
firmness
and
carries
about
a
thousand
roubles
without
daring
to
touch
it
does
that
fit
in
at
all
with
the
character
we
have
analyzed
no
and
i
venture
to
tell
you
how
the
real
dmitri
karamazov
would
have
behaved
in
such
circumstances
if
he
really
had
brought
himself
to
put
away
the
money
at
the
first
temptationfor
instance
to
entertain
the
woman
with
whom
he
had
already
squandered
half
the
moneyhe
would
have
unpicked
his
little
bag
and
have
taken
out
some
hundred
roubles
for
why
should
he
have
taken
back
precisely
half
the
money
that
is
fifteen
hundred
roubles
why
not
fourteen
hundred
he
could
just
as
well
have
said
then
that
he
was
not
a
thief
because
he
brought
back
fourteen
hundred
roubles
then
another
time
he
would
have
unpicked
it
again
and
taken
out
another
hundred
and
then
a
third
and
then
a
fourth
and
before
the
end
of
the
month
he
would
have
taken
the
last
note
but
one
feeling
that
if
he
took
back
only
a
hundred
it
would
answer
the
purpose
for
a
thief
would
have
stolen
it
all
and
then
he
would
have
looked
at
this
last
note
and
have
said
to
himself
its
really
not
worth
while
to
give
back
one
hundred
lets
spend
that
too
thats
how
the
real
dmitri
karamazov
as
we
know
him
would
have
behaved
one
cannot
imagine
anything
more
incongruous
with
the
actual
fact
than
this
legend
of
the
little
bag
nothing
could
be
more
inconceivable
but
we
shall
return
to
that
later
after
touching
upon
what
had
come
out
in
the
proceedings
concerning
the
financial
relations
of
father
and
son
and
arguing
again
and
again
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
from
the
facts
known
to
determine
which
was
in
the
wrong
ippolit
kirillovitch
passed
to
the
evidence
of
the
medical
experts
in
reference
to
mityas
fixed
idea
about
the
three
thousand
owing
him
chapter
vii
an
historical
survey
the
medical
experts
have
striven
to
convince
us
that
the
prisoner
is
out
of
his
mind
and
in
fact
a
maniac
i
maintain
that
he
is
in
his
right
mind
and
that
if
he
had
not
been
he
would
have
behaved
more
cleverly
as
for
his
being
a
maniac
that
i
would
agree
with
but
only
in
one
point
that
is
his
fixed
idea
about
the
three
thousand
yet
i
think
one
might
find
a
much
simpler
cause
than
his
tendency
to
insanity
for
my
part
i
agree
thoroughly
with
the
young
doctor
who
maintained
that
the
prisoners
mental
faculties
have
always
been
normal
and
that
he
has
only
been
irritable
and
exasperated
the
object
of
the
prisoners
continual
and
violent
anger
was
not
the
sum
itself
there
was
a
special
motive
at
the
bottom
of
it
that
motive
is
jealousy
here
ippolit
kirillovitch
described
at
length
the
prisoners
fatal
passion
for
grushenka
he
began
from
the
moment
when
the
prisoner
went
to
the
young
persons
lodgings
to
beat
heri
use
his
own
expression
the
prosecutor
explainedbut
instead
of
beating
her
he
remained
there
at
her
feet
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
passion
at
the
same
time
the
prisoners
father
was
captivated
by
the
same
young
persona
strange
and
fatal
coincidence
for
they
both
lost
their
hearts
to
her
simultaneously
though
both
had
known
her
before
and
she
inspired
in
both
of
them
the
most
violent
characteristically
karamazov
passion
we
have
her
own
confession
i
was
laughing
at
both
of
them
yes
the
sudden
desire
to
make
a
jest
of
them
came
over
her
and
she
conquered
both
of
them
at
once
the
old
man
who
worshiped
money
at
once
set
aside
three
thousand
roubles
as
a
reward
for
one
visit
from
her
but
soon
after
that
he
would
have
been
happy
to
lay
his
property
and
his
name
at
her
feet
if
only
she
would
become
his
lawful
wife
we
have
good
evidence
of
this
as
for
the
prisoner
the
tragedy
of
his
fate
is
evident
it
is
before
us
but
such
was
the
young
persons
game
the
enchantress
gave
the
unhappy
young
man
no
hope
until
the
last
moment
when
he
knelt
before
her
stretching
out
hands
that
were
already
stained
with
the
blood
of
his
father
and
rival
it
was
in
that
position
that
he
was
arrested
send
me
to
siberia
with
him
i
have
brought
him
to
this
i
am
most
to
blame
the
woman
herself
cried
in
genuine
remorse
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
the
talented
young
man
to
whom
i
have
referred
already
mr
rakitin
characterized
this
heroine
in
brief
and
impressive
terms
she
was
disillusioned
early
in
life
deceived
and
ruined
by
a
betrothed
who
seduced
and
abandoned
her
she
was
left
in
poverty
cursed
by
her
respectable
family
and
taken
under
the
protection
of
a
wealthy
old
man
whom
she
still
however
considers
as
her
benefactor
there
was
perhaps
much
that
was
good
in
her
young
heart
but
it
was
embittered
too
early
she
became
prudent
and
saved
money
she
grew
sarcastic
and
resentful
against
society
after
this
sketch
of
her
character
it
may
well
be
understood
that
she
might
laugh
at
both
of
them
simply
from
mischief
from
malice
after
a
month
of
hopeless
love
and
moral
degradation
during
which
he
betrayed
his
betrothed
and
appropriated
money
entrusted
to
his
honor
the
prisoner
was
driven
almost
to
frenzy
almost
to
madness
by
continual
jealousyand
of
whom
his
father
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
crazy
old
man
was
alluring
and
enticing
the
object
of
his
affection
by
means
of
that
very
three
thousand
roubles
which
the
son
looked
upon
as
his
own
property
part
of
his
inheritance
from
his
mother
of
which
his
father
was
cheating
him
yes
i
admit
it
was
hard
to
bear
it
might
well
drive
a
man
to
madness
it
was
not
the
money
but
the
fact
that
this
money
was
used
with
such
revolting
cynicism
to
ruin
his
happiness
then
the
prosecutor
went
on
to
describe
how
the
idea
of
murdering
his
father
had
entered
the
prisoners
head
and
illustrated
his
theory
with
facts
at
first
he
only
talked
about
it
in
tavernshe
was
talking
about
it
all
that
month
ah
he
likes
being
always
surrounded
with
company
and
he
likes
to
tell
his
companions
everything
even
his
most
diabolical
and
dangerous
ideas
he
likes
to
share
every
thought
with
others
and
expects
for
some
reason
that
those
he
confides
in
will
meet
him
with
perfect
sympathy
enter
into
all
his
troubles
and
anxieties
take
his
part
and
not
oppose
him
in
anything
if
not
he
flies
into
a
rage
and
smashes
up
everything
in
the
tavern
then
followed
the
anecdote
about
captain
snegiryov
those
who
heard
the
prisoner
began
to
think
at
last
that
he
might
mean
more
than
threats
and
that
such
a
frenzy
might
turn
threats
into
actions
here
the
prosecutor
described
the
meeting
of
the
family
at
the
monastery
the
conversations
with
alyosha
and
the
horrible
scene
of
violence
when
the
prisoner
had
rushed
into
his
fathers
house
just
after
dinner
i
cannot
positively
assert
the
prosecutor
continued
that
the
prisoner
fully
intended
to
murder
his
father
before
that
incident
yet
the
idea
had
several
times
presented
itself
to
him
and
he
had
deliberated
on
itfor
that
we
have
facts
witnesses
and
his
own
words
i
confess
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
added
that
till
today
i
have
been
uncertain
whether
to
attribute
to
the
prisoner
conscious
premeditation
i
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
had
pictured
the
fatal
moment
beforehand
but
had
only
pictured
it
contemplating
it
as
a
possibility
he
had
not
definitely
considered
when
and
how
he
might
commit
the
crime
but
i
was
only
uncertain
till
today
till
that
fatal
document
was
presented
to
the
court
just
now
you
yourselves
heard
that
young
ladys
exclamation
it
is
the
plan
the
program
of
the
murder
that
is
how
she
defined
that
miserable
drunken
letter
of
the
unhappy
prisoner
and
in
fact
from
that
letter
we
see
that
the
whole
fact
of
the
murder
was
premeditated
it
was
written
two
days
before
and
so
we
know
now
for
a
fact
that
fortyeight
hours
before
the
perpetration
of
his
terrible
design
the
prisoner
swore
that
if
he
could
not
get
money
next
day
he
would
murder
his
father
in
order
to
take
the
envelope
with
the
notes
from
under
his
pillow
as
soon
as
ivan
had
left
as
soon
as
ivan
had
gone
awayyou
hear
that
so
he
had
thought
everything
out
weighing
every
circumstance
and
he
carried
it
all
out
just
as
he
had
written
it
the
proof
of
premeditation
is
conclusive
the
crime
must
have
been
committed
for
the
sake
of
the
money
that
is
stated
clearly
that
is
written
and
signed
the
prisoner
does
not
deny
his
signature
i
shall
be
told
he
was
drunk
when
he
wrote
it
but
that
does
not
diminish
the
value
of
the
letter
quite
the
contrary
he
wrote
when
drunk
what
he
had
planned
when
sober
had
he
not
planned
it
when
sober
he
would
not
have
written
it
when
drunk
i
shall
be
asked
then
why
did
he
talk
about
it
in
taverns
a
man
who
premeditates
such
a
crime
is
silent
and
keeps
it
to
himself
yes
but
he
talked
about
it
before
he
had
formed
a
plan
when
he
had
only
the
desire
only
the
impulse
to
it
afterwards
he
talked
less
about
it
on
the
evening
he
wrote
that
letter
at
the
metropolis
tavern
contrary
to
his
custom
he
was
silent
though
he
had
been
drinking
he
did
not
play
billiards
he
sat
in
a
corner
talked
to
no
one
he
did
indeed
turn
a
shopman
out
of
his
seat
but
that
was
done
almost
unconsciously
because
he
could
never
enter
a
tavern
without
making
a
disturbance
it
is
true
that
after
he
had
taken
the
final
decision
he
must
have
felt
apprehensive
that
he
had
talked
too
much
about
his
design
beforehand
and
that
this
might
lead
to
his
arrest
and
prosecution
afterwards
but
there
was
nothing
for
it
he
could
not
take
his
words
back
but
his
luck
had
served
him
before
it
would
serve
him
again
he
believed
in
his
star
you
know
i
must
confess
too
that
he
did
a
great
deal
to
avoid
the
fatal
catastrophe
tomorrow
i
shall
try
and
borrow
the
money
from
every
one
as
he
writes
in
his
peculiar
language
and
if
they
wont
give
it
to
me
there
will
be
bloodshed

here
ippolit
kirillovitch
passed
to
a
detailed
description
of
all
mityas
efforts
to
borrow
the
money
he
described
his
visit
to
samsonov
his
journey
to
lyagavy
harassed
jeered
at
hungry
after
selling
his
watch
to
pay
for
the
journey
though
he
tells
us
he
had
fifteen
hundred
roubles
on
hima
likely
story
tortured
by
jealousy
at
having
left
the
object
of
his
affections
in
the
town
suspecting
that
she
would
go
to
fyodor
pavlovitch
in
his
absence
he
returned
at
last
to
the
town
to
find
to
his
joy
that
she
had
not
been
near
his
father
he
accompanied
her
himself
to
her
protector
strange
to
say
he
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
jealous
of
samsonov
which
is
psychologically
interesting
then
he
hastens
back
to
his
ambush
in
the
back
gardens
and
there
learns
that
smerdyakov
is
in
a
fit
that
the
other
servant
is
illthe
coast
is
clear
and
he
knows
the
signalswhat
a
temptation
still
he
resists
it
he
goes
off
to
a
lady
who
has
for
some
time
been
residing
in
the
town
and
who
is
highly
esteemed
among
us
madame
hohlakov
that
lady
who
had
long
watched
his
career
with
compassion
gave
him
the
most
judicious
advice
to
give
up
his
dissipated
life
his
unseemly
loveaffair
the
waste
of
his
youth
and
vigor
in
pothouse
debauchery
and
to
set
off
to
siberia
to
the
gold
mines
that
would
be
an
outlet
for
your
turbulent
energies
your
romantic
character
your
thirst
for
adventure

after
describing
the
result
of
this
conversation
and
the
moment
when
the
prisoner
learnt
that
grushenka
had
not
remained
at
samsonovs
the
sudden
frenzy
of
the
luckless
man
worn
out
with
jealousy
and
nervous
exhaustion
at
the
thought
that
she
had
deceived
him
and
was
now
with
his
father
ippolit
kirillovitch
concluded
by
dwelling
upon
the
fatal
influence
of
chance
had
the
maid
told
him
that
her
mistress
was
at
mokroe
with
her
former
lover
nothing
would
have
happened
but
she
lost
her
head
she
could
only
swear
and
protest
her
ignorance
and
if
the
prisoner
did
not
kill
her
on
the
spot
it
was
only
because
he
flew
in
pursuit
of
his
false
mistress
but
note
frantic
as
he
was
he
took
with
him
a
brass
pestle
why
that
why
not
some
other
weapon
but
since
he
had
been
contemplating
his
plan
and
preparing
himself
for
it
for
a
whole
month
he
would
snatch
up
anything
like
a
weapon
that
caught
his
eye
he
had
realized
for
a
month
past
that
any
object
of
the
kind
would
serve
as
a
weapon
so
he
instantly
without
hesitation
recognized
that
it
would
serve
his
purpose
so
it
was
by
no
means
unconsciously
by
no
means
involuntarily
that
he
snatched
up
that
fatal
pestle
and
then
we
find
him
in
his
fathers
gardenthe
coast
is
clear
there
are
no
witnesses
darkness
and
jealousy
the
suspicion
that
she
was
there
with
him
with
his
rival
in
his
arms
and
perhaps
laughing
at
him
at
that
momenttook
his
breath
away
and
it
was
not
mere
suspicion
the
deception
was
open
obvious
she
must
be
there
in
that
lighted
room
she
must
be
behind
the
screen
and
the
unhappy
man
would
have
us
believe
that
he
stole
up
to
the
window
peeped
respectfully
in
and
discreetly
withdrew
for
fear
something
terrible
and
immoral
should
happen
and
he
tries
to
persuade
us
of
that
us
who
understand
his
character
who
know
his
state
of
mind
at
the
moment
and
that
he
knew
the
signals
by
which
he
could
at
once
enter
the
house
at
this
point
ippolit
kirillovitch
broke
off
to
discuss
exhaustively
the
suspected
connection
of
smerdyakov
with
the
murder
he
did
this
very
circumstantially
and
every
one
realized
that
although
he
professed
to
despise
that
suspicion
he
thought
the
subject
of
great
importance
chapter
viii
a
treatise
on
smerdyakov
to
begin
with
what
was
the
source
of
this
suspicion
ippolit
kirillovitch
began
the
first
person
who
cried
out
that
smerdyakov
had
committed
the
murder
was
the
prisoner
himself
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
yet
from
that
time
to
this
he
had
not
brought
forward
a
single
fact
to
confirm
the
charge
nor
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
fact
the
charge
is
confirmed
by
three
persons
onlythe
two
brothers
of
the
prisoner
and
madame
svyetlov
the
elder
of
these
brothers
expressed
his
suspicions
only
today
when
he
was
undoubtedly
suffering
from
brain
fever
but
we
know
that
for
the
last
two
months
he
has
completely
shared
our
conviction
of
his
brothers
guilt
and
did
not
attempt
to
combat
that
idea
but
of
that
later
the
younger
brother
has
admitted
that
he
has
not
the
slightest
fact
to
support
his
notion
of
smerdyakovs
guilt
and
has
only
been
led
to
that
conclusion
from
the
prisoners
own
words
and
the
expression
of
his
face
yes
that
astounding
piece
of
evidence
has
been
brought
forward
twice
to
day
by
him
madame
svyetlov
was
even
more
astounding
what
the
prisoner
tells
you
you
must
believe
he
is
not
a
man
to
tell
a
lie
that
is
all
the
evidence
against
smerdyakov
produced
by
these
three
persons
who
are
all
deeply
concerned
in
the
prisoners
fate
and
yet
the
theory
of
smerdyakovs
guilt
has
been
noised
about
has
been
and
is
still
maintained
is
it
credible
is
it
conceivable
here
ippolit
kirillovitch
thought
it
necessary
to
describe
the
personality
of
smerdyakov
who
had
cut
short
his
life
in
a
fit
of
insanity
he
depicted
him
as
a
man
of
weak
intellect
with
a
smattering
of
education
who
had
been
thrown
off
his
balance
by
philosophical
ideas
above
his
level
and
certain
modern
theories
of
duty
which
he
learnt
in
practice
from
the
reckless
life
of
his
master
who
was
also
perhaps
his
fatherfyodor
pavlovitch
and
theoretically
from
various
strange
philosophical
conversations
with
his
masters
elder
son
ivan
fyodorovitch
who
readily
indulged
in
this
diversion
probably
feeling
dull
or
wishing
to
amuse
himself
at
the
valets
expense
he
spoke
to
me
himself
of
his
spiritual
condition
during
the
last
few
days
at
his
fathers
house
ippolit
kirillovitch
explained
but
others
too
have
borne
witness
to
itthe
prisoner
himself
his
brother
and
the
servant
grigorythat
is
all
who
knew
him
well
moreover
smerdyakov
whose
health
was
shaken
by
his
attacks
of
epilepsy
had
not
the
courage
of
a
chicken
he
fell
at
my
feet
and
kissed
them
the
prisoner
himself
has
told
us
before
he
realized
how
damaging
such
a
statement
was
to
himself
he
is
an
epileptic
chicken
he
declared
about
him
in
his
characteristic
language
and
the
prisoner
chose
him
for
his
confidant
we
have
his
own
word
for
it
and
he
frightened
him
into
consenting
at
last
to
act
as
a
spy
for
him
in
that
capacity
he
deceived
his
master
revealing
to
the
prisoner
the
existence
of
the
envelope
with
the
notes
in
it
and
the
signals
by
means
of
which
he
could
get
into
the
house
how
could
he
help
telling
him
indeed
he
would
have
killed
me
i
could
see
that
he
would
have
killed
me
he
said
at
the
inquiry
trembling
and
shaking
even
before
us
though
his
tormentor
was
by
that
time
arrested
and
could
do
him
no
harm
he
suspected
me
at
every
instant
in
fear
and
trembling
i
hastened
to
tell
him
every
secret
to
pacify
him
that
he
might
see
that
i
had
not
deceived
him
and
let
me
off
alive
those
are
his
own
words
i
wrote
them
down
and
i
remember
them
when
he
began
shouting
at
me
i
would
fall
on
my
knees
he
was
naturally
very
honest
and
enjoyed
the
complete
confidence
of
his
master
ever
since
he
had
restored
him
some
money
he
had
lost
so
it
may
be
supposed
that
the
poor
fellow
suffered
pangs
of
remorse
at
having
deceived
his
master
whom
he
loved
as
his
benefactor
persons
severely
afflicted
with
epilepsy
are
so
the
most
skillful
doctors
tell
us
always
prone
to
continual
and
morbid
selfreproach
they
worry
over
their
wickedness
they
are
tormented
by
pangs
of
conscience
often
entirely
without
cause
they
exaggerate
and
often
invent
all
sorts
of
faults
and
crimes
and
here
we
have
a
man
of
that
type
who
had
really
been
driven
to
wrongdoing
by
terror
and
intimidation
he
had
besides
a
strong
presentiment
that
something
terrible
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
situation
that
was
developing
before
his
eyes
when
ivan
fyodorovitch
was
leaving
for
moscow
just
before
the
catastrophe
smerdyakov
besought
him
to
remain
though
he
was
too
timid
to
tell
him
plainly
what
he
feared
he
confined
himself
to
hints
but
his
hints
were
not
understood
it
must
be
observed
that
he
looked
on
ivan
fyodorovitch
as
a
protector
whose
presence
in
the
house
was
a
guarantee
that
no
harm
would
come
to
pass
remember
the
phrase
in
dmitri
karamazovs
drunken
letter
i
shall
kill
the
old
man
if
only
ivan
goes
away
so
ivan
fyodorovitchs
presence
seemed
to
every
one
a
guarantee
of
peace
and
order
in
the
house
but
he
went
away
and
within
an
hour
of
his
young
masters
departure
smerdyakov
was
taken
with
an
epileptic
fit
but
thats
perfectly
intelligible
here
i
must
mention
that
smerdyakov
oppressed
by
terror
and
despair
of
a
sort
had
felt
during
those
last
few
days
that
one
of
the
fits
from
which
he
had
suffered
before
at
moments
of
strain
might
be
coming
upon
him
again
the
day
and
hour
of
such
an
attack
cannot
of
course
be
foreseen
but
every
epileptic
can
feel
beforehand
that
he
is
likely
to
have
one
so
the
doctors
tell
us
and
so
as
soon
as
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
driven
out
of
the
yard
smerdyakov
depressed
by
his
lonely
and
unprotected
position
went
to
the
cellar
he
went
down
the
stairs
wondering
if
he
would
have
a
fit
or
not
and
what
if
it
were
to
come
upon
him
at
once
and
that
very
apprehension
that
very
wonder
brought
on
the
spasm
in
his
throat
that
always
precedes
such
attacks
and
he
fell
unconscious
into
the
cellar
and
in
this
perfectly
natural
occurrence
people
try
to
detect
a
suspicion
a
hint
that
he
was
shamming
an
attack
on
purpose
but
if
it
were
on
purpose
the
question
arises
at
once
what
was
his
motive
what
was
he
reckoning
on
what
was
he
aiming
at
i
say
nothing
about
medicine
science
i
am
told
may
go
astray
the
doctors
were
not
able
to
discriminate
between
the
counterfeit
and
the
real
that
may
be
so
but
answer
me
one
question
what
motive
had
he
for
such
a
counterfeit
could
he
had
he
been
plotting
the
murder
have
desired
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
household
by
having
a
fit
just
before
you
see
gentlemen
of
the
jury
on
the
night
of
the
murder
there
were
five
persons
in
fyodor
pavlovitchsfyodor
pavlovitch
himself
but
he
did
not
kill
himself
thats
evident
then
his
servant
grigory
but
he
was
almost
killed
himself
the
third
person
was
grigorys
wife
marfa
ignatyevna
but
it
would
be
simply
shameful
to
imagine
her
murdering
her
master
two
persons
are
leftthe
prisoner
and
smerdyakov
but
if
we
are
to
believe
the
prisoners
statement
that
he
is
not
the
murderer
then
smerdyakov
must
have
been
for
there
is
no
other
alternative
no
one
else
can
be
found
that
is
what
accounts
for
the
artful
astounding
accusation
against
the
unhappy
idiot
who
committed
suicide
yesterday
had
a
shadow
of
suspicion
rested
on
any
one
else
had
there
been
any
sixth
person
i
am
persuaded
that
even
the
prisoner
would
have
been
ashamed
to
accuse
smerdyakov
and
would
have
accused
that
sixth
person
for
to
charge
smerdyakov
with
that
murder
is
perfectly
absurd
gentlemen
let
us
lay
aside
psychology
let
us
lay
aside
medicine
let
us
even
lay
aside
logic
let
us
turn
only
to
the
facts
and
see
what
the
facts
tell
us
if
smerdyakov
killed
him
how
did
he
do
it
alone
or
with
the
assistance
of
the
prisoner
let
us
consider
the
first
alternativethat
he
did
it
alone
if
he
had
killed
him
it
must
have
been
with
some
object
for
some
advantage
to
himself
but
not
having
a
shadow
of
the
motive
that
the
prisoner
had
for
the
murderhatred
jealousy
and
so
onsmerdyakov
could
only
have
murdered
him
for
the
sake
of
gain
in
order
to
appropriate
the
three
thousand
roubles
he
had
seen
his
master
put
in
the
envelope
and
yet
he
tells
another
personand
a
person
most
closely
interested
that
is
the
prisonereverything
about
the
money
and
the
signals
where
the
envelope
lay
what
was
written
on
it
what
it
was
tied
up
with
and
above
all
told
him
of
those
signals
by
which
he
could
enter
the
house
did
he
do
this
simply
to
betray
himself
or
to
invite
to
the
same
enterprise
one
who
would
be
anxious
to
get
that
envelope
for
himself
yes
i
shall
be
told
but
he
betrayed
it
from
fear
but
how
do
you
explain
this
a
man
who
could
conceive
such
an
audacious
savage
act
and
carry
it
out
tells
facts
which
are
known
to
no
one
else
in
the
world
and
which
if
he
held
his
tongue
no
one
would
ever
have
guessed
no
however
cowardly
he
might
be
if
he
had
plotted
such
a
crime
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
tell
any
one
about
the
envelope
and
the
signals
for
that
was
as
good
as
betraying
himself
beforehand
he
would
have
invented
something
he
would
have
told
some
lie
if
he
had
been
forced
to
give
information
but
he
would
have
been
silent
about
that
for
on
the
other
hand
if
he
had
said
nothing
about
the
money
but
had
committed
the
murder
and
stolen
the
money
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
charged
him
with
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
since
no
one
but
he
had
seen
the
money
no
one
but
he
knew
of
its
existence
in
the
house
even
if
he
had
been
accused
of
the
murder
it
could
only
have
been
thought
that
he
had
committed
it
from
some
other
motive
but
since
no
one
had
observed
any
such
motive
in
him
beforehand
and
every
one
saw
on
the
contrary
that
his
master
was
fond
of
him
and
honored
him
with
his
confidence
he
would
of
course
have
been
the
last
to
be
suspected
people
would
have
suspected
first
the
man
who
had
a
motive
a
man
who
had
himself
declared
he
had
such
motives
who
had
made
no
secret
of
it
they
would
in
fact
have
suspected
the
son
of
the
murdered
man
dmitri
fyodorovitch
had
smerdyakov
killed
and
robbed
him
and
the
son
been
accused
of
it
that
would
of
course
have
suited
smerdyakov
yet
are
we
to
believe
that
though
plotting
the
murder
he
told
that
son
dmitri
about
the
money
the
envelope
and
the
signals
is
that
logical
is
that
clear
when
the
day
of
the
murder
planned
by
smerdyakov
came
we
have
him
falling
downstairs
in
a
feigned
fitwith
what
object
in
the
first
place
that
grigory
who
had
been
intending
to
take
his
medicine
might
put
it
off
and
remain
on
guard
seeing
there
was
no
one
to
look
after
the
house
and
in
the
second
place
i
suppose
that
his
master
seeing
that
there
was
no
one
to
guard
him
and
in
terror
of
a
visit
from
his
son
might
redouble
his
vigilance
and
precaution
and
most
of
all
i
suppose
that
he
smerdyakov
disabled
by
the
fit
might
be
carried
from
the
kitchen
where
he
always
slept
apart
from
all
the
rest
and
where
he
could
go
in
and
out
as
he
liked
to
grigorys
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
lodge
where
he
was
always
put
shut
off
by
a
screen
three
paces
from
their
own
bed
this
was
the
immemorial
custom
established
by
his
master
and
the
kindhearted
marfa
ignatyevna
whenever
he
had
a
fit
there
lying
behind
the
screen
he
would
most
likely
to
keep
up
the
sham
have
begun
groaning
and
so
keeping
them
awake
all
night
as
grigory
and
his
wife
testified
and
all
this
we
are
to
believe
that
he
might
more
conveniently
get
up
and
murder
his
master
but
i
shall
be
told
that
he
shammed
illness
on
purpose
that
he
might
not
be
suspected
and
that
he
told
the
prisoner
of
the
money
and
the
signals
to
tempt
him
to
commit
the
murder
and
when
he
had
murdered
him
and
had
gone
away
with
the
money
making
a
noise
most
likely
and
waking
people
smerdyakov
got
up
am
i
to
believe
and
went
inwhat
for
to
murder
his
master
a
second
time
and
carry
off
the
money
that
had
already
been
stolen
gentlemen
are
you
laughing
i
am
ashamed
to
put
forward
such
suggestions
but
incredible
as
it
seems
thats
just
what
the
prisoner
alleges
when
he
had
left
the
house
had
knocked
grigory
down
and
raised
an
alarm
he
tells
us
smerdyakov
got
up
went
in
and
murdered
his
master
and
stole
the
money
i
wont
press
the
point
that
smerdyakov
could
hardly
have
reckoned
on
this
beforehand
and
have
foreseen
that
the
furious
and
exasperated
son
would
simply
come
to
peep
in
respectfully
though
he
knew
the
signals
and
beat
a
retreat
leaving
smerdyakov
his
booty
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
put
this
question
to
you
in
earnest
when
was
the
moment
when
smerdyakov
could
have
committed
his
crime
name
that
moment
or
you
cant
accuse
him
but
perhaps
the
fit
was
a
real
one
the
sick
man
suddenly
recovered
heard
a
shout
and
went
out
wellwhat
then
he
looked
about
him
and
said
why
not
go
and
kill
the
master
and
how
did
he
know
what
had
happened
since
he
had
been
lying
unconscious
till
that
moment
but
theres
a
limit
to
these
flights
of
fancy

quite
so
some
astute
people
will
tell
me
but
what
if
they
were
in
agreement
what
if
they
murdered
him
together
and
shared
the
moneywhat
then
a
weighty
question
truly
and
the
facts
to
confirm
it
are
astounding
one
commits
the
murder
and
takes
all
the
trouble
while
his
accomplice
lies
on
one
side
shamming
a
fit
apparently
to
arouse
suspicion
in
every
one
alarm
in
his
master
and
alarm
in
grigory
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
motives
could
have
induced
the
two
accomplices
to
form
such
an
insane
plan
but
perhaps
it
was
not
a
case
of
active
complicity
on
smerdyakovs
part
but
only
of
passive
acquiescence
perhaps
smerdyakov
was
intimidated
and
agreed
not
to
prevent
the
murder
and
foreseeing
that
he
would
be
blamed
for
letting
his
master
be
murdered
without
screaming
for
help
or
resisting
he
may
have
obtained
permission
from
dmitri
karamazov
to
get
out
of
the
way
by
shamming
a
fityou
may
murder
him
as
you
like
its
nothing
to
me
but
as
this
attack
of
smerdyakovs
was
bound
to
throw
the
household
into
confusion
dmitri
karamazov
could
never
have
agreed
to
such
a
plan
i
will
waive
that
point
however
supposing
that
he
did
agree
it
would
still
follow
that
dmitri
karamazov
is
the
murderer
and
the
instigator
and
smerdyakov
is
only
a
passive
accomplice
and
not
even
an
accomplice
but
merely
acquiesced
against
his
will
through
terror
but
what
do
we
see
as
soon
as
he
is
arrested
the
prisoner
instantly
throws
all
the
blame
on
smerdyakov
not
accusing
him
of
being
his
accomplice
but
of
being
himself
the
murderer
he
did
it
alone
he
says
he
murdered
and
robbed
him
it
was
the
work
of
his
hands
strange
sort
of
accomplices
who
begin
to
accuse
one
another
at
once
and
think
of
the
risk
for
karamazov
after
committing
the
murder
while
his
accomplice
lay
in
bed
he
throws
the
blame
on
the
invalid
who
might
well
have
resented
it
and
in
selfpreservation
might
well
have
confessed
the
truth
for
he
might
well
have
seen
that
the
court
would
at
once
judge
how
far
he
was
responsible
and
so
he
might
well
have
reckoned
that
if
he
were
punished
it
would
be
far
less
severely
than
the
real
murderer
but
in
that
case
he
would
have
been
certain
to
make
a
confession
yet
he
has
not
done
so
smerdyakov
never
hinted
at
their
complicity
though
the
actual
murderer
persisted
in
accusing
him
and
declaring
that
he
had
committed
the
crime
alone
whats
more
smerdyakov
at
the
inquiry
volunteered
the
statement
that
it
was
he
who
had
told
the
prisoner
of
the
envelope
of
notes
and
of
the
signals
and
that
but
for
him
he
would
have
known
nothing
about
them
if
he
had
really
been
a
guilty
accomplice
would
he
so
readily
have
made
this
statement
at
the
inquiry
on
the
contrary
he
would
have
tried
to
conceal
it
to
distort
the
facts
or
minimize
them
but
he
was
far
from
distorting
or
minimizing
them
no
one
but
an
innocent
man
who
had
no
fear
of
being
charged
with
complicity
could
have
acted
as
he
did
and
in
a
fit
of
melancholy
arising
from
his
disease
and
this
catastrophe
he
hanged
himself
yesterday
he
left
a
note
written
in
his
peculiar
language
i
destroy
myself
of
my
own
will
and
inclination
so
as
to
throw
no
blame
on
any
one
what
would
it
have
cost
him
to
add
i
am
the
murderer
not
karamazov
but
that
he
did
not
add
did
his
conscience
lead
him
to
suicide
and
not
to
avowing
his
guilt
and
what
followed
notes
for
three
thousand
roubles
were
brought
into
the
court
just
now
and
we
were
told
that
they
were
the
same
that
lay
in
the
envelope
now
on
the
table
before
us
and
that
the
witness
had
received
them
from
smerdyakov
the
day
before
but
i
need
not
recall
the
painful
scene
though
i
will
make
one
or
two
comments
selecting
such
trivial
ones
as
might
not
be
obvious
at
first
sight
to
every
one
and
so
may
be
overlooked
in
the
first
place
smerdyakov
must
have
given
back
the
money
and
hanged
himself
yesterday
from
remorse
and
only
yesterday
he
confessed
his
guilt
to
ivan
karamazov
as
the
latter
informs
us
if
it
were
not
so
indeed
why
should
ivan
fyodorovitch
have
kept
silence
till
now
and
so
if
he
has
confessed
then
why
i
ask
again
did
he
not
avow
the
whole
truth
in
the
last
letter
he
left
behind
knowing
that
the
innocent
prisoner
had
to
face
this
terrible
ordeal
the
next
day
the
money
alone
is
no
proof
a
week
ago
quite
by
chance
the
fact
came
to
the
knowledge
of
myself
and
two
other
persons
in
this
court
that
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
sent
two
five
per
cent
coupons
of
five
thousand
eachthat
is
ten
thousand
in
allto
the
chief
town
of
the
province
to
be
changed
i
only
mention
this
to
point
out
that
any
one
may
have
money
and
that
it
cant
be
proved
that
these
notes
are
the
same
as
were
in
fyodor
pavlovitchs
envelope
ivan
karamazov
after
receiving
yesterday
a
communication
of
such
importance
from
the
real
murderer
did
not
stir
why
didnt
he
report
it
at
once
why
did
he
put
it
all
off
till
morning
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
conjecture
why
his
health
had
been
giving
way
for
a
week
past
he
had
admitted
to
a
doctor
and
to
his
most
intimate
friends
that
he
was
suffering
from
hallucinations
and
seeing
phantoms
of
the
dead
he
was
on
the
eve
of
the
attack
of
brain
fever
by
which
he
has
been
stricken
down
today
in
this
condition
he
suddenly
heard
of
smerdyakovs
death
and
at
once
reflected
the
man
is
dead
i
can
throw
the
blame
on
him
and
save
my
brother
i
have
money
i
will
take
a
roll
of
notes
and
say
that
smerdyakov
gave
them
me
before
his
death
you
will
say
that
was
dishonorable
its
dishonorable
to
slander
even
the
dead
and
even
to
save
a
brother
true
but
what
if
he
slandered
him
unconsciously
what
if
finally
unhinged
by
the
sudden
news
of
the
valets
death
he
imagined
it
really
was
so
you
saw
the
recent
scene
you
have
seen
the
witnesss
condition
he
was
standing
up
and
was
speaking
but
where
was
his
mind
then
followed
the
document
the
prisoners
letter
written
two
days
before
the
crime
and
containing
a
complete
program
of
the
murder
why
then
are
we
looking
for
any
other
program
the
crime
was
committed
precisely
according
to
this
program
and
by
no
other
than
the
writer
of
it
yes
gentlemen
of
the
jury
it
went
off
without
a
hitch
he
did
not
run
respectfully
and
timidly
away
from
his
fathers
window
though
he
was
firmly
convinced
that
the
object
of
his
affections
was
with
him
no
that
is
absurd
and
unlikely
he
went
in
and
murdered
him
most
likely
he
killed
him
in
anger
burning
with
resentment
as
soon
as
he
looked
on
his
hated
rival
but
having
killed
him
probably
with
one
blow
of
the
brass
pestle
and
having
convinced
himself
after
careful
search
that
she
was
not
there
he
did
not
however
forget
to
put
his
hand
under
the
pillow
and
take
out
the
envelope
the
torn
cover
of
which
lies
now
on
the
table
before
us
i
mention
this
fact
that
you
may
note
one
to
my
thinking
very
characteristic
circumstance
had
he
been
an
experienced
murderer
and
had
he
committed
the
murder
for
the
sake
of
gain
only
would
he
have
left
the
torn
envelope
on
the
floor
as
it
was
found
beside
the
corpse
had
it
been
smerdyakov
for
instance
murdering
his
master
to
rob
him
he
would
have
simply
carried
away
the
envelope
with
him
without
troubling
himself
to
open
it
over
his
victims
corpse
for
he
would
have
known
for
certain
that
the
notes
were
in
the
envelopethey
had
been
put
in
and
sealed
up
in
his
presenceand
had
he
taken
the
envelope
with
him
no
one
would
ever
have
known
of
the
robbery
i
ask
you
gentlemen
would
smerdyakov
have
behaved
in
that
way
would
he
have
left
the
envelope
on
the
floor
no
this
was
the
action
of
a
frantic
murderer
a
murderer
who
was
not
a
thief
and
had
never
stolen
before
that
day
who
snatched
the
notes
from
under
the
pillow
not
like
a
thief
stealing
them
but
as
though
seizing
his
own
property
from
the
thief
who
had
stolen
it
for
that
was
the
idea
which
had
become
almost
an
insane
obsession
in
dmitri
karamazov
in
regard
to
that
money
and
pouncing
upon
the
envelope
which
he
had
never
seen
before
he
tore
it
open
to
make
sure
whether
the
money
was
in
it
and
ran
away
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
even
forgetting
to
consider
that
he
had
left
an
astounding
piece
of
evidence
against
himself
in
that
torn
envelope
on
the
floor
all
because
it
was
karamazov
not
smerdyakov
he
didnt
think
he
didnt
reflect
and
how
should
he
he
ran
away
he
heard
behind
him
the
servant
cry
out
the
old
man
caught
him
stopped
him
and
was
felled
to
the
ground
by
the
brass
pestle
the
prisoner
moved
by
pity
leapt
down
to
look
at
him
would
you
believe
it
he
tells
us
that
he
leapt
down
out
of
pity
out
of
compassion
to
see
whether
he
could
do
anything
for
him
was
that
a
moment
to
show
compassion
no
he
jumped
down
simply
to
make
certain
whether
the
only
witness
of
his
crime
were
dead
or
alive
any
other
feeling
any
other
motive
would
be
unnatural
note
that
he
took
trouble
over
grigory
wiped
his
head
with
his
handkerchief
and
convincing
himself
he
was
dead
he
ran
to
the
house
of
his
mistress
dazed
and
covered
with
blood
how
was
it
he
never
thought
that
he
was
covered
with
blood
and
would
be
at
once
detected
but
the
prisoner
himself
assures
us
that
he
did
not
even
notice
that
he
was
covered
with
blood
that
may
be
believed
that
is
very
possible
that
always
happens
at
such
moments
with
criminals
on
one
point
they
will
show
diabolical
cunning
while
another
will
escape
them
altogether
but
he
was
thinking
at
that
moment
of
one
thing
onlywhere
was
she
he
wanted
to
find
out
at
once
where
she
was
so
he
ran
to
her
lodging
and
learnt
an
unexpected
and
astounding
piece
of
newsshe
had
gone
off
to
mokroe
to
meet
her
first
lover
chapter
ix
the
galloping
troika
the
end
of
the
prosecutors
speech
ippolit
kirillovitch
had
chosen
the
historical
method
of
exposition
beloved
by
all
nervous
orators
who
find
in
its
limitation
a
check
on
their
own
eager
rhetoric
at
this
moment
in
his
speech
he
went
off
into
a
dissertation
on
grushenkas
first
lover
and
brought
forward
several
interesting
thoughts
on
this
theme
karamazov
who
had
been
frantically
jealous
of
every
one
collapsed
so
to
speak
and
effaced
himself
at
once
before
this
first
lover
what
makes
it
all
the
more
strange
is
that
he
seems
to
have
hardly
thought
of
this
formidable
rival
but
he
had
looked
upon
him
as
a
remote
danger
and
karamazov
always
lives
in
the
present
possibly
he
regarded
him
as
a
fiction
but
his
wounded
heart
grasped
instantly
that
the
woman
had
been
concealing
this
new
rival
and
deceiving
him
because
he
was
anything
but
a
fiction
to
her
because
he
was
the
one
hope
of
her
life
grasping
this
instantly
he
resigned
himself
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
cannot
help
dwelling
on
this
unexpected
trait
in
the
prisoners
character
he
suddenly
evinces
an
irresistible
desire
for
justice
a
respect
for
woman
and
a
recognition
of
her
right
to
love
and
all
this
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
stained
his
hands
with
his
fathers
blood
for
her
sake
it
is
true
that
the
blood
he
had
shed
was
already
crying
out
for
vengeance
for
after
having
ruined
his
soul
and
his
life
in
this
world
he
was
forced
to
ask
himself
at
that
same
instant
what
he
was
and
what
he
could
be
now
to
her
to
that
being
dearer
to
him
than
his
own
soul
in
comparison
with
that
former
lover
who
had
returned
penitent
with
new
love
to
the
woman
he
had
once
betrayed
with
honorable
offers
with
the
promise
of
a
reformed
and
happy
life
and
he
luckless
man
what
could
he
give
her
now
what
could
he
offer
her
karamazov
felt
all
this
knew
that
all
ways
were
barred
to
him
by
his
crime
and
that
he
was
a
criminal
under
sentence
and
not
a
man
with
life
before
him
this
thought
crushed
him
and
so
he
instantly
flew
to
one
frantic
plan
which
to
a
man
of
karamazovs
character
must
have
appeared
the
one
inevitable
way
out
of
his
terrible
position
that
way
out
was
suicide
he
ran
for
the
pistols
he
had
left
in
pledge
with
his
friend
perhotin
and
on
the
way
as
he
ran
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
the
money
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
stained
his
hands
with
his
fathers
gore
oh
now
he
needed
money
more
than
ever
karamazov
would
die
karamazov
would
shoot
himself
and
it
should
be
remembered
to
be
sure
he
was
a
poet
and
had
burnt
the
candle
at
both
ends
all
his
life
to
her
to
her
and
there
oh
there
i
will
give
a
feast
to
the
whole
world
such
as
never
was
before
that
will
be
remembered
and
talked
of
long
after
in
the
midst
of
shouts
of
wild
merriment
reckless
gypsy
songs
and
dances
i
shall
raise
the
glass
and
drink
to
the
woman
i
adore
and
her
newfound
happiness
and
then
on
the
spot
at
her
feet
i
shall
dash
out
my
brains
before
her
and
punish
myself
she
will
remember
mitya
karamazov
sometimes
she
will
see
how
mitya
loved
her
she
will
feel
for
mitya
here
we
see
in
excess
a
love
of
effect
a
romantic
despair
and
sentimentality
and
the
wild
recklessness
of
the
karamazovs
yes
but
there
is
something
else
gentlemen
of
the
jury
something
that
cries
out
in
the
soul
throbs
incessantly
in
the
mind
and
poisons
the
heart
unto
deaththat
something
is
conscience
gentlemen
of
the
jury
its
judgment
its
terrible
torments
the
pistol
will
settle
everything
the
pistol
is
the
only
way
out
but
beyondi
dont
know
whether
karamazov
wondered
at
that
moment
what
lies
beyond
and
whether
karamazov
could
like
hamlet
wonder
what
lies
beyond
no
gentlemen
of
the
jury
they
have
their
hamlets
but
we
still
have
our
karamazovs

ippolit
kirillovitch
drew
a
minute
picture
of
mityas
preparations
the
scene
at
perhotins
at
the
shop
with
the
drivers
he
quoted
numerous
words
and
actions
confirmed
by
witnesses
and
the
picture
made
a
terrible
impression
on
the
audience
the
guilt
of
this
harassed
and
desperate
man
stood
out
clear
and
convincing
when
the
facts
were
brought
together
what
need
had
he
of
precaution
two
or
three
times
he
almost
confessed
hinted
at
it
all
but
spoke
out
then
followed
the
evidence
given
by
witnesses
he
even
cried
out
to
the
peasant
who
drove
him
do
you
know
you
are
driving
a
murderer
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
speak
out
he
had
to
get
to
mokroe
and
there
to
finish
his
romance
but
what
was
awaiting
the
luckless
man
almost
from
the
first
minute
at
mokroe
he
saw
that
his
invincible
rival
was
perhaps
by
no
means
so
invincible
that
the
toast
to
their
newfound
happiness
was
not
desired
and
would
not
be
acceptable
but
you
know
the
facts
gentlemen
of
the
jury
from
the
preliminary
inquiry
karamazovs
triumph
over
his
rival
was
complete
and
his
soul
passed
into
quite
a
new
phase
perhaps
the
most
terrible
phase
through
which
his
soul
has
passed
or
will
pass
one
may
say
with
certainty
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
prosecutor
continued
that
outraged
nature
and
the

heart
bring
their
own
vengeance
more
completely
than
any
earthly
justice
whats
more
justice
and
punishment
on
earth
positively
alleviate
the
punishment
of
nature
and
are
indeed
essential
to
the
soul
of
the
criminal
at
such
moments
as
its
salvation
from
despair
for
i
cannot
imagine
the
horror
and
moral
suffering
of
karamazov
when
he
learnt
that
she
loved
him
that
for
his
sake
she
had
rejected
her
first
lover
that
she
was
summoning
him
mitya
to
a
new
life
that
she
was
promising
him
happinessand
when
when
everything
was
over
for
him
and
nothing
was
possible
by
the
way
i
will
note
in
parenthesis
a
point
of
importance
for
the
light
it
throws
on
the
prisoners
position
at
the
moment
this
woman
this
love
of
his
had
been
till
the
last
moment
till
the
very
instant
of
his
arrest
a
being
unattainable
passionately
desired
by
him
but
unattainable
yet
why
did
he
not
shoot
himself
then
why
did
he
relinquish
his
design
and
even
forget
where
his
pistol
was
it
was
just
that
passionate
desire
for
love
and
the
hope
of
satisfying
it
that
restrained
him
throughout
their
revels
he
kept
close
to
his
adored
mistress
who
was
at
the
banquet
with
him
and
was
more
charming
and
fascinating
to
him
than
everhe
did
not
leave
her
side
abasing
himself
in
his
homage
before
her
his
passion
might
well
for
a
moment
stifle
not
only
the
fear
of
arrest
but
even
the
torments
of
conscience
for
a
moment
oh
only
for
a
moment
i
can
picture
the
state
of
mind
of
the
criminal
hopelessly
enslaved
by
these
influencesfirst
the
influence
of
drink
of
noise
and
excitement
of
the
thud
of
the
dance
and
the
scream
of
the
song
and
of
her
flushed
with
wine
singing
and
dancing
and
laughing
to
him
secondly
the
hope
in
the
background
that
the
fatal
end
might
still
be
far
off
that
not
till
next
morning
at
least
they
would
come
and
take
him
so
he
had
a
few
hours
and
thats
much
very
much
in
a
few
hours
one
can
think
of
many
things
i
imagine
that
he
felt
something
like
what
criminals
feel
when
they
are
being
taken
to
the
scaffold
they
have
another
long
long
street
to
pass
down
and
at
walking
pace
past
thousands
of
people
then
there
will
be
a
turning
into
another
street
and
only
at
the
end
of
that
street
the
dread
place
of
execution
i
fancy
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
the
condemned
man
sitting
on
his
shameful
cart
must
feel
that
he
has
infinite
life
still
before
him
the
houses
recede
the
cart
moves
onoh
thats
nothing
its
still
far
to
the
turning
into
the
second
street
and
he
still
looks
boldly
to
right
and
to
left
at
those
thousands
of
callously
curious
people
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
he
still
fancies
that
he
is
just
such
a
man
as
they
but
now
the
turning
comes
to
the
next
street
oh
thats
nothing
nothing
theres
still
a
whole
street
before
him
and
however
many
houses
have
been
passed
he
will
still
think
there
are
many
left
and
so
to
the
very
end
to
the
very
scaffold
this
i
imagine
is
how
it
was
with
karamazov
then
theyve
not
had
time
yet
he
must
have
thought
i
may
still
find
some
way
out
oh
theres
still
time
to
make
some
plan
of
defense
and
now
nowshe
is
so
fascinating
his
soul
was
full
of
confusion
and
dread
but
he
managed
however
to
put
aside
half
his
money
and
hide
it
somewherei
cannot
otherwise
explain
the
disappearance
of
quite
half
of
the
three
thousand
he
had
just
taken
from
his
fathers
pillow
he
had
been
in
mokroe
more
than
once
before
he
had
caroused
there
for
two
days
together
already
he
knew
the
old
big
house
with
all
its
passages
and
outbuildings
i
imagine
that
part
of
the
money
was
hidden
in
that
house
not
long
before
the
arrest
in
some
crevice
under
some
floor
in
some
corner
under
the
roof
with
what
object
i
shall
be
asked
why
the
catastrophe
may
take
place
at
once
of
course
he
hadnt
yet
considered
how
to
meet
it
he
hadnt
the
time
his
head
was
throbbing
and
his
heart
was
with
her
but
moneymoney
was
indispensable
in
any
case
with
money
a
man
is
always
a
man
perhaps
such
foresight
at
such
a
moment
may
strike
you
as
unnatural
but
he
assures
us
himself
that
a
month
before
at
a
critical
and
exciting
moment
he
had
halved
his
money
and
sewn
it
up
in
a
little
bag
and
though
that
was
not
true
as
we
shall
prove
directly
it
shows
the
idea
was
a
familiar
one
to
karamazov
he
had
contemplated
it
whats
more
when
he
declared
at
the
inquiry
that
he
had
put
fifteen
hundred
roubles
in
a
bag
which
never
existed
he
may
have
invented
that
little
bag
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
because
he
had
two
hours
before
divided
his
money
and
hidden
half
of
it
at
mokroe
till
morning
in
case
of
emergency
simply
not
to
have
it
on
himself
two
extremes
gentlemen
of
the
jury
remember
that
karamazov
can
contemplate
two
extremes
and
both
at
once
we
have
looked
in
the
house
but
we
havent
found
the
money
it
may
still
be
there
or
it
may
have
disappeared
next
day
and
be
in
the
prisoners
hands
now
in
any
case
he
was
at
her
side
on
his
knees
before
her
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
he
had
his
hands
stretched
out
to
her
and
he
had
so
entirely
forgotten
everything
that
he
did
not
even
hear
the
men
coming
to
arrest
him
he
hadnt
time
to
prepare
any
line
of
defense
in
his
mind
he
was
caught
unawares
and
confronted
with
his
judges
the
arbiters
of
his
destiny
gentlemen
of
the
jury
there
are
moments
in
the
execution
of
our
duties
when
it
is
terrible
for
us
to
face
a
man
terrible
on
his
account
too
the
moments
of
contemplating
that
animal
fear
when
the
criminal
sees
that
all
is
lost
but
still
struggles
still
means
to
struggle
the
moments
when
every
instinct
of
selfpreservation
rises
up
in
him
at
once
and
he
looks
at
you
with
questioning
and
suffering
eyes
studies
you
your
face
your
thoughts
uncertain
on
which
side
you
will
strike
and
his
distracted
mind
frames
thousands
of
plans
in
an
instant
but
he
is
still
afraid
to
speak
afraid
of
giving
himself
away
this
purgatory
of
the
spirit
this
animal
thirst
for
selfpreservation
these
humiliating
moments
of
the
human
soul
are
awful
and
sometimes
arouse
horror
and
compassion
for
the
criminal
even
in
the
lawyer
and
this
was
what
we
all
witnessed
then
at
first
he
was
thunderstruck
and
in
his
terror
dropped
some
very
compromising
phrases
blood
ive
deserved
it
but
he
quickly
restrained
himself
he
had
not
prepared
what
he
was
to
say
what
answer
he
was
to
make
he
had
nothing
but
a
bare
denial
ready
i
am
not
guilty
of
my
fathers
death
that
was
his
fence
for
the
moment
and
behind
it
he
hoped
to
throw
up
a
barricade
of
some
sort
his
first
compromising
exclamations
he
hastened
to
explain
by
declaring
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
servant
grigory
only
of
that
bloodshed
i
am
guilty
but
who
has
killed
my
father
gentlemen
who
has
killed
him
who
can
have
killed
him
if
not
i
do
you
hear
he
asked
us
that
us
who
had
come
to
ask
him
that
question
do
you
hear
that
phrase
uttered
with
such
premature
hasteif
not
ithe
animal
cunning
the
navet
the
karamazov
impatience
of
it
i
didnt
kill
him
and
you
mustnt
think
i
did
i
wanted
to
kill
him
gentlemen
i
wanted
to
kill
him
he
hastens
to
admit
he
was
in
a
hurry
in
a
terrible
hurry
but
still
i
am
not
guilty
it
is
not
i
murdered
him
he
concedes
to
us
that
he
wanted
to
murder
him
as
though
to
say
you
can
see
for
yourselves
how
truthful
i
am
so
youll
believe
all
the
sooner
that
i
didnt
murder
him
oh
in
such
cases
the
criminal
is
often
amazingly
shallow
and
credulous
at
that
point
one
of
the
lawyers
asked
him
as
it
were
incidentally
the
most
simple
question
wasnt
it
smerdyakov
killed
him
then
as
we
expected
he
was
horribly
angry
at
our
having
anticipated
him
and
caught
him
unawares
before
he
had
time
to
pave
the
way
to
choose
and
snatch
the
moment
when
it
would
be
most
natural
to
bring
in
smerdyakovs
name
he
rushed
at
once
to
the
other
extreme
as
he
always
does
and
began
to
assure
us
that
smerdyakov
could
not
have
killed
him
was
not
capable
of
it
but
dont
believe
him
that
was
only
his
cunning
he
didnt
really
give
up
the
idea
of
smerdyakov
on
the
contrary
he
meant
to
bring
him
forward
again
for
indeed
he
had
no
one
else
to
bring
forward
but
he
would
do
that
later
because
for
the
moment
that
line
was
spoiled
for
him
he
would
bring
him
forward
perhaps
next
day
or
even
a
few
days
later
choosing
an
opportunity
to
cry
out
to
us
you
know
i
was
more
skeptical
about
smerdyakov
than
you
you
remember
that
yourselves
but
now
i
am
convinced
he
killed
him
he
must
have
done
and
for
the
present
he
falls
back
upon
a
gloomy
and
irritable
denial
impatience
and
anger
prompted
him
however
to
the
most
inept
and
incredible
explanation
of
how
he
looked
into
his
fathers
window
and
how
he
respectfully
withdrew
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
was
unaware
of
the
position
of
affairs
of
the
evidence
given
by
grigory
we
proceeded
to
search
him
the
search
angered
but
encouraged
him
the
whole
three
thousand
had
not
been
found
on
him
only
half
of
it
and
no
doubt
only
at
that
moment
of
angry
silence
the
fiction
of
the
little
bag
first
occurred
to
him
no
doubt
he
was
conscious
himself
of
the
improbability
of
the
story
and
strove
painfully
to
make
it
sound
more
likely
to
weave
it
into
a
romance
that
would
sound
plausible
in
such
cases
the
first
duty
the
chief
task
of
the
investigating
lawyers
is
to
prevent
the
criminal
being
prepared
to
pounce
upon
him
unexpectedly
so
that
he
may
blurt
out
his
cherished
ideas
in
all
their
simplicity
improbability
and
inconsistency
the
criminal
can
only
be
made
to
speak
by
the
sudden
and
apparently
incidental
communication
of
some
new
fact
of
some
circumstance
of
great
importance
in
the
case
of
which
he
had
no
previous
idea
and
could
not
have
foreseen
we
had
such
a
fact
in
readinessthat
was
grigorys
evidence
about
the
open
door
through
which
the
prisoner
had
run
out
he
had
completely
forgotten
about
that
door
and
had
not
even
suspected
that
grigory
could
have
seen
it
the
effect
of
it
was
amazing
he
leapt
up
and
shouted
to
us
then
smerdyakov
murdered
him
it
was
smerdyakov
and
so
betrayed
the
basis
of
the
defense
he
was
keeping
back
and
betrayed
it
in
its
most
improbable
shape
for
smerdyakov
could
only
have
committed
the
murder
after
he
had
knocked
grigory
down
and
run
away
when
we
told
him
that
grigory
saw
the
door
was
open
before
he
fell
down
and
had
heard
smerdyakov
behind
the
screen
as
he
came
out
of
his
bedroomkaramazov
was
positively
crushed
my
esteemed
and
witty
colleague
nikolay
parfenovitch
told
me
afterwards
that
he
was
almost
moved
to
tears
at
the
sight
of
him
and
to
improve
matters
the
prisoner
hastened
to
tell
us
about
the
muchtalkedof
little
bagso
be
it
you
shall
hear
this
romance
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
have
told
you
already
why
i
consider
this
romance
not
only
an
absurdity
but
the
most
improbable
invention
that
could
have
been
brought
forward
in
the
circumstances
if
one
tried
for
a
bet
to
invent
the
most
unlikely
story
one
could
hardly
find
anything
more
incredible
the
worst
of
such
stories
is
that
the
triumphant
romancers
can
always
be
put
to
confusion
and
crushed
by
the
very
details
in
which
real
life
is
so
rich
and
which
these
unhappy
and
involuntary
storytellers
neglect
as
insignificant
trifles
oh
they
have
no
thought
to
spare
for
such
details
their
minds
are
concentrated
on
their
grand
invention
as
a
whole
and
fancy
any
one
daring
to
pull
them
up
for
a
trifle
but
thats
how
they
are
caught
the
prisoner
was
asked
the
question
where
did
you
get
the
stuff
for
your
little
bag
and
who
made
it
for
you
i
made
it
myself
and
where
did
you
get
the
linen
the
prisoner
was
positively
offended
he
thought
it
almost
insulting
to
ask
him
such
a
trivial
question
and
would
you
believe
it
his
resentment
was
genuine
but
they
are
all
like
that
i
tore
it
off
my
shirt
then
we
shall
find
that
shirt
among
your
linen
tomorrow
with
a
piece
torn
off
and
only
fancy
gentlemen
of
the
jury
if
we
really
had
found
that
torn
shirt
and
how
could
we
have
failed
to
find
it
in
his
chest
of
drawers
or
trunk
that
would
have
been
a
fact
a
material
fact
in
support
of
his
statement
but
he
was
incapable
of
that
reflection
i
dont
remember
it
may
not
have
been
off
my
shirt
i
sewed
it
up
in
one
of
my
landladys
caps
what
sort
of
a
cap
it
was
an
old
cotton
rag
of
hers
lying
about
and
do
you
remember
that
clearly
no
i
dont
and
he
was
angry
very
angry
and
yet
imagine
not
remembering
it
at
the
most
terrible
moments
of
mans
life
for
instance
when
he
is
being
led
to
execution
he
remembers
just
such
trifles
he
will
forget
anything
but
some
green
roof
that
has
flashed
past
him
on
the
road
or
a
jackdaw
on
a
crossthat
he
will
remember
he
concealed
the
making
of
that
little
bag
from
his
household
he
must
have
remembered
his
humiliating
fear
that
some
one
might
come
in
and
find
him
needle
in
hand
how
at
the
slightest
sound
he
slipped
behind
the
screen
there
is
a
screen
in
his
lodgings
but
gentlemen
of
the
jury
why
do
i
tell
you
all
this
all
these
details
trifles
cried
ippolit
kirillovitch
suddenly
just
because
the
prisoner
still
persists
in
these
absurdities
to
this
moment
he
has
not
explained
anything
since
that
fatal
night
two
months
ago
he
has
not
added
one
actual
illuminating
fact
to
his
former
fantastic
statements
all
those
are
trivialities
you
must
believe
it
on
my
honor
oh
we
are
glad
to
believe
it
we
are
eager
to
believe
it
even
if
only
on
his
word
of
honor
are
we
jackals
thirsting
for
human
blood
show
us
a
single
fact
in
the
prisoners
favor
and
we
shall
rejoice
but
let
it
be
a
substantial
real
fact
and
not
a
conclusion
drawn
from
the
prisoners
expression
by
his
own
brother
or
that
when
he
beat
himself
on
the
breast
he
must
have
meant
to
point
to
the
little
bag
in
the
darkness
too
we
shall
rejoice
at
the
new
fact
we
shall
be
the
first
to
repudiate
our
charge
we
shall
hasten
to
repudiate
it
but
now
justice
cries
out
and
we
persist
we
cannot
repudiate
anything
ippolit
kirillovitch
passed
to
his
final
peroration
he
looked
as
though
he
was
in
a
fever
he
spoke
of
the
blood
that
cried
for
vengeance
the
blood
of
the
father
murdered
by
his
son
with
the
base
motive
of
robbery
he
pointed
to
the
tragic
and
glaring
consistency
of
the
facts
and
whatever
you
may
hear
from
the
talented
and
celebrated
counsel
for
the
defense
ippolit
kirillovitch
could
not
resist
adding
whatever
eloquent
and
touching
appeals
may
be
made
to
your
sensibilities
remember
that
at
this
moment
you
are
in
a
temple
of
justice
remember
that
you
are
the
champions
of
our
justice
the
champions
of
our
holy
russia
of
her
principles
her
family
everything
that
she
holds
sacred
yes
you
represent
russia
here
at
this
moment
and
your
verdict
will
be
heard
not
in
this
hall
only
but
will
recho
throughout
the
whole
of
russia
and
all
russia
will
hear
you
as
her
champions
and
her
judges
and
she
will
be
encouraged
or
disheartened
by
your
verdict
do
not
disappoint
russia
and
her
expectations
our
fatal
troika
dashes
on
in
her
headlong
flight
perhaps
to
destruction
and
in
all
russia
for
long
past
men
have
stretched
out
imploring
hands
and
called
a
halt
to
its
furious
reckless
course
and
if
other
nations
stand
aside
from
that
troika
that
may
be
not
from
respect
as
the
poet
would
fain
believe
but
simply
from
horror
from
horror
perhaps
from
disgust
and
well
it
is
that
they
stand
aside
but
maybe
they
will
cease
one
day
to
do
so
and
will
form
a
firm
wall
confronting
the
hurrying
apparition
and
will
check
the
frenzied
rush
of
our
lawlessness
for
the
sake
of
their
own
safety
enlightenment
and
civilization
already
we
have
heard
voices
of
alarm
from
europe
they
already
begin
to
sound
do
not
tempt
them
do
not
heap
up
their
growing
hatred
by
a
sentence
justifying
the
murder
of
a
father
by
his
son
though
ippolit
kirillovitch
was
genuinely
moved
he
wound
up
his
speech
with
this
rhetorical
appealand
the
effect
produced
by
him
was
extraordinary
when
he
had
finished
his
speech
he
went
out
hurriedly
and
as
i
have
mentioned
before
almost
fainted
in
the
adjoining
room
there
was
no
applause
in
the
court
but
serious
persons
were
pleased
the
ladies
were
not
so
well
satisfied
though
even
they
were
pleased
with
his
eloquence
especially
as
they
had
no
apprehensions
as
to
the
upshot
of
the
trial
and
had
full
trust
in
fetyukovitch
he
will
speak
at
last
and
of
course
carry
all
before
him
every
one
looked
at
mitya
he
sat
silent
through
the
whole
of
the
prosecutors
speech
clenching
his
teeth
with
his
hands
clasped
and
his
head
bowed
only
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
head
and
listened
especially
when
grushenka
was
spoken
of
when
the
prosecutor
mentioned
rakitins
opinion
of
her
a
smile
of
contempt
and
anger
passed
over
his
face
and
he
murmured
rather
audibly
the
bernards
when
ippolit
kirillovitch
described
how
he
had
questioned
and
tortured
him
at
mokroe
mitya
raised
his
head
and
listened
with
intense
curiosity
at
one
point
he
seemed
about
to
jump
up
and
cry
out
but
controlled
himself
and
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
disdainfully
people
talked
afterwards
of
the
end
of
the
speech
of
the
prosecutors
feat
in
examining
the
prisoner
at
mokroe
and
jeered
at
ippolit
kirillovitch
the
man
could
not
resist
boasting
of
his
cleverness
they
said
the
court
was
adjourned
but
only
for
a
short
interval
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
at
most
there
was
a
hum
of
conversation
and
exclamations
in
the
audience
i
remember
some
of
them
a
weighty
speech
a
gentleman
in
one
group
observed
gravely
he
brought
in
too
much
psychology
said
another
voice
but
it
was
all
true
the
absolute
truth
yes
he
is
first
rate
at
it
he
summed
it
all
up
yes
he
summed
us
up
too
chimed
in
another
voice
do
you
remember
at
the
beginning
of
his
speech
making
out
we
were
all
like
fyodor
pavlovitch
and
at
the
end
too
but
that
was
all
rot
and
obscure
too
he
was
a
little
too
much
carried
away
its
unjust
its
unjust
no
it
was
smartly
done
anyway
hes
had
long
to
wait
but
hes
had
his
say
ha
ha
what
will
the
counsel
for
the
defense
say
in
another
group
i
heard
he
had
no
business
to
make
a
thrust
at
the
petersburg
man
like
that
appealing
to
your
sensibilitiesdo
you
remember
yes
that
was
awkward
of
him
he
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
he
is
a
nervous
man
we
laugh
but
what
must
the
prisoner
be
feeling
yes
what
must
it
be
for
mitya
in
a
third
group
what
lady
is
that
the
fat
one
with
the
lorgnette
sitting
at
the
end
she
is
a
generals
wife
divorced
i
know
her
thats
why
she
has
the
lorgnette
she
is
not
good
for
much
oh
no
she
is
a
piquante
little
woman
two
places
beyond
her
there
is
a
little
fair
woman
she
is
prettier
they
caught
him
smartly
at
mokroe
didnt
they
eh
oh
it
was
smart
enough
weve
heard
it
before
how
often
he
has
told
the
story
at
peoples
houses
and
he
couldnt
resist
doing
it
now
thats
vanity
he
is
a
man
with
a
grievance
he
he
yes
and
quick
to
take
offense
and
there
was
too
much
rhetoric
such
long
sentences
yes
he
tries
to
alarm
us
he
kept
trying
to
alarm
us
do
you
remember
about
the
troika
something
about
they
have
hamlets
but
we
have
so
far
only
karamazovs
that
was
cleverly
said
that
was
to
propitiate
the
liberals
he
is
afraid
of
them
yes
and
he
is
afraid
of
the
lawyer
too
yes
what
will
fetyukovitch
say
whatever
he
says
he
wont
get
round
our
peasants
dont
you
think
so
a
fourth
group
what
he
said
about
the
troika
was
good
that
piece
about
the
other
nations
and
that
was
true
what
he
said
about
other
nations
not
standing
it
what
do
you
mean
why
in
the
english
parliament
a
member
got
up
last
week
and
speaking
about
the
nihilists
asked
the
ministry
whether
it
was
not
high
time
to
intervene
to
educate
this
barbarous
people
ippolit
was
thinking
of
him
i
know
he
was
he
was
talking
about
that
last
week
not
an
easy
job
not
an
easy
job
why
not
why
wed
shut
up
kronstadt
and
not
let
them
have
any
corn
where
would
they
get
it
in
america
they
get
it
from
america
now
nonsense
but
the
bell
rang
all
rushed
to
their
places
fetyukovitch
mounted
the
tribune
chapter
x
the
speech
for
the
defense
an
argument
that
cuts
both
ways
all
was
hushed
as
the
first
words
of
the
famous
orator
rang
out
the
eyes
of
the
audience
were
fastened
upon
him
he
began
very
simply
and
directly
with
an
air
of
conviction
but
not
the
slightest
trace
of
conceit
he
made
no
attempt
at
eloquence
at
pathos
or
emotional
phrases
he
was
like
a
man
speaking
in
a
circle
of
intimate
and
sympathetic
friends
his
voice
was
a
fine
one
sonorous
and
sympathetic
and
there
was
something
genuine
and
simple
in
the
very
sound
of
it
but
every
one
realized
at
once
that
the
speaker
might
suddenly
rise
to
genuine
pathos
and
pierce
the
heart
with
untold
power
his
language
was
perhaps
more
irregular
than
ippolit
kirillovitchs
but
he
spoke
without
long
phrases
and
indeed
with
more
precision
one
thing
did
not
please
the
ladies
he
kept
bending
forward
especially
at
the
beginning
of
his
speech
not
exactly
bowing
but
as
though
he
were
about
to
dart
at
his
listeners
bending
his
long
spine
in
half
as
though
there
were
a
spring
in
the
middle
that
enabled
him
to
bend
almost
at
right
angles
at
the
beginning
of
his
speech
he
spoke
rather
disconnectedly
without
system
one
may
say
dealing
with
facts
separately
though
at
the
end
these
facts
formed
a
whole
his
speech
might
be
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
consisting
of
criticism
in
refutation
of
the
charge
sometimes
malicious
and
sarcastic
but
in
the
second
half
he
suddenly
changed
his
tone
and
even
his
manner
and
at
once
rose
to
pathos
the
audience
seemed
on
the
lookout
for
it
and
quivered
with
enthusiasm
he
went
straight
to
the
point
and
began
by
saying
that
although
he
practiced
in
petersburg
he
had
more
than
once
visited
provincial
towns
to
defend
prisoners
of
whose
innocence
he
had
a
conviction
or
at
least
a
preconceived
idea
that
is
what
has
happened
to
me
in
the
present
case
he
explained
from
the
very
first
accounts
in
the
newspapers
i
was
struck
by
something
which
strongly
prepossessed
me
in
the
prisoners
favor
what
interested
me
most
was
a
fact
which
often
occurs
in
legal
practice
but
rarely
i
think
in
such
an
extreme
and
peculiar
form
as
in
the
present
case
i
ought
to
formulate
that
peculiarity
only
at
the
end
of
my
speech
but
i
will
do
so
at
the
very
beginning
for
it
is
my
weakness
to
go
to
work
directly
not
keeping
my
effects
in
reserve
and
economizing
my
material
that
may
be
imprudent
on
my
part
but
at
least
its
sincere
what
i
have
in
my
mind
is
this
there
is
an
overwhelming
chain
of
evidence
against
the
prisoner
and
at
the
same
time
not
one
fact
that
will
stand
criticism
if
it
is
examined
separately
as
i
followed
the
case
more
closely
in
the
papers
my
idea
was
more
and
more
confirmed
and
i
suddenly
received
from
the
prisoners
relatives
a
request
to
undertake
his
defense
i
at
once
hurried
here
and
here
i
became
completely
convinced
it
was
to
break
down
this
terrible
chain
of
facts
and
to
show
that
each
piece
of
evidence
taken
separately
was
unproved
and
fantastic
that
i
undertook
the
case
so
fetyukovitch
began
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
suddenly
protested
i
am
new
to
this
district
i
have
no
preconceived
ideas
the
prisoner
a
man
of
turbulent
and
unbridled
temper
has
not
insulted
me
but
he
has
insulted
perhaps
hundreds
of
persons
in
this
town
and
so
prejudiced
many
people
against
him
beforehand
of
course
i
recognize
that
the
moral
sentiment
of
local
society
is
justly
excited
against
him
the
prisoner
is
of
turbulent
and
violent
temper
yet
he
was
received
in
society
here
he
was
even
welcome
in
the
family
of
my
talented
friend
the
prosecutor
nb
at
these
words
there
were
two
or
three
laughs
in
the
audience
quickly
suppressed
but
noticed
by
all
all
of
us
knew
that
the
prosecutor
received
mitya
against
his
will
solely
because
he
had
somehow
interested
his
wifea
lady
of
the
highest
virtue
and
moral
worth
but
fanciful
capricious
and
fond
of
opposing
her
husband
especially
in
trifles
mityas
visits
however
had
not
been
frequent
nevertheless
i
venture
to
suggest
fetyukovitch
continued
that
in
spite
of
his
independent
mind
and
just
character
my
opponent
may
have
formed
a
mistaken
prejudice
against
my
unfortunate
client
oh
that
is
so
natural
the
unfortunate
man
has
only
too
well
deserved
such
prejudice
outraged
morality
and
still
more
outraged
taste
is
often
relentless
we
have
in
the
talented
prosecutors
speech
heard
a
stern
analysis
of
the
prisoners
character
and
conduct
and
his
severe
critical
attitude
to
the
case
was
evident
and
whats
more
he
went
into
psychological
subtleties
into
which
he
could
not
have
entered
if
he
had
the
least
conscious
and
malicious
prejudice
against
the
prisoner
but
there
are
things
which
are
even
worse
even
more
fatal
in
such
cases
than
the
most
malicious
and
consciously
unfair
attitude
it
is
worse
if
we
are
carried
away
by
the
artistic
instinct
by
the
desire
to
create
so
to
speak
a
romance
especially
if
god
has
endowed
us
with
psychological
insight
before
i
started
on
my
way
here
i
was
warned
in
petersburg
and
was
myself
aware
that
i
should
find
here
a
talented
opponent
whose
psychological
insight
and
subtlety
had
gained
him
peculiar
renown
in
legal
circles
of
recent
years
but
profound
as
psychology
is
its
a
knife
that
cuts
both
ways
laughter
among
the
public
you
will
of
course
forgive
me
my
comparison
i
cant
boast
of
eloquence
but
i
will
take
as
an
example
any
point
in
the
prosecutors
speech
the
prisoner
running
away
in
the
garden
in
the
dark
climbed
over
the
fence
was
seized
by
the
servant
and
knocked
him
down
with
a
brass
pestle
then
he
jumped
back
into
the
garden
and
spent
five
minutes
over
the
man
trying
to
discover
whether
he
had
killed
him
or
not
and
the
prosecutor
refuses
to
believe
the
prisoners
statement
that
he
ran
to
old
grigory
out
of
pity
no
he
says
such
sensibility
is
impossible
at
such
a
moment
thats
unnatural
he
ran
to
find
out
whether
the
only
witness
of
his
crime
was
dead
or
alive
and
so
showed
that
he
had
committed
the
murder
since
he
would
not
have
run
back
for
any
other
reason
here
you
have
psychology
but
let
us
take
the
same
method
and
apply
it
to
the
case
the
other
way
round
and
our
result
will
be
no
less
probable
the
murderer
we
are
told
leapt
down
to
find
out
as
a
precaution
whether
the
witness
was
alive
or
not
yet
he
had
left
in
his
murdered
fathers
study
as
the
prosecutor
himself
argues
an
amazing
piece
of
evidence
in
the
shape
of
a
torn
envelope
with
an
inscription
that
there
had
been
three
thousand
roubles
in
it
if
he
had
carried
that
envelope
away
with
him
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
known
of
that
envelope
and
of
the
notes
in
it
and
that
the
money
had
been
stolen
by
the
prisoner
those
are
the
prosecutors
own
words
so
on
one
side
you
see
a
complete
absence
of
precaution
a
man
who
has
lost
his
head
and
run
away
in
a
fright
leaving
that
clew
on
the
floor
and
two
minutes
later
when
he
has
killed
another
man
we
are
entitled
to
assume
the
most
heartless
and
calculating
foresight
in
him
but
even
admitting
this
was
so
it
is
psychological
subtlety
i
suppose
that
discerns
that
under
certain
circumstances
i
become
as
bloodthirsty
and
keensighted
as
a
caucasian
eagle
while
at
the
next
i
am
as
timid
and
blind
as
a
mole
but
if
i
am
so
bloodthirsty
and
cruelly
calculating
that
when
i
kill
a
man
i
only
run
back
to
find
out
whether
he
is
alive
to
witness
against
me
why
should
i
spend
five
minutes
looking
after
my
victim
at
the
risk
of
encountering
other
witnesses
why
soak
my
handkerchief
wiping
the
blood
off
his
head
so
that
it
may
be
evidence
against
me
later
if
he
were
so
coldhearted
and
calculating
why
not
hit
the
servant
on
the
head
again
and
again
with
the
same
pestle
so
as
to
kill
him
outright
and
relieve
himself
of
all
anxiety
about
the
witness
again
though
he
ran
to
see
whether
the
witness
was
alive
he
left
another
witness
on
the
path
that
brass
pestle
which
he
had
taken
from
the
two
women
and
which
they
could
always
recognize
afterwards
as
theirs
and
prove
that
he
had
taken
it
from
them
and
it
is
not
as
though
he
had
forgotten
it
on
the
path
dropped
it
through
carelessness
or
haste
no
he
had
flung
away
his
weapon
for
it
was
found
fifteen
paces
from
where
grigory
lay
why
did
he
do
so
just
because
he
was
grieved
at
having
killed
a
man
an
old
servant
and
he
flung
away
the
pestle
with
a
curse
as
a
murderous
weapon
thats
how
it
must
have
been
what
other
reason
could
he
have
had
for
throwing
it
so
far
and
if
he
was
capable
of
feeling
grief
and
pity
at
having
killed
a
man
it
shows
that
he
was
innocent
of
his
fathers
murder
had
he
murdered
him
he
would
never
have
run
to
another
victim
out
of
pity
then
he
would
have
felt
differently
his
thoughts
would
have
been
centered
on
selfpreservation
he
would
have
had
none
to
spare
for
pity
that
is
beyond
doubt
on
the
contrary
he
would
have
broken
his
skull
instead
of
spending
five
minutes
looking
after
him
there
was
room
for
pity
and
goodfeeling
just
because
his
conscience
had
been
clear
till
then
here
we
have
a
different
psychology
i
have
purposely
resorted
to
this
method
gentlemen
of
the
jury
to
show
that
you
can
prove
anything
by
it
it
all
depends
on
who
makes
use
of
it
psychology
lures
even
most
serious
people
into
romancing
and
quite
unconsciously
i
am
speaking
of
the
abuse
of
psychology
gentlemen
sounds
of
approval
and
laughter
at
the
expense
of
the
prosecutor
were
again
audible
in
the
court
i
will
not
repeat
the
speech
in
detail
i
will
only
quote
some
passages
from
it
some
leading
points
chapter
xi
there
was
no
money
there
was
no
robbery
there
was
one
point
that
struck
every
one
in
fetyukovitchs
speech
he
flatly
denied
the
existence
of
the
fatal
three
thousand
roubles
and
consequently
the
possibility
of
their
having
been
stolen
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
began
every
new
and
unprejudiced
observer
must
be
struck
by
a
characteristic
peculiarity
in
the
present
case
namely
the
charge
of
robbery
and
the
complete
impossibility
of
proving
that
there
was
anything
to
be
stolen
we
are
told
that
money
was
stolenthree
thousand
roublesbut
whether
those
roubles
ever
existed
nobody
knows
consider
how
have
we
heard
of
that
sum
and
who
has
seen
the
notes
the
only
person
who
saw
them
and
stated
that
they
had
been
put
in
the
envelope
was
the
servant
smerdyakov
he
had
spoken
of
it
to
the
prisoner
and
his
brother
ivan
fyodorovitch
before
the
catastrophe
madame
svyetlov
too
had
been
told
of
it
but
not
one
of
these
three
persons
had
actually
seen
the
notes
no
one
but
smerdyakov
had
seen
them
here
the
question
arises
if
its
true
that
they
did
exist
and
that
smerdyakov
had
seen
them
when
did
he
see
them
for
the
last
time
what
if
his
master
had
taken
the
notes
from
under
his
bed
and
put
them
back
in
his
cashbox
without
telling
him
note
that
according
to
smerdyakovs
story
the
notes
were
kept
under
the
mattress
the
prisoner
must
have
pulled
them
out
and
yet
the
bed
was
absolutely
unrumpled
that
is
carefully
recorded
in
the
protocol
how
could
the
prisoner
have
found
the
notes
without
disturbing
the
bed
how
could
he
have
helped
soiling
with
his
blood
stained
hands
the
fine
and
spotless
linen
with
which
the
bed
had
been
purposely
made
but
i
shall
be
asked
what
about
the
envelope
on
the
floor
yes
its
worth
saying
a
word
or
two
about
that
envelope
i
was
somewhat
surprised
just
now
to
hear
the
highly
talented
prosecutor
declare
of
himselfof
himself
observethat
but
for
that
envelope
but
for
its
being
left
on
the
floor
no
one
in
the
world
would
have
known
of
the
existence
of
that
envelope
and
the
notes
in
it
and
therefore
of
the
prisoners
having
stolen
it
and
so
that
torn
scrap
of
paper
is
by
the
prosecutors
own
admission
the
sole
proof
on
which
the
charge
of
robbery
rests
otherwise
no
one
would
have
known
of
the
robbery
nor
perhaps
even
of
the
money
but
is
the
mere
fact
that
that
scrap
of
paper
was
lying
on
the
floor
a
proof
that
there
was
money
in
it
and
that
that
money
had
been
stolen
yet
it
will
be
objected
smerdyakov
had
seen
the
money
in
the
envelope
but
when
when
had
he
seen
it
for
the
last
time
i
ask
you
that
i
talked
to
smerdyakov
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
seen
the
notes
two
days
before
the
catastrophe
then
why
not
imagine
that
old
fyodor
pavlovitch
locked
up
alone
in
impatient
and
hysterical
expectation
of
the
object
of
his
adoration
may
have
whiled
away
the
time
by
breaking
open
the
envelope
and
taking
out
the
notes
whats
the
use
of
the
envelope
he
may
have
asked
himself
she
wont
believe
the
notes
are
there
but
when
i
show
her
the
thirty
rainbowcolored
notes
in
one
roll
it
will
make
more
impression
you
may
be
sure
it
will
make
her
mouth
water
and
so
he
tears
open
the
envelope
takes
out
the
money
and
flings
the
envelope
on
the
floor
conscious
of
being
the
owner
and
untroubled
by
any
fears
of
leaving
evidence
listen
gentlemen
could
anything
be
more
likely
than
this
theory
and
such
an
action
why
is
it
out
of
the
question
but
if
anything
of
the
sort
could
have
taken
place
the
charge
of
robbery
falls
to
the
ground
if
there
was
no
money
there
was
no
theft
of
it
if
the
envelope
on
the
floor
may
be
taken
as
evidence
that
there
had
been
money
in
it
why
may
i
not
maintain
the
opposite
that
the
envelope
was
on
the
floor
because
the
money
had
been
taken
from
it
by
its
owner
but
i
shall
be
asked
what
became
of
the
money
if
fyodor
pavlovitch
took
it
out
of
the
envelope
since
it
was
not
found
when
the
police
searched
the
house
in
the
first
place
part
of
the
money
was
found
in
the
cashbox
and
secondly
he
might
have
taken
it
out
that
morning
or
the
evening
before
to
make
some
other
use
of
it
to
give
or
send
it
away
he
may
have
changed
his
idea
his
plan
of
action
completely
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
announce
the
fact
to
smerdyakov
beforehand
and
if
there
is
the
barest
possibility
of
such
an
explanation
how
can
the
prisoner
be
so
positively
accused
of
having
committed
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
and
of
having
actually
carried
out
that
robbery
this
is
encroaching
on
the
domain
of
romance
if
it
is
maintained
that
something
has
been
stolen
the
thing
must
be
produced
or
at
least
its
existence
must
be
proved
beyond
doubt
yet
no
one
had
ever
seen
these
notes
not
long
ago
in
petersburg
a
young
man
of
eighteen
hardly
more
than
a
boy
who
carried
on
a
small
business
as
a
costermonger
went
in
broad
daylight
into
a
moneychangers
shop
with
an
ax
and
with
extraordinary
typical
audacity
killed
the
master
of
the
shop
and
carried
off
fifteen
hundred
roubles
five
hours
later
he
was
arrested
and
except
fifteen
roubles
he
had
already
managed
to
spend
the
whole
sum
was
found
on
him
moreover
the
shopman
on
his
return
to
the
shop
after
the
murder
informed
the
police
not
only
of
the
exact
sum
stolen
but
even
of
the
notes
and
gold
coins
of
which
that
sum
was
made
up
and
those
very
notes
and
coins
were
found
on
the
criminal
this
was
followed
by
a
full
and
genuine
confession
on
the
part
of
the
murderer
thats
what
i
call
evidence
gentlemen
of
the
jury
in
that
case
i
know
i
see
i
touch
the
money
and
cannot
deny
its
existence
is
it
the
same
in
the
present
case
and
yet
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
yes
i
shall
be
told
but
he
was
carousing
that
night
squandering
money
he
was
shown
to
have
had
fifteen
hundred
roubleswhere
did
he
get
the
money
but
the
very
fact
that
only
fifteen
hundred
could
be
found
and
the
other
half
of
the
sum
could
nowhere
be
discovered
shows
that
that
money
was
not
the
same
and
had
never
been
in
any
envelope
by
strict
calculation
of
time
it
was
proved
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
that
the
prisoner
ran
straight
from
those
women
servants
to
perhotins
without
going
home
and
that
he
had
been
nowhere
so
he
had
been
all
the
time
in
company
and
therefore
could
not
have
divided
the
three
thousand
in
half
and
hidden
half
in
the
town
its
just
this
consideration
that
has
led
the
prosecutor
to
assume
that
the
money
is
hidden
in
some
crevice
at
mokroe
why
not
in
the
dungeons
of
the
castle
of
udolpho
gentlemen
isnt
this
supposition
really
too
fantastic
and
too
romantic
and
observe
if
that
supposition
breaks
down
the
whole
charge
of
robbery
is
scattered
to
the
winds
for
in
that
case
what
could
have
become
of
the
other
fifteen
hundred
roubles
by
what
miracle
could
they
have
disappeared
since
its
proved
the
prisoner
went
nowhere
else
and
we
are
ready
to
ruin
a
mans
life
with
such
tales
i
shall
be
told
that
he
could
not
explain
where
he
got
the
fifteen
hundred
that
he
had
and
every
one
knew
that
he
was
without
money
before
that
night
who
knew
it
pray
the
prisoner
has
made
a
clear
and
unflinching
statement
of
the
source
of
that
money
and
if
you
will
have
it
so
gentlemen
of
the
jury
nothing
can
be
more
probable
than
that
statement
and
more
consistent
with
the
temper
and
spirit
of
the
prisoner
the
prosecutor
is
charmed
with
his
own
romance
a
man
of
weak
will
who
had
brought
himself
to
take
the
three
thousand
so
insultingly
offered
by
his
betrothed
could
not
we
are
told
have
set
aside
half
and
sewn
it
up
but
would
even
if
he
had
done
so
have
unpicked
it
every
two
days
and
taken
out
a
hundred
and
so
would
have
spent
it
all
in
a
month
all
this
you
will
remember
was
put
forward
in
a
tone
that
brooked
no
contradiction
but
what
if
the
thing
happened
quite
differently
what
if
youve
been
weaving
a
romance
and
about
quite
a
different
kind
of
man
thats
just
it
you
have
invented
quite
a
different
man
i
shall
be
told
perhaps
there
are
witnesses
that
he
spent
on
one
day
all
that
three
thousand
given
him
by
his
betrothed
a
month
before
the
catastrophe
so
he
could
not
have
divided
the
sum
in
half
but
who
are
these
witnesses
the
value
of
their
evidence
has
been
shown
in
court
already
besides
in
another
mans
hand
a
crust
always
seems
larger
and
no
one
of
these
witnesses
counted
that
money
they
all
judged
simply
at
sight
and
the
witness
maximov
has
testified
that
the
prisoner
had
twenty
thousand
in
his
hand
you
see
gentlemen
of
the
jury
psychology
is
a
two
edged
weapon
let
me
turn
the
other
edge
now
and
see
what
comes
of
it
a
month
before
the
catastrophe
the
prisoner
was
entrusted
by
katerina
ivanovna
with
three
thousand
roubles
to
send
off
by
post
but
the
question
is
is
it
true
that
they
were
entrusted
to
him
in
such
an
insulting
and
degrading
way
as
was
proclaimed
just
now
the
first
statement
made
by
the
young
lady
on
the
subject
was
different
perfectly
different
in
the
second
statement
we
heard
only
cries
of
resentment
and
revenge
cries
of
longconcealed
hatred
and
the
very
fact
that
the
witness
gave
her
first
evidence
incorrectly
gives
us
a
right
to
conclude
that
her
second
piece
of
evidence
may
have
been
incorrect
also
the
prosecutor
will
not
dare
not
his
own
words
touch
on
that
story
so
be
it
i
will
not
touch
on
it
either
but
will
only
venture
to
observe
that
if
a
lofty
and
high
principled
person
such
as
that
highly
respected
young
lady
unquestionably
is
if
such
a
person
i
say
allows
herself
suddenly
in
court
to
contradict
her
first
statement
with
the
obvious
motive
of
ruining
the
prisoner
it
is
clear
that
this
evidence
has
been
given
not
impartially
not
coolly
have
not
we
the
right
to
assume
that
a
revengeful
woman
might
have
exaggerated
much
yes
she
may
well
have
exaggerated
in
particular
the
insult
and
humiliation
of
her
offering
him
the
money
no
it
was
offered
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
possible
to
take
it
especially
for
a
man
so
easygoing
as
the
prisoner
above
all
as
he
expected
to
receive
shortly
from
his
father
the
three
thousand
roubles
that
he
reckoned
was
owing
to
him
it
was
unreflecting
of
him
but
it
was
just
his
irresponsible
want
of
reflection
that
made
him
so
confident
that
his
father
would
give
him
the
money
that
he
would
get
it
and
so
could
always
dispatch
the
money
entrusted
to
him
and
repay
the
debt
but
the
prosecutor
refuses
to
allow
that
he
could
the
same
day
have
set
aside
half
the
money
and
sewn
it
up
in
a
little
bag
thats
not
his
character
he
tells
us
he
couldnt
have
had
such
feelings
but
yet
he
talked
himself
of
the
broad
karamazov
nature
he
cried
out
about
the
two
extremes
which
a
karamazov
can
contemplate
at
once
karamazov
is
just
such
a
twosided
nature
fluctuating
between
two
extremes
that
even
when
moved
by
the
most
violent
craving
for
riotous
gayety
he
can
pull
himself
up
if
something
strikes
him
on
the
other
side
and
on
the
other
side
is
lovethat
new
love
which
had
flamed
up
in
his
heart
and
for
that
love
he
needed
money
oh
far
more
than
for
carousing
with
his
mistress
if
she
were
to
say
to
him
i
am
yours
i
wont
have
fyodor
pavlovitch
then
he
must
have
money
to
take
her
away
that
was
more
important
than
carousing
could
a
karamazov
fail
to
understand
it
that
anxiety
was
just
what
he
was
suffering
fromwhat
is
there
improbable
in
his
laying
aside
that
money
and
concealing
it
in
case
of
emergency
but
time
passed
and
fyodor
pavlovitch
did
not
give
the
prisoner
the
expected
three
thousand
on
the
contrary
the
latter
heard
that
he
meant
to
use
this
sum
to
seduce
the
woman
he
the
prisoner
loved
if
fyodor
pavlovitch
doesnt
give
the
money
he
thought
i
shall
be
put
in
the
position
of
a
thief
before
katerina
ivanovna
and
then
the
idea
presented
itself
to
him
that
he
would
go
to
katerina
ivanovna
lay
before
her
the
fifteen
hundred
roubles
he
still
carried
round
his
neck
and
say
i
am
a
scoundrel
but
not
a
thief
so
here
we
have
already
a
twofold
reason
why
he
should
guard
that
sum
of
money
as
the
apple
of
his
eye
why
he
shouldnt
unpick
the
little
bag
and
spend
it
a
hundred
at
a
time
why
should
you
deny
the
prisoner
a
sense
of
honor
yes
he
has
a
sense
of
honor
granted
that
its
misplaced
granted
its
often
mistaken
yet
it
exists
and
amounts
to
a
passion
and
he
has
proved
that
but
now
the
affair
becomes
even
more
complex
his
jealous
torments
reach
a
climax
and
those
same
two
questions
torture
his
fevered
brain
more
and
more
if
i
repay
katerina
ivanovna
where
can
i
find
the
means
to
go
off
with
grushenka
if
he
behaved
wildly
drank
and
made
disturbances
in
the
taverns
in
the
course
of
that
month
it
was
perhaps
because
he
was
wretched
and
strained
beyond
his
powers
of
endurance
these
two
questions
became
so
acute
that
they
drove
him
at
last
to
despair
he
sent
his
younger
brother
to
beg
for
the
last
time
for
the
three
thousand
roubles
but
without
waiting
for
a
reply
burst
in
himself
and
ended
by
beating
the
old
man
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
after
that
he
had
no
prospect
of
getting
it
from
any
one
his
father
would
not
give
it
him
after
that
beating
the
same
evening
he
struck
himself
on
the
breast
just
on
the
upper
part
of
the
breast
where
the
little
bag
was
and
swore
to
his
brother
that
he
had
the
means
of
not
being
a
scoundrel
but
that
still
he
would
remain
a
scoundrel
for
he
foresaw
that
he
would
not
use
that
means
that
he
wouldnt
have
the
character
that
he
wouldnt
have
the
willpower
to
do
it
why
why
does
the
prosecutor
refuse
to
believe
the
evidence
of
alexey
karamazov
given
so
genuinely
and
sincerely
so
spontaneously
and
convincingly
and
why
on
the
contrary
does
he
force
me
to
believe
in
money
hidden
in
a
crevice
in
the
dungeons
of
the
castle
of
udolpho
the
same
evening
after
his
talk
with
his
brother
the
prisoner
wrote
that
fatal
letter
and
that
letter
is
the
chief
the
most
stupendous
proof
of
the
prisoner
having
committed
robbery
i
shall
beg
from
every
one
and
if
i
dont
get
it
i
shall
murder
my
father
and
shall
take
the
envelope
with
the
pink
ribbon
on
it
from
under
his
mattress
as
soon
as
ivan
has
gone
a
full
program
of
the
murder
we
are
told
so
it
must
have
been
he
it
has
all
been
done
as
he
wrote
cries
the
prosecutor
but
in
the
first
place
its
the
letter
of
a
drunken
man
and
written
in
great
irritation
secondly
he
writes
of
the
envelope
from
what
he
has
heard
from
smerdyakov
again
for
he
has
not
seen
the
envelope
himself
and
thirdly
he
wrote
it
indeed
but
how
can
you
prove
that
he
did
it
did
the
prisoner
take
the
envelope
from
under
the
pillow
did
he
find
the
money
did
that
money
exist
indeed
and
was
it
to
get
money
that
the
prisoner
ran
off
if
you
remember
he
ran
off
posthaste
not
to
steal
but
to
find
out
where
she
was
the
woman
who
had
crushed
him
he
was
not
running
to
carry
out
a
program
to
carry
out
what
he
had
written
that
is
not
for
an
act
of
premeditated
robbery
but
he
ran
suddenly
spontaneously
in
a
jealous
fury
yes
i
shall
be
told
but
when
he
got
there
and
murdered
him
he
seized
the
money
too
but
did
he
murder
him
after
all
the
charge
of
robbery
i
repudiate
with
indignation
a
man
cannot
be
accused
of
robbery
if
its
impossible
to
state
accurately
what
he
has
stolen
thats
an
axiom
but
did
he
murder
him
without
robbery
did
he
murder
him
at
all
is
that
proved
isnt
that
too
a
romance
chapter
xii
and
there
was
no
murder
either
allow
me
gentlemen
of
the
jury
to
remind
you
that
a
mans
life
is
at
stake
and
that
you
must
be
careful
we
have
heard
the
prosecutor
himself
admit
that
until
today
he
hesitated
to
accuse
the
prisoner
of
a
full
and
conscious
premeditation
of
the
crime
he
hesitated
till
he
saw
that
fatal
drunken
letter
which
was
produced
in
court
today
all
was
done
as
written
but
i
repeat
again
he
was
running
to
her
to
seek
her
solely
to
find
out
where
she
was
thats
a
fact
that
cant
be
disputed
had
she
been
at
home
he
would
not
have
run
away
but
would
have
remained
at
her
side
and
so
would
not
have
done
what
he
promised
in
the
letter
he
ran
unexpectedly
and
accidentally
and
by
that
time
very
likely
he
did
not
even
remember
his
drunken
letter
he
snatched
up
the
pestle
they
say
and
you
will
remember
how
a
whole
edifice
of
psychology
was
built
on
that
pestlewhy
he
was
bound
to
look
at
that
pestle
as
a
weapon
to
snatch
it
up
and
so
on
and
so
on
a
very
commonplace
idea
occurs
to
me
at
this
point
what
if
that
pestle
had
not
been
in
sight
had
not
been
lying
on
the
shelf
from
which
it
was
snatched
by
the
prisoner
but
had
been
put
away
in
a
cupboard
it
would
not
have
caught
the
prisoners
eye
and
he
would
have
run
away
without
a
weapon
with
empty
hands
and
then
he
would
certainly
not
have
killed
any
one
how
then
can
i
look
upon
the
pestle
as
a
proof
of
premeditation
yes
but
he
talked
in
the
taverns
of
murdering
his
father
and
two
days
before
on
the
evening
when
he
wrote
his
drunken
letter
he
was
quiet
and
only
quarreled
with
a
shopman
in
the
tavern
because
a
karamazov
could
not
help
quarreling
forsooth
but
my
answer
to
that
is
that
if
he
was
planning
such
a
murder
in
accordance
with
his
letter
he
certainly
would
not
have
quarreled
even
with
a
shopman
and
probably
would
not
have
gone
into
the
tavern
at
all
because
a
person
plotting
such
a
crime
seeks
quiet
and
retirement
seeks
to
efface
himself
to
avoid
being
seen
and
heard
and
that
not
from
calculation
but
from
instinct
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
psychological
method
is
a
twoedged
weapon
and
we
too
can
use
it
as
for
all
this
shouting
in
taverns
throughout
the
month
dont
we
often
hear
children
or
drunkards
coming
out
of
taverns
shout
ill
kill
you
but
they
dont
murder
any
one
and
that
fatal
letterisnt
that
simply
drunken
irritability
too
isnt
that
simply
the
shout
of
the
brawler
outside
the
tavern
ill
kill
you
ill
kill
the
lot
of
you
why
not
why
could
it
not
be
that
what
reason
have
we
to
call
that
letter
fatal
rather
than
absurd
because
his
father
has
been
found
murdered
because
a
witness
saw
the
prisoner
running
out
of
the
garden
with
a
weapon
in
his
hand
and
was
knocked
down
by
him
therefore
we
are
told
everything
was
done
as
he
had
planned
in
writing
and
the
letter
was
not
absurd
but
fatal
now
thank
god
weve
come
to
the
real
point
since
he
was
in
the
garden
he
must
have
murdered
him
in
those
few
words
since
he
was
then
he
must
lies
the
whole
case
for
the
prosecution
he
was
there
so
he
must
have
and
what
if
there
is
no
must
about
it
even
if
he
was
there
oh
i
admit
that
the
chain
of
evidencethe
coincidencesare
really
suggestive
but
examine
all
these
facts
separately
regardless
of
their
connection
why
for
instance
does
the
prosecution
refuse
to
admit
the
truth
of
the
prisoners
statement
that
he
ran
away
from
his
fathers
window
remember
the
sarcasms
in
which
the
prosecutor
indulged
at
the
expense
of
the
respectful
and
pious
sentiments
which
suddenly
came
over
the
murderer
but
what
if
there
were
something
of
the
sort
a
feeling
of
religious
awe
if
not
of
filial
respect
my
mother
must
have
been
praying
for
me
at
that
moment
were
the
prisoners
words
at
the
preliminary
inquiry
and
so
he
ran
away
as
soon
as
he
convinced
himself
that
madame
svyetlov
was
not
in
his
fathers
house
but
he
could
not
convince
himself
by
looking
through
the
window
the
prosecutor
objects
but
why
couldnt
he
why
the
window
opened
at
the
signals
given
by
the
prisoner
some
word
might
have
been
uttered
by
fyodor
pavlovitch
some
exclamation
which
showed
the
prisoner
that
she
was
not
there
why
should
we
assume
everything
as
we
imagine
it
as
we
make
up
our
minds
to
imagine
it
a
thousand
things
may
happen
in
reality
which
elude
the
subtlest
imagination

yes
but
grigory
saw
the
door
open
and
so
the
prisoner
certainly
was
in
the
house
therefore
he
killed
him
now
about
that
door
gentlemen
of
the
jury
observe
that
we
have
only
the
statement
of
one
witness
as
to
that
door
and
he
was
at
the
time
in
such
a
condition
that
but
supposing
the
door
was
open
supposing
the
prisoner
has
lied
in
denying
it
from
an
instinct
of
selfdefense
natural
in
his
position
supposing
he
did
go
into
the
housewell
what
then
how
does
it
follow
that
because
he
was
there
he
committed
the
murder
he
might
have
dashed
in
run
through
the
rooms
might
have
pushed
his
father
away
might
have
struck
him
but
as
soon
as
he
had
made
sure
madame
svyetlov
was
not
there
he
may
have
run
away
rejoicing
that
she
was
not
there
and
that
he
had
not
killed
his
father
and
it
was
perhaps
just
because
he
had
escaped
from
the
temptation
to
kill
his
father
because
he
had
a
clear
conscience
and
was
rejoicing
at
not
having
killed
him
that
he
was
capable
of
a
pure
feeling
the
feeling
of
pity
and
compassion
and
leapt
off
the
fence
a
minute
later
to
the
assistance
of
grigory
after
he
had
in
his
excitement
knocked
him
down
with
terrible
eloquence
the
prosecutor
has
described
to
us
the
dreadful
state
of
the
prisoners
mind
at
mokroe
when
love
again
lay
before
him
calling
him
to
new
life
while
love
was
impossible
for
him
because
he
had
his
fathers
bloodstained
corpse
behind
him
and
beyond
that
corpseretribution
and
yet
the
prosecutor
allowed
him
love
which
he
explained
according
to
his
method
talking
about
his
drunken
condition
about
a
criminal
being
taken
to
execution
about
it
being
still
far
off
and
so
on
and
so
on
but
again
i
ask
mr
prosecutor
have
you
not
invented
a
new
personality
is
the
prisoner
so
coarse
and
heartless
as
to
be
able
to
think
at
that
moment
of
love
and
of
dodges
to
escape
punishment
if
his
hands
were
really
stained
with
his
fathers
blood
no
no
no
as
soon
as
it
was
made
plain
to
him
that
she
loved
him
and
called
him
to
her
side
promising
him
new
happiness
oh
then
i
protest
he
must
have
felt
the
impulse
to
suicide
doubled
trebled
and
must
have
killed
himself
if
he
had
his
fathers
murder
on
his
conscience
oh
no
he
would
not
have
forgotten
where
his
pistols
lay
i
know
the
prisoner
the
savage
stony
heartlessness
ascribed
to
him
by
the
prosecutor
is
inconsistent
with
his
character
he
would
have
killed
himself
thats
certain
he
did
not
kill
himself
just
because
his
mothers
prayers
had
saved
him
and
he
was
innocent
of
his
fathers
blood
he
was
troubled
he
was
grieving
that
night
at
mokroe
only
about
old
grigory
and
praying
to
god
that
the
old
man
would
recover
that
his
blow
had
not
been
fatal
and
that
he
would
not
have
to
suffer
for
it
why
not
accept
such
an
interpretation
of
the
facts
what
trustworthy
proof
have
we
that
the
prisoner
is
lying
but
we
shall
be
told
at
once
again
there
is
his
fathers
corpse
if
he
ran
away
without
murdering
him
who
did
murder
him
here
i
repeat
you
have
the
whole
logic
of
the
prosecution
who
murdered
him
if
not
he
theres
no
one
to
put
in
his
place
gentlemen
of
the
jury
is
that
really
so
is
it
positively
actually
true
that
there
is
no
one
else
at
all
weve
heard
the
prosecutor
count
on
his
fingers
all
the
persons
who
were
in
that
house
that
night
they
were
five
in
number
three
of
them
i
agree
could
not
have
been
responsiblethe
murdered
man
himself
old
grigory
and
his
wife
there
are
left
then
the
prisoner
and
smerdyakov
and
the
prosecutor
dramatically
exclaims
that
the
prisoner
pointed
to
smerdyakov
because
he
had
no
one
else
to
fix
on
that
had
there
been
a
sixth
person
even
a
phantom
of
a
sixth
person
he
would
have
abandoned
the
charge
against
smerdyakov
at
once
in
shame
and
have
accused
that
other
but
gentlemen
of
the
jury
why
may
i
not
draw
the
very
opposite
conclusion
there
are
two
personsthe
prisoner
and
smerdyakov
why
can
i
not
say
that
you
accuse
my
client
simply
because
you
have
no
one
else
to
accuse
and
you
have
no
one
else
only
because
you
have
determined
to
exclude
smerdyakov
from
all
suspicion
its
true
indeed
smerdyakov
is
accused
only
by
the
prisoner
his
two
brothers
and
madame
svyetlov
but
there
are
others
who
accuse
him
there
are
vague
rumors
of
a
question
of
a
suspicion
an
obscure
report
a
feeling
of
expectation
finally
we
have
the
evidence
of
a
combination
of
facts
very
suggestive
though
i
admit
inconclusive
in
the
first
place
we
have
precisely
on
the
day
of
the
catastrophe
that
fit
for
the
genuineness
of
which
the
prosecutor
for
some
reason
has
felt
obliged
to
make
a
careful
defense
then
smerdyakovs
sudden
suicide
on
the
eve
of
the
trial
then
the
equally
startling
evidence
given
in
court
today
by
the
elder
of
the
prisoners
brothers
who
had
believed
in
his
guilt
but
has
today
produced
a
bundle
of
notes
and
proclaimed
smerdyakov
as
the
murderer
oh
i
fully
share
the
courts
and
the
prosecutors
conviction
that
ivan
karamazov
is
suffering
from
brain
fever
that
his
statement
may
really
be
a
desperate
effort
planned
in
delirium
to
save
his
brother
by
throwing
the
guilt
on
the
dead
man
but
again
smerdyakovs
name
is
pronounced
again
there
is
a
suggestion
of
mystery
there
is
something
unexplained
incomplete
and
perhaps
it
may
one
day
be
explained
but
we
wont
go
into
that
now
of
that
later
the
court
has
resolved
to
go
on
with
the
trial
but
meantime
i
might
make
a
few
remarks
about
the
charactersketch
of
smerdyakov
drawn
with
subtlety
and
talent
by
the
prosecutor
but
while
i
admire
his
talent
i
cannot
agree
with
him
i
have
visited
smerdyakov
i
have
seen
him
and
talked
to
him
and
he
made
a
very
different
impression
on
me
he
was
weak
in
health
it
is
true
but
in
character
in
spirit
he
was
by
no
means
the
weak
man
the
prosecutor
has
made
him
out
to
be
i
found
in
him
no
trace
of
the
timidity
on
which
the
prosecutor
so
insisted
there
was
no
simplicity
about
him
either
i
found
in
him
on
the
contrary
an
extreme
mistrustfulness
concealed
under
a
mask
of
navet
and
an
intelligence
of
considerable
range
the
prosecutor
was
too
simple
in
taking
him
for
weakminded
he
made
a
very
definite
impression
on
me
i
left
him
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
a
distinctly
spiteful
creature
excessively
ambitious
vindictive
and
intensely
envious
i
made
some
inquiries
he
resented
his
parentage
was
ashamed
of
it
and
would
clench
his
teeth
when
he
remembered
that
he
was
the
son
of
stinking
lizaveta
he
was
disrespectful
to
the
servant
grigory
and
his
wife
who
had
cared
for
him
in
his
childhood
he
cursed
and
jeered
at
russia
he
dreamed
of
going
to
france
and
becoming
a
frenchman
he
used
often
to
say
that
he
hadnt
the
means
to
do
so
i
fancy
he
loved
no
one
but
himself
and
had
a
strangely
high
opinion
of
himself
his
conception
of
culture
was
limited
to
good
clothes
clean
shirtfronts
and
polished
boots
believing
himself
to
be
the
illegitimate
son
of
fyodor
pavlovitch
there
is
evidence
of
this
he
might
well
have
resented
his
position
compared
with
that
of
his
masters
legitimate
sons
they
had
everything
he
nothing
they
had
all
the
rights
they
had
the
inheritance
while
he
was
only
the
cook
he
told
me
himself
that
he
had
helped
fyodor
pavlovitch
to
put
the
notes
in
the
envelope
the
destination
of
that
suma
sum
which
would
have
made
his
careermust
have
been
hateful
to
him
moreover
he
saw
three
thousand
roubles
in
new
rainbowcolored
notes
i
asked
him
about
that
on
purpose
oh
beware
of
showing
an
ambitious
and
envious
man
a
large
sum
of
money
at
once
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
so
much
money
in
the
hands
of
one
man
the
sight
of
the
rainbowcolored
notes
may
have
made
a
morbid
impression
on
his
imagination
but
with
no
immediate
results
the
talented
prosecutor
with
extraordinary
subtlety
sketched
for
us
all
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
hypothesis
of
smerdyakovs
guilt
and
asked
us
in
particular
what
motive
he
had
in
feigning
a
fit
but
he
may
not
have
been
feigning
at
all
the
fit
may
have
happened
quite
naturally
but
it
may
have
passed
off
quite
naturally
and
the
sick
man
may
have
recovered
not
completely
perhaps
but
still
regaining
consciousness
as
happens
with
epileptics
the
prosecutor
asks
at
what
moment
could
smerdyakov
have
committed
the
murder
but
it
is
very
easy
to
point
out
that
moment
he
might
have
waked
up
from
deep
sleep
for
he
was
only
asleepan
epileptic
fit
is
always
followed
by
a
deep
sleep
at
that
moment
when
the
old
grigory
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
parricide
that
shout
in
the
dark
and
stillness
may
have
waked
smerdyakov
whose
sleep
may
have
been
less
sound
at
the
moment
he
might
naturally
have
waked
up
an
hour
before
getting
out
of
bed
he
goes
almost
unconsciously
and
with
no
definite
motive
towards
the
sound
to
see
whats
the
matter
his
head
is
still
clouded
with
his
attack
his
faculties
are
half
asleep
but
once
in
the
garden
he
walks
to
the
lighted
windows
and
he
hears
terrible
news
from
his
master
who
would
be
of
course
glad
to
see
him
his
mind
sets
to
work
at
once
he
hears
all
the
details
from
his
frightened
master
and
gradually
in
his
disordered
brain
there
shapes
itself
an
ideaterrible
but
seductive
and
irresistibly
logical
to
kill
the
old
man
take
the
three
thousand
and
throw
all
the
blame
on
to
his
young
master
a
terrible
lust
of
money
of
booty
might
seize
upon
him
as
he
realized
his
security
from
detection
oh
these
sudden
and
irresistible
impulses
come
so
often
when
there
is
a
favorable
opportunity
and
especially
with
murderers
who
have
had
no
idea
of
committing
a
murder
beforehand
and
smerdyakov
may
have
gone
in
and
carried
out
his
plan
with
what
weapon
why
with
any
stone
picked
up
in
the
garden
but
what
for
with
what
object
why
the
three
thousand
which
means
a
career
for
him
oh
i
am
not
contradicting
myselfthe
money
may
have
existed
and
perhaps
smerdyakov
alone
knew
where
to
find
it
where
his
master
kept
it
and
the
covering
of
the
moneythe
torn
envelope
on
the
floor
just
now
when
the
prosecutor
was
explaining
his
subtle
theory
that
only
an
inexperienced
thief
like
karamazov
would
have
left
the
envelope
on
the
floor
and
not
one
like
smerdyakov
who
would
have
avoided
leaving
a
piece
of
evidence
against
himself
i
thought
as
i
listened
that
i
was
hearing
something
very
familiar
and
would
you
believe
it
i
have
heard
that
very
argument
that
very
conjecture
of
how
karamazov
would
have
behaved
precisely
two
days
before
from
smerdyakov
himself
whats
more
it
struck
me
at
the
time
i
fancied
that
there
was
an
artificial
simplicity
about
him
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
suggest
this
idea
to
me
that
i
might
fancy
it
was
my
own
he
insinuated
it
as
it
were
did
he
not
insinuate
the
same
idea
at
the
inquiry
and
suggest
it
to
the
talented
prosecutor
i
shall
be
asked
what
about
the
old
woman
grigorys
wife
she
heard
the
sick
man
moaning
close
by
all
night
yes
she
heard
it
but
that
evidence
is
extremely
unreliable
i
knew
a
lady
who
complained
bitterly
that
she
had
been
kept
awake
all
night
by
a
dog
in
the
yard
yet
the
poor
beast
it
appeared
had
only
yelped
once
or
twice
in
the
night
and
thats
natural
if
any
one
is
asleep
and
hears
a
groan
he
wakes
up
annoyed
at
being
waked
but
instantly
falls
asleep
again
two
hours
later
again
a
groan
he
wakes
up
and
falls
asleep
again
and
the
same
thing
again
two
hours
laterthree
times
altogether
in
the
night
next
morning
the
sleeper
wakes
up
and
complains
that
some
one
has
been
groaning
all
night
and
keeping
him
awake
and
it
is
bound
to
seem
so
to
him
the
intervals
of
two
hours
of
sleep
he
does
not
remember
he
only
remembers
the
moments
of
waking
so
he
feels
he
has
been
waked
up
all
night
but
why
why
asks
the
prosecutor
did
not
smerdyakov
confess
in
his
last
letter
why
did
his
conscience
prompt
him
to
one
step
and
not
to
both
but
excuse
me
conscience
implies
penitence
and
the
suicide
may
not
have
felt
penitence
but
only
despair
despair
and
penitence
are
two
very
different
things
despair
may
be
vindictive
and
irreconcilable
and
the
suicide
laying
his
hands
on
himself
may
well
have
felt
redoubled
hatred
for
those
whom
he
had
envied
all
his
life
gentlemen
of
the
jury
beware
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
what
is
there
unlikely
in
all
i
have
put
before
you
just
now
find
the
error
in
my
reasoning
find
the
impossibility
the
absurdity
and
if
there
is
but
a
shade
of
possibility
but
a
shade
of
probability
in
my
propositions
do
not
condemn
him
and
is
there
only
a
shade
i
swear
by
all
that
is
sacred
i
fully
believe
in
the
explanation
of
the
murder
i
have
just
put
forward
what
troubles
me
and
makes
me
indignant
is
that
of
all
the
mass
of
facts
heaped
up
by
the
prosecution
against
the
prisoner
there
is
not
a
single
one
certain
and
irrefutable
and
yet
the
unhappy
man
is
to
be
ruined
by
the
accumulation
of
these
facts
yes
the
accumulated
effect
is
awful
the
blood
the
blood
dripping
from
his
fingers
the
bloodstained
shirt
the
dark
night
resounding
with
the
shout
parricide
and
the
old
man
falling
with
a
broken
head
and
then
the
mass
of
phrases
statements
gestures
shouts
oh
this
has
so
much
influence
it
can
so
bias
the
mind
but
gentlemen
of
the
jury
can
it
bias
your
minds
remember
you
have
been
given
absolute
power
to
bind
and
to
loose
but
the
greater
the
power
the
more
terrible
its
responsibility
i
do
not
draw
back
one
iota
from
what
i
have
said
just
now
but
suppose
for
one
moment
i
agreed
with
the
prosecution
that
my
luckless
client
had
stained
his
hands
with
his
fathers
blood
this
is
only
hypothesis
i
repeat
i
never
for
one
instant
doubt
of
his
innocence
but
so
be
it
i
assume
that
my
client
is
guilty
of
parricide
even
so
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
have
it
in
my
heart
to
say
something
more
to
you
for
i
feel
that
there
must
be
a
great
conflict
in
your
hearts
and
minds
forgive
my
referring
to
your
hearts
and
minds
gentlemen
of
the
jury
but
i
want
to
be
truthful
and
sincere
to
the
end
let
us
all
be
sincere
at
this
point
the
speech
was
interrupted
by
rather
loud
applause
the
last
words
indeed
were
pronounced
with
a
note
of
such
sincerity
that
every
one
felt
that
he
really
might
have
something
to
say
and
that
what
he
was
about
to
say
would
be
of
the
greatest
consequence
but
the
president
hearing
the
applause
in
a
loud
voice
threatened
to
clear
the
court
if
such
an
incident
were
repeated
every
sound
was
hushed
and
fetyukovitch
began
in
a
voice
full
of
feeling
quite
unlike
the
tone
he
had
used
hitherto
chapter
xiii
a
corrupter
of
thought
its
not
only
the
accumulation
of
facts
that
threatens
my
client
with
ruin
gentlemen
of
the
jury
he
began
what
is
really
damning
for
my
client
is
one
factthe
dead
body
of
his
father
had
it
been
an
ordinary
case
of
murder
you
would
have
rejected
the
charge
in
view
of
the
triviality
the
incompleteness
and
the
fantastic
character
of
the
evidence
if
you
examine
each
part
of
it
separately
or
at
least
you
would
have
hesitated
to
ruin
a
mans
life
simply
from
the
prejudice
against
him
which
he
has
alas
only
too
well
deserved
but
its
not
an
ordinary
case
of
murder
its
a
case
of
parricide
that
impresses
mens
minds
and
to
such
a
degree
that
the
very
triviality
and
incompleteness
of
the
evidence
becomes
less
trivial
and
less
incomplete
even
to
an
unprejudiced
mind
how
can
such
a
prisoner
be
acquitted
what
if
he
committed
the
murder
and
gets
off
unpunished
that
is
what
every
one
almost
involuntarily
instinctively
feels
at
heart
yes
its
a
fearful
thing
to
shed
a
fathers
bloodthe
father
who
has
begotten
me
loved
me
not
spared
his
life
for
me
grieved
over
my
illnesses
from
childhood
up
troubled
all
his
life
for
my
happiness
and
has
lived
in
my
joys
in
my
successes
to
murder
such
a
fatherthats
inconceivable
gentlemen
of
the
jury
what
is
a
fathera
real
father
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
great
word
what
is
the
great
idea
in
that
name
we
have
just
indicated
in
part
what
a
true
father
is
and
what
he
ought
to
be
in
the
case
in
which
we
are
now
so
deeply
occupied
and
over
which
our
hearts
are
achingin
the
present
case
the
father
fyodor
pavlovitch
karamazov
did
not
correspond
to
that
conception
of
a
father
to
which
we
have
just
referred
thats
the
misfortune
and
indeed
some
fathers
are
a
misfortune
let
us
examine
this
misfortune
rather
more
closely
we
must
shrink
from
nothing
gentlemen
of
the
jury
considering
the
importance
of
the
decision
you
have
to
make
its
our
particular
duty
not
to
shrink
from
any
idea
like
children
or
frightened
women
as
the
talented
prosecutor
happily
expresses
it
but
in
the
course
of
his
heated
speech
my
esteemed
opponent
and
he
was
my
opponent
before
i
opened
my
lips
exclaimed
several
times
oh
i
will
not
yield
the
defense
of
the
prisoner
to
the
lawyer
who
has
come
down
from
petersburg
i
accuse
but
i
defend
also
he
exclaimed
that
several
times
but
forgot
to
mention
that
if
this
terrible
prisoner
was
for
twentythree
years
so
grateful
for
a
mere
pound
of
nuts
given
him
by
the
only
man
who
had
been
kind
to
him
as
a
child
in
his
fathers
house
might
not
such
a
man
well
have
remembered
for
twentythree
years
how
he
ran
in
his
fathers
backyard
without
boots
on
his
feet
and
with
his
little
trousers
hanging
by
one
buttonto
use
the
expression
of
the
kindhearted
doctor
herzenstube
oh
gentlemen
of
the
jury
why
need
we
look
more
closely
at
this
misfortune
why
repeat
what
we
all
know
already
what
did
my
client
meet
with
when
he
arrived
here
at
his
fathers
house
and
why
depict
my
client
as
a
heartless
egoist
and
monster
he
is
uncontrolled
he
is
wild
and
unrulywe
are
trying
him
now
for
thatbut
who
is
responsible
for
his
life
who
is
responsible
for
his
having
received
such
an
unseemly
bringing
up
in
spite
of
his
excellent
disposition
and
his
grateful
and
sensitive
heart
did
any
one
train
him
to
be
reasonable
was
he
enlightened
by
study
did
any
one
love
him
ever
so
little
in
his
childhood
my
client
was
left
to
the
care
of
providence
like
a
beast
of
the
field
he
thirsted
perhaps
to
see
his
father
after
long
years
of
separation
a
thousand
times
perhaps
he
may
recalling
his
childhood
have
driven
away
the
loathsome
phantoms
that
haunted
his
childish
dreams
and
with
all
his
heart
he
may
have
longed
to
embrace
and
to
forgive
his
father
and
what
awaited
him
he
was
met
by
cynical
taunts
suspicions
and
wrangling
about
money
he
heard
nothing
but
revolting
talk
and
vicious
precepts
uttered
daily
over
the
brandy
and
at
last
he
saw
his
father
seducing
his
mistress
from
him
with
his
own
money
oh
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
was
cruel
and
revolting
and
that
old
man
was
always
complaining
of
the
disrespect
and
cruelty
of
his
son
he
slandered
him
in
society
injured
him
calumniated
him
bought
up
his
unpaid
debts
to
get
him
thrown
into
prison
gentlemen
of
the
jury
people
like
my
client
who
are
fierce
unruly
and
uncontrolled
on
the
surface
are
sometimes
most
frequently
indeed
exceedingly
tenderhearted
only
they
dont
express
it
dont
laugh
dont
laugh
at
my
idea
the
talented
prosecutor
laughed
mercilessly
just
now
at
my
client
for
loving
schillerloving
the
sublime
and
beautiful
i
should
not
have
laughed
at
that
in
his
place
yes
such
naturesoh
let
me
speak
in
defense
of
such
natures
so
often
and
so
cruelly
misunderstoodthese
natures
often
thirst
for
tenderness
goodness
and
justice
as
it
were
in
contrast
to
themselves
their
unruliness
their
ferocitythey
thirst
for
it
unconsciously
passionate
and
fierce
on
the
surface
they
are
painfully
capable
of
loving
woman
for
instance
and
with
a
spiritual
and
elevated
love
again
do
not
laugh
at
me
this
is
very
often
the
case
in
such
natures
but
they
cannot
hide
their
passionssometimes
very
coarseand
that
is
conspicuous
and
is
noticed
but
the
inner
man
is
unseen
their
passions
are
quickly
exhausted
but
by
the
side
of
a
noble
and
lofty
creature
that
seemingly
coarse
and
rough
man
seeks
a
new
life
seeks
to
correct
himself
to
be
better
to
become
noble
and
honorable
sublime
and
beautiful
however
much
the
expression
has
been
ridiculed
i
said
just
now
that
i
would
not
venture
to
touch
upon
my
clients
engagement
but
i
may
say
half
a
word
what
we
heard
just
now
was
not
evidence
but
only
the
scream
of
a
frenzied
and
revengeful
woman
and
it
was
not
for
heroh
not
for
herto
reproach
him
with
treachery
for
she
has
betrayed
him
if
she
had
had
but
a
little
time
for
reflection
she
would
not
have
given
such
evidence
oh
do
not
believe
her
no
my
client
is
not
a
monster
as
she
called
him
the
lover
of
mankind
on
the
eve
of
his
crucifixion
said
i
am
the
good
shepherd
the
good
shepherd
lays
down
his
life
for
his
sheep
so
that
not
one
of
them
might
be
lost
let
not
a
mans
soul
be
lost
through
us
i
asked
just
now
what
does
father
mean
and
exclaimed
that
it
was
a
great
word
a
precious
name
but
one
must
use
words
honestly
gentlemen
and
i
venture
to
call
things
by
their
right
names
such
a
father
as
old
karamazov
cannot
be
called
a
father
and
does
not
deserve
to
be
filial
love
for
an
unworthy
father
is
an
absurdity
an
impossibility
love
cannot
be
created
from
nothing
only
god
can
create
something
from
nothing

the
apostle
writes
from
a
heart
glowing
with
love
its
not
for
the
sake
of
my
client
that
i
quote
these
sacred
words
i
mention
them
for
all
fathers
who
has
authorized
me
to

we
are
not
long
on
earth
we
do
many
evil
deeds
and
say
many
evil
words
so
let
us
all
catch
a
favorable
moment
when
we
are
all
together
to
say
a
good
word
to
each

thats
what
i
am
doing
while
i
am
in

authorityall

fathers
provoke
not

yes
let
us
first
fulfill
christs
injunction
ourselves
and
only
then
venture
to
expect
it
of
our
children
otherwise
we
are
not
fathers
but
enemies
of
our
children
and
they
are
not
our
children
but
our
enemies
and
we
have
made
them
our
enemies

not
long
ago
a
servant
girl
in
finland
was
suspected
of
having
secretly
given
birth
to
a
child
she
was
watched
and
a
box
of
which
no
one
knew
anything
was
found
in
the
corner
of
the
loft
behind
some
bricks
it
was
opened
and
inside
was
found
the
body
of
a
newborn
child
which
she
had
killed
in
the
same
box
were
found
the
skeletons
of
two
other
babies
which
according
to
her
own
confession
she
had
killed
at
the
moment
of
their
birth
gentlemen
of
the
jury
was
she
a
mother
to
her
children
she
gave
birth
to
them
indeed
but
was
she
a
mother
to
them
would
any
one
venture
to
give
her
the
sacred
name
of
mother
let
us
be
bold
gentlemen
let
us
be
audacious
even
its
our
duty
to
be
so
at
this
moment
and
not
to
be
afraid
of
certain
words
and
ideas
like
the
moscow
women
in
ostrovskys
play
who
are
scared
at
the
sound
of
certain
words
no
let
us
prove
that
the
progress
of
the
last
few
years
has
touched
even
us
and
let
us
say
plainly
the
father
is
not
merely
he
who
begets
the
child
but
he
who
begets
it
and
does
his
duty
by
it
oh
of
course
there
is
the
other
meaning
there
is
the
other
interpretation
of
the
word
father
which
insists
that
any
father
even
though
he
be
a
monster
even
though
he
be
the
enemy
of
his
children
still
remains
my
father
simply
because
he
begot
me
but
this
is
so
to
say
the
mystical
meaning
which
i
cannot
comprehend
with
my
intellect
but
can
only
accept
by
faith
or
better
to
say
on
faith
like
many
other
things
which
i
do
not
understand
but
which
religion
bids
me
believe
but
in
that
case
let
it
be
kept
outside
the
sphere
of
actual
life
in
the
sphere
of
actual
life
which
has
indeed
its
own
rights
but
also
lays
upon
us
great
duties
and
obligations
in
that
sphere
if
we
want
to
be
humanechristian
in
factwe
must
or
ought
to
act
only
upon
convictions
justified
by
reason
and
experience
which
have
been
passed
through
the
crucible
of
analysis
in
a
word
we
must
act
rationally
and
not
as
though
in
dream
and
delirium
that
we
may
not
do
harm
that
we
may
not
illtreat
and
ruin
a
man
then
it
will
be
real
christian
work
not
only
mystic
but
rational
and
philanthropic
there
was
violent
applause
at
this
passage
from
many
parts
of
the
court
but
fetyukovitch
waved
his
hands
as
though
imploring
them
to
let
him
finish
without
interruption
the
court
relapsed
into
silence
at
once
the
orator
went
on
do
you
suppose
gentlemen
that
our
children
as
they
grow
up
and
begin
to
reason
can
avoid
such
questions
no
they
cannot
and
we
will
not
impose
on
them
an
impossible
restriction
the
sight
of
an
unworthy
father
involuntarily
suggests
tormenting
questions
to
a
young
creature
especially
when
he
compares
him
with
the
excellent
fathers
of
his
companions
the
conventional
answer
to
this
question
is
he
begot
you
and
you
are
his
flesh
and
blood
and
therefore
you
are
bound
to
love
him
the
youth
involuntarily
reflects
but
did
he
love
me
when
he
begot
me
he
asks
wondering
more
and
more
was
it
for
my
sake
he
begot
me
he
did
not
know
me
not
even
my
sex
at
that
moment
at
the
moment
of
passion
perhaps
inflamed
by
wine
and
he
has
only
transmitted
to
me
a
propensity
to
drunkennessthats
all
hes
done
for
me
why
am
i
bound
to
love
him
simply
for
begetting
me
when
he
has
cared
nothing
for
me
all
my
life
after
oh
perhaps
those
questions
strike
you
as
coarse
and
cruel
but
do
not
expect
an
impossible
restraint
from
a
young
mind
drive
nature
out
of
the
door
and
it
will
fly
in
at
the
window
and
above
all
let
us
not
be
afraid
of
words
but
decide
the
question
according
to
the
dictates
of
reason
and
humanity
and
not
of
mystic
ideas
how
shall
it
be
decided
why
like
this
let
the
son
stand
before
his
father
and
ask
him
father
tell
me
why
must
i
love
you
father
show
me
that
i
must
love
you
and
if
that
father
is
able
to
answer
him
and
show
him
good
reason
we
have
a
real
normal
parental
relation
not
resting
on
mystical
prejudice
but
on
a
rational
responsible
and
strictly
humanitarian
basis
but
if
he
does
not
theres
an
end
to
the
family
tie
he
is
not
a
father
to
him
and
the
son
has
a
right
to
look
upon
him
as
a
stranger
and
even
an
enemy
our
tribune
gentlemen
of
the
jury
ought
to
be
a
school
of
true
and
sound
ideas
here
the
orator
was
interrupted
by
irrepressible
and
almost
frantic
applause
of
course
it
was
not
the
whole
audience
but
a
good
half
of
it
applauded
the
fathers
and
mothers
present
applauded
shrieks
and
exclamations
were
heard
from
the
gallery
where
the
ladies
were
sitting
handkerchiefs
were
waved
the
president
began
ringing
his
bell
with
all
his
might
he
was
obviously
irritated
by
the
behavior
of
the
audience
but
did
not
venture
to
clear
the
court
as
he
had
threatened
even
persons
of
high
position
old
men
with
stars
on
their
breasts
sitting
on
specially
reserved
seats
behind
the
judges
applauded
the
orator
and
waved
their
handkerchiefs
so
that
when
the
noise
died
down
the
president
confined
himself
to
repeating
his
stern
threat
to
clear
the
court
and
fetyukovitch
excited
and
triumphant
continued
his
speech
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
remember
that
awful
night
of
which
so
much
has
been
said
today
when
the
son
got
over
the
fence
and
stood
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
and
persecutor
who
had
begotten
him
i
insist
most
emphatically
it
was
not
for
money
he
ran
to
his
fathers
house
the
charge
of
robbery
is
an
absurdity
as
i
proved
before
and
it
was
not
to
murder
him
he
broke
into
the
house
oh
no
if
he
had
had
that
design
he
would
at
least
have
taken
the
precaution
of
arming
himself
beforehand
the
brass
pestle
he
caught
up
instinctively
without
knowing
why
he
did
it
granted
that
he
deceived
his
father
by
tapping
at
the
window
granted
that
he
made
his
way
inive
said
already
that
i
do
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
legend
but
let
it
be
so
let
us
suppose
it
for
a
moment
gentlemen
i
swear
to
you
by
all
thats
holy
if
it
had
not
been
his
father
but
an
ordinary
enemy
he
would
after
running
through
the
rooms
and
satisfying
himself
that
the
woman
was
not
there
have
made
off
posthaste
without
doing
any
harm
to
his
rival
he
would
have
struck
him
pushed
him
away
perhaps
nothing
more
for
he
had
no
thought
and
no
time
to
spare
for
that
what
he
wanted
to
know
was
where
she
was
but
his
father
his
father
the
mere
sight
of
the
father
who
had
hated
him
from
his
childhood
had
been
his
enemy
his
persecutor
and
now
his
unnatural
rival
was
enough
a
feeling
of
hatred
came
over
him
involuntarily
irresistibly
clouding
his
reason
it
all
surged
up
in
one
moment
it
was
an
impulse
of
madness
and
insanity
but
also
an
impulse
of
nature
irresistibly
and
unconsciously
like
everything
in
nature
avenging
the
violation
of
its
eternal
laws
but
the
prisoner
even
then
did
not
murder
himi
maintain
that
i
cry
that
aloudno
he
only
brandished
the
pestle
in
a
burst
of
indignant
disgust
not
meaning
to
kill
him
not
knowing
that
he
would
kill
him
had
he
not
had
this
fatal
pestle
in
his
hand
he
would
have
only
knocked
his
father
down
perhaps
but
would
not
have
killed
him
as
he
ran
away
he
did
not
know
whether
he
had
killed
the
old
man
such
a
murder
is
not
a
murder
such
a
murder
is
not
a
parricide
no
the
murder
of
such
a
father
cannot
be
called
parricide
such
a
murder
can
only
be
reckoned
parricide
by
prejudice
but
i
appeal
to
you
again
and
again
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
did
this
murder
actually
take
place
gentlemen
of
the
jury
if
we
convict
and
punish
him
he
will
say
to
himself
these
people
have
done
nothing
for
my
bringing
up
for
my
education
nothing
to
improve
my
lot
nothing
to
make
me
better
nothing
to
make
me
a
man
these
people
have
not
given
me
to
eat
and
to
drink
have
not
visited
me
in
prison
and
nakedness
and
here
they
have
sent
me
to
penal
servitude
i
am
quits
i
owe
them
nothing
now
and
owe
no
one
anything
for
ever
they
are
wicked
and
i
will
be
wicked
they
are
cruel
and
i
will
be
cruel
that
is
what
he
will
say
gentlemen
of
the
jury
and
i
swear
by
finding
him
guilty
you
will
only
make
it
easier
for
him
you
will
ease
his
conscience
he
will
curse
the
blood
he
has
shed
and
will
not
regret
it
at
the
same
time
you
will
destroy
in
him
the
possibility
of
becoming
a
new
man
for
he
will
remain
in
his
wickedness
and
blindness
all
his
life
but
do
you
want
to
punish
him
fearfully
terribly
with
the
most
awful
punishment
that
could
be
imagined
and
at
the
same
time
to
save
him
and
regenerate
his
soul
if
so
overwhelm
him
with
your
mercy
you
will
see
you
will
hear
how
he
will
tremble
and
be
horrorstruck
how
can
i
endure
this
mercy
how
can
i
endure
so
much
love
am
i
worthy
of
it
thats
what
he
will
exclaim
oh
i
know
i
know
that
heart
that
wild
but
grateful
heart
gentlemen
of
the
jury
it
will
bow
before
your
mercy
it
thirsts
for
a
great
and
loving
action
it
will
melt
and
mount
upwards
there
are
souls
which
in
their
limitation
blame
the
whole
world
but
subdue
such
a
soul
with
mercy
show
it
love
and
it
will
curse
its
past
for
there
are
many
good
impulses
in
it
such
a
heart
will
expand
and
see
that
god
is
merciful
and
that
men
are
good
and
just
he
will
be
horrorstricken
he
will
be
crushed
by
remorse
and
the
vast
obligation
laid
upon
him
henceforth
and
he
will
not
say
then
i
am
quits
but
will
say
i
am
guilty
in
the
sight
of
all
men
and
am
more
unworthy
than
all
with
tears
of
penitence
and
poignant
tender
anguish
he
will
exclaim
others
are
better
than
i
they
wanted
to
save
me
not
to
ruin
me
oh
this
act
of
mercy
is
so
easy
for
you
for
in
the
absence
of
anything
like
real
evidence
it
will
be
too
awful
for
you
to
pronounce
yes
he
is
guilty
better
acquit
ten
guilty
men
than
punish
one
innocent
man
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
that
majestic
voice
from
the
past
century
of
our
glorious
history
it
is
not
for
an
insignificant
person
like
me
to
remind
you
that
the
russian
court
does
not
exist
for
the
punishment
only
but
also
for
the
salvation
of
the
criminal
let
other
nations
think
of
retribution
and
the
letter
of
the
law
we
will
cling
to
the
spirit
and
the
meaningthe
salvation
and
the
reformation
of
the
lost
if
this
is
true
if
russia
and
her
justice
are
such
she
may
go
forward
with
good
cheer
do
not
try
to
scare
us
with
your
frenzied
troikas
from
which
all
the
nations
stand
aside
in
disgust
not
a
runaway
troika
but
the
stately
chariot
of
russia
will
move
calmly
and
majestically
to
its
goal
in
your
hands
is
the
fate
of
my
client
in
your
hands
is
the
fate
of
russian
justice
you
will
defend
it
you
will
save
it
you
will
prove
that
there
are
men
to
watch
over
it
that
it
is
in

hands
chapter
xiv
the
peasants
stand
firm
this
was
how
fetyukovitch
concluded
his
speech
and
the
enthusiasm
of
the
audience
burst
like
an
irresistible
storm
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
stop
it
the
women
wept
many
of
the
men
wept
too
even
two
important
personages
shed
tears
the
president
submitted
and
even
postponed
ringing
his
bell
the
suppression
of
such
an
enthusiasm
would
be
the
suppression
of
something
sacred
as
the
ladies
cried
afterwards
the
orator
himself
was
genuinely
touched
and
it
was
at
this
moment
that
ippolit
kirillovitch
got
up
to
make
certain
objections
people
looked
at
him
with
hatred
what
whats
the
meaning
of
it
he
positively
dares
to
make
objections
the
ladies
babbled
but
if
the
whole
world
of
ladies
including
his
wife
had
protested
he
could
not
have
been
stopped
at
that
moment
he
was
pale
he
was
shaking
with
emotion
his
first
phrases
were
even
unintelligible
he
gasped
for
breath
could
hardly
speak
clearly
lost
the
thread
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
of
this
new
speech
of
his
i
will
quote
only
a
few
sentences

i
am
reproached
with
having
woven
a
romance
but
what
is
this
defense
if
not
one
romance
on
the
top
of
another
all
that
was
lacking
was
poetry
fyodor
pavlovitch
while
waiting
for
his
mistress
tears
open
the
envelope
and
throws
it
on
the
floor
we
are
even
told
what
he
said
while
engaged
in
this
strange
act
is
not
this
a
flight
of
fancy
and
what
proof
have
we
that
he
had
taken
out
the
money
who
heard
what
he
said
the
weakminded
idiot
smerdyakov
transformed
into
a
byronic
hero
avenging
society
for
his
illegitimate
birthisnt
this
a
romance
in
the
byronic
style
and
the
son
who
breaks
into
his
fathers
house
and
murders
him
without
murdering
him
is
not
even
a
romancethis
is
a
sphinx
setting
us
a
riddle
which
he
cannot
solve
himself
if
he
murdered
him
he
murdered
him
and
whats
the
meaning
of
his
murdering
him
without
having
murdered
himwho
can
make
head
or
tail
of
this
then
we
are
admonished
that
our
tribune
is
a
tribune
of
true
and
sound
ideas
and
from
this
tribune
of
sound
ideas
is
heard
a
solemn
declaration
that
to
call
the
murder
of
a
father
parricide
is
nothing
but
a
prejudice
but
if
parricide
is
a
prejudice
and
if
every
child
is
to
ask
his
father
why
he
is
to
love
him
what
will
become
of
us
what
will
become
of
the
foundations
of
society
what
will
become
of
the
family
parricide
it
appears
is
only
a
bogy
of
moscow
merchants
wives
the
most
precious
the
most
sacred
guarantees
for
the
destiny
and
future
of
russian
justice
are
presented
to
us
in
a
perverted
and
frivolous
form
simply
to
attain
an
objectto
obtain
the
justification
of
something
which
cannot
be
justified
oh
crush
him
by
mercy
cries
the
counsel
for
the
defense
but
thats
all
the
criminal
wants
and
tomorrow
it
will
be
seen
how
much
he
is
crushed
and
is
not
the
counsel
for
the
defense
too
modest
in
asking
only
for
the
acquittal
of
the
prisoner
why
not
found
a
charity
in
the
honor
of
the
parricide
to
commemorate
his
exploit
among
future
generations
religion
and
the
gospel
are
correctedthats
all
mysticism
we
are
told
and
ours
is
the
only
true
christianity
which
has
been
subjected
to
the
analysis
of
reason
and
common
sense
and
so
they
set
up
before
us
a
false
semblance
of
christ
what
measure
ye
mete
so
it
shall
be
meted
unto
you
again
cried
the
counsel
for
the
defense
and
instantly
deduces
that
christ
teaches
us
to
measure
as
it
is
measured
to
usand
this
from
the
tribune
of
truth
and
sound
sense
we
peep
into
the
gospel
only
on
the
eve
of
making
speeches
in
order
to
dazzle
the
audience
by
our
acquaintance
with
what
is
anyway
a
rather
original
composition
which
may
be
of
use
to
produce
a
certain
effectall
to
serve
the
purpose
but
what
christ
commands
us
is
something
very
different
he
bids
us
beware
of
doing
this
because
the
wicked
world
does
this
but
we
ought
to
forgive
and
to
turn
the
other
cheek
and
not
to
measure
to
our
persecutors
as
they
measure
to
us
this
is
what
our
god
has
taught
us
and
not
that
to
forbid
children
to
murder
their
fathers
is
a
prejudice
and
we
will
not
from
the
tribune
of
truth
and
good
sense
correct
the
gospel
of
our
lord
whom
the
counsel
for
the
defense
deigns
to
call
only
the
crucified
lover
of
humanity
in
opposition
to
all
orthodox
russia
which
calls
to
him
for
thou
art
our
god

at
this
the
president
intervened
and
checked
the
overzealous
speaker
begging
him
not
to
exaggerate
not
to
overstep
the
bounds
and
so
on
as
presidents
always
do
in
such
cases
the
audience
too
was
uneasy
the
public
was
restless
there
were
even
exclamations
of
indignation
fetyukovitch
did
not
so
much
as
reply
he
only
mounted
the
tribune
to
lay
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
with
an
offended
voice
utter
a
few
words
full
of
dignity
he
only
touched
again
lightly
and
ironically
on
romancing
and
psychology
and
in
an
appropriate
place
quoted
jupiter
you
are
angry
therefore
you
are
wrong
which
provoked
a
burst
of
approving
laughter
in
the
audience
for
ippolit
kirillovitch
was
by
no
means
like
jupiter
then

propos
of
the
accusation
that
he
was
teaching
the
young
generation
to
murder
their
fathers
fetyukovitch
observed
with
great
dignity
that
he
would
not
even
answer
as
for
the
prosecutors
charge
of
uttering
unorthodox
opinions
fetyukovitch
hinted
that
it
was
a
personal
insinuation
and
that
he
had
expected
in
this
court
to
be
secure
from
accusations
damaging
to
my
reputation
as
a
citizen
and
a
loyal
subject
but
at
these
words
the
president
pulled
him
up
too
and
fetyukovitch
concluded
his
speech
with
a
bow
amid
a
hum
of
approbation
in
the
court
and
ippolit
kirillovitch
was
in
the
opinion
of
our
ladies
crushed
for
good
then
the
prisoner
was
allowed
to
speak
mitya
stood
up
but
said
very
little
he
was
fearfully
exhausted
physically
and
mentally
the
look
of
strength
and
independence
with
which
he
had
entered
in
the
morning
had
almost
disappeared
he
seemed
as
though
he
had
passed
through
an
experience
that
day
which
had
taught
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
something
very
important
he
had
not
understood
till
then
his
voice
was
weak
he
did
not
shout
as
before
in
his
words
there
was
a
new
note
of
humility
defeat
and
submission
what
am
i
to
say
gentlemen
of
the
jury
the
hour
of
judgment
has
come
for
me
i
feel
the
hand
of
god
upon
me
the
end
has
come
to
an
erring
man
but
before
god
i
repeat
to
you
i
am
innocent
of
my
fathers
blood
for
the
last
time
i
repeat
it
wasnt
i
killed
him
i
was
erring
but
i
loved
what
is
good
every
instant
i
strove
to
reform
but
i
lived
like
a
wild
beast
i
thank
the
prosecutor
he
told
me
many
things
about
myself
that
i
did
not
know
but
its
not
true
that
i
killed
my
father
the
prosecutor
is
mistaken
i
thank
my
counsel
too
i
cried
listening
to
him
but
its
not
true
that
i
killed
my
father
and
he
neednt
have
supposed
it
and
dont
believe
the
doctors
i
am
perfectly
sane
only
my
heart
is
heavy
if
you
spare
me
if
you
let
me
go
i
will
pray
for
you
i
will
be
a
better
man
i
give
you
my
word
before
god
i
will
and
if
you
will
condemn
me
ill
break
my
sword
over
my
head
myself
and
kiss
the
pieces
but
spare
me
do
not
rob
me
of
my
god
i
know
myself
i
shall
rebel
my
heart
is
heavy
gentlemen

spare
me
he
almost
fell
back
in
his
place
his
voice
broke
he
could
hardly
articulate
the
last
phrase
then
the
judges
proceeded
to
put
the
questions
and
began
to
ask
both
sides
to
formulate
their
conclusions
but
i
will
not
describe
the
details
at
last
the
jury
rose
to
retire
for
consultation
the
president
was
very
tired
and
so
his
last
charge
to
the
jury
was
rather
feeble
be
impartial
dont
be
influenced
by
the
eloquence
of
the
defense
but
yet
weigh
the
arguments
remember
that
there
is
a
great
responsibility
laid
upon
you
and
so
on
and
so
on
the
jury
withdrew
and
the
court
adjourned
people
could
get
up
move
about
exchange
their
accumulated
impressions
refresh
themselves
at
the
buffet
it
was
very
late
almost
one
oclock
in
the
night
but
nobody
went
away
the
strain
was
so
great
that
no
one
could
think
of
repose
all
waited
with
sinking
hearts
though
that
is
perhaps
too
much
to
say
for
the
ladies
were
only
in
a
state
of
hysterical
impatience
and
their
hearts
were
untroubled
an
acquittal
they
thought
was
inevitable
they
all
prepared
themselves
for
a
dramatic
moment
of
general
enthusiasm
i
must
own
there
were
many
among
the
men
too
who
were
convinced
that
an
acquittal
was
inevitable
some
were
pleased
others
frowned
while
some
were
simply
dejected
not
wanting
him
to
be
acquitted
fetyukovitch
himself
was
confident
of
his
success
he
was
surrounded
by
people
congratulating
him
and
fawning
upon
him
there
are
he
said
to
one
group
as
i
was
told
afterwards
there
are
invisible
threads
binding
the
counsel
for
the
defense
with
the
jury
one
feels
during
ones
speech
if
they
are
being
formed
i
was
aware
of
them
they
exist
our
cause
is
won
set
your
mind
at
rest
what
will
our
peasants
say
now
said
one
stout
crosslooking
pock
marked
gentleman
a
landowner
of
the
neighborhood
approaching
a
group
of
gentlemen
engaged
in
conversation
but
they
are
not
all
peasants
there
are
four
government
clerks
among
them
yes
there
are
clerks
said
a
member
of
the
district
council
joining
the
group
and
do
you
know
that
nazaryev
the
merchant
with
the
medal
a
juryman
what
of
him
he
is
a
man
with
brains
but
he
never
speaks
he
is
no
great
talker
but
so
much
the
better
theres
no
need
for
the
petersburg
man
to
teach
him
he
could
teach
all
petersburg
himself
hes
the
father
of
twelve
children
think
of
that
upon
my
word
you
dont
suppose
they
wont
acquit
him
one
of
our
young
officials
exclaimed
in
another
group
theyll
acquit
him
for
certain
said
a
resolute
voice
it
would
be
shameful
disgraceful
not
to
acquit
him
cried
the
official
suppose
he
did
murder
himthere
are
fathers
and
fathers
and
besides
he
was
in
such
a
frenzy
he
really
may
have
done
nothing
but
swing
the
pestle
in
the
air
and
so
knocked
the
old
man
down
but
it
was
a
pity
they
dragged
the
valet
in
that
was
simply
an
absurd
theory
if
id
been
in
fetyukovitchs
place
i
should
simply
have
said
straight
out
he
murdered
him
but
he
is
not
guilty
hang
it
all

thats
what
he
did
only
without
saying
hang
it
all

no
mihail
semyonovitch
he
almost
said
that
too
put
in
a
third
voice
why
gentlemen
in
lent
an
actress
was
acquitted
in
our
town
who
had
cut
the
throat
of
her
lovers
lawful
wife
oh
but
she
did
not
finish
cutting
it
that
makes
no
difference
she
began
cutting
it
what
did
you
think
of
what
he
said
about
children
splendid
wasnt
it
splendid
and
about
mysticism
too
oh
drop
mysticism
do
cried
some
one
else
think
of
ippolit
and
his
fate
from
this
day
forth
his
wife
will
scratch
his
eyes
out
tomorrow
for
mityas
sake
is
she
here
what
an
idea
if
shed
been
here
shed
have
scratched
them
out
in
court
she
is
at
home
with
toothache
he
he
he
he
he
he
in
a
third
group
i
dare
say
they
will
acquit
mitenka
after
all
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
turns
the
metropolis
upside
down
to
morrow
he
will
be
drinking
for
ten
days
oh
the
devil
the
devils
bound
to
have
a
hand
in
it
where
should
he
be
if
not
here
well
gentlemen
i
admit
it
was
eloquent
but
still
its
not
the
thing
to
break
your
fathers
head
with
a
pestle
or
what
are
we
coming
to
the
chariot
do
you
remember
the
chariot
yes
he
turned
a
cart
into
a
chariot
and
tomorrow
he
will
turn
a
chariot
into
a
cart
just
to
suit
his
purpose
what
cunning
chaps
there
are
nowadays
is
there
any
justice
to
be
had
in
russia
but
the
bell
rang
the
jury
deliberated
for
exactly
an
hour
neither
more
nor
less
a
profound
silence
reigned
in
the
court
as
soon
as
the
public
had
taken
their
seats
i
remember
how
the
jurymen
walked
into
the
court
at
last
i
wont
repeat
the
questions
in
order
and
indeed
i
have
forgotten
them
i
remember
only
the
answer
to
the
presidents
first
and
chief
question
did
the
prisoner
commit
the
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
and
with
premeditation
i
dont
remember
the
exact
words
there
was
a
complete
hush
the
foreman
of
the
jury
the
youngest
of
the
clerks
pronounced
in
a
clear
loud
voice
amidst
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
court
yes
guilty
and
the
same
answer
was
repeated
to
every
question
yes
guilty
and
without
the
slightest
extenuating
comment
this
no
one
had
expected
almost
every
one
had
reckoned
upon
a
recommendation
to
mercy
at
least
the
deathlike
silence
in
the
court
was
not
brokenall
seemed
petrified
those
who
desired
his
conviction
as
well
as
those
who
had
been
eager
for
his
acquittal
but
that
was
only
for
the
first
instant
and
it
was
followed
by
a
fearful
hubbub
many
of
the
men
in
the
audience
were
pleased
some
were
rubbing
their
hands
with
no
attempt
to
conceal
their
joy
those
who
disagreed
with
the
verdict
seemed
crushed
shrugged
their
shoulders
whispered
but
still
seemed
unable
to
realize
this
but
how
shall
i
describe
the
state
the
ladies
were
in
i
thought
they
would
create
a
riot
at
first
they
could
scarcely
believe
their
ears
then
suddenly
the
whole
court
rang
with
exclamations
whats
the
meaning
of
it
what
next
they
leapt
up
from
their
places
they
seemed
to
fancy
that
it
might
be
at
once
reconsidered
and
reversed
at
that
instant
mitya
suddenly
stood
up
and
cried
in
a
heartrending
voice
stretching
his
hands
out
before
him
i
swear
by
god
and
the
dreadful
day
of
judgment
i
am
not
guilty
of
my
fathers
blood
katya
i
forgive
you
brothers
friends
have
pity
on
the
other
woman
he
could
not
go
on
and
broke
into
a
terrible
sobbing
wail
that
was
heard
all
over
the
court
in
a
strange
unnatural
voice
unlike
his
own
from
the
farthest
corner
at
the
back
of
the
gallery
came
a
piercing
shriekit
was
grushenka
she
had
succeeded
in
begging
admittance
to
the
court
again
before
the
beginning
of
the
lawyers
speeches
mitya
was
taken
away
the
passing
of
the
sentence
was
deferred
till
next
day
the
whole
court
was
in
a
hubbub
but
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
i
only
remember
a
few
exclamations
i
heard
on
the
steps
as
i
went
out
hell
have
a
twenty
years
trip
to
the
mines
not
less
well
our
peasants
have
stood
firm
and
have
done
for
our
mitya
epilogue
chapter
i
plans
for
mityas
escape
very
early
at
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
five
days
after
the
trial
alyosha
went
to
katerina
ivanovnas
to
talk
over
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
both
of
them
and
to
give
her
a
message
she
sat
and
talked
to
him
in
the
very
room
in
which
she
had
once
received
grushenka
in
the
next
room
ivan
fyodorovitch
lay
unconscious
in
a
high
fever
katerina
ivanovna
had
immediately
after
the
scene
at
the
trial
ordered
the
sick
and
unconscious
man
to
be
carried
to
her
house
disregarding
the
inevitable
gossip
and
general
disapproval
of
the
public
one
of
the
two
relations
who
lived
with
her
had
departed
to
moscow
immediately
after
the
scene
in
court
the
other
remained
but
if
both
had
gone
away
katerina
ivanovna
would
have
adhered
to
her
resolution
and
would
have
gone
on
nursing
the
sick
man
and
sitting
by
him
day
and
night
varvinsky
and
herzenstube
were
attending
him
the
famous
doctor
had
gone
back
to
moscow
refusing
to
give
an
opinion
as
to
the
probable
end
of
the
illness
though
the
doctors
encouraged
katerina
ivanovna
and
alyosha
it
was
evident
that
they
could
not
yet
give
them
positive
hopes
of
recovery
alyosha
came
to
see
his
sick
brother
twice
a
day
but
this
time
he
had
specially
urgent
business
and
he
foresaw
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
approach
the
subject
yet
he
was
in
great
haste
he
had
another
engagement
that
could
not
be
put
off
for
that
same
morning
and
there
was
need
of
haste
they
had
been
talking
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
katerina
ivanovna
was
pale
and
terribly
fatigued
yet
at
the
same
time
in
a
state
of
hysterical
excitement
she
had
a
presentiment
of
the
reason
why
alyosha
had
come
to
her
dont
worry
about
his
decision
she
said
with
confident
emphasis
to
alyosha
one
way
or
another
he
is
bound
to
come
to
it
he
must
escape
that
unhappy
man
that
hero
of
honor
and
principlenot
he
not
dmitri
fyodorovitch
but
the
man
lying
the
other
side
of
that
door
who
has
sacrificed
himself
for
his
brother
katya
added
with
flashing
eyestold
me
the
whole
plan
of
escape
long
ago
you
know
he
has
already
entered
into
negotiations
ive
told
you
something
already
you
see
it
will
probably
come
off
at
the
third
tape
from
here
when
the
party
of
prisoners
is
being
taken
to
siberia
oh
its
a
long
way
off
yet
ivan
fyodorovitch
has
already
visited
the
superintendent
of
the
third
tape
but
we
dont
know
yet
who
will
be
in
charge
of
the
party
and
its
impossible
to
find
that
out
so
long
beforehand
tomorrow
perhaps
i
will
show
you
in
detail
the
whole
plan
which
ivan
fyodorovitch
left
me
on
the
eve
of
the
trial
in
case
of
need
that
was
whendo
you
rememberyou
found
us
quarreling
he
had
just
gone
downstairs
but
seeing
you
i
made
him
come
back
do
you
remember
do
you
know
what
we
were
quarreling
about
then
no
i
dont
said
alyosha
of
course
he
did
not
tell
you
it
was
about
that
plan
of
escape
he
had
told
me
the
main
idea
three
days
before
and
we
began
quarreling
about
it
at
once
and
quarreled
for
three
days
we
quarreled
because
when
he
told
me
that
if
dmitri
fyodorovitch
were
convicted
he
would
escape
abroad
with
that
creature
i
felt
furious
at
oncei
cant
tell
you
why
i
dont
know
myself
why
oh
of
course
i
was
furious
then
about
that
creature
and
that
she
too
should
go
abroad
with
dmitri
katerina
ivanovna
exclaimed
suddenly
her
lips
quivering
with
anger
as
soon
as
ivan
fyodorovitch
saw
that
i
was
furious
about
that
woman
he
instantly
imagined
i
was
jealous
of
dmitri
and
that
i
still
loved
dmitri
that
is
how
our
first
quarrel
began
i
would
not
give
an
explanation
i
could
not
ask
forgiveness
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
such
a
man
could
suspect
me
of
still
loving
that

and
when
i
myself
had
told
him
long
before
that
i
did
not
love
dmitri
that
i
loved
no
one
but
him
it
was
only
resentment
against
that
creature
that
made
me
angry
with
him
three
days
later
on
the
evening
you
came
he
brought
me
a
sealed
envelope
which
i
was
to
open
at
once
if
anything
happened
to
him
oh
he
foresaw
his
illness
he
told
me
that
the
envelope
contained
the
details
of
the
escape
and
that
if
he
died
or
was
taken
dangerously
ill
i
was
to
save
mitya
alone
then
he
left
me
money
nearly
ten
thousandthose
notes
to
which
the
prosecutor
referred
in
his
speech
having
learnt
from
some
one
that
he
had
sent
them
to
be
changed
i
was
tremendously
impressed
to
find
that
ivan
fyodorovitch
had
not
given
up
his
idea
of
saving
his
brother
and
was
confiding
this
plan
of
escape
to
me
though
he
was
still
jealous
of
me
and
still
convinced
that
i
loved
mitya
oh
that
was
a
sacrifice
no
you
cannot
understand
the
greatness
of
such
selfsacrifice
alexey
fyodorovitch
i
wanted
to
fall
at
his
feet
in
reverence
but
i
thought
at
once
that
he
would
take
it
only
for
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
mityas
being
saved
and
he
certainly
would
have
imagined
that
and
i
was
so
exasperated
at
the
mere
possibility
of
such
an
unjust
thought
on
his
part
that
i
lost
my
temper
again
and
instead
of
kissing
his
feet
flew
into
a
fury
again
oh
i
am
unhappy
its
my
character
my
awful
unhappy
character
oh
you
will
see
i
shall
end
by
driving
him
too
to
abandon
me
for
another
with
whom
he
can
get
on
better
like
dmitri
but

no
i
could
not
bear
it
i
should
kill
myself
and
when
you
came
in
then
and
when
i
called
to
you
and
told
him
to
come
back
i
was
so
enraged
by
the
look
of
contempt
and
hatred
he
turned
on
me
thatdo
you
rememberi
cried
out
to
you
that
it
was
he
he
alone
who
had
persuaded
me
that
his
brother
dmitri
was
a
murderer
i
said
that
malicious
thing
on
purpose
to
wound
him
again
he
had
never
never
persuaded
me
that
his
brother
was
a
murderer
on
the
contrary
it
was
i
who
persuaded
him
oh
my
vile
temper
was
the
cause
of
everything
i
paved
the
way
to
that
hideous
scene
at
the
trial
he
wanted
to
show
me
that
he
was
an
honorable
man
and
that
even
if
i
loved
his
brother
he
would
not
ruin
him
for
revenge
or
jealousy
so
he
came
to
the
court

i
am
the
cause
of
it
all
i
alone
am
to
blame
katya
never
had
made
such
confessions
to
alyosha
before
and
he
felt
that
she
was
now
at
that
stage
of
unbearable
suffering
when
even
the
proudest
heart
painfully
crushes
its
pride
and
falls
vanquished
by
grief
oh
alyosha
knew
another
terrible
reason
of
her
present
misery
though
she
had
carefully
concealed
it
from
him
during
those
days
since
the
trial
but
it
would
have
been
for
some
reason
too
painful
to
him
if
she
had
been
brought
so
low
as
to
speak
to
him
now
about
that
she
was
suffering
for
her
treachery
at
the
trial
and
alyosha
felt
that
her
conscience
was
impelling
her
to
confess
it
to
him
to
him
alyosha
with
tears
and
cries
and
hysterical
writhings
on
the
floor
but
he
dreaded
that
moment
and
longed
to
spare
her
it
made
the
commission
on
which
he
had
come
even
more
difficult
he
spoke
of
mitya
again
its
all
right
its
all
right
dont
be
anxious
about
him
she
began
again
sharply
and
stubbornly
all
that
is
only
momentary
i
know
him
i
know
his
heart
only
too
well
you
may
be
sure
he
will
consent
to
escape
its
not
as
though
it
would
be
immediately
he
will
have
time
to
make
up
his
mind
to
it
ivan
fyodorovitch
will
be
well
by
that
time
and
will
manage
it
all
himself
so
that
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
dont
be
anxious
he
will
consent
to
run
away
he
has
agreed
already
do
you
suppose
he
would
give
up
that
creature
and
they
wont
let
her
go
to
him
so
he
is
bound
to
escape
its
you
hes
most
afraid
of
he
is
afraid
you
wont
approve
of
his
escape
on
moral
grounds
but
you
must
generously
allow
it
if
your
sanction
is
so
necessary
katya
added
viciously
she
paused
and
smiled
he
talks
about
some
hymn
she
went
on
again
some
cross
he
has
to
bear
some
duty
i
remember
ivan
fyodorovitch
told
me
a
great
deal
about
it
and
if
you
knew
how
he
talked
katya
cried
suddenly
with
feeling
she
could
not
repress
if
you
knew
how
he
loved
that
wretched
man
at
the
moment
he
told
me
and
how
he
hated
him
perhaps
at
the
same
moment
and
i
heard
his
story
and
his
tears
with
sneering
disdain
brute
yes
i
am
a
brute
i
am
responsible
for
his
fever
but
that
man
in
prison
is
incapable
of
suffering
katya
concluded
irritably
can
such
a
man
suffer
men
like
him
never
suffer
there
was
a
note
of
hatred
and
contemptuous
repulsion
in
her
words
and
yet
it
was
she
who
had
betrayed
him
perhaps
because
she
feels
how
shes
wronged
him
she
hates
him
at
moments
alyosha
thought
to
himself
he
hoped
that
it
was
only
at
moments
in
katyas
last
words
he
detected
a
challenging
note
but
he
did
not
take
it
up
i
sent
for
you
this
morning
to
make
you
promise
to
persuade
him
yourself
or
do
you
too
consider
that
to
escape
would
be
dishonorable
cowardly
or
something

unchristian
perhaps
katya
added
even
more
defiantly
oh
no
ill
tell
him
everything
muttered
alyosha
he
asks
you
to
come
and
see
him
today
he
blurted
out
suddenly
looking
her
steadily
in
the
face
she
started
and
drew
back
a
little
from
him
on
the
sofa
me
can
that
be
she
faltered
turning
pale
it
can
and
ought
to
be
alyosha
began
emphatically
growing
more
animated
he
needs
you
particularly
just
now
i
would
not
have
opened
the
subject
and
worried
you
if
it
were
not
necessary
he
is
ill
he
is
beside
himself
he
keeps
asking
for
you
it
is
not
to
be
reconciled
with
you
that
he
wants
you
but
only
that
you
would
go
and
show
yourself
at
his
door
so
much
has
happened
to
him
since
that
day
he
realizes
that
he
has
injured
you
beyond
all
reckoning
he
does
not
ask
your
forgivenessits
impossible
to
forgive
me
he
says
himselfbut
only
that
you
would
show
yourself
in
his
doorway
its
so
sudden
faltered
katya
ive
had
a
presentiment
all
these
days
that
you
would
come
with
that
message
i
knew
he
would
ask
me
to
come
its
impossible
let
it
be
impossible
but
do
it
only
think
he
realizes
for
the
first
time
how
he
has
wounded
you
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
never
grasped
it
before
so
fully
he
said
if
she
refuses
to
come
i
shall
be
unhappy
all
my
life
do
you
hear
though
he
is
condemned
to
penal
servitude
for
twenty
years
he
is
still
planning
to
be
happyis
not
that
piteous
thinkyou
must
visit
him
though
he
is
ruined
he
is
innocent
broke
like
a
challenge
from
alyosha
his
hands
are
clean
there
is
no
blood
on
them
for
the
sake
of
his
infinite
sufferings
in
the
future
visit
him
now
go
greet
him
on
his
way
into
the
darknessstand
at
his
door
that
is
all
you
ought
to
do
it
you
ought
to
alyosha
concluded
laying
immense
stress
on
the
word
ought
i
ought
to

but
i
cannot
katya
moaned
he
will
look
at
me
i
cant
your
eyes
ought
to
meet
how
will
you
live
all
your
life
if
you
dont
make
up
your
mind
to
do
it
now
better
suffer
all
my
life
you
ought
to
go
you
ought
to
go
alyosha
repeated
with
merciless
emphasis
but
why
today
why
at
once
i
cant
leave
our
patient
you
can
for
a
moment
it
will
only
be
a
moment
if
you
dont
come
he
will
be
in
delirium
by
tonight
i
would
not
tell
you
a
lie
have
pity
on
him
have
pity
on
me
katya
said
with
bitter
reproach
and
she
burst
into
tears
then
you
will
come
said
alyosha
firmly
seeing
her
tears
ill
go
and
tell
him
you
will
come
directly
no
dont
tell
him
so
on
any
account
cried
katya
in
alarm
i
will
come
but
dont
tell
him
beforehand
for
perhaps
i
may
go
but
not
go
in
i
dont
know
yet
her
voice
failed
her
she
gasped
for
breath
alyosha
got
up
to
go
and
what
if
i
meet
any
one
she
said
suddenly
in
a
low
voice
turning
white
again
thats
just
why
you
must
go
now
to
avoid
meeting
any
one
there
will
be
no
one
there
i
can
tell
you
that
for
certain
we
will
expect
you
he
concluded
emphatically
and
went
out
of
the
room
chapter
ii
for
a
moment
the
lie
becomes
truth
he
hurried
to
the
hospital
where
mitya
was
lying
now
the
day
after
his
fate
was
determined
mitya
had
fallen
ill
with
nervous
fever
and
was
sent
to
the
prison
division
of
the
town
hospital
but
at
the
request
of
several
persons
alyosha
madame
hohlakov
lise
etc
doctor
varvinsky
had
put
mitya
not
with
other
prisoners
but
in
a
separate
little
room
the
one
where
smerdyakov
had
been
it
is
true
that
there
was
a
sentinel
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
and
there
was
a
grating
over
the
window
so
that
varvinsky
could
be
at
ease
about
the
indulgence
he
had
shown
which
was
not
quite
legal
indeed
but
he
was
a
kindhearted
and
compassionate
young
man
he
knew
how
hard
it
would
be
for
a
man
like
mitya
to
pass
at
once
so
suddenly
into
the
society
of
robbers
and
murderers
and
that
he
must
get
used
to
it
by
degrees
the
visits
of
relations
and
friends
were
informally
sanctioned
by
the
doctor
and
overseer
and
even
by
the
police
captain
but
only
alyosha
and
grushenka
had
visited
mitya
rakitin
had
tried
to
force
his
way
in
twice
but
mitya
persistently
begged
varvinsky
not
to
admit
him
alyosha
found
him
sitting
on
his
bed
in
a
hospital
dressinggown
rather
feverish
with
a
towel
soaked
in
vinegar
and
water
on
his
head
he
looked
at
alyosha
as
he
came
in
with
an
undefined
expression
but
there
was
a
shade
of
something
like
dread
discernible
in
it
he
had
become
terribly
preoccupied
since
the
trial
sometimes
he
would
be
silent
for
half
an
hour
together
and
seemed
to
be
pondering
something
heavily
and
painfully
oblivious
of
everything
about
him
if
he
roused
himself
from
his
brooding
and
began
to
talk
he
always
spoke
with
a
kind
of
abruptness
and
never
of
what
he
really
wanted
to
say
he
looked
sometimes
with
a
face
of
suffering
at
his
brother
he
seemed
to
be
more
at
ease
with
grushenka
than
with
alyosha
it
is
true
he
scarcely
spoke
to
her
at
all
but
as
soon
as
she
came
in
his
whole
face
lighted
up
with
joy
alyosha
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
bed
in
silence
this
time
mitya
was
waiting
for
alyosha
in
suspense
but
he
did
not
dare
ask
him
a
question
he
felt
it
almost
unthinkable
that
katya
would
consent
to
come
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
if
she
did
not
come
something
inconceivable
would
happen
alyosha
understood
his
feelings

mitya
began
nervously
has
pulled
his
whole
inn
to
pieces
i
am
told
hes
taken
up
the
flooring
pulled
apart
the
planks
split
up
all
the
gallery
i
am
told
he
is
seeking
treasure
all
the
timethe
fifteen
hundred
roubles
which
the
prosecutor
said
id
hidden
there
he
began
playing
these
tricks
they
say
as
soon
as
he
got
home
serve
him
right
the
swindler
the
guard
here
told
me
yesterday
he
comes
from
there
listen
began
alyosha
she
will
come
but
i
dont
know
when
perhaps
today
perhaps
in
a
few
days
that
i
cant
tell
but
she
will
come
she
will
thats
certain
mitya
started
would
have
said
something
but
was
silent
the
news
had
a
tremendous
effect
on
him
it
was
evident
that
he
would
have
liked
terribly
to
know
what
had
been
said
but
he
was
again
afraid
to
ask
something
cruel
and
contemptuous
from
katya
would
have
cut
him
like
a
knife
at
that
moment
this
was
what
she
said
among
other
things
that
i
must
be
sure
to
set
your
conscience
at
rest
about
escaping
if
ivan
is
not
well
by
then
she
will
see
to
it
all
herself
youve
spoken
of
that
already
mitya
observed
musingly
and
you
have
repeated
it
to
grusha
observed
alyosha
yes
mitya
admitted
she
wont
come
this
morning
he
looked
timidly
at
his
brother
she
wont
come
till
the
evening
when
i
told
her
yesterday
that
katya
was
taking
measures
she
was
silent
but
she
set
her
mouth
she
only
whispered
let
her
she
understood
that
it
was
important
i
did
not
dare
to
try
her
further
she
understands
now
i
think
that
katya
no
longer
cares
for
me
but
loves
ivan
does
she
broke
from
alyosha
perhaps
she
does
not
only
she
is
not
coming
this
morning
mitya
hastened
to
explain
again
i
asked
her
to
do
something
for
me
you
know
ivan
is
superior
to
all
of
us
he
ought
to
live
not
us
he
will
recover
would
you
believe
it
though
katya
is
alarmed
about
him
she
scarcely
doubts
of
his
recovery
said
alyosha
that
means
that
she
is
convinced
he
will
die
its
because
she
is
frightened
shes
so
sure
he
will
get
well
ivan
has
a
strong
constitution
and
i
too
believe
theres
every
hope
that
he
will
get
well
alyosha
observed
anxiously
yes
he
will
get
well
but
she
is
convinced
that
he
will
die
she
has
a
great
deal
of
sorrow
to
bear
a
silence
followed
a
grave
anxiety
was
fretting
mitya
alyosha
i
love
grusha
terribly
he
said
suddenly
in
a
shaking
voice
full
of
tears
they
wont
let
her
go
out
there
to
you
alyosha
put
in
at
once
and
there
is
something
else
i
wanted
to
tell
you
mitya
went
on
with
a
sudden
ring
in
his
voice
if
they
beat
me
on
the
way
or
out
there
i
wont
submit
to
it
i
shall
kill
some
one
and
shall
be
shot
for
it
and
this
will
be
going
on
for
twenty
years
they
speak
to
me
rudely
as
it
is
ive
been
lying
here
all
night
passing
judgment
on
myself
i
am
not
ready
i
am
not
able
to
resign
myself
i
wanted
to
sing
a
hymn
but
if
a
guard
speaks
rudely
to
me
i
have
not
the
strength
to
bear
it
for
grusha
i
would
bear
anything

anything
except
blows
but
she
wont
be
allowed
to
come
there
alyosha
smiled
gently
listen
brother
once
for
all
he
said
this
is
what
i
think
about
it
and
you
know
that
i
would
not
tell
you
a
lie
listen
you
are
not
ready
and
such
a
cross
is
not
for
you
whats
more
you
dont
need
such
a
martyrs
cross
when
you
are
not
ready
for
it
if
you
had
murdered
our
father
it
would
grieve
me
that
you
should
reject
your
punishment
but
you
are
innocent
and
such
a
cross
is
too
much
for
you
you
wanted
to
make
yourself
another
man
by
suffering
i
say
only
remember
that
other
man
always
all
your
life
and
wherever
you
go
and
that
will
be
enough
for
you
your
refusal
of
that
great
cross
will
only
serve
to
make
you
feel
all
your
life
an
even
greater
duty
and
that
constant
feeling
will
do
more
to
make
you
a
new
man
perhaps
than
if
you
went
there
for
there
you
would
not
endure
it
and
would
repine
and
perhaps
at
last
would
say
i
am
quits
the
lawyer
was
right
about
that
such
heavy
burdens
are
not
for
all
men
for
some
they
are
impossible
these
are
my
thoughts
about
it
if
you
want
them
so
much
if
other
men
would
have
to
answer
for
your
escape
officers
or
soldiers
then
i
would
not
have
allowed
you
smiled
alyosha
but
they
declarethe
superintendent
of
that
tape
told
ivan
himselfthat
if
its
well
managed
there
will
be
no
great
inquiry
and
that
they
can
get
off
easily
of
course
bribing
is
dishonest
even
in
such
a
case
but
i
cant
undertake
to
judge
about
it
because
if
ivan
and
katya
commissioned
me
to
act
for
you
i
know
i
should
go
and
give
bribes
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
and
so
i
cant
judge
of
your
own
action
but
let
me
assure
you
that
i
shall
never
condemn
you
and
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
if
i
could
judge
you
in
this
now
i
think
ive
gone
into
everything
but
i
do
condemn
myself
cried
mitya
i
shall
escape
that
was
settled
apart
from
you
could
mitya
karamazov
do
anything
but
run
away
but
i
shall
condemn
myself
and
i
will
pray
for
my
sin
for
ever
thats
how
the
jesuits
talk
isnt
it
just
as
we
are
doing
yes
alyosha
smiled
gently
i
love
you
for
always
telling
the
whole
truth
and
never
hiding
anything
cried
mitya
with
a
joyful
laugh
so
ive
caught
my
alyosha
being
jesuitical
i
must
kiss
you
for
that
now
listen
to
the
rest
ill
open
the
other
side
of
my
heart
to
you
this
is
what
i
planned
and
decided
if
i
run
away
even
with
money
and
a
passport
and
even
to
america
i
should
be
cheered
up
by
the
thought
that
i
am
not
running
away
for
pleasure
not
for
happiness
but
to
another
exile
as
bad
perhaps
as
siberia
it
is
as
bad
alyosha
it
is
i
hate
that
america
damn
it
already
even
though
grusha
will
be
with
me
just
look
at
her
is
she
an
american
she
is
russian
russian
to
the
marrow
of
her
bones
she
will
be
homesick
for
the
mother
country
and
i
shall
see
every
hour
that
she
is
suffering
for
my
sake
that
she
has
taken
up
that
cross
for
me
and
what
harm
has
she
done
and
how
shall
i
too
put
up
with
the
rabble
out
there
though
they
may
be
better
than
i
every
one
of
them
i
hate
that
america
already
and
though
they
may
be
wonderful
at
machinery
every
one
of
them
damn
them
they
are
not
of
my
soul
i
love
russia
alyosha
i
love
the
russian
god
though
i
am
a
scoundrel
myself
i
shall
choke
there
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
suddenly
flashing
his
voice
was
trembling
with
tears
so
this
is
what
ive
decided
alyosha
listen
he
began
again
mastering
his
emotion
as
soon
as
i
arrive
there
with
grusha
we
will
set
to
work
at
once
on
the
land
in
solitude
somewhere
very
remote
with
wild
bears
there
must
be
some
remote
parts
even
there
i
am
told
there
are
still
redskins
there
somewhere
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
so
to
the
country
of
the
last
of
the
mohicans
and
there
well
tackle
the
grammar
at
once
grusha
and
i
work
and
grammarthats
how
well
spend
three
years
and
by
that
time
we
shall
speak
english
like
any
englishman
and
as
soon
as
weve
learnt
itgoodby
to
america
well
run
here
to
russia
as
american
citizens
dont
be
uneasywe
would
not
come
to
this
little
town
wed
hide
somewhere
a
long
way
off
in
the
north
or
in
the
south
i
shall
be
changed
by
that
time
and
she
will
too
in
america
the
doctors
shall
make
me
some
sort
of
wart
on
my
facewhats
the
use
of
their
being
so
mechanicalor
else
ill
put
out
one
eye

my
beard
grow
a
yard
and
i
shall
turn
gray
fretting
for
russia
i
dare
say
they
wont
recognize
us
and
if
they
do
let
them
send
us

siberia
i
dont

show
its
our
fate

somewhere
in
the
wilds
and
ill
make
up
as
an
american
all
my
life
but
we
shall
die
on
our
own
soil
thats
my
plan
and
it
shant
be
altered
do
you
approve
yes
said
alyosha
not
wanting
to
contradict
him
mitya
paused
for
a
minute
and
said
suddenly
and
how
they
worked
it
up
at
the
trial
didnt
they
work
it
up
if
they
had
not
you
would
have
been
convicted
just
the
same
said
alyosha
with
a
sigh
yes
people
are
sick
of
me
here
god
bless
them
but
its
hard
mitya
moaned
miserably
again
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
alyosha
put
me
out
of
my
misery
at
once
he
exclaimed
suddenly
tell
me
is
she
coming
now
or
not
tell
me
what
did
she
say
how
did
she
say
it
she
said
she
would
come
but
i
dont
know
whether
she
will
come
today
its
hard
for
her
you
know
alyosha
looked
timidly
at
his
brother
i
should
think
it
is
hard
for
her
alyosha
it
will
drive
me
out
of
my
mind
grusha
keeps
looking
at
me
she
understands
my
god
calm
my
heart
what
is
it
i
want
i
want
katya
do
i
understand
what
i
want
its
the
headstrong
evil
karamazov
spirit
no
i
am
not
fit
for
suffering
i
am
a
scoundrel
thats
all
one
can
say
here
she
is
cried
alyosha
at
that
instant
katya
appeared
in
the
doorway
for
a
moment
she
stood
still
gazing
at
mitya
with
a
dazed
expression
he
leapt
impulsively
to
his
feet
and
a
scared
look
came
into
his
face
he
turned
pale
but
a
timid
pleading
smile
appeared
on
his
lips
at
once
and
with
an
irresistible
impulse
he
held
out
both
hands
to
katya
seeing
it
she
flew
impetuously
to
him
she
seized
him
by
the
hands
and
almost
by
force
made
him
sit
down
on
the
bed
she
sat
down
beside
him
and
still
keeping
his
hands
pressed
them
violently
several
times
they
both
strove
to
speak
but
stopped
short
and
again
gazed
speechless
with
a
strange
smile
their
eyes
fastened
on
one
another
so
passed
two
minutes
have
you
forgiven
me
mitya
faltered
at
last
and
at
the
same
moment
turning
to
alyosha
his
face
working
with
joy
he
cried
do
you
hear
what
i
am
asking
do
you
hear
thats
what
i
loved
you
for
that
you
are
generous
at
heart
broke
from
katya
my
forgiveness
is
no
good
to
you
nor
yours
to
me
whether
you
forgive
me
or
not
you
will
always
be
a
sore
place
in
my
heart
and
i
in
yoursso
it
must
be
she
stopped
to
take
breath
what
have
i
come
for
she
began
again
with
nervous
haste
to
embrace
your
feet
to
press
your
hands
like
this
till
it
hurtsyou
remember
how
in
moscow
i
used
to
squeeze
themto
tell
you
again
that
you
are
my
god
my
joy
to
tell
you
that
i
love
you
madly
she
moaned
in
anguish
and
suddenly
pressed
his
hand
greedily
to
her
lips
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
alyosha
stood
speechless
and
confounded
he
had
never
expected
what
he
was
seeing
love
is
over
mitya
katya
began
again
but
the
past
is
painfully
dear
to
me
know
that
you
will
always
be
so
but
now
let
what
might
have
been
come
true
for
one
minute
she
faltered
with
a
drawn
smile
looking
into
his
face
joyfully
again
you
love
another
woman
and
i
love
another
man
and
yet
i
shall
love
you
for
ever
and
you
will
love
me
do
you
know
that
do
you
hear
love
me
love
me
all
your
life
she
cried
with
a
quiver
almost
of
menace
in
her
voice
i
shall
love
you
and

do
you
know
katya
mitya
began
drawing
a
deep
breath
at
each
word
do
you
know
five
days
ago
that
same
evening
i
loved
you
when
you
fell
down
and
were
carried
out

all
my
life
so
it
will
be
so
it
will
always
be
so
they
murmured
to
one
another
frantic
words
almost
meaningless
perhaps
not
even
true
but
at
that
moment
it
was
all
true
and
they
both
believed
what
they
said
implicitly
katya
cried
mitya
suddenly
do
you
believe
i
murdered
him
i
know
you
dont
believe
it
now
but
then

when
you
gave
evidence
surely
surely
you
did
not
believe
it
i
did
not
believe
it
even
then
ive
never
believed
it
i
hated
you
and
for
a
moment
i
persuaded
myself
while
i
was
giving
evidence
i
persuaded
myself
and
believed
it
but
when
id
finished
speaking
i
left
off
believing
it
at
once
dont
doubt
that
i
have
forgotten
that
i
came
here
to
punish
myself
she
said
with
a
new
expression
in
her
voice
quite
unlike
the
loving
tones
of
a
moment
before
woman
yours
is
a
heavy
burden
broke
as
it
were
involuntarily
from
mitya
let
me
go
she
whispered
ill
come
again
its
more
than
i
can
bear
now
she
was
getting
up
from
her
place
but
suddenly
uttered
a
loud
scream
and
staggered
back
grushenka
walked
suddenly
and
noiselessly
into
the
room
no
one
had
expected
her
katya
moved
swiftly
to
the
door
but
when
she
reached
grushenka
she
stopped
suddenly
turned
as
white
as
chalk
and
moaned
softly
almost
in
a
whisper
forgive
me
grushenka
stared
at
her
and
pausing
for
an
instant
in
a
vindictive
venomous
voice
answered
we
are
full
of
hatred
my
girl
you
and
i
we
are
both
full
of
hatred
as
though
we
could
forgive
one
another
save
him
and
ill
worship
you
all
my
life
you
wont
forgive
her
cried
mitya
with
frantic
reproach
dont
be
anxious
ill
save
him
for
you
katya
whispered
rapidly
and
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
you
could
refuse
to
forgive
her
when
she
begged
your
forgiveness
herself
mitya
exclaimed
bitterly
again
mitya
dont
dare
to
blame
her
you
have
no
right
to
alyosha
cried
hotly
her
proud
lips
spoke
not
her
heart
grushenka
brought
out
in
a
tone
of
disgust
if
she
saves
you
ill
forgive
her
everything
she
stopped
speaking
as
though
suppressing
something
she
could
not
yet
recover
herself
she
had
come
in
as
appeared
afterwards
accidentally
with
no
suspicion
of
what
she
would
meet
alyosha
run
after
her
mitya
cried
to
his
brother
tell
her

i
dont
know

dont
let
her
go
away
like
this
ill
come
to
you
again
at
nightfall
said
alyosha
and
he
ran
after
katya
he
overtook
her
outside
the
hospital
grounds
she
was
walking
fast
but
as
soon
as
alyosha
caught
her
up
she
said
quickly
no
before
that
woman
i
cant
punish
myself
i
asked
her
forgiveness
because
i
wanted
to
punish
myself
to
the
bitter
end
she
would
not
forgive
me
i
like
her
for
that
she
added
in
an
unnatural
voice
and
her
eyes
flashed
with
fierce
resentment
my
brother
did
not
expect
this
in
the
least
muttered
alyosha
he
was
sure
she
would
not
come
no
doubt
let
us
leave
that
she
snapped

chapter
iii
ilushas
funeral
the
speech
at
the
stone
he
really
was
late
they
had
waited
for
him
and
had
already
decided
to
bear
the
pretty
flowerdecked
little
coffin
to
the
church
without
him
it
was
the
coffin
of
poor
little
ilusha
he
had
died
two
days
after
mitya
was
sentenced
at
the
gate
of
the
house
alyosha
was
met
by
the
shouts
of
the
boys
ilushas
schoolfellows
they
had
all
been
impatiently
expecting
him
and
were
glad
that
he
had
come
at
last
there
were
about
twelve
of
them
they
all
had
their
schoolbags
or
satchels
on
their
shoulders
father
will
cry
be
with
father
ilusha
had
told
them
as
he
lay
dying
and
the
boys
remembered
it
kolya
krassotkin
was
the
foremost
of
them
how
glad
i
am
youve
come
karamazov
he
cried
holding
out
his
hand
to
alyosha
its
awful
here
its
really
horrible
to
see
it
snegiryov
is
not
drunk
we
know
for
a
fact
hes
had
nothing
to
drink
today
but
he
seems
as
if
he
were
drunk

i
am
always
manly
but
this
is
awful
karamazov
if
i
am
not
keeping
you
one
question
before
you
go
in
what
is
it
kolya
said
alyosha
is
your
brother
innocent
or
guilty
was
it
he
killed
your
father
or
was
it
the
valet
as
you
say
so
it
will
be
i
havent
slept
for
the
last
four
nights
for
thinking
of
it
the
valet
killed
him
my
brother
is
innocent
answered
alyosha
thats
what
i
said
cried
smurov
so
he
will
perish
an
innocent
victim
exclaimed
kolya
though
he
is
ruined
he
is
happy
i
could
envy
him
what
do
you
mean
how
can
you
why
cried
alyosha
surprised
oh
if
i
too
could
sacrifice
myself
some
day
for
truth
said
kolya
with
enthusiasm
but
not
in
such
a
cause
not
with
such
disgrace
and
such
horror
said
alyosha
of
course

i
should
like
to
die
for
all
humanity
and
as
for
disgrace
i
dont
care
about
thatour
names
may
perish
i
respect
your
brother
and
so
do
i
the
boy
who
had
once
declared
that
he
knew
who
had
founded
troy
cried
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
and
he
blushed
up
to
his
ears
like
a
peony
as
he
had
done
on
that
occasion
alyosha
went
into
the
room
ilusha
lay
with
his
hands
folded
and
his
eyes
closed
in
a
blue
coffin
with
a
white
frill
round
it
his
thin
face
was
hardly
changed
at
all
and
strange
to
say
there
was
no
smell
of
decay
from
the
corpse
the
expression
of
his
face
was
serious
and
as
it
were
thoughtful
his
hands
crossed
over
his
breast
looked
particularly
beautiful
as
though
chiseled
in
marble
there
were
flowers
in
his
hands
and
the
coffin
inside
and
out
was
decked
with
flowers
which
had
been
sent
early
in
the
morning
by
lise
hohlakov
but
there
were
flowers
too
from
katerina
ivanovna
and
when
alyosha
opened
the
door
the
captain
had
a
bunch
in
his
trembling
hands
and
was
strewing
them
again
over
his
dear
boy
he
scarcely
glanced
at
alyosha
when
he
came
in
and
he
would
not
look
at
any
one
even
at
his
crazy
weeping
wife
mamma
who
kept
trying
to
stand
on
her
crippled
legs
to
get
a
nearer
look
at
her
dead
boy
nina
had
been
pushed
in
her
chair
by
the
boys
close
up
to
the
coffin
she
sat
with
her
head
pressed
to
it
and
she
too
was
no
doubt
quietly
weeping
snegiryovs
face
looked
eager
yet
bewildered
and
exasperated
there
was
something
crazy
about
his
gestures
and
the
words
that
broke
from
him
old
man
dear
old
man
he
exclaimed
every
minute
gazing
at
ilusha
it
was
his
habit
to
call
ilusha
old
man
as
a
term
of
affection
when
he
was
alive
father
give
me
a
flower
too
take
that
white
one
out
of
his
hand
and
give
it
me
the
crazy
mother
begged
whimpering
either
because
the
little
white
rose
in
ilushas
hand
had
caught
her
fancy
or
that
she
wanted
one
from
his
hand
to
keep
in
memory
of
him
she
moved
restlessly
stretching
out
her
hands
for
the
flower
i
wont
give
it
to
any
one
i
wont
give
you
anything
snegiryov
cried
callously
they
are
his
flowers
not
yours
everything
is
his
nothing
is
yours
father
give
mother
a
flower
said
nina
lifting
her
face
wet
with
tears
i
wont
give
away
anything
and
to
her
less
than
any
one
she
didnt
love
ilusha
she
took
away
his
little
cannon
and
he
gave
it
to
her
the
captain
broke
into
loud
sobs
at
the
thought
of
how
ilusha
had
given
up
his
cannon
to
his
mother
the
poor
crazy
creature
was
bathed
in
noiseless
tears
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
the
boys
seeing
that
the
father
would
not
leave
the
coffin
and
that
it
was
time
to
carry
it
out
stood
round
it
in
a
close
circle
and
began
to
lift
it
up
i
dont
want
him
to
be
buried
in
the
churchyard
snegiryov
wailed
suddenly
ill
bury
him
by
the
stone
by
our
stone
ilusha
told
me
to
i
wont
let
him
be
carried
out
he
had
been
saying
for
the
last
three
days
that
he
would
bury
him
by
the
stone
but
alyosha
krassotkin
the
landlady
her
sister
and
all
the
boys
interfered
what
an
idea
bury
him
by
an
unholy
stone
as
though
he
had
hanged
himself
the
old
landlady
said
sternly
there
in
the
churchyard
the
ground
has
been
crossed
hell
be
prayed
for
there
one
can
hear
the
singing
in
church
and
the
deacon
reads
so
plainly
and
verbally
that
it
will
reach
him
every
time
just
as
though
it
were
read
over
his
grave
at
last
the
captain
made
a
gesture
of
despair
as
though
to
say
take
him
where
you
will
the
boys
raised
the
coffin
but
as
they
passed
the
mother
they
stopped
for
a
moment
and
lowered
it
that
she
might
say
good
by
to
ilusha
but
on
seeing
that
precious
little
face
which
for
the
last
three
days
she
had
only
looked
at
from
a
distance
she
trembled
all
over
and
her
gray
head
began
twitching
spasmodically
over
the
coffin
mother
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
give
him
your
blessing
kiss
him
nina
cried
to
her
but
her
head
still
twitched
like
an
automaton
and
with
a
face
contorted
with
bitter
grief
she
began
without
a
word
beating
her
breast
with
her
fist
they
carried
the
coffin
past
her
nina
pressed
her
lips
to
her
brothers
for
the
last
time
as
they
bore
the
coffin
by
her
as
alyosha
went
out
of
the
house
he
begged
the
landlady
to
look
after
those
who
were
left
behind
but
she
interrupted
him
before
he
had
finished
to
be
sure
ill
stay
with
them
we
are
christians
too
the
old
woman
wept
as
she
said
it
they
had
not
far
to
carry
the
coffin
to
the
church
not
more
than
three
hundred
paces
it
was
a
still
clear
day
with
a
slight
frost
the
church
bells
were
still
ringing
snegiryov
ran
fussing
and
distracted
after
the
coffin
in
his
short
old
summer
overcoat
with
his
head
bare
and
his
soft
old
widebrimmed
hat
in
his
hand
he
seemed
in
a
state
of
bewildered
anxiety
at
one
minute
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
support
the
head
of
the
coffin
and
only
hindered
the
bearers
at
another
he
ran
alongside
and
tried
to
find
a
place
for
himself
there
a
flower
fell
on
the
snow
and
he
rushed
to
pick
it
up
as
though
everything
in
the
world
depended
on
the
loss
of
that
flower
and
the
crust
of
bread
weve
forgotten
the
crust
he
cried
suddenly
in
dismay
but
the
boys
reminded
him
at
once
that
he
had
taken
the
crust
of
bread
already
and
that
it
was
in
his
pocket
he
instantly
pulled
it
out
and
was
reassured
ilusha
told
me
to
ilusha
he
explained
at
once
to
alyosha
i
was
sitting
by
him
one
night
and
he
suddenly
told
me
father
when
my
grave
is
filled
up
crumble
a
piece
of
bread
on
it
so
that
the
sparrows
may
fly
down
i
shall
hear
and
it
will
cheer
me
up
not
to
be
lying
alone

thats
a
good
thing
said
alyosha
we
must
often
take
some
every
day
every
day
said
the
captain
quickly
seeming
cheered
at
the
thought
they
reached
the
church
at
last
and
set
the
coffin
in
the
middle
of
it
the
boys
surrounded
it
and
remained
reverently
standing
so
all
through
the
service
it
was
an
old
and
rather
poor
church
many
of
the
ikons
were
without
settings
but
such
churches
are
the
best
for
praying
in
during
the
mass
snegiryov
became
somewhat
calmer
though
at
times
he
had
outbursts
of
the
same
unconscious
and
as
it
were
incoherent
anxiety
at
one
moment
he
went
up
to
the
coffin
to
set
straight
the
cover
or
the
wreath
when
a
candle
fell
out
of
the
candlestick
he
rushed
to
replace
it
and
was
a
fearful
time
fumbling
over
it
then
he
subsided
and
stood
quietly
by
the
coffin
with
a
look
of
blank
uneasiness
and
perplexity
after
the
epistle
he
suddenly
whispered
to
alyosha
who
was
standing
beside
him
that
the
epistle
had
not
been
read
properly
but
did
not
explain
what
he
meant
during
the
prayer
like
the
cherubim
he
joined
in
the
singing
but
did
not
go
on
to
the
end
falling
on
his
knees
he
pressed
his
forehead
to
the
stone
floor
and
lay
so
for
a
long
while
at
last
came
the
funeral
service
itself
and
candles
were
distributed
the
distracted
father
began
fussing
about
again
but
the
touching
and
impressive
funeral
prayers
moved
and
roused
his
soul
he
seemed
suddenly
to
shrink
together
and
broke
into
rapid
short
sobs
which
he
tried
at
first
to
smother
but
at
last
he
sobbed
aloud
when
they
began
taking
leave
of
the
dead
and
closing
the
coffin
he
flung
his
arms
about
as
though
he
would
not
allow
them
to
cover
ilusha
and
began
greedily
and
persistently
kissing
his
dead
boy
on
the
lips
at
last
they
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
come
away
from
the
step
but
suddenly
he
impulsively
stretched
out
his
hand
and
snatched
a
few
flowers
from
the
coffin
he
looked
at
them
and
a
new
idea
seemed
to
dawn
upon
him
so
that
he
apparently
forgot
his
grief
for
a
minute
gradually
he
seemed
to
sink
into
brooding
and
did
not
resist
when
the
coffin
was
lifted
up
and
carried
to
the
grave
it
was
an
expensive
one
in
the
churchyard
close
to
the
church
katerina
ivanovna
had
paid
for
it
after
the
customary
rites
the
grave
diggers
lowered
the
coffin
snegiryov
with
his
flowers
in
his
hands
bent
down
so
low
over
the
open
grave
that
the
boys
caught
hold
of
his
coat
in
alarm
and
pulled
him
back
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
fully
what
was
happening
when
they
began
filling
up
the
grave
he
suddenly
pointed
anxiously
at
the
falling
earth
and
began
trying
to
say
something
but
no
one
could
make
out
what
he
meant
and
he
stopped
suddenly
then
he
was
reminded
that
he
must
crumble
the
bread
and
he
was
awfully
excited
snatched
up
the
bread
and
began
pulling
it
to
pieces
and
flinging
the
morsels
on
the
grave
come
fly
down
birds
fly
down
sparrows
he
muttered
anxiously
one
of
the
boys
observed
that
it
was
awkward
for
him
to
crumble
the
bread
with
the
flowers
in
his
hands
and
suggested
he
should
give
them
to
some
one
to
hold
for
a
time
but
he
would
not
do
this
and
seemed
indeed
suddenly
alarmed
for
his
flowers
as
though
they
wanted
to
take
them
from
him
altogether
and
after
looking
at
the
grave
and
as
it
were
satisfying
himself
that
everything
had
been
done
and
the
bread
had
been
crumbled
he
suddenly
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
turned
quite
composedly
even
and
made
his
way
homewards
but
his
steps
became
more
and
more
hurried
he
almost
ran
the
boys
and
alyosha
kept
up
with
him
the
flowers
are
for
mamma
the
flowers
are
for
mamma
i
was
unkind
to
mamma
he
began
exclaiming
suddenly
some
one
called
to
him
to
put
on
his
hat
as
it
was
cold
but
he
flung
the
hat
in
the
snow
as
though
he
were
angry
and
kept
repeating
i
wont
have
the
hat
i
wont
have
the
hat
smurov
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
after
him
all
the
boys
were
crying
and
kolya
and
the
boy
who
discovered
about
troy
most
of
all
though
smurov
with
the
captains
hat
in
his
hand
was
crying
bitterly
too
he
managed
as
he
ran
to
snatch
up
a
piece
of
red
brick
that
lay
on
the
snow
of
the
path
to
fling
it
at
the
flock
of
sparrows
that
was
flying
by
he
missed
them
of
course
and
went
on
crying
as
he
ran
halfway
snegiryov
suddenly
stopped
stood
still
for
half
a
minute
as
though
struck
by
something
and
suddenly
turning
back
to
the
church
ran
towards
the
deserted
grave
but
the
boys
instantly
overtook
him
and
caught
hold
of
him
on
all
sides
then
he
fell
helpless
on
the
snow
as
though
he
had
been
knocked
down
and
struggling
sobbing
and
wailing
he
began
crying
out
ilusha
old
man
dear
old
man
alyosha
and
kolya
tried
to
make
him
get
up
soothing
and
persuading
him
captain
give
over
a
brave
man
must
show
fortitude
muttered
kolya
youll
spoil
the
flowers
said
alyosha
and
mamma
is
expecting
them
she
is
sitting
crying
because
you
would
not
give
her
any
before
ilushas
little
bed
is
still
there
yes
yes
mamma
snegiryov
suddenly
recollected
theyll
take
away
the
bed
theyll
take
it
away
he
added
as
though
alarmed
that
they
really
would
he
jumped
up
and
ran
homewards
again
but
it
was
not
far
off
and
they
all
arrived
together
snegiryov
opened
the
door
hurriedly
and
called
to
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
so
cruelly
quarreled
just
before
mamma
poor
crippled
darling
ilusha
has
sent
you
these
flowers
he
cried
holding
out
to
her
a
little
bunch
of
flowers
that
had
been
frozen
and
broken
while
he
was
struggling
in
the
snow
but
at
that
instant
he
saw
in
the
corner
by
the
little
bed
ilushas
little
boots
which
the
landlady
had
put
tidily
side
by
side
seeing
the
old
patched
rusty
looking
stiff
boots
he
flung
up
his
hands
and
rushed
to
them
fell
on
his
knees
snatched
up
one
boot
and
pressing
his
lips
to
it
began
kissing
it
greedily
crying
ilusha
old
man
dear
old
man
where
are
your
little
feet
where
have
you
taken
him
away
where
have
you
taken
him
the
lunatic
cried
in
a
heartrending
voice
nina
too
broke
into
sobs
kolya
ran
out
of
the
room
the
boys
followed
him
at
last
alyosha
too
went
out
let
them
weep
he
said
to
kolya
its
no
use
trying
to
comfort
them
just
now
let
us
wait
a
minute
and
then
go
back
no
its
no
use
its
awful
kolya
assented
do
you
know
karamazov
he
dropped
his
voice
so
that
no
one
could
hear
them
i
feel
dreadfully
sad
and
if
it
were
only
possible
to
bring
him
back
id
give
anything
in
the
world
to
do
it
ah
so
would
i
said
alyosha
what
do
you
think
karamazov
had
we
better
come
back
here
tonight
hell
be
drunk
you
know
perhaps
he
will
let
us
come
together
you
and
i
that
will
be
enough
to
spend
an
hour
with
them
with
the
mother
and
nina
if
we
all
come
together
we
shall
remind
them
of
everything
again
alyosha
suggested
the
landlady
is
laying
the
table
for
them
nowtherell
be
a
funeral
dinner
or
something
the
priest
is
coming
shall
we
go
back
to
it
karamazov
of
course
said
alyosha
its
all
so
strange
karamazov
such
sorrow
and
then
pancakes
after
it
it
all
seems
so
unnatural
in
our
religion
they
are
going
to
have
salmon
too
the
boy
who
had
discovered
about
troy
observed
in
a
loud
voice
i
beg
you
most
earnestly
kartashov
not
to
interrupt
again
with
your
idiotic
remarks
especially
when
one
is
not
talking
to
you
and
doesnt
care
to
know
whether
you
exist
or
not
kolya
snapped
out
irritably
the
boy
flushed
crimson
but
did
not
dare
to
reply
meantime
they
were
strolling
slowly
along
the
path
and
suddenly
smurov
exclaimed
theres
ilushas
stone
under
which
they
wanted
to
bury
him
they
all
stood
still
by
the
big
stone
alyosha
looked
and
the
whole
picture
of
what
snegiryov
had
described
to
him
that
day
how
ilusha
weeping
and
hugging
his
father
had
cried
father
father
how
he
insulted
you
rose
at
once
before
his
imagination
a
sudden
impulse
seemed
to
come
into
his
soul
with
a
serious
and
earnest
expression
he
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
bright
pleasant
faces
of
ilushas
schoolfellows
and
suddenly
said
to
them
boys
i
should
like
to
say
one
word
to
you
here
at
this
place
the
boys
stood
round
him
and
at
once
bent
attentive
and
expectant
eyes
upon
him
boys
we
shall
soon
part
i
shall
be
for
some
time
with
my
two
brothers
of
whom
one
is
going
to
siberia
and
the
other
is
lying
at
deaths
door
but
soon
i
shall
leave
this
town
perhaps
for
a
long
time
so
we
shall
part
let
us
make
a
compact
here
at
ilushas
stone
that
we
will
never
forget
ilusha
and
one
another
and
whatever
happens
to
us
later
in
life
if
we
dont
meet
for
twenty
years
afterwards
let
us
always
remember
how
we
buried
the
poor
boy
at
whom
we
once
threw
stones
do
you
remember
by
the
bridge
and
afterwards
we
all
grew
so
fond
of
him
he
was
a
fine
boy
a
kindhearted
brave
boy
he
felt
for
his
fathers
honor
and
resented
the
cruel
insult
to
him
and
stood
up
for
him
and
so
in
the
first
place
we
will
remember
him
boys
all
our
lives
and
even
if
we
are
occupied
with
most
important
things
if
we
attain
to
honor
or
fall
into
great
misfortunestill
let
us
remember
how
good
it
was
once
here
when
we
were
all
together
united
by
a
good
and
kind
feeling
which
made
us
for
the
time
we
were
loving
that
poor
boy
better
perhaps
than
we
are
my
little
doveslet
me
call
you
so
for
you
are
very
like
them
those
pretty
blue
birds
at
this
minute
as
i
look
at
your
good
dear
faces
my
dear
children
perhaps
you
wont
understand
what
i
am
saying
to
you
because
i
often
speak
very
unintelligibly
but
youll
remember
it
all
the
same
and
will
agree
with
my
words
some
time
you
must
know
that
there
is
nothing
higher
and
stronger
and
more
wholesome
and
good
for
life
in
the
future
than
some
good
memory
especially
a
memory
of
childhood
of
home
people
talk
to
you
a
great
deal
about
your
education
but
some
good
sacred
memory
preserved
from
childhood
is
perhaps
the
best
education
if
a
man
carries
many
such
memories
with
him
into
life
he
is
safe
to
the
end
of
his
days
and
if
one
has
only
one
good
memory
left
in
ones
heart
even
that
may
sometime
be
the
means
of
saving
us
perhaps
we
may
even
grow
wicked
later
on
may
be
unable
to
refrain
from
a
bad
action
may
laugh
at
mens
tears
and
at
those
people
who
say
as
kolya
did
just
now
i
want
to
suffer
for
all
men
and
may
even
jeer
spitefully
at
such
people
but
however
bad
we
may
becomewhich
god
forbidyet
when
we
recall
how
we
buried
ilusha
how
we
loved
him
in
his
last
days
and
how
we
have
been
talking
like
friends
all
together
at
this
stone
the
cruelest
and
most
mocking
of
usif
we
do
become
sowill
not
dare
to
laugh
inwardly
at
having
been
kind
and
good
at
this
moment
whats
more
perhaps
that
one
memory
may
keep
him
from
great
evil
and
he
will
reflect
and
say
yes
i
was
good
and
brave
and
honest
then
let
him
laugh
to
himself
thats
no
matter
a
man
often
laughs
at
whats
good
and
kind
thats
only
from
thoughtlessness
but
i
assure
you
boys
that
as
he
laughs
he
will
say
at
once
in
his
heart
no
i
do
wrong
to
laugh
for
thats
not
a
thing
to
laugh
at

that
will
be
so
i
understand
you
karamazov
cried
kolya
with
flashing
eyes
the
boys
were
excited
and
they
too
wanted
to
say
something
but
they
restrained
themselves
looking
with
intentness
and
emotion
at
the
speaker
i
say
this
in
case
we
become
bad
alyosha
went
on
but
theres
no
reason
why
we
should
become
bad
is
there
boys
let
us
be
first
and
above
all
kind
then
honest
and
then
let
us
never
forget
each
other
i
say
that
again
i
give
you
my
word
for
my
part
that
ill
never
forget
one
of
you
every
face
looking
at
me
now
i
shall
remember
even
for
thirty
years
just
now
kolya
said
to
kartashov
that
we
did
not
care
to
know
whether
he
exists
or
not
but
i
cannot
forget
that
kartashov
exists
and
that
he
is
not
blushing
now
as
he
did
when
he
discovered
the
founders
of
troy
but
is
looking
at
me
with
his
jolly
kind
dear
little
eyes
boys
my
dear
boys
let
us
all
be
generous
and
brave
like
ilusha
clever
brave
and
generous
like
kolya
though
he
will
be
ever
so
much
cleverer
when
he
is
grown
up
and
let
us
all
be
as
modest
as
clever
and
sweet
as
kartashov
but
why
am
i
talking
about
those
two
you
are
all
dear
to
me
boys
from
this
day
forth
i
have
a
place
in
my
heart
for
you
all
and
i
beg
you
to
keep
a
place
in
your
hearts
for
me
well
and
who
has
united
us
in
this
kind
good
feeling
which
we
shall
remember
and
intend
to
remember
all
our
lives
who
if
not
ilusha
the
good
boy
the
dear
boy
precious
to
us
for
ever
let
us
never
forget
him

his
memory
live
for
ever
in
our
hearts
from
this
time
forth

ever

the
boys
cried
in
their
ringing
voices
with
softened
faces
let
us
remember
his
face
and
his
clothes
and
his
poor
little
boots
his
coffin
and
his
unhappy
sinful
father
and
how
boldly
he
stood
up
for
him
alone
against
the
whole
school
we
will
remember
we
will
remember
cried
the
boys

was
brave

was
good

i
loved
him

kolya

and

the
boys
repeated
enthusiastically
karamazov

voice
probably
kartashovs
cried
impulsively
we
love

all
caught
it
up

tears
in
the

karamazov

alyosha
added
again
with
feeling
for
ever
the
boys
chimed
in
again
karamazov
cried
kolya

be
true

in
religion
that

dead
and
shall
live
and

each
other
again

other
and
shall
tell
each
other
with
joy
and
gladness
all
that

happened
alyosha
answered
half
laughing
half
enthusiastic
ah

splendid
it
will
be

exclamation
