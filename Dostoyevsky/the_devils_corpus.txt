and
there
was
one
herd
of
many
swine
feeding
on
this

they
besought
him
that
he
would
suffer
them
to
enter

and
he
suffered
them
then
went

out
of
the
man

entered
into

the

violently

introductory
some
details
of
the
biography
of
that
highly
respected
gentleman
stepan
trofimovitch
verhovensky
i
in
undertaking
to
describe
the
recent
and
strange
incidents
in
our
town
till
lately
wrapped
in
uneventful
obscurity
i
find
myself
forced
in
absence
of
literary
skill
to
begin
my
story
rather
far
back
that
is
to
say
with
certain
biographical
details
concerning
that
talented
and
highlyesteemed
gentleman
stepan
trofimovitch
verhovensky
i
trust
that
these
details
may
at
least
serve
as
an
introduction
while
my
projected
story
itself
will
come
later
i
will
say
at
once
that
stepan
trofimovitch
had
always
filled
a
particular
rle
among
us
that
of
the
progressive
patriot
so
to
say
and
he
was
passionately
fond
of
playing
the
partso
much
so
that
i
really
believe
he
could
not
have
existed
without
it
not
that
i
would
put
him
on
a
level
with
an
actor
at
a
theatre
god
forbid
for
i
really
have
a
respect
for
him
this
may
all
have
been
the
effect
of
habit
or
rather
more
exactly
of
a
generous
propensity
he
had
from
his
earliest
years
for
indulging
in
an
agreeable
daydream
in
which
he
figured
as
a
picturesque
public
character
he
fondly
loved
for
instance
his
position
as
a
persecuted
man
and
so
to
speak
an
exile
there
is
a
sort
of
traditional
glamour
about
those
two
little
words
that
fascinated
him
once
for
all
and
exalting
him
gradually
in
his
own
opinion
raised
him
in
the
course
of
years
to
a
lofty
pedestal
very
gratifying
to
vanity
in
an
english
satire
of
the
last
century
gulliver
returning
from
the
land
of
the
lilliputians
where
the
people
were
only
three
or
four
inches
high
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
consider
himself
a
giant
among
them
that
as
he
walked
along
the
streets
of
london
he
could
not
help
crying
out
to
carriages
and
passersby
to
be
careful
and
get
out
of
his
way
for
fear
he
should
crush
them
imagining
that
they
were
little
and
he
was
still
a
giant
he
was
laughed
at
and
abused
for
it
and
rough
coachmen
even
lashed
at
the
giant
with
their
whips
but
was
that
just
what
may
not
be
done
by
habit
habit
had
brought
stepan
trofimovitch
almost
to
the
same
position
but
in
a
more
innocent
and
inoffensive
form
if
one
may
use
such
expressions
for
he
was
a
most
excellent
man
i
am
even
inclined
to
suppose
that
towards
the
end
he
had
been
entirely
forgotten
everywhere
but
still
it
cannot
be
said
that
his
name
had
never
been
known
it
is
beyond
question
that
he
had
at
one
time
belonged
to
a
certain
distinguished
constellation
of
celebrated
leaders
of
the
last
generation
and
at
one
timethough
only
for
the
briefest
momenthis
name
was
pronounced
by
many
hasty
persons
of
that
day
almost
as
though
it
were
on
a
level
with
the
names
of
tchaadaev
of
byelinsky
of
granovsky
and
of
herzen
who
had
only
just
begun
to
write
abroad
but
stepan
trofimovitchs
activity
ceased
almost
at
the
moment
it
began
owing
so
to
say
to
a
vortex
of
combined
circumstances
and
would
you
believe
it
it
turned
out
afterwards
that
there
had
been
no
vortex
and
even
no
circumstances
at
least
in
that
connection
i
only
learned
the
other
day
to
my
intense
amazement
though
on
the
most
unimpeachable
authority
that
stepan
trofimovitch
had
lived
among
us
in
our
province
not
as
an
exile
as
we
were
accustomed
to
believe
and
had
never
even
been
under
police
supervision
at
all
such
is
the
force
of
imagination
all
his
life
he
sincerely
believed
that
in
certain
spheres
he
was
a
constant
cause
of
apprehension
that
every
step
he
took
was
watched
and
noted
and
that
each
one
of
the
three
governors
who
succeeded
one
another
during
twenty
years
in
our
province
came
with
special
and
uneasy
ideas
concerning
him
which
had
by
higher
powers
been
impressed
upon
each
before
everything
else
on
receiving
the
appointment
had
anyone
assured
the
honest
man
on
the
most
irrefutable
grounds
that
he
had
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
he
would
certainly
have
been
offended
yet
stepan
trofimovitch
was
a
most
intelligent
and
gifted
man
even
so
to
say
a
man
of
science
though
indeed
in
science
well
in
fact
he
had
not
done
such
great
things
in
science
i
believe
indeed
he
had
done
nothing
at
all
but
thats
very
often
the
case
of
course
with
men
of
science
among
us
in
russia
he
came
back
from
abroad
and
was
brilliant
in
the
capacity
of
lecturer
at
the
university
towards
the
end
of
the
forties
he
only
had
time
to
deliver
a
few
lectures
i
believe
they
were
about
the
arabs
he
maintained
too
a
brilliant
thesis
on
the
political
and
hanseatic
importance
of
the
german
town
hanau
of
which
there
was
promise
in
the
epoch
between
1413
and
1428
and
on
the
special
and
obscure
reasons
why
that
promise
was
never
fulfilled
this
dissertation
was
a
cruel
and
skilful
thrust
at
the
slavophils
of
the
day
and
at
once
made
him
numerous
and
irreconcilable
enemies
among
them
later
onafter
he
had
lost
his
post
as
lecturer
howeverhe
published
by
way
of
revenge
so
to
say
and
to
show
them
what
a
man
they
had
lost
in
a
progressive
monthly
review
which
translated
dickens
and
advocated
the
views
of
george
sand
the
beginning
of
a
very
profound
investigation
into
the
causes
i
believe
of
the
extraordinary
moral
nobility
of
certain
knights
at
a
certain
epoch
or
something
of
that
nature
some
lofty
and
exceptionally
noble
idea
was
maintained
in
it
anyway
it
was
said
afterwards
that
the
continuation
was
hurriedly
forbidden
and
even
that
the
progressive
review
had
to
suffer
for
having
printed
the
first
part
that
may
very
well
have
been
so
for
what
was
not
possible
in
those
days
though
in
this
case
it
is
more
likely
that
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
and
that
the
author
himself
was
too
lazy
to
conclude
his
essay
he
cut
short
his
lectures
on
the
arabs
because
somehow
and
by
someone
probably
one
of
his
reactionary
enemies
a
letter
had
been
seized
giving
an
account
of
certain
circumstances
in
consequence
of
which
someone
had
demanded
an
explanation
from
him
i
dont
know
whether
the
story
is
true
but
it
was
asserted
that
at
the
same
time
there
was
discovered
in
petersburg
a
vast
unnatural
and
illegal
conspiracy
of
thirty
people
which
almost
shook
society
to
its
foundations
it
was
said
that
they
were
positively
on
the
point
of
translating
fourier
as
though
of
design
a
poem
of
stepan
trofimovitchs
was
seized
in
moscow
at
that
very
time
though
it
had
been
written
six
years
before
in
berlin
in
his
earliest
youth
and
manuscript
copies
had
been
passed
round
a
circle
consisting
of
two
poetical
amateurs
and
one
student
this
poem
is
lying
now
on
my
table
no
longer
ago
than
last
year
i
received
a
recent
copy
in
his
own
handwriting
from
stepan
trofimovitch
himself
signed
by
him
and
bound
in
a
splendid
red
leather
binding
it
is
not
without
poetic
merit
however
and
even
a
certain
talent
its
strange
but
in
those
days
or
to
be
more
exact
in
the
thirties
people
were
constantly
composing
in
that
style
i
find
it
difficult
to
describe
the
subject
for
i
really
do
not
understand
it
it
is
some
sort
of
an
allegory
in
lyricaldramatic
form
recalling
the
second
part
of
faust
the
scene
opens
with
a
chorus
of
women
followed
by
a
chorus
of
men
then
a
chorus
of
incorporeal
powers
of
some
sort
and
at
the
end
of
all
a
chorus
of
spirits
not
yet
living
but
very
eager
to
come
to
life
all
these
choruses
sing
about
something
very
indefinite
for
the
most
part
about
somebodys
curse
but
with
a
tinge
of
the
higher
humour
but
the
scene
is
suddenly
changed
there
begins
a
sort
of
festival
of
life
at
which
even
insects
sing
a
tortoise
comes
on
the
scene
with
certain
sacramental
latin
words
and
even
if
i
remember
aright
a
mineral
sings
about
something
that
is
a
quite
inanimate
object
in
fact
they
all
sing
continually
or
if
they
converse
it
is
simply
to
abuse
one
another
vaguely
but
again
with
a
tinge
of
higher
meaning
at
last
the
scene
is
changed
again
a
wilderness
appears
and
among
the
rocks
there
wanders
a
civilized
young
man
who
picks
and
sucks
certain
herbs
asked
by
a
fairy
why
he
sucks
these
herbs
he
answers
that
conscious
of
a
superfluity
of
life
in
himself
he
seeks
forgetfulness
and
finds
it
in
the
juice
of
these
herbs
but
that
his
great
desire
is
to
lose
his
reason
at
once
a
desire
possibly
superfluous
then
a
youth
of
indescribable
beauty
rides
in
on
a
black
steed
and
an
immense
multitude
of
all
nations
follow
him
the
youth
represents
death
for
whom
all
the
peoples
are
yearning
and
finally
in
the
last
scene
we
are
suddenly
shown
the
tower
of
babel
and
certain
athletes
at
last
finish
building
it
with
a
song
of
new
hope
and
when
at
length
they
complete
the
topmost
pinnacle
the
lord
of
olympia
let
us
say
takes
flight
in
a
comic
fashion
and
man
grasping
the
situation
and
seizing
his
place
at
once
begins
a
new
life
with
new
insight
into
things
well
this
poem
was
thought
at
that
time
to
be
dangerous
last
year
i
proposed
to
stepan
trofimovitch
to
publish
it
on
the
ground
of
its
perfect
harmlessness
nowadays
but
he
declined
the
suggestion
with
evident
dissatisfaction
my
view
of
its
complete
harmlessness
evidently
displeased
him
and
i
even
ascribe
to
it
a
certain
coldness
on
his
part
which
lasted
two
whole
months
and
what
do
you
think
suddenly
almost
at
the
time
i
proposed
printing
it
here
our
poem
was
published
abroad
in
a
collection
of
revolutionary
verse
without
the
knowledge
of
stepan
trofimovitch
he
was
at
first
alarmed
rushed
to
the
governor
and
wrote
a
noble
letter
in
selfdefence
to
petersburg
he
read
it
to
me
twice
but
did
not
send
it
not
knowing
to
whom
to
address
it
in
fact
he
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
for
a
whole
month
but
i
am
convinced
that
in
the
secret
recesses
of
his
heart
he
was
enormously
flattered
he
almost
took
the
copy
of
the
collection
to
bed
with
him
and
kept
it
hidden
under
his
mattress
in
the
daytime
he
positively
would
not
allow
the
women
to
turn
his
bed
and
although
he
expected
every
day
a
telegram
he
held
his
head
high
no
telegram
came
then
he
made
friends
with
me
again
which
is
a
proof
of
the
extreme
kindness
of
his
gentle
and
unresentful
heart
ii
of
course
i
dont
assert
that
he
had
never
suffered
for
his
convictions
at
all
but
i
am
fully
convinced
that
he
might
have
gone
on
lecturing
on
his
arabs
as
long
as
he
liked
if
he
had
only
given
the
necessary
explanations
but
he
was
too
lofty
and
he
proceeded
with
peculiar
haste
to
assure
himself
that
his
career
was
ruined
forever
by
the
vortex
of
circumstance
and
if
the
whole
truth
is
to
be
told
the
real
cause
of
the
change
in
his
career
was
the
very
delicate
proposition
which
had
been
made
before
and
was
then
renewed
by
varvara
petrovna
stavrogin
a
lady
of
great
wealth
the
wife
of
a
lieutenantgeneral
that
he
should
undertake
the
education
and
the
whole
intellectual
development
of
her
only
son
in
the
capacity
of
a
superior
sort
of
teacher
and
friend
to
say
nothing
of
a
magnificent
salary
this
proposal
had
been
made
to
him
the
first
time
in
berlin
at
the
moment
when
he
was
first
left
a
widower
his
first
wife
was
a
frivolous
girl
from
our
province
whom
he
married
in
his
early
and
unthinking
youth
and
apparently
he
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
this
young
person
charming
as
she
was
owing
to
the
lack
of
means
for
her
support
and
also
from
other
more
delicate
reasons
she
died
in
paris
after
three
years
separation
from
him
leaving
him
a
son
of
five
years
old
the
fruit
of
our
first
joyous
and
unclouded
love
were
the
words
the
sorrowing
father
once
let
fall
in
my
presence
the
child
had
from
the
first
been
sent
back
to
russia
where
he
was
brought
up
in
the
charge
of
distant
cousins
in
some
remote
region
stepan
trofimovitch
had
declined
varvara
petrovnas
proposal
on
that
occasion
and
had
quickly
married
again
before
the
year
was
over
a
taciturn
berlin
girl
and
what
makes
it
more
strange
there
was
no
particular
necessity
for
him
to
do
so
but
apart
from
his
marriage
there
were
it
appears
other
reasons
for
his
declining
the
situation
he
was
tempted
by
the
resounding
fame
of
a
professor
celebrated
at
that
time
and
he
in
his
turn
hastened
to
the
lecturers
chair
for
which
he
had
been
preparing
himself
to
try
his
eagle
wings
in
flight
but
now
with
singed
wings
he
naturally
remembered
the
proposition
which
even
then
had
made
him
hesitate
the
sudden
death
of
his
second
wife
who
did
not
live
a
year
with
him
settled
the
matter
decisively
to
put
it
plainly
it
was
all
brought
about
by
the
passionate
sympathy
and
priceless
so
to
speak
classic
friendship
of
varvara
petrovna
if
one
may
use
such
an
expression
of
friendship
he
flung
himself
into
the
arms
of
this
friendship
and
his
position
was
settled
for
more
than
twenty
years
i
use
the
expression
flung
himself
into
the
arms
of
but
god
forbid
that
anyone
should
fly
to
idle
and
superfluous
conclusions
these
embraces
must
be
understood
only
in
the
most
loftily
moral
sense
the
most
refined
and
delicate
tie
united
these
two
beings
both
so
remarkable
forever
the
post
of
tutor
was
the
more
readily
accepted
too
as
the
propertya
very
small
oneleft
to
stepan
trofimovitch
by
his
first
wife
was
close
to
skvoreshniki
the
stavrogins
magnificent
estate
on
the
outskirts
of
our
provincial
town
besides
in
the
stillness
of
his
study
far
from
the
immense
burden
of
university
work
it
was
always
possible
to
devote
himself
to
the
service
of
science
and
to
enrich
the
literature
of
his
country
with
erudite
studies
these
works
did
not
appear
but
on
the
other
hand
it
did
appear
possible
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
more
than
twenty
years
a
reproach
incarnate
so
to
speak
to
his
native
country
in
the
words
of
a
popular
poet
reproach
incarnate
thou
didst
stand
erect
before
thy
fatherland
o
liberal
idealist
but
the
person
to
whom
the
popular
poet
referred
may
perhaps
have
had
the
right
to
adopt
that
pose
for
the
rest
of
his
life
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
though
it
must
have
been
tedious
our
stepan
trofimovitch
was
to
tell
the
truth
only
an
imitator
compared
with
such
people
moreover
he
had
grown
weary
of
standing
erect
and
often
lay
down
for
a
while
but
to
do
him
justice
the
incarnation
of
reproach
was
preserved
even
in
the
recumbent
attitude
the
more
so
as
that
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
province
you
should
have
seen
him
at
our
club
when
he
sat
down
to
cards
his
whole
figure
seemed
to
exclaim
cards
me
sit
down
to
whist
with
you
is
it
consistent
who
is
responsible
for
it
who
has
shattered
my
energies
and
turned
them
to
whist
ah
perish
russia
and
he
would
majestically
trump
with
a
heart
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
dearly
loved
a
game
of
cards
which
led
him
especially
in
later
years
into
frequent
and
unpleasant
skirmishes
with
varvara
petrovna
particularly
as
he
was
always
losing
but
of
that
later
i
will
only
observe
that
he
was
a
man
of
tender
conscience
that
is
sometimes
and
so
was
often
depressed
in
the
course
of
his
twenty
years
friendship
with
varvara
petrovna
he
used
regularly
three
or
four
times
a
year
to
sink
into
a
state
of
patriotic
grief
as
it
was
called
among
us
or
rather
really
into
an
attack
of
spleen
but
our
estimable
varvara
petrovna
preferred
the
former
phrase
of
late
years
his
grief
had
begun
to
be
not
only
patriotic
but
at
times
alcoholic
too
but
varvara
petrovnas
alertness
succeeded
in
keeping
him
all
his
life
from
trivial
inclinations
and
he
needed
someone
to
look
after
him
indeed
for
he
sometimes
behaved
very
oddly
in
the
midst
of
his
exalted
sorrow
he
would
begin
laughing
like
any
simple
peasant
there
were
moments
when
he
began
to
take
a
humorous
tone
even
about
himself
but
there
was
nothing
varvara
petrovna
dreaded
so
much
as
a
humorous
tone
she
was
a
woman
of
the
classic
type
a
female
mcenas
invariably
guided
only
by
the
highest
considerations
the
influence
of
this
exalted
lady
over
her
poor
friend
for
twenty
years
is
a
fact
of
the
first
importance
i
shall
need
to
speak
of
her
more
particularly
which
i
now
proceed
to
do
iii
there
are
strange
friendships
the
two
friends
are
always
ready
to
fly
at
one
another
and
go
on
like
that
all
their
lives
and
yet
they
cannot
separate
parting
in
fact
is
utterly
impossible
the
one
who
has
begun
the
quarrel
and
separated
will
be
the
first
to
fall
ill
and
even
die
perhaps
if
the
separation
comes
off
i
know
for
a
positive
fact
that
several
times
stepan
trofimovitch
has
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
and
beaten
the
wall
with
his
fists
after
the
most
intimate
and
emotional
ttette
with
varvara
petrovna
this
proceeding
was
by
no
means
an
empty
symbol
indeed
on
one
occasion
he
broke
some
plaster
off
the
wall
it
may
be
asked
how
i
come
to
know
such
delicate
details
what
if
i
were
myself
a
witness
of
it
what
if
stepan
trofimovitch
himself
has
on
more
than
one
occasion
sobbed
on
my
shoulder
while
he
described
to
me
in
lurid
colours
all
his
most
secret
feelings
and
what
was
there
he
did
not
say
at
such
times
but
what
almost
always
happened
after
these
tearful
outbreaks
was
that
next
day
he
was
ready
to
crucify
himself
for
his
ingratitude
he
would
send
for
me
in
a
hurry
or
run
over
to
see
me
simply
to
assure
me
that
varvara
petrovna
was
an
angel
of
honour
and
delicacy
while
he
was
very
much
the
opposite
he
did
not
only
run
to
confide
in
me
but
on
more
than
one
occasion
described
it
all
to
her
in
the
most
eloquent
letter
and
wrote
a
full
signed
confession
that
no
longer
ago
than
the
day
before
he
had
told
an
outsider
that
she
kept
him
out
of
vanity
that
she
was
envious
of
his
talents
and
erudition
that
she
hated
him
and
was
only
afraid
to
express
her
hatred
openly
dreading
that
he
would
leave
her
and
so
damage
her
literary
reputation
that
this
drove
him
to
selfcontempt
and
he
was
resolved
to
die
a
violent
death
and
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
final
word
from
her
which
would
decide
everything
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
the
same
style
you
can
fancy
after
this
what
an
hysterical
pitch
the
nervous
outbreaks
of
this
most
innocent
of
all
fiftyyearold
infants
sometimes
reached
i
once
read
one
of
these
letters
after
some
quarrel
between
them
arising
from
a
trivial
matter
but
growing
venomous
as
it
went
on
i
was
horrified
and
besought
him
not
to
send
it
i
must
more
honourable
duty
i
shall
die
if
i
dont
confess
everything
everything
he
answered
almost
in
delirium
and
he
did
send
the
letter
that
was
the
difference
between
them
that
varvara
petrovna
never
would
have
sent
such
a
letter
it
is
true
that
he
was
passionately
fond
of
writing
he
wrote
to
her
though
he
lived
in
the
same
house
and
during
hysterical
interludes
he
would
write
two
letters
a
day
i
know
for
a
fact
that
she
always
read
these
letters
with
the
greatest
attention
even
when
she
received
two
a
day
and
after
reading
them
she
put
them
away
in
a
special
drawer
sorted
and
annotated
moreover
she
pondered
them
in
her
heart
but
she
kept
her
friend
all
day
without
an
answer
met
him
as
though
there
were
nothing
the
matter
exactly
as
though
nothing
special
had
happened
the
day
before
by
degrees
she
broke
him
in
so
completely
that
at
last
he
did
not
himself
dare
to
allude
to
what
had
happened
the
day
before
and
only
glanced
into
her
eyes
at
times
but
she
never
forgot
anything
while
he
sometimes
forgot
too
quickly
and
encouraged
by
her
composure
he
would
not
infrequently
if
friends
came
in
laugh
and
make
jokes
over
the
champagne
the
very
same
day
with
what
malignancy
she
must
have
looked
at
him
at
such
moments
while
he
noticed
nothing
perhaps
in
a
weeks
time
a
months
time
or
even
six
months
later
chancing
to
recall
some
phrase
in
such
a
letter
and
then
the
whole
letter
with
all
its
attendant
circumstances
he
would
suddenly
grow
hot
with
shame
and
be
so
upset
that
he
fell
ill
with
one
of
his
attacks
of
summer
cholera
these
attacks
of
a
sort
of
summer
cholera
were
in
some
cases
the
regular
consequence
of
his
nervous
agitations
and
were
an
interesting
peculiarity
of
his
physical
constitution
no
doubt
varvara
petrovna
did
very
often
hate
him
but
there
was
one
thing
he
had
not
discerned
up
to
the
end
that
was
that
he
had
become
for
her
a
son
her
creation
even
one
may
say
her
invention
he
had
become
flesh
of
her
flesh
and
she
kept
and
supported
him
not
simply
from
envy
of
his
talents
and
how
wounded
she
must
have
been
by
such
suppositions
an
inexhaustible
love
for
him
lay
concealed
in
her
heart
in
the
midst
of
continual
hatred
jealousy
and
contempt
she
would
not
let
a
speck
of
dust
fall
upon
him
coddled
him
up
for
twentytwo
years
would
not
have
slept
for
nights
together
if
there
were
the
faintest
breath
against
his
reputation
as
a
poet
a
learned
man
and
a
public
character
she
had
invented
him
and
had
been
the
first
to
believe
in
her
own
invention
he
was
after
a
fashion
her
daydream
but
in
return
she
exacted
a
great
deal
from
him
sometimes
even
slavishness
it
was
incredible
how
long
she
harboured
resentment
i
have
two
anecdotes
to
tell
about
that
iv
on
one
occasion
just
at
the
time
when
the
first
rumours
of
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
were
in
the
air
when
all
russia
was
exulting
and
making
ready
for
a
complete
regeneration
varvara
petrovna
was
visited
by
a
baron
from
petersburg
a
man
of
the
highest
connections
and
very
closely
associated
with
the
new
reform
varvara
petrovna
prized
such
visits
highly
as
her
connections
in
higher
circles
had
grown
weaker
and
weaker
since
the
death
of
her
husband
and
had
at
last
ceased
altogether
the
baron
spent
an
hour
drinking
tea
with
her
there
was
no
one
else
present
but
stepan
trofimovitch
whom
varvara
petrovna
invited
and
exhibited
the
baron
had
heard
something
about
him
before
or
affected
to
have
done
so
but
paid
little
attention
to
him
at
tea
stepan
trofimovitch
of
course
was
incapable
of
making
a
social
blunder
and
his
manners
were
most
elegant
though
i
believe
he
was
by
no
means
of
exalted
origin
yet
it
happened
that
he
had
from
earliest
childhood
been
brought
up
in
a
moscow
householdof
high
rank
and
consequently
was
well
bred
he
spoke
french
like
a
parisian
thus
the
baron
was
to
have
seen
from
the
first
glance
the
sort
of
people
with
whom
varvara
petrovna
surrounded
herself
even
in
provincial
seclusion
but
things
did
not
fall
out
like
this
when
the
baron
positively
asserted
the
absolute
truth
of
the
rumours
of
the
great
reform
which
were
then
only
just
beginning
to
be
heard
stepan
trofimovitch
could
not
contain
himself
and
suddenly
shouted
hurrah
and
even
made
some
gesticulation
indicative
of
delight
his
ejaculation
was
not
overloud
and
quite
polite
his
delight
was
even
perhaps
premeditated
and
his
gesture
purposely
studied
before
the
lookingglass
half
an
hour
before
tea
but
something
must
have
been
amiss
with
it
for
the
baron
permitted
himself
a
faint
smile
though
he
at
once
with
extraordinary
courtesy
put
in
a
phrase
concerning
the
universal
and
befitting
emotion
of
all
russian
hearts
in
view
of
the
great
event
shortly
afterwards
he
took
his
leave
and
at
parting
did
not
forget
to
hold
out
two
fingers
to
stepan
trofimovitch
on
returning
to
the
drawingroom
varvara
petrovna
was
at
first
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
on
the
table
then
she
turned
to
stepan
trofimovitch
and
with
pale
face
and
flashing
eyes
she
hissed
in
a
whisper
i
shall
never
forgive
you
for
that
next
day
she
met
her
friend
as
though
nothing
had
happened
she
never
referred
to
the
incident
but
thirteen
years
afterwards
at
a
tragic
moment
she
recalled
it
and
reproached
him
with
it
and
she
turned
pale
just
as
she
had
done
thirteen
years
before
only
twice
in
the
course
of
her
life
did
she
say
to
him
i
shall
never
forgive
you
for
that
the
incident
with
the
baron
was
the
second
time
but
the
first
incident
was
so
characteristic
and
had
so
much
influence
on
the
fate
of
stepan
trofimovitch
that
i
venture
to
refer
to
that
too
it
was
in
1855
in
springtime
in
may
just
after
the
news
had
reached
skvoreshniki
of
the
death
of
lieutenantgeneral
stavrogin
a
frivolous
old
gentleman
who
died
of
a
stomach
ailment
on
the
way
to
the
crimea
where
he
was
hastening
to
join
the
army
on
active
service
varvara
petrovna
was
left
a
widow
and
put
on
deep
mourning
she
could
not
it
is
true
deplore
his
death
very
deeply
since
for
the
last
four
years
she
had
been
completely
separated
from
him
owing
to
incompatibility
of
temper
and
was
giving
him
an
allowance
the
lieutenantgeneral
himself
had
nothing
but
one
hundred
and
fifty
serfs
and
his
pay
besides
his
position
and
his
connections
all
the
money
and
skvoreshniki
belonged
to
varvara
petrovna
the
only
daughter
of
a
very
rich
contractor
yet
she
was
shocked
by
the
suddenness
of
the
news
and
retired
into
complete
solitude
stepan
trofimovitch
of
course
was
always
at
her
side
may
was
in
its
full
beauty
the
evenings
were
exquisite
the
wild
cherry
was
in
flower
the
two
friends
walked
every
evening
in
the
garden
and
used
to
sit
till
nightfall
in
the
arbour
and
pour
out
their
thoughts
and
feelings
to
one
another
they
had
poetic
moments
under
the
influence
of
the
change
in
her
position
varvara
petrovna
talked
more
than
usual
she
as
it
were
clung
to
the
heart
of
her
friend
and
this
continued
for
several
evenings
a
strange
idea
suddenly
came
over
stepan
trofimovitch
was
not
the
inconsolable
widow
reckoning
upon
him
and
expecting
from
him
when
her
mourning
was
over
the
offer
of
his
hand
a
cynical
idea
but
the
very
loftiness
of
a
mans
nature
sometimes
increases
a
disposition
to
cynical
ideas
if
only
from
the
manysidedness
of
his
culture
he
began
to
look
more
deeply
into
it
and
thought
it
seemed
like
it
he
pondered
her
fortune
is
immense
of
course
but
varvara
petrovna
certainly
could
not
be
called
a
beauty
she
was
a
tall
yellow
bony
woman
with
an
extremely
long
face
suggestive
of
a
horse
stepan
trofimovitch
hesitated
more
and
more
he
was
tortured
by
doubts
he
positively
shed
tears
of
indecision
once
or
twice
he
wept
not
infrequently
in
the
evenings
that
is
to
say
in
the
arbour
his
countenance
involuntarily
began
to
express
something
capricious
and
ironical
something
coquettish
and
at
the
same
time
condescending
this
is
apt
to
happen
as
it
were
by
accident
and
the
more
gentlemanly
the
man
the
more
noticeable
it
is
goodness
only
knows
what
one
is
to
think
about
it
but
its
most
likely
that
nothing
had
begun
working
in
her
heart
that
could
have
fully
justified
stepan
trofimovitchs
suspicions
moreover
she
would
not
have
changed
her
name
stavrogin
for
his
name
famous
as
it
was
perhaps
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
the
play
of
femininity
on
her
side
the
manifestation
of
an
unconscious
feminine
yearning
so
natural
in
some
extremely
feminine
types
however
i
wont
answer
for
it
the
depths
of
the
female
heart
have
not
been
explored
to
this
day
but
i
must
continue
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
she
soon
inwardly
guessed
the
significance
of
her
friends
strange
expression
she
was
quick
and
observant
and
he
was
sometimes
extremely
guileless
but
the
evenings
went
on
as
before
and
their
conversations
were
just
as
poetic
and
interesting
and
behold
on
one
occasion
at
nightfall
after
the
most
lively
and
poetical
conversation
they
parted
affectionately
warmly
pressing
each
others
hands
at
the
steps
of
the
lodge
where
stepan
trofimovitch
slept
every
summer
he
used
to
move
into
this
little
lodge
which
stood
adjoining
the
huge
seignorial
house
of
skvoreshniki
almost
in
the
garden
he
had
only
just
gone
in
and
in
restless
hesitation
taken
a
cigar
and
not
having
yet
lighted
it
was
standing
weary
and
motionless
before
the
open
window
gazing
at
the
light
feathery
white
clouds
gliding
around
the
bright
moon
when
suddenly
a
faint
rustle
made
him
start
and
turn
round
varvara
petrovna
whom
he
had
left
only
four
minutes
earlier
was
standing
before
him
again
her
yellow
face
was
almost
blue
her
lips
were
pressed
tightly
together
and
twitching
at
the
corners
for
ten
full
seconds
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
in
silence
with
a
firm
relentless
gaze
and
suddenly
whispered
rapidly
i
shall
never
forgive
you
for
this
when
ten
years
later
stepan
trofimovitch
after
closing
the
doors
told
me
this
melancholy
tale
in
a
whisper
he
vowed
that
he
had
been
so
petrified
on
the
spot
that
he
had
not
seen
or
heard
how
varvara
petrovna
had
disappeared
as
she
never
once
afterwards
alluded
to
the
incident
and
everything
went
on
as
though
nothing
had
happened
he
was
all
his
life
inclined
to
the
idea
that
it
was
all
an
hallucination
a
symptom
of
illness
the
more
so
as
he
was
actually
taken
ill
that
very
night
and
was
indisposed
for
a
fortnight
which
by
the
way
cut
short
the
interviews
in
the
arbour
but
in
spite
of
his
vague
theory
of
hallucination
he
seemed
every
day
all
his
life
to
be
expecting
the
continuation
and
so
to
say
the
dnouement
of
this
affair
he
could
not
believe
that
that
was
the
end
of
it
and
if
so
he
must
have
looked
strangely
sometimes
at
his
friend
v
she
had
herself
designed
the
costume
for
him
which
he
wore
for
the
rest
of
his
life
it
was
elegant
and
characteristic
a
long
black
frockcoat
buttoned
almost
to
the
top
but
stylishly
cut
a
soft
hat
in
summer
a
straw
hat
with
a
wide
brim
a
white
batiste
cravat
with
a
full
bow
and
hanging
ends
a
cane
with
a
silver
knob
his
hair
flowed
on
to
his
shoulders
it
was
dark
brown
and
only
lately
had
begun
to
get
a
little
grey
he
was
cleanshaven
he
was
said
to
have
been
very
handsome
in
his
youth
and
to
my
mind
he
was
still
an
exceptionally
impressive
figure
even
in
old
age
besides
who
can
talk
of
old
age
at
fiftythree
from
his
special
pose
as
a
patriot
however
he
did
not
try
to
appear
younger
but
seemed
rather
to
pride
himself
on
the
solidity
of
his
age
and
dressed
as
described
tall
and
thin
with
flowing
hair
he
looked
almost
like
a
patriarch
or
even
more
like
the
portrait
of
the
poet
kukolnik
engraved
in
the
edition
of
his
works
published
in
1830
or
thereabouts
this
resemblance
was
especially
striking
when
he
sat
in
the
garden
in
summertime
on
a
seat
under
a
bush
of
flowering
lilac
with
both
hands
propped
on
his
cane
and
an
open
book
beside
him
musing
poetically
over
the
setting
sun
in
regard
to
books
i
may
remark
that
he
came
in
later
years
rather
to
avoid
reading
but
that
was
only
quite
towards
the
end
the
papers
and
magazines
ordered
in
great
profusion
by
varvara
petrovna
he
was
continually
reading
he
never
lost
interest
in
the
successes
of
russian
literature
either
though
he
always
maintained
a
dignified
attitude
with
regard
to
them
he
was
at
one
time
engrossed
in
the
study
of
our
home
and
foreign
politics
but
he
soon
gave
up
the
undertaking
with
a
gesture
of
despair
it
sometimes
happened
that
he
would
take
de
tocqueville
with
him
into
the
garden
while
he
had
a
paul
de
kock
in
his
pocket
but
these
are
trivial
matters
i
must
observe
in
parenthesis
about
the
portrait
of
kukolnik
the
engraving
had
first
come
into
the
hands
of
varvara
petrovna
when
she
was
a
girl
in
a
highclass
boardingschool
in
moscow
she
fell
in
love
with
the
portrait
at
once
after
the
habit
of
all
girls
at
school
who
fall
in
love
with
anything
they
come
across
as
well
as
with
their
teachers
especially
the
drawing
and
writing
masters
what
is
interesting
in
this
though
is
not
the
characteristics
of
girls
but
the
fact
that
even
at
fifty
varvara
petrovna
kept
the
engraving
among
her
most
intimate
and
treasured
possessions
so
that
perhaps
it
was
only
on
this
account
that
she
had
designed
for
stepan
trofimovitch
a
costume
somewhat
like
the
poets
in
the
engraving
but
that
of
course
is
a
trifling
matter
too
for
the
first
years
or
more
accurately
for
the
first
half
of
the
time
he
spent
with
varvara
petrovna
stepan
trofimovitch
was
still
planning
a
book
and
every
day
seriously
prepared
to
write
it
but
during
the
later
period
he
must
have
forgotten
even
what
he
had
done
more
and
more
frequently
he
used
to
say
to
us
i
seem
to
be
ready
for
work
my
materials
are
collected
yet
the
work
doesnt
get
done
nothing
is
done
and
he
would
bow
his
head
dejectedly
no
doubt
this
was
calculated
to
increase
his
prestige
in
our
eyes
as
a
martyr
to
science
but
he
himself
was
longing
for
something
else
they
have
forgotten
me
im
no
use
to
anyone
broke
from
him
more
than
once
this
intensified
depression
took
special
hold
of
him
towards
the
end
of
the
fifties
varvara
petrovna
realised
at
last
that
it
was
a
serious
matter
besides
she
could
not
endure
the
idea
that
her
friend
was
forgotten
and
useless
to
distract
him
and
at
the
same
time
to
renew
his
fame
she
carried
him
off
to
moscow
where
she
had
fashionable
acquaintances
in
the
literary
and
scientific
world
but
it
appeared
that
moscow
too
was
unsatisfactory
it
was
a
peculiar
time
something
new
was
beginning
quite
unlike
the
stagnation
of
the
past
something
very
strange
too
though
it
was
felt
everywhere
even
at
skvoreshniki
rumours
of
all
sorts
reached
us
the
facts
were
generally
more
or
less
well
known
but
it
was
evident
that
in
addition
to
the
facts
there
were
certain
ideas
accompanying
them
and
whats
more
a
great
number
of
them
and
this
was
perplexing
it
was
impossible
to
estimate
and
find
out
exactly
what
was
the
drift
of
these
ideas
varvara
petrovna
was
prompted
by
the
feminine
composition
of
her
character
to
a
compelling
desire
to
penetrate
the
secret
of
them
she
took
to
reading
newspapers
and
magazines
prohibited
publications
printed
abroad
and
even
the
revolutionary
manifestoes
which
were
just
beginning
to
appear
at
the
time
she
was
able
to
procure
them
all
but
this
only
set
her
head
in
a
whirl
she
fell
to
writing
letters
she
got
few
answers
and
they
grew
more
incomprehensible
as
time
went
on
stepan
trofimovitch
was
solemnly
called
upon
to
explain
these
ideas
to
her
once
for
all
but
she
remained
distinctly
dissatisfied
with
his
explanations
stepan
trofimovitchs
view
of
the
general
movement
was
supercilious
in
the
extreme
in
his
eyes
all
it
amounted
to
was
that
he
was
forgotten
and
of
no
use
at
last
his
name
was
mentioned
at
first
in
periodicals
published
abroad
as
that
of
an
exiled
martyr
and
immediately
afterwards
in
petersburg
as
that
of
a
former
star
in
a
celebrated
constellation
he
was
even
for
some
reason
compared
with
radishtchev
then
someone
printed
the
statement
that
he
was
dead
and
promised
an
obituary
notice
of
him
stepan
trofimovitch
instantly
perked
up
and
assumed
an
air
of
immense
dignity
all
his
disdain
for
his
contemporaries
evaporated
and
he
began
to
cherish
the
dream
of
joining
the
movement
and
showing
his
powers
varvara
petrovnas
faith
in
everything
instantly
revived
and
she
was
thrown
into
a
violent
ferment
it
was
decided
to
go
to
petersburg
without
a
moments
delay
to
find
out
everything
on
the
spot
to
go
into
everything
personally
and
if
possible
to
throw
themselves
heart
and
soul
into
the
new
movement
among
other
things
she
announced
that
she
was
prepared
to
found
a
magazine
of
her
own
and
henceforward
to
devote
her
whole
life
to
it
seeing
what
it
had
come
to
stepan
trofimovitch
became
more
condescending
than
ever
and
on
the
journey
began
to
behave
almost
patronisingly
to
varvara
petrovnawhich
she
at
once
laid
up
in
her
heart
against
him
she
had
however
another
very
important
reason
for
the
trip
which
was
to
renew
her
connections
in
higher
spheres
it
was
necessary
as
far
as
she
could
to
remind
the
world
of
her
existence
or
at
any
rate
to
make
an
attempt
to
do
so
the
ostensible
object
of
the
journey
was
to
see
her
only
son
who
was
just
finishing
his
studies
at
a
petersburg
lyceum
vi
they
spent
almost
the
whole
winter
season
in
petersburg
but
by
lent
everything
burst
like
a
rainbowcoloured
soapbubble
their
dreams
were
dissipated
and
the
muddle
far
from
being
cleared
up
had
become
even
more
revoltingly
incomprehensible
to
begin
with
connections
with
the
higher
spheres
were
not
established
or
only
on
a
microscopic
scale
and
by
humiliating
exertions
in
her
mortification
varvara
petrovna
threw
herself
heart
and
soul
into
the
new
ideas
and
began
giving
evening
receptions
she
invited
literary
people
and
they
were
brought
to
her
at
once
in
multitudes
afterwards
they
came
of
themselves
without
invitation
one
brought
another
never
had
she
seen
such
literary
men
they
were
incredibly
vain
but
quite
open
in
their
vanity
as
though
they
were
performing
a
duty
by
the
display
of
it
some
but
by
no
means
all
of
them
even
turned
up
intoxicated
seeming
however
to
detect
in
this
a
peculiar
only
recently
discovered
merit
they
were
all
strangely
proud
of
something
on
every
face
was
written
that
they
had
only
just
discovered
some
extremely
important
secret
they
abused
one
another
and
took
credit
to
themselves
for
it
it
was
rather
difficult
to
find
out
what
they
had
written
exactly
but
among
them
there
were
critics
novelists
dramatists
satirists
and
exposers
of
abuses
stepan
trofimovitch
penetrated
into
their
very
highest
circle
from
which
the
movement
was
directed
incredible
heights
had
to
be
scaled
to
reach
this
group
but
they
gave
him
a
cordial
welcome
though
of
course
no
one
of
them
had
ever
heard
of
him
or
knew
anything
about
him
except
that
he
represented
an
idea
his
manoeuvres
among
them
were
so
successful
that
he
got
them
twice
to
varvara
petrovnas
salon
in
spite
of
their
olympian
grandeur
these
people
were
very
serious
and
very
polite
they
behaved
nicely
the
others
were
evidently
afraid
of
them
but
it
was
obvious
that
they
had
no
time
to
spare
two
or
three
former
literary
celebrities
who
happened
to
be
in
petersburg
and
with
whom
varvara
petrovna
had
long
maintained
a
most
refined
correspondence
came
also
but
to
her
surprise
these
genuine
and
quite
indubitable
celebrities
were
stiller
than
water
humbler
than
the
grass
and
some
of
them
simply
hung
on
to
this
new
rabble
and
were
shamefully
cringing
before
them
at
first
stepan
trofimovitch
was
a
success
people
caught
at
him
and
began
to
exhibit
him
at
public
literary
gatherings
the
first
time
he
came
on
to
the
platform
at
some
public
reading
in
which
he
was
to
take
part
he
was
received
with
enthusiastic
clapping
which
lasted
for
five
minutes
he
recalled
this
with
tears
nine
years
afterwards
though
rather
from
his
natural
artistic
sensibility
than
from
gratitude
i
swear
and
im
ready
to
bet
he
declared
but
only
to
me
and
in
secret
that
not
one
of
that
audience
knew
anything
whatever
about
me
a
noteworthy
admission
he
must
have
had
a
keen
intelligence
since
he
was
capable
of
grasping
his
position
so
clearly
even
on
the
platform
even
in
such
a
state
of
exaltation
it
also
follows
that
he
had
not
a
keen
intelligence
if
nine
years
afterwards
he
could
not
recall
it
without
mortification
he
was
made
to
sign
two
or
three
collective
protests
against
what
he
did
not
know
he
signed
them
varvara
petrovna
too
was
made
to
protest
against
some
disgraceful
action
and
she
signed
too
the
majority
of
these
new
people
however
though
they
visited
varvara
petrovna
felt
themselves
for
some
reason
called
upon
to
regard
her
with
contempt
and
with
undisguised
irony
stepan
trofimovitch
hinted
to
me
at
bitter
moments
afterwards
that
it
was
from
that
time
she
had
been
envious
of
him
she
saw
of
course
that
she
could
not
get
on
with
these
people
yet
she
received
them
eagerly
with
all
the
hysterical
impatience
of
her
sex
and
what
is
more
she
expected
something
at
her
parties
she
talked
little
although
she
could
talk
but
she
listened
the
more
they
talked
of
the
abolition
of
the
censorship
and
of
phonetic
spelling
of
the
substitution
of
the
latin
characters
for
the
russian
alphabet
of
someones
having
been
sent
into
exile
the
day
before
of
some
scandal
of
the
advantage
of
splitting
russia
into
nationalities
united
in
a
free
federation
of
the
abolition
of
the
army
and
the
navy
of
the
restoration
of
poland
as
far
as
the
dnieper
of
the
peasant
reforms
and
of
the
manifestoes
of
the
abolition
of
the
hereditary
principle
of
the
family
of
children
and
of
priests
of
womens
rights
of
kraevskys
house
for
which
no
one
ever
seemed
able
to
forgive
mr
kraevsky
and
so
on
and
so
on
it
was
evident
that
in
this
mob
of
new
people
there
were
many
impostors
but
undoubtedly
there
were
also
many
honest
and
very
attractive
people
in
spite
of
some
surprising
characteristics
in
them
the
honest
ones
were
far
more
difficult
to
understand
than
the
coarse
and
dishonest
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
which
was
being
made
a
tool
of
by
the
other
when
varvara
petrovna
announced
her
idea
of
founding
a
magazine
people
flocked
to
her
in
even
larger
numbers
but
charges
of
being
a
capitalist
and
an
exploiter
of
labour
were
showered
upon
her
to
her
face
the
rudeness
of
these
accusations
was
only
equalled
by
their
unexpectedness
the
aged
general
ivan
ivanovitch
drozdov
an
old
friend
and
comrade
of
the
late
general
stavrogins
known
to
us
all
here
as
an
extremely
stubborn
and
irritable
though
very
estimable
man
in
his
own
way
of
course
who
ate
a
great
deal
and
was
dreadfully
afraid
of
atheism
quarrelled
at
one
of
varvara
petrovnas
parties
with
a
distinguished
young
man
the
latter
at
the
first
word
exclaimed
you
must
be
a
general
if
you
talk
like
that
meaning
that
he
could
find
no
word
of
abuse
worse
than
general
ivan
ivanovitch
flew
into
a
terrible
passion
yes
sir
i
am
a
general
and
a
lieutenantgeneral
and
i
have
served
my
tsar
and
you
sir
are
a
puppy
and
an
infidel
an
outrageous
scene
followed
next
day
the
incident
was
exposed
in
print
and
they
began
getting
up
a
collective
protest
against
varvara
petrovnas
disgraceful
conduct
in
not
having
immediately
turned
the
general
out
in
an
illustrated
paper
there
appeared
a
malignant
caricature
in
which
varvara
petrovna
stepan
trofimovitch
and
general
drozdov
were
depicted
as
three
reactionary
friends
there
were
verses
attached
to
this
caricature
written
by
a
popular
poet
especially
for
the
occasion
i
may
observe
for
my
own
part
that
many
persons
of
generals
rank
certainly
have
an
absurd
habit
of
saying
i
have
served
my
tsarjust
as
though
they
had
not
the
same
tsar
as
all
the
rest
of
us
their
simple
fellowsubjects
but
had
a
special
tsar
of
their
own
it
was
impossible
of
course
to
remain
any
longer
in
petersburg
all
the
more
so
as
stepan
trofimovitch
was
overtaken
by
a
complete
fiasco
he
could
not
resist
talking
of
the
claims
of
art
and
they
laughed
at
him
more
loudly
as
time
went
on
at
his
last
lecture
he
thought
to
impress
them
with
patriotic
eloquence
hoping
to
touch
their
hearts
and
reckoning
on
the
respect
inspired
by
his
persecution
he
did
not
attempt
to
dispute
the
uselessness
and
absurdity
of
the
word
fatherland
acknowledged
the
pernicious
influence
of
religion
but
firmly
and
loudly
declared
that
boots
were
of
less
consequence
than
pushkin
of
much
less
indeed
he
was
hissed
so
mercilessly
that
he
burst
into
tears
there
and
then
on
the
platform
varvara
petrovna
took
him
home
more
dead
than
alive
on
ma
trait
comme
un
vieux
bonnet
de
coton
he
babbled
senselessly
she
was
looking
after
him
all
night
giving
him
laureldrops
and
repeating
to
him
till
daybreak
you
will
still
be
of
use
you
will
still
make
your
mark
you
will
be
appreciated

in
another
place
early
next
morning
five
literary
men
called
on
varvara
petrovna
three
of
them
complete
strangers
whom
she
had
never
set
eyes
on
before
with
a
stern
air
they
informed
her
that
they
had
looked
into
the
question
of
her
magazine
and
had
brought
her
their
decision
on
the
subject
varvara
petrovna
had
never
authorised
anyone
to
look
into
or
decide
anything
concerning
her
magazine
their
decision
was
that
having
founded
the
magazine
she
should
at
once
hand
it
over
to
them
with
the
capital
to
run
it
on
the
basis
of
a
cooperative
society
she
herself
was
to
go
back
to
skvoreshniki
not
forgetting
to
take
with
her
stepan
trofimovitch
who
was
out
of
date
from
delicacy
they
agreed
to
recognise
the
right
of
property
in
her
case
and
to
send
her
every
year
a
sixth
part
of
the
net
profits
what
was
most
touching
about
it
was
that
of
these
five
men
four
certainly
were
not
actuated
by
any
mercenary
motive
and
were
simply
acting
in
the
interests
of
the
cause
we
came
away
utterly
at
a
loss
stepan
trofimovitch
used
to
say
afterwards
i
couldnt
make
head
or
tail
of
it
and
kept
muttering
i
remember
to
the
rumble
of
the
train
vyek
and
vyek
and
lyov
kambek
lyov
kambek
and
vyek
and
vyek
and
goodness
knows
what
all
the
way
to
moscow
it
was
only
in
moscow
that
i
came
to
myselfas
though
we
really
might
find
something
different
there
oh
my
friends
he
would
exclaim
to
us
sometimes
with
fervour
you
cannot
imagine
what
wrath
and
sadness
overcome
your
whole
soul
when
a
great
idea
which
you
have
long
cherished
as
holy
is
caught
up
by
the
ignorant
and
dragged
forth
before
fools
like
themselves
into
the
street
and
you
suddenly
meet
it
in
the
market
unrecognisable
in
the
mud
absurdly
set
up
without
proportion
without
harmony
the
plaything
of
foolish
louts
no
in
our
day
it
was
not
so
and
it
was
not
this
for
which
we
strove
no
no
not
this
at
all
i
dont
recognise
it
our
day
will
come
again
and
will
turn
all
the
tottering
fabric
of
today
into
a
true
path
if
not
what
will
happen
vii
immediately
on
their
return
from
petersburg
varvara
petrovna
sent
her
friend
abroad
to
recruit
and
indeed
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
part
for
a
time
she
felt
that
stepan
trofimovitch
was
delighted
to
go
there
i
shall
revive
he
exclaimed
there
at
last
i
shall
set
to
work
but
in
the
first
of
his
letters
from
berlin
he
struck
his
usual
note
my
heart
is
broken
he
wrote
to
varvara
petrovna
i
can
forget
nothing
here
in
berlin
everything
brings
back
to
me
my
old
past
my
first
raptures
and
my
first
agonies
where
is
she
where
are
they
both
where
are
you
two
angels
of
whom
i
was
never
worthy
where
is
my
son
my
beloved
son
and
last
of
all
where
am
i
where
is
my
old
self
strong
as
steel
firm
as
a
rock
when
now
some
andreev
our
orthodox
clown
with
a
beard
peut
briser
mon
existence
en
deuxand
so
on
as
for
stepan
trofimovitchs
son
he
had
only
seen
him
twice
in
his
life
the
first
time
when
he
was
born
and
the
second
time
lately
in
petersburg
where
the
young
man
was
preparing
to
enter
the
university
the
boy
had
been
all
his
life
as
we
have
said
already
brought
up
by
his
aunts
at
varvara
petrovnas
expense
in
a
remote
province
nearly
six
hundred
miles
from
skvoreshniki
as
for
andreev
he
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
our
local
shopkeeper
a
very
eccentric
fellow
a
selftaught
archologist
who
had
a
passion
for
collecting
russian
antiquities
and
sometimes
tried
to
outshine
stepan
trofimovitch
in
erudition
and
in
the
progressiveness
of
his
opinions
this
worthy
shopkeeper
with
a
grey
beard
and
silverrimmed
spectacles
still
owed
stepan
trofimovitch
four
hundred
roubles
for
some
acres
of
timber
he
had
bought
on
the
latters
little
estate
near
skvoreshniki
though
varvara
petrovna
had
liberally
provided
her
friend
with
funds
when
she
sent
him
to
berlin
yet
stepan
trofimovitch
had
before
starting
particularly
reckoned
on
getting
that
four
hundred
roubles
probably
for
his
secret
expenditure
and
was
ready
to
cry
when
andreev
asked
leave
to
defer
payment
for
a
month
which
he
had
a
right
to
do
since
he
had
brought
the
first
installments
of
the
money
almost
six
months
in
advance
to
meet
stepan
trofimovitchs
special
need
at
the
time
varvara
petrovna
read
this
first
letter
greedily
and
underlining
in
pencil
the
exclamation
where
are
they
both
numbered
it
and
put
it
away
in
a
drawer
he
had
of
course
referred
to
his
two
deceased
wives
the
second
letter
she
received
from
berlin
was
in
a
different
strain
i
am
working
twelve
hours
out
of
the
twentyfour
eleven
would
be
enough
muttered
varvara
petrovna
im
rummaging
in
the
libraries
collating
copying
rushing
about
ive
visited
the
professors
i
have
renewed
my
acquaintance
with
the
delightful
dundasov
family
what
a
charming
creature
lizaveta
nikolaevna
is
even
now
she
sends
you
her
greetings
her
young
husband
and
three
nephews
are
all
in
berlin
i
sit
up
talking
till
daybreak
with
the
young
people
and
we
have
almost
athenian
evenings
athenian
i
mean
only
in
their
intellectual
subtlety
and
refinement
everything
is
in
noble
style
a
great
deal
of
music
spanish
airs
dreams
of
the
regeneration
of
all
humanity
ideas
of
eternal
beauty
of
the
sistine
madonna
light
interspersed
with
darkness
but
there
are
spots
even
on
the
sun
oh
my
friend
my
noble
faithful
friend
in
heart
i
am
with
you
and
am
yours
with
you
alone
always
en
tout
pays
even
in
le
pays
de
makar
et
de
ses
veaux
of
which
we
often
used
to
talk
in
agitation
in
petersburg
do
you
remember
before
we
came
away
i
think
of
it
with
a
smile
crossing
the
frontier
i
felt
myself
in
safety
a
sensation
strange
and
new
for
the
first
time
after
so
many
yearsand
so
on
and
so
on
come
its
all
nonsense
varvara
petrovna
commented
folding
up
that
letter
too
if
hes
up
till
daybreak
with
his
athenian
nights
he
isnt
at
his
books
for
twelve
hours
a
day
was
he
drunk
when
he
wrote
it
that
dundasov
woman
dares
to
send
me
greetings
but
there
let
him
amuse
himself
the
phrase
dans
le
pays
de
makar
et
de
ses
veaux
meant
wherever
makar
may
drive
his
calves
stepan
trofimovitch
sometimes
purposely
translated
russian
proverbs
and
traditional
sayings
into
french
in
the
most
stupid
way
though
no
doubt
he
was
able
to
understand
and
translate
them
better
but
he
did
it
from
a
feeling
that
it
was
chic
and
thought
it
witty
but
he
did
not
amuse
himself
for
long
he
could
not
hold
out
for
four
months
and
was
soon
flying
back
to
skvoreshniki
his
last
letters
consisted
of
nothing
but
outpourings
of
the
most
sentimental
love
for
his
absent
friend
and
were
literally
wet
with
tears
there
are
natures
extremely
attached
to
home
like
lapdogs
the
meeting
of
the
friends
was
enthusiastic
within
two
days
everything
was
as
before
and
even
duller
than
before
my
friend
stepan
trofimovitch
said
to
me
a
fortnight
after
in
dead
secret
i
have
discovered
something
awful
for
me
something
new
je

viii
after
this
we
had
a
period
of
stagnation
which
lasted
nine
years
the
hysterical
outbreaks
and
sobbings
on
my
shoulder
that
recurred
at
regular
intervals
did
not
in
the
least
mar
our
prosperity
i
wonder
that
stepan
trofimovitch
did
not
grow
stout
during
this
period
his
nose
was
a
little
redder
and
his
manner
had
gained
in
urbanity
that
was
all
by
degrees
a
circle
of
friends
had
formed
around
him
although
it
was
never
a
very
large
one
though
varvara
petrovna
had
little
to
do
with
the
circle
yet
we
all
recognised
her
as
our
patroness
after
the
lesson
she
had
received
in
petersburg
she
settled
down
in
our
town
for
good
in
winter
she
lived
in
her
town
house
and
spent
the
summer
on
her
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
she
had
never
enjoyed
so
much
consequence
and
prestige
in
our
provincial
society
as
during
the
last
seven
years
of
this
period
that
is
up
to
the
time
of
the
appointment
of
our
present
governor
our
former
governor
the
mild
ivan
ossipovitch
who
will
never
be
forgotten
among
us
was
a
near
relation
of
varvara
petrovnas
and
had
at
one
time
been
under
obligations
to
her
his
wife
trembled
at
the
very
thought
of
displeasing
her
while
the
homage
paid
her
by
provincial
society
was
carried
almost
to
a
pitch
that
suggested
idolatry
so
stepan
trofimovitch
too
had
a
good
time
he
was
a
member
of
the
club
lost
at
cards
majestically
and
was
everywhere
treated
with
respect
though
many
people
regarded
him
only
as
a
learned
man
later
on
when
varvara
petrovna
allowed
him
to
live
in
a
separate
house
we
enjoyed
greater
freedom
than
before
twice
a
week
we
used
to
meet
at
his
house
we
were
a
merry
party
especially
when
he
was
not
sparing
of
the
champagne
the
wine
came
from
the
shop
of
the
same
andreev
the
bill
was
paid
twice
a
year
by
varvara
petrovna
and
on
the
day
it
was
paid
stepan
trofimovitch
almost
invariably
suffered
from
an
attack
of
his
summer
cholera
one
of
the
first
members
of
our
circle
was
liputin
an
elderly
provincial
official
and
a
great
liberal
who
was
reputed
in
the
town
to
be
an
atheist
he
had
married
for
the
second
time
a
young
and
pretty
wife
with
a
dowry
and
had
besides
three
grownup
daughters
he
brought
up
his
family
in
the
fear
of
god
and
kept
a
tight
hand
over
them
he
was
extremely
stingy
and
out
of
his
salary
had
bought
himself
a
house
and
amassed
a
fortune
he
was
an
uncomfortable
sort
of
man
and
had
not
been
in
the
service
he
was
not
much
respected
in
the
town
and
was
not
received
in
the
best
circles
moreover
he
was
a
scandalmonger
and
had
more
than
once
had
to
smart
for
his
backbiting
for
which
he
had
been
badly
punished
by
an
officer
and
again
by
a
country
gentleman
the
respectable
head
of
a
family
but
we
liked
his
wit
his
inquiring
mind
his
peculiar
malicious
liveliness
varvara
petrovna
disliked
him
but
he
always
knew
how
to
make
up
to
her
nor
did
she
care
for
shatov
who
became
one
of
our
circle
during
the
last
years
of
this
period
shatov
had
been
a
student
and
had
been
expelled
from
the
university
after
some
disturbance
in
his
childhood
he
had
been
a
student
of
stepan
trofimovitchs
and
was
by
birth
a
serf
of
varvara
petrovnas
the
son
of
a
former
valet
of
hers
pavel
fyodoritch
and
was
greatly
indebted
to
her
bounty
she
disliked
him
for
his
pride
and
ingratitude
and
could
never
forgive
him
for
not
having
come
straight
to
her
on
his
expulsion
from
the
university
on
the
contrary
he
had
not
even
answered
the
letter
she
had
expressly
sent
him
at
the
time
and
preferred
to
be
a
drudge
in
the
family
of
a
merchant
of
the
new
style
with
whom
he
went
abroad
looking
after
his
children
more
in
the
position
of
a
nurse
than
of
a
tutor
he
was
very
eager
to
travel
at
the
time
the
children
had
a
governess
too
a
lively
young
russian
lady
who
also
became
one
of
the
household
on
the
eve
of
their
departure
and
had
been
engaged
chiefly
because
she
was
so
cheap
two
months
later
the
merchant
turned
her
out
of
the
house
for
free
thinking
shatov
took
himself
off
after
her
and
soon
afterwards
married
her
in
geneva
they
lived
together
about
three
weeks
and
then
parted
as
free
people
recognising
no
bonds
though
no
doubt
also
through
poverty
he
wandered
about
europe
alone
for
a
long
time
afterwards
living
god
knows
how
he
is
said
to
have
blacked
boots
in
the
street
and
to
have
been
a
porter
in
some
dockyard
at
last
a
year
before
he
had
returned
to
his
native
place
among
us
and
settled
with
an
old
aunt
whom
he
buried
a
month
later
his
sister
dasha
who
had
also
been
brought
up
by
varvara
petrovna
was
a
favourite
of
hers
and
treated
with
respect
and
consideration
in
her
house
he
saw
his
sister
rarely
and
was
not
on
intimate
terms
with
her
in
our
circle
he
was
always
sullen
and
never
talkative
but
from
time
to
time
when
his
convictions
were
touched
upon
he
became
morbidly
irritable
and
very
unrestrained
in
his
language

has
to
tie
shatov
up
and
then
argue
with
him
stepan
trofimovitch
would
sometimes
say
in
joke
but
he
liked
him
shatov
had
radically
changed
some
of
his
former
socialistic
convictions
abroad
and
had
rushed
to
the
opposite
extreme
he
was
one
of
those
idealistic
beings
common
in
russia
who
are
suddenly
struck
by
some
overmastering
idea
which
seems
as
it
were
to
crush
them
at
once
and
sometimes
forever
they
are
never
equal
to
coping
with
it
but
put
passionate
faith
in
it
and
their
whole
life
passes
afterwards
as
it
were
in
the
last
agonies
under
the
weight
of
the
stone
that
has
fallen
upon
them
and
half
crushed
them
in
appearance
shatov
was
in
complete
harmony
with
his
convictions
he
was
short
awkward
had
a
shock
of
flaxen
hair
broad
shoulders
thick
lips
very
thick
overhanging
white
eyebrows
a
wrinkled
forehead
and
a
hostile
obstinately
downcast
as
it
were
shamefaced
expression
in
his
eyes
his
hair
was
always
in
a
wild
tangle
and
stood
up
in
a
shock
which
nothing
could
smooth
he
was
seven
or
eightandtwenty
i
no
longer
wonder
that
his
wife
ran
away
from
him
varvara
petrovna
enunciated
on
one
occasion
after
gazing
intently
at
him
he
tried
to
be
neat
in
his
dress
in
spite
of
his
extreme
poverty
he
refrained
again
from
appealing
to
varvara
petrovna
and
struggled
along
as
best
he
could
doing
various
jobs
for
tradespeople
at
one
time
he
served
in
a
shop
at
another
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
as
an
assistant
clerk
on
a
freight
steamer
but
he
fell
ill
just
at
the
time
of
sailing
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
poverty
he
was
capable
of
enduring
without
thinking
about
it
at
all
after
his
illness
varvara
petrovna
sent
him
a
hundred
roubles
anonymously
and
in
secret
he
found
out
the
secret
however
and
after
some
reflection
took
the
money
and
went
to
varvara
petrovna
to
thank
her
she
received
him
with
warmth
but
on
this
occasion
too
he
shamefully
disappointed
her
he
only
stayed
five
minutes
staring
blankly
at
the
ground
and
smiling
stupidly
in
profound
silence
and
suddenly
at
the
most
interesting
point
without
listening
to
what
she
was
saying
he
got
up
made
an
uncouth
sideways
bow
helpless
with
confusion
caught
against
the
ladys
expensive
inlaid
worktable
upsetting
it
on
the
floor
and
smashing
it
to
atoms
and
walked
out
nearly
dead
with
shame
liputin
blamed
him
severely
afterwards
for
having
accepted
the
hundred
roubles
and
having
even
gone
to
thank
varvara
petrovna
for
them
instead
of
having
returned
the
money
with
contempt
because
it
had
come
from
his
former
despotic
mistress
he
lived
in
solitude
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
did
not
like
any
of
us
to
go
and
see
him
he
used
to
turn
up
invariably
at
stepan
trofimovitchs
evenings
and
borrowed
newspapers
and
books
from
him
there
was
another
young
man
who
always
came
one
virginsky
a
clerk
in
the
service
here
who
had
something
in
common
with
shatov
though
on
the
surface
he
seemed
his
complete
opposite
in
every
respect
he
was
a
family
man
too
he
was
a
pathetic
and
very
quiet
young
man
though
he
was
thirty
he
had
considerable
education
though
he
was
chiefly
selftaught
he
was
poor
married
and
in
the
service
and
supported
the
aunt
and
sister
of
his
wife
his
wife
and
all
the
ladies
of
his
family
professed
the
very
latest
convictions
but
in
rather
a
crude
form
it
was
a
case
of
an
idea
dragged
forth
into
the
street
as
stepan
trofimovitch
had
expressed
it
upon
a
former
occasion
they
got
it
all
out
of
books
and
at
the
first
hint
coming
from
any
of
our
little
progressive
corners
in
petersburg
they
were
prepared
to
throw
anything
overboard
so
soon
as
they
were
advised
to
do
so
madame
virginsky
practised
as
a
midwife
in
the
town
she
had
lived
a
long
while
in
petersburg
as
a
girl
virginsky
himself
was
a
man
of
rare
singleheartedness
and
i
have
seldom
met
more
honest
fervour
i
will
never
never
abandon
these
bright
hopes
he
used
to
say
to
me
with
shining
eyes
of
these
bright
hopes
he
always
spoke
quietly
in
a
blissful
halfwhisper
as
it
were
secretly
he
was
rather
tall
but
extremely
thin
and
narrowshouldered
and
had
extraordinarily
lank
hair
of
a
reddish
hue
all
stepan
trofimovitchs
condescending
gibes
at
some
of
his
opinions
he
accepted
mildly
answered
him
sometimes
very
seriously
and
often
nonplussed
him
stepan
trofimovitch
treated
him
very
kindly
and
indeed
he
behaved
like
a
father
to
all
of
us
you
are
all
halfhearted
chickens
he
observed
to
virginsky
in
joke
all
who
are
like
you
though
in
you
virginsky
i
have
not
observed
that
narrowmindedness
i
found
in
petersburg
chez
ces
sminaristes
but
youre
a
halfhatched
chicken
all
the
same
shatov
would
give
anything
to
hatch
out
but
hes
halfhatched
too
and
i
liputin
inquired
youre
simply
the
golden
mean
which
will
get
on
anywhere
in
its
own
way
liputin
was
offended
the
story
was
told
of
virginsky
and
it
was
unhappily
only
too
true
that
before
his
wife
had
spent
a
year
in
lawful
wedlock
with
him
she
announced
that
he
was
superseded
and
that
she
preferred
lebyadkin
this
lebyadkin
a
stranger
to
the
town
turned
out
afterwards
to
be
a
very
dubious
character
and
not
a
retired
captain
as
he
represented
himself
to
be
he
could
do
nothing
but
twist
his
moustache
drink
and
chatter
the
most
inept
nonsense
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
this
fellow
who
was
utterly
lacking
in
delicacy
at
once
settled
in
his
house
glad
to
live
at
another
mans
expense
ate
and
slept
there
and
came
in
the
end
to
treating
the
master
of
the
house
with
condescension
it
was
asserted
that
when
virginskys
wife
had
announced
to
him
that
he
was
superseded
he
said
to
her
my
dear
hitherto
i
have
only
loved
you
but
now
i
respect
you
but
i
doubt
whether
this
renunciation
worthy
of
ancient
rome
was
ever
really
uttered
on
the
contrary
they
say
that
he
wept
violently
a
fortnight
after
he
was
superseded
all
of
them
in
a
family
party
went
one
day
for
a
picnic
to
a
wood
outside
the
town
to
drink
tea
with
their
friends
virginsky
was
in
a
feverishly
lively
mood
and
took
part
in
the
dances
but
suddenly
without
any
preliminary
quarrel
he
seized
the
giant
lebyadkin
with
both
hands
by
the
hair
just
as
the
latter
was
dancing
a
cancan
solo
pushed
him
down
and
began
dragging
him
along
with
shrieks
shouts
and
tears
the
giant
was
so
panicstricken
that
he
did
not
attempt
to
defend
himself
and
hardly
uttered
a
sound
all
the
time
he
was
being
dragged
along
but
afterwards
he
resented
it
with
all
the
heat
of
an
honourable
man
virginsky
spent
a
whole
night
on
his
knees
begging
his
wifes
forgiveness
but
this
forgiveness
was
not
granted
as
he
refused
to
apologise
to
lebyadkin
moreover
he
was
upbraided
for
the
meanness
of
his
ideas
and
his
foolishness
the
latter
charge
based
on
the
fact
that
he
knelt
down
in
the
interview
with
his
wife
the
captain
soon
disappeared
and
did
not
reappear
in
our
town
till
quite
lately
when
he
came
with
his
sister
and
with
entirely
different
aims
but
of
him
later
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
poor
young
husband
sought
our
society
and
found
comfort
in
it
but
he
never
spoke
of
his
homelife
to
us
on
one
occasion
only
returning
with
me
from
stepan
trofimovitchs
he
made
a
remote
allusion
to
his
position
but
clutching
my
hand
at
once
he
cried
ardently
its
of
no
consequence
its
only
a
personal
incident
its
no
hindrance
to
the
cause
not
the
slightest
stray
guests
visited
our
circle
too
a
jew
called
lyamshin
and
a
captain
kartusov
came
an
old
gentleman
of
inquiring
mind
used
to
come
at
one
time
but
he
died
liputin
brought
an
exiled
polish
priest
called
slontsevsky
and
for
a
time
we
received
him
on
principle
but
afterwards
we
didnt
keep
it
up
ix
at
one
time
it
was
reported
about
the
town
that
our
little
circle
was
a
hotbed
of
nihilism
profligacy
and
godlessness
and
the
rumour
gained
more
and
more
strength
and
yet
we
did
nothing
but
indulge
in
the
most
harmless
agreeable
typically
russian
lighthearted
liberal
chatter
the
higher
liberalism
and
the
higher
liberal
that
is
a
liberal
without
any
definite
aim
is
only
possible
in
russia
stepan
trofimovitch
like
every
witty
man
needed
a
listener
and
besides
that
he
needed
the
consciousness
that
he
was
fulfilling
the
lofty
duty
of
disseminating
ideas
and
finally
he
had
to
have
someone
to
drink
champagne
with
and
over
the
wine
to
exchange
lighthearted
views
of
a
certain
sort
about
russia
and
the
russian
spirit
about
god
in
general
and
the
russian
god
in
particular
to
repeat
for
the
hundredth
time
the
same
russian
scandalous
stories
that
every
one
knew
and
every
one
repeated
we
had
no
distaste
for
the
gossip
of
the
town
which
often
indeed
led
us
to
the
most
severe
and
loftily
moral
verdicts
we
fell
into
generalising
about
humanity
made
stern
reflections
on
the
future
of
europe
and
mankind
in
general
authoritatively
predicted
that
after
csarism
france
would
at
once
sink
into
the
position
of
a
secondrate
power
and
were
firmly
convinced
that
this
might
terribly
easily
and
quickly
come
to
pass
we
had
long
ago
predicted
that
the
pope
would
play
the
part
of
a
simple
archbishop
in
a
united
italy
and
were
firmly
convinced
that
this
thousandyearold
question
had
in
our
age
of
humanitarianism
industry
and
railways
become
a
trifling
matter
but
of
course
russian
higher
liberalism
could
not
look
at
the
question
in
any
other
way
stepan
trofimovitch
sometimes
talked
of
art
and
very
well
though
rather
abstractly
he
sometimes
spoke
of
the
friends
of
his
youthall
names
noteworthy
in
the
history
of
russian
progress
he
talked
of
them
with
emotion
and
reverence
though
sometimes
with
envy
if
we
were
very
much
bored
the
jew
lyamshin
a
little
postoffice
clerk
a
wonderful
performer
on
the
piano
sat
down
to
play
and
in
the
intervals
would
imitate
a
pig
a
thunderstorm
a
confinement
with
the
first
cry
of
the
baby
and
so
on
and
so
on
it
was
only
for
this
that
he
was
invited
indeed
if
we
had
drunk
a
great
dealand
that
did
happen
sometimes
though
not
oftenwe
flew
into
raptures
and
even
on
one
occasion
sang
the
marseillaise
in
chorus
to
the
accompaniment
of
lyamshin
though
i
dont
know
how
it
went
off
the
great
day
the
nineteenth
of
february
we
welcomed
enthusiastically
and
for
a
long
time
beforehand
drank
toasts
in
its
honour
but
that
was
long
ago
before
the
advent
of
shatov
or
virginsky
when
stepan
trofimovitch
was
still
living
in
the
same
house
with
varvara
petrovna
for
some
time
before
the
great
day
stepan
trofimovitch
fell
into
the
habit
of
muttering
to
himself
wellknown
though
rather
farfetched
lines
which
must
have
been
written
by
some
liberal
landowner
of
the
past
the
peasant
with
his
axe
is
coming
something
terrible
will
happen
something
of
that
sort
i
dont
remember
the
exact
words
varvara
petrovna
overheard
him
on
one
occasion
and
crying
nonsense
nonsense
she
went
out
of
the
room
in
a
rage
liputin
who
happened
to
be
present
observed
malignantly
to
stepan
trofimovitch
itll
be
a
pity
if
their
former
serfs
really
do
some
mischief
to
messieurs
les
landowners
to
celebrate
the
occasion
and
he
drew
his
forefinger
round
his
throat
cher
ami
stepan
trofimovitch
observed
believe
me
thatthis
he
repeated
the
gesture
will
never
be
of
any
use
to
our
landowners
nor
to
any
of
us
in
general
we
shall
never
be
capable
of
organising
anything
even
without
our
heads
though
our
heads
hinder
our
understanding
more
than
anything
i
may
observe
that
many
people
among
us
anticipated
that
something
extraordinary
such
as
liputin
predicted
would
take
place
on
the
day
of
the
emancipation
and
those
who
held
this
view
were
the
socalled
authorities
on
the
peasantry
and
the
government
i
believe
stepan
trofimovitch
shared
this
idea
so
much
so
that
almost
on
the
eve
of
the
great
day
he
began
asking
varvara
petrovnas
leave
to
go
abroad
in
fact
he
began
to
be
uneasy
but
the
great
day
passed
and
some
time
passed
after
it
and
the
condescending
smile
reappeared
on
stepan
trofimovitchs
lips
in
our
presence
he
delivered
himself
of
some
noteworthy
thoughts
on
the
character
of
the
russian
in
general
and
the
russian
peasant
in
particular
like
hasty
people
we
have
been
in
too
great
a
hurry
with
our
peasants
he
said
in
conclusion
of
a
series
of
remarkable
utterances
we
have
made
them
the
fashion
and
a
whole
section
of
writers
have
for
several
years
treated
them
as
though
they
were
newly
discovered
curiosities
we
have
put
laurelwreaths
on
lousy
heads
the
russian
village
has
given
us
only
kamarinsky
in
a
thousand
years
a
remarkable
russian
poet
who
was
also
something
of
a
wit
seeing
the
great
rachel
on
the
stage
for
the
first
time
cried
in
ecstasy
i
wouldnt
exchange
rachel
for
a
peasant
i
am
prepared
to
go
further
i
would
give
all
the
peasants
in
russia
for
one
rachel
its
high
time
to
look
things
in
the
face
more
soberly
and
not
to
mix
up
our
national
rustic
pitch
with
bouquet
de
limpratrice
liputin
agreed
at
once
but
remarked
that
one
had
to
perjure
oneself
and
praise
the
peasant
all
the
same
for
the
sake
of
being
progressive
that
even
ladies
in
good
society
shed
tears
reading
poor
anton
and
that
some
of
them
even
wrote
from
paris
to
their
bailiffs
that
they
were
henceforward
to
treat
the
peasants
as
humanely
as
possible
it
happened
and
as
illluck
would
have
it
just
after
the
rumours
of
the
anton
petrov
affair
had
reached
us
that
there
was
some
disturbance
in
our
province
too
only
about
ten
miles
from
skvoreshniki
so
that
a
detachment
of
soldiers
was
sent
down
in
a
hurry
this
time
stepan
trofimovitch
was
so
much
upset
that
he
even
frightened
us
he
cried
out
at
the
club
that
more
troops
were
needed
that
they
ought
to
be
telegraphed
for
from
another
province
he
rushed
off
to
the
governor
to
protest
that
he
had
no
hand
in
it
begged
him
not
to
allow
his
name
on
account
of
old
associations
to
be
brought
into
it
and
offered
to
write
about
his
protest
to
the
proper
quarter
in
petersburg
fortunately
it
all
passed
over
quickly
and
ended
in
nothing
but
i
was
surprised
at
stepan
trofimovitch
at
the
time
three
years
later
as
every
one
knows
people
were
beginning
to
talk
of
nationalism
and
public
opinion
first
came
upon
the
scene
stepan
trofimovitch
laughed
a
great
deal
my
friends
he
instructed
us
if
our
nationalism
has
dawned
as
they
keep
repeating
in
the
papersits
still
at
school
at
some
german
peterschule
sitting
over
a
german
book
and
repeating
its
everlasting
german
lesson
and
its
german
teacher
will
make
it
go
down
on
its
knees
when
he
thinks
fit
i
think
highly
of
the
german
teacher
but
nothing
has
happened
and
nothing
of
the
kind
has
dawned
and
everything
is
going
on
in
the
old
way
that
is
as
ordained
by
god
to
my
thinking
that
should
be
enough
for
russia
pour
notre
sainte
russie
besides
all
this
slavism
and
nationalism
is
too
old
to
be
new
nationalism
if
you
like
has
never
existed
among
us
except
as
a
distraction
for
gentlemens
clubs
and
moscow
ones
at
that
im
not
talking
of
the
days
of
igor
of
course
and
besides
it
all
comes
of
idleness
everything
in
russia
comes
of
idleness
everything
good
and
fine
even
it
all
springs
from
the
charming
cultured
whimsical
idleness
of
our
gentry
im
ready
to
repeat
it
for
thirty
thousand
years
we
dont
know
how
to
live
by
our
own
labour
and
as
for
the
fuss
theyre
making
now
about
the
dawn
of
some
sort
of
public
opinion
has
it
so
suddenly
dropped
from
heaven
without
any
warning
how
is
it
they
dont
understand
that
before
we
can
have
an
opinion
of
our
own
we
must
have
work
our
own
work
our
own
initiative
in
things
our
own
experience
nothing
is
to
be
gained
for
nothing
if
we
work
we
shall
have
an
opinion
of
our
own
but
as
we
never
shall
work
our
opinions
will
be
formed
for
us
by
those
who
have
hitherto
done
the
work
instead
of
us
that
is
as
always
europe
the
everlasting
germansour
teachers
for
the
last
two
centuries
moreover
russia
is
too
big
a
tangle
for
us
to
unravel
alone
without
the
germans
and
without
hard
work
for
the
last
twenty
years
ive
been
sounding
the
alarm
and
the
summons
to
work
ive
given
up
my
life
to
that
appeal
and
in
my
folly
i
put
faith
in
it
now
i
have
lost
faith
in
it
but
i
sound
the
alarm
still
and
shall
sound
it
to
the
tomb
i
will
pull
at
the
bellropes
until
they
toll
for
my
own
requiem
alas
we
could
do
nothing
but
assent
we
applauded
our
teacher
and
with
what
warmth
indeed
and
after
all
my
friends
dont
we
still
hear
today
every
hour
at
every
step
the
same
charming
clever
liberal
old
russian
nonsense
our
teacher
believed
in
god
i
cant
understand
why
they
make
me
out
an
infidel
here
he
used
to
say
sometimes
i
believe
in
god
mais
distinguons
i
believe
in
him
as
a
being
who
is
conscious
of
himself
in
me
only
i
cannot
believe
as
my
nastasya
the
servant
or
like
some
country
gentleman
who
believes
to
be
on
the
safe
side
or
like
our
dear
shatovbut
no
shatov
doesnt
come
into
it
shatov
believes
on
principle
like
a
moscow
slavophil
as
for
christianity
for
all
my
genuine
respect
for
it
im
not
a
christian
i
am
more
of
an
antique
pagan
like
the
great
goethe
or
like
an
ancient
greek
the
very
fact
that
christianity
has
failed
to
understand
woman
is
enough
as
george
sand
has
so
splendidly
shown
in
one
of
her
great
novels
as
for
the
bowings
fasting
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
dont
understand
what
they
have
to
do
with
me
however
busy
the
informers
may
be
here
i
dont
care
to
become
a
jesuit
in
the
year
1847
byelinsky
who
was
abroad
sent
his
famous
letter
to
gogol
and
warmly
reproached
him
for
believing
in
some
sort
of
god
entre
nous
soit
dit
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
comic
than
the
moment
when
gogol
the
gogol
of
that
period
read
that
phrase
and
the
whole
letter
but
dismissing
the
humorous
aspect
and
as
i
am
fundamentally
in
agreement
i
point
to
them
and
saythese
were
men
they
knew
how
to
love
their
people
they
knew
how
to
suffer
for
them
they
knew
how
to
sacrifice
everything
for
them
yet
they
knew
how
to
differ
from
them
when
they
ought
and
did
not
filch
certain
ideas
from
them
could
byelinsky
have
sought
salvation
in
lenten
oil
or
peas
with
radish
but
at
this
point
shatov
interposed
those
men
of
yours
never
loved
the
people
they
didnt
suffer
for
them
and
didnt
sacrifice
anything
for
them
though
they
may
have
amused
themselves
by
imagining
it
he
growled
sullenly
looking
down
and
moving
impatiently
in
his
chair
they
didnt
love
the
people
yelled
stepan
trofimovitch
oh
how
they
loved
russia
neither
russia
nor
the
people
shatov
yelled
too
with
flashing
eyes
you
cant
love
what
you
dont
know
and
they
had
no
conception
of
the
russian
people
all
of
them
peered
at
the
russian
people
through
their
fingers
and
you
do
too
byelinsky
especially
from
that
very
letter
to
gogol
one
can
see
it
byelinsky
like
the
inquisitive
man
in
krylovs
fable
did
not
notice
the
elephant
in
the
museum
of
curiosities
but
concentrated
his
whole
attention
on
the
french
socialist
beetles
he
did
not
get
beyond
them
and
yet
perhaps
he
was
cleverer
than
any
of
you
youve
not
only
overlooked
the
people
youve
taken
up
an
attitude
of
disgusting
contempt
for
them
if
only
because
you
could
not
imagine
any
but
the
french
people
the
parisians
indeed
and
were
ashamed
that
the
russians
were
not
like
them
thats
the
naked
truth
and
he
who
has
no
people
has
no
god
you
may
be
sure
that
all
who
cease
to
understand
their
own
people
and
lose
their
connection
with
them
at
once
lose
to
the
same
extent
the
faith
of
their
fathers
and
become
atheistic
or
indifferent
im
speaking
the
truth
this
is
a
fact
which
will
be
realised
thats
why
all
of
you
and
all
of
us
now
are
either
beastly
atheists
or
careless
dissolute
imbeciles
and
nothing
more
and
you
too
stepan
trofimovitch
i
dont
make
an
exception
of
you
at
all
in
fact
it
is
on
your
account
i
am
speaking
let
me
tell
you
that
as
a
rule
after
uttering
such
monologues
which
happened
to
him
pretty
frequently
shatov
snatched
up
his
cap
and
rushed
to
the
door
in
the
full
conviction
that
everything
was
now
over
and
that
he
had
cut
short
all
friendly
relations
with
stepan
trofimovitch
forever
but
the
latter
always
succeeded
in
stopping
him
in
time
hadnt
we
better
make
it
up
shatov
after
all
these
endearments
he
would
say
benignly
holding
out
his
hand
to
him
from
his
armchair
shatov
clumsy
and
bashful
disliked
sentimentality
externally
he
was
rough
but
inwardly
i
believe
he
had
great
delicacy
although
he
often
went
too
far
he
was
the
first
to
suffer
for
it
muttering
something
between
his
teeth
in
response
to
stepan
trofimovitchs
appeal
and
shuffling
with
his
feet
like
a
bear
he
gave
a
sudden
and
unexpected
smile
put
down
his
cap
and
sat
down
in
the
same
chair
as
before
with
his
eyes
stubbornly
fixed
on
the
ground
wine
was
of
course
brought
in
and
stepan
trofimovitch
proposed
some
suitable
toast
for
instance
the
memory
of
some
leading
man
of
the
past
chapter
ii
prince
harry
matchmaking
i
there
was
another
being
in
the
world
to
whom
varvara
petrovna
was
as
much
attached
as
she
was
to
stepan
trofimovitch
her
only
son
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
stavrogin
it
was
to
undertake
his
education
that
stepan
trofimovitch
had
been
engaged
the
boy
was
at
that
time
eight
years
old
and
his
frivolous
father
general
stavrogin
was
already
living
apart
from
varvara
petrovna
so
that
the
child
grew
up
entirely
in
his
mothers
care
to
do
stepan
trofimovitch
justice
he
knew
how
to
win
his
pupils
heart
the
whole
secret
of
this
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
a
child
himself
i
was
not
there
in
those
days
and
he
continually
felt
the
want
of
a
real
friend
he
did
not
hesitate
to
make
a
friend
of
this
little
creature
as
soon
as
he
had
grown
a
little
older
it
somehow
came
to
pass
quite
naturally
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
discrepancy
of
age
between
them
more
than
once
he
awaked
his
ten
or
elevenyearold
friend
at
night
simply
to
pour
out
his
wounded
feelings
and
weep
before
him
or
to
tell
him
some
family
secret
without
realising
that
this
was
an
outrageous
proceeding
they
threw
themselves
into
each
others
arms
and
wept
the
boy
knew
that
his
mother
loved
him
very
much
but
i
doubt
whether
he
cared
much
for
her
she
talked
little
to
him
and
did
not
often
interfere
with
him
but
he
was
always
morbidly
conscious
of
her
intent
searching
eyes
fixed
upon
him
yet
the
mother
confided
his
whole
instruction
and
moral
education
to
stepan
trofimovitch
at
that
time
her
faith
in
him
was
unshaken
one
cant
help
believing
that
the
tutor
had
rather
a
bad
influence
on
his
pupils
nerves
when
at
sixteen
he
was
taken
to
a
lyceum
he
was
fragilelooking
and
pale
strangely
quiet
and
dreamy
later
on
he
was
distinguished
by
great
physical
strength
one
must
assume
too
that
the
friends
went
on
weeping
at
night
throwing
themselves
in
each
others
arms
though
their
tears
were
not
always
due
to
domestic
difficulties
stepan
trofimovitch
succeeded
in
reaching
the
deepest
chords
in
his
pupils
heart
and
had
aroused
in
him
a
vague
sensation
of
that
eternal
sacred
yearning
which
some
elect
souls
can
never
give
up
for
cheap
gratification
when
once
they
have
tasted
and
known
it
there
are
some
connoisseurs
who
prize
this
yearning
more
than
the
most
complete
satisfaction
of
it
if
such
were
possible
but
in
any
case
it
was
just
as
well
that
the
pupil
and
the
preceptor
were
though
none
too
soon
parted
for
the
first
two
years
the
lad
used
to
come
home
from
the
lyceum
for
the
holidays
while
varvara
petrovna
and
stepan
trofimovitch
were
staying
in
petersburg
he
was
sometimes
present
at
the
literary
evenings
at
his
mothers
he
listened
and
looked
on
he
spoke
little
and
was
quiet
and
shy
as
before
his
manner
to
stepan
trofimovitch
was
as
affectionately
attentive
as
ever
but
there
was
a
shade
of
reserve
in
it
he
unmistakably
avoided
distressing
lofty
subjects
or
reminiscences
of
the
past
by
his
mothers
wish
he
entered
the
army
on
completing
the
school
course
and
soon
received
a
commission
in
one
of
the
most
brilliant
regiments
of
the
horse
guards
he
did
not
come
to
show
himself
to
his
mother
in
his
uniform
and
his
letters
from
petersburg
began
to
be
infrequent
varvara
petrovna
sent
him
money
without
stint
though
after
the
emancipation
the
revenue
from
her
estate
was
so
diminished
that
at
first
her
income
was
less
than
half
what
it
had
been
before
she
had
however
a
considerable
sum
laid
by
through
years
of
economy
she
took
great
interest
in
her
sons
success
in
the
highest
petersburg
society
where
she
had
failed
the
wealthy
young
officer
with
expectations
succeeded
he
renewed
acquaintances
which
she
had
hardly
dared
to
dream
of
and
was
welcomed
everywhere
with
pleasure
but
very
soon
rather
strange
rumours
reached
varvara
petrovna
the
young
man
had
suddenly
taken
to
riotous
living
with
a
sort
of
frenzy
not
that
he
gambled
or
drank
too
much
there
was
only
talk
of
savage
recklessness
of
running
over
people
in
the
street
with
his
horses
of
brutal
conduct
to
a
lady
of
good
society
with
whom
he
had
a
liaison
and
whom
he
afterwards
publicly
insulted
there
was
a
callous
nastiness
about
this
affair
it
was
added
too
that
he
had
developed
into
a
regular
bully
insulting
people
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
insulting
them
varvara
petrovna
was
greatly
agitated
and
distressed
stepan
trofimovitch
assured
her
that
this
was
only
the
first
riotous
effervescence
of
a
too
richly
endowed
nature
that
the
storm
would
subside
and
that
this
was
only
like
the
youth
of
prince
harry
who
caroused
with
falstaff
poins
and
mrs
quickly
as
described
by
shakespeare
this
time
varvara
petrovna
did
not
cry
out
nonsense
nonsense
as
she
was
very
apt
to
do
in
later
years
in
response
to
stepan
trofimovitch
on
the
contrary
she
listened
very
eagerly
asked
him
to
explain
this
theory
more
exactly
took
up
shakespeare
herself
and
with
great
attention
read
the
immortal
chronicle
but
it
did
not
comfort
her
and
indeed
she
did
not
find
the
resemblance
very
striking
with
feverish
impatience
she
awaited
answers
to
some
of
her
letters
she
had
not
long
to
wait
for
them
the
fatal
news
soon
reached
her
that
prince
harry
had
been
involved
in
two
duels
almost
at
once
was
entirely
to
blame
for
both
of
them
had
killed
one
of
his
adversaries
on
the
spot
and
had
maimed
the
other
and
was
awaiting
his
trial
in
consequence
the
case
ended
in
his
being
degraded
to
the
ranks
deprived
of
the
rights
of
a
nobleman
and
transferred
to
an
infantry
line
regiment
and
he
only
escaped
worse
punishment
by
special
favour
in
1863
he
somehow
succeeded
in
distinguishing
himself
he
received
a
cross
was
promoted
to
be
a
noncommissioned
officer
and
rose
rapidly
to
the
rank
of
an
officer
during
this
period
varvara
petrovna
despatched
perhaps
hundreds
of
letters
to
the
capital
full
of
prayers
and
supplications
she
even
stooped
to
some
humiliation
in
this
extremity
after
his
promotion
the
young
man
suddenly
resigned
his
commission
but
he
did
not
come
back
to
skvoreshniki
again
and
gave
up
writing
to
his
mother
altogether
they
learned
by
roundabout
means
that
he
was
back
in
petersburg
but
that
he
was
not
to
be
met
in
the
same
society
as
before
he
seemed
to
be
in
hiding
they
found
out
that
he
was
living
in
strange
company
associating
with
the
dregs
of
the
population
of
petersburg
with
slipshod
government
clerks
discharged
military
men
beggars
of
the
higher
class
and
drunkards
of
all
sortsthat
he
visited
their
filthy
families
spent
days
and
nights
in
dark
slums
and
all
sorts
of
low
haunts
that
he
had
sunk
very
low
that
he
was
in
rags
and
that
apparently
he
liked
it
he
did
not
ask
his
mother
for
money
he
had
his
own
little
estateonce
the
property
of
his
father
general
stavrogin
which
yielded
at
least
some
revenue
and
which
it
was
reported
he
had
let
to
a
german
from
saxony
at
last
his
mother
besought
him
to
come
to
her
and
prince
harry
made
his
appearance
in
our
town
i
had
never
set
eyes
on
him
before
but
now
i
got
a
very
distinct
impression
of
him
he
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
of
fiveandtwenty
and
i
must
own
i
was
impressed
by
him
i
had
expected
to
see
a
dirty
ragamuffin
sodden
with
drink
and
debauchery
he
was
on
the
contrary
the
most
elegant
gentleman
i
had
ever
met
extremely
well
dressed
with
an
air
and
manner
only
to
be
found
in
a
man
accustomed
to
culture
and
refinement
i
was
not
the
only
person
surprised
it
was
a
surprise
to
all
the
townspeople
to
whom
of
course
young
stavrogins
whole
biography
was
well
known
in
its
minutest
details
though
one
could
not
imagine
how
they
had
got
hold
of
them
and
what
was
still
more
surprising
half
of
their
stories
about
him
turned
out
to
be
true
all
our
ladies
were
wild
over
the
new
visitor
they
were
sharply
divided
into
two
parties
one
of
which
adored
him
while
the
other
half
regarded
him
with
a
hatred
that
was
almost
bloodthirsty
but
both
were
crazy
about
him
some
of
them
were
particularly
fascinated
by
the
idea
that
he
had
perhaps
a
fateful
secret
hidden
in
his
soul
others
were
positively
delighted
at
the
fact
that
he
was
a
murderer
it
appeared
too
that
he
had
had
a
very
good
education
and
was
indeed
a
man
of
considerable
culture
no
great
acquirements
were
needed
of
course
to
astonish
us
but
he
could
judge
also
of
very
interesting
everyday
affairs
and
what
was
of
the
utmost
value
he
judged
of
them
with
remarkable
good
sense
i
must
mention
as
a
peculiar
fact
that
almost
from
the
first
day
we
all
of
us
thought
him
a
very
sensible
fellow
he
was
not
very
talkative
he
was
elegant
without
exaggeration
surprisingly
modest
and
at
the
same
time
bold
and
selfreliant
as
none
of
us
were
our
dandies
gazed
at
him
with
envy
and
were
completely
eclipsed
by
him
his
face
too
impressed
me
his
hair
was
of
a
peculiarly
intense
black
his
lightcoloured
eyes
were
peculiarly
light
and
calm
his
complexion
was
peculiarly
soft
and
white
the
red
in
his
cheeks
was
too
bright
and
clear
his
teeth
were
like
pearls
and
his
lips
like
coralone
would
have
thought
that
he
must
be
a
paragon
of
beauty
yet
at
the
same
time
there
seemed
something
repellent
about
him
it
was
said
that
his
face
suggested
a
mask
so
much
was
said
though
among
other
things
they
talked
of
his
extraordinary
physical
strength
he
was
rather
tall
varvara
petrovna
looked
at
him
with
pride
yet
with
continual
uneasiness
he
spent
about
six
months
among
uslistless
quiet
rather
morose
he
made
his
appearance
in
society
and
with
unfailing
propriety
performed
all
the
duties
demanded
by
our
provincial
etiquette
he
was
related
on
his
fathers
side
to
the
governor
and
was
received
by
the
latter
as
a
near
kinsman
but
a
few
months
passed
and
the
wild
beast
showed
his
claws
i
may
observe
by
the
way
in
parenthesis
that
ivan
ossipovitch
our
dear
mild
governor
was
rather
like
an
old
woman
though
he
was
of
good
family
and
highly
connectedwhich
explains
the
fact
that
he
remained
so
long
among
us
though
he
steadily
avoided
all
the
duties
of
his
office
from
his
munificence
and
hospitality
he
ought
rather
to
have
been
a
marshal
of
nobility
of
the
good
old
days
than
a
governor
in
such
busy
times
as
ours
it
was
always
said
in
the
town
that
it
was
not
he
but
varvara
petrovna
who
governed
the
province
of
course
this
was
said
sarcastically
however
it
was
certainly
a
falsehood
and
indeed
much
wit
was
wasted
on
the
subject
among
us
on
the
contrary
in
later
years
varvara
petrovna
purposely
and
consciously
withdrew
from
anything
like
a
position
of
authority
and
in
spite
of
the
extraordinary
respect
in
which
she
was
held
by
the
whole
province
voluntarily
confined
her
influence
within
strict
limits
set
up
by
herself
instead
of
these
higher
responsibilities
she
suddenly
took
up
the
management
of
her
estate
and
within
two
or
three
years
raised
the
revenue
from
it
almost
to
what
it
had
yielded
in
the
past
giving
up
her
former
romantic
impulses
trips
to
petersburg
plans
for
founding
a
magazine
and
so
on
she
began
to
be
careful
and
to
save
money
she
kept
even
stepan
trofimovitch
at
a
distance
allowing
him
to
take
lodgings
in
another
house
a
change
for
which
he
had
long
been
worrying
her
under
various
pretexts
little
by
little
stepan
trofimovitch
began
to
call
her
a
prosaic
woman
or
more
jestingly
my
prosaic
friend
i
need
hardly
say
he
only
ventured
on
such
jests
in
an
extremely
respectful
form
and
on
rare
and
carefully
chosen
occasions
all
of

in
her
intimate
circle
feltstepan
trofimovitch
more
acutely
than
any
of
usthat
her
son
had
come
to
her
almost
as
it
were
as
a
new
hope
and
even
as
a
sort
of
new
aspiration
her
passion
for
her
son
dated
from
the
time
of
his
successes
in
petersburg
society
and
grew
more
intense
from
the
moment
that
he
was
degraded
in
the
army
yet
she
was
evidently
afraid
of
him
and
seemed
like
a
slave
in
his
presence
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
afraid
of
something
vague
and
mysterious
which
she
could
not
have
put
into
words
and
she
often
stole
searching
glances
at
nicolas
scrutinising
him
reflectively
and
beholdthe
wild
beast
suddenly
showed
his
claws
ii
suddenly
apropos
of
nothing
our
prince
was
guilty
of
incredible
outrages
upon
various
persons
and
what
was
most
striking
these
outrages
were
utterly
unheard
of
quite
inconceivable
unlike
anything
commonly
done
utterly
silly
and
mischievous
quite
unprovoked
and
objectless
one
of
the
most
respected
of
our
club
members
on
our
committee
of
management
pyotr
pavlovitch
gaganov
an
elderly
man
of
high
rank
in
the
service
had
formed
the
innocent
habit
of
declaring
vehemently
on
all
sorts
of
occasions
no
you
cant
lead
me
by
the
nose
well
there
is
no
harm
in
that
but
one
day
at
the
club
when
he
brought
out
this
phrase
in
connection
with
some
heated
discussion
in
the
midst
of
a
little
group
of
members
all
persons
of
some
consequence
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
who
was
standing
on
one
side
alone
and
unnoticed
suddenly
went
up
to
pyotr
pavlovitch
took
him
unexpectedly
and
firmly
with
two
fingers
by
the
nose
and
succeeded
in
leading
him
two
or
three
steps
across
the
room
he
could
have
had
no
grudge
against
mr
gaganov
it
might
be
thought
to
be
a
mere
schoolboy
prank
though
of
course
a
most
unpardonable
one
yet
describing
it
afterwards
people
said
that
he
looked
almost
dreamy
at
the
very
instant
of
the
operation
as
though
he
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
but
that
was
recalled
and
reflected
upon
long
afterwards
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
all
they
recalled
was
the
minute
after
when
he
certainly
saw
it
all
as
it
really
was
and
far
from
being
confused
smiled
gaily
and
maliciously
without
the
slightest
regret
there
was
a
terrific
outcry
he
was
surrounded
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
kept
turning
round
looking
about
him
answering
nobody
and
glancing
curiously
at
the
persons
exclaiming
around
him
at
last
he
seemed
suddenly
as
it
were
to
sink
into
thought
againso
at
least
it
was
reportedfrowned
went
firmly
up
to
the
affronted
pyotr
pavlovitch
and
with
evident
vexation
said
in
a
rapid
mutter
you
must
forgive
me
of
course
i
really
dont
know
what
suddenly
came
over
me
its
silly
the
carelessness
of
his
apology
was
almost
equivalent
to
a
fresh
insult
the
outcry
was
greater
than
ever
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
away
all
this
was
very
stupid
to
say
nothing
of
its
gross
indecency
a
calculated
and
premeditated
indecency
as
it
seemed
at
first
sightand
therefore
a
premeditated
and
utterly
brutal
insult
to
our
whole
society
so
it
was
taken
to
be
by
every
one
we
began
by
promptly
and
unanimously
striking
young
stavrogins
name
off
the
list
of
club
members
then
it
was
decided
to
send
an
appeal
in
the
name
of
the
whole
club
to
the
governor
begging
him
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
case
to
be
formally
tried
in
court
to
use
the
administrative
power
entrusted
to
him
to
restrain
this
dangerous
ruffian
this
duelling
bully
from
the
capital
and
so
protect
the
tranquillity
of
all
the
gentry
of
our
town
from
injurious
encroachments
it
was
added
with
angry
resentment
that
a
law
might
be
found
to
control
even
mr
stavrogin
this
phrase
was
prepared
by
way
of
a
thrust
at
the
governor
on
account
of
varvara
petrovna
they
elaborated
it
with
relish
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
the
governor
was
not
in
the
town
at
the
time
he
had
gone
to
a
little
distance
to
stand
godfather
to
the
child
of
a
very
charming
lady
recently
left
a
widow
in
an
interesting
condition
but
it
was
known
that
he
would
soon
be
back
in
the
meanwhile
they
got
up
a
regular
ovation
for
the
respected
and
insulted
gentleman
people
embraced
and
kissed
him
the
whole
town
called
upon
him
it
was
even
proposed
to
give
a
subscription
dinner
in
his
honour
and
they
only
gave
up
the
idea
at
his
earnest
requestreflecting
possibly
at
last
that
the
man
had
after
all
been
pulled
by
the
nose
and
that
that
was
really
nothing
to
congratulate
him
upon
yet
how
had
it
happened
how
could
it
have
happened
it
is
remarkable
that
no
one
in
the
whole
town
put
down
this
savage
act
to
madness
they
must
have
been
predisposed
to
expect
such
actions
from
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
even
when
he
was
sane
for
my
part
i
dont
know
to
this
day
how
to
explain
it
in
spite
of
the
event
that
quickly
followed
and
apparently
explained
everything
and
conciliated
every
one
i
will
add
also
that
four
years
later
in
reply
to
a
discreet
question
from
me
about
the
incident
at
the
club
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
answered
frowning
i
wasnt
quite
well
at
the
time
but
there
is
no
need
to
anticipate
events
the
general
outburst
of
hatred
with
which
every
one
fell
upon
the
ruffian
and
duelling
bully
from
the
capital
also
struck
me
as
curious
they
insisted
on
seeing
an
insolent
design
and
deliberate
intention
to
insult
our
whole
society
at
once
the
truth
was
no
one
liked
the
fellow
but
on
the
contrary
he
had
set
every
one
against
himand
one
wonders
how
up
to
the
last
incident
he
had
never
quarrelled
with
anyone
nor
insulted
anyone
but
was
as
courteous
as
a
gentleman
in
a
fashionplate
if
only
the
latter
were
able
to
speak
i
imagine
that
he
was
hated
for
his
pride
even
our
ladies
who
had
begun
by
adoring
him
railed
against
him
now
more
loudly
than
the
men
varvara
petrovna
was
dreadfully
overwhelmed
she
confessed
afterwards
to
stepan
trofimovitch
that
she
had
had
a
foreboding
of
all
this
long
before
that
every
day
for
the
last
six
months
she
had
been
expecting
just
something
of
that
sort
a
remarkable
admission
on
the
part
of
his
own
mother
its
begun
she
thought
to
herself
with
a
shudder
the
morning
after
the
incident
at
the
club
she
cautiously
but
firmly
approached
the
subject
with
her
son
but
the
poor
woman
was
trembling
all
over
in
spite
of
her
firmness
she
had
not
slept
all
night
and
even
went
out
early
to
stepan
trofimovitchs
lodgings
to
ask
his
advice
and
shed
tears
there
a
thing
which
she
had
never
been
known
to
do
before
anyone
she
longed
for
nicolas
to
say
something
to
her
to
deign
to
give
some
explanation
nikolay
who
was
always
so
polite
and
respectful
to
his
mother
listened
to
her
for
some
time
scowling
but
very
seriously
he
suddenly
got
up
without
saying
a
word
kissed
her
hand
and
went
away
that
very
evening
as
though
by
design
he
perpetrated
another
scandal
it
was
of
a
more
harmless
and
ordinary
character
than
the
first
yet
owing
to
the
state
of
the
public
mind
it
increased
the
outcry
in
the
town
our
friend
liputin
turned
up
and
called
on
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
immediately
after
the
latters
interview
with
his
mother
and
earnestly
begged
for
the
honour
of
his
company
at
a
little
party
he
was
giving
for
his
wifes
birthday
that
evening
varvara
petrovna
had
long
watched
with
a
pang
at
her
heart
her
sons
taste
for
such
low
company
but
she
had
not
dared
to
speak
of
it
to
him
he
had
made
several
acquaintances
besides
liputin
in
the
third
rank
of
our
society
and
even
in
lower
depthshe
had
a
propensity
for
making
such
friends
he
had
never
been
in
liputins
house
before
though
he
had
met
the
man
himself
he
guessed
that
liputins
invitation
now
was
the
consequence
of
the
previous
days
scandal
and
that
as
a
local
liberal
he
was
delighted
at
the
scandal
genuinely
believing
that
that
was
the
proper
way
to
treat
stewards
at
the
club
and
that
it
was
very
well
done
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
smiled
and
promised
to
come
a
great
number
of
guests
had
assembled
the
company
was
not
very
presentable
but
very
sprightly
liputin
vain
and
envious
only
entertained
visitors
twice
a
year
but
on
those
occasions
he
did
it
without
stint
the
most
honoured
of
the
invited
guests
stepan
trofimovitch
was
prevented
by
illness
from
being
present
tea
was
handed
and
there
were
refreshments
and
vodka
in
plenty
cards
were
played
at
three
tables
and
while
waiting
for
supper
the
young
people
got
up
a
dance
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
led
out
madame
liputina
very
pretty
little
woman
who
was
dreadfully
shy
of
himtook
two
turns
round
the
room
with
her
sat
down
beside
her
drew
her
into
conversation
and
made
her
laugh
noticing
at
last
how
pretty
she
was
when
she
laughed
he
suddenly
before
all
the
company
seized
her
round
the
waist
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
two
or
three
times
with
great
relish
the
poor
frightened
lady
fainted
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
took
his
hat
and
went
up
to
the
husband
who
stood
petrified
in
the
middle
of
the
general
excitement
looking
at
him
he
too
became
confused
and
muttering
hurriedly
dont
be
angry
went
away
liputin
ran
after
him
in
the
entry
gave
him
his
furcoat
with
his
own
hands
and
saw
him
down
the
stairs
bowing
but
next
day
a
rather
amusing
sequel
followed
this
comparatively
harmless
pranka
sequel
from
which
liputin
gained
some
credit
and
of
which
he
took
the
fullest
possible
advantage
at
ten
oclock
in
the
morning
liputins
servant
agafya
an
easymannered
lively
rosycheeked
peasant
woman
of
thirty
made
her
appearance
at
stavrogins
house
with
a
message
for
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
she
insisted
on
seeing
his
honour
himself
he
had
a
very
bad
headache
but
he
went
out
varvara
petrovna
succeeded
in
being
present
when
the
message
was
given
sergay
vassilyevitch
liputins
name
agafya
rattled
off
briskly
bade
me
first
of
all
give
you
his
respectful
greetings
and
ask
after
your
health
what
sort
of
night
your
honour
spent
after
yesterdays
doings
and
how
your
honour
feels
now
after
yesterdays
doings
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
smiled
give
him
my
greetings
and
thank
him
and
tell
your
master
from
me
agafya
that
hes
the
most
sensible
man
in
the
town
and
he
told
me
to
answer
that
agafya
caught
him
up
still
more
briskly
that
he
knows
that
without
your
telling
him
and
wishes
you
the
same
really
but
how
could
he
tell
what
i
should
say
to
you
i
cant
say
in
what
way
he
could
tell
but
when
i
had
set
off
and
had
gone
right
down
the
street
i
heard
something
and
there
he
was
running
after
me
without
his
cap
i
say
agafya
if
by
any
chance
he
says
to
you
tell
your
master
that
he
has
more
sense
than
all
the
town
you
tell
him
at
once
dont
forget
the
master
himself
knows
that
very
well
and
wishes
you
the
same
iii
at
last
the
interview
with
the
governor
took
place
too
our
dear
mild
ivan
ossipovitch
had
only
just
returned
and
only
just
had
time
to
hear
the
angry
complaint
from
the
club
there
was
no
doubt
that
something
must
be
done
but
he
was
troubled
the
hospitable
old
man
seemed
also
rather
afraid
of
his
young
kinsman
he
made
up
his
mind
however
to
induce
him
to
apologise
to
the
club
and
to
his
victim
in
satisfactory
form
and
if
required
by
letter
and
then
to
persuade
him
to
leave
us
for
a
time
travelling
for
instance
to
improve
his
mind
in
italy
or
in
fact
anywhere
abroad
in
the
waitingroom
in
which
on
this
occasion
he
received
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
who
had
been
at
other
times
privileged
as
a
relation
to
wander
all
over
the
house

telyatnikov
a
clerk
of
refined
manners
who
was
also
a
member
of
the
governors
household
was
sitting
in
a
corner
opening
envelopes
at
a
table
and
in
the
next
room
at
the
window
nearest
to
the
door
a
stout
and
sturdy
colonel
a
former
friend
and
colleague
of
the
governor
was
sitting
alone
reading
the
golos
paying
no
attention
of
course
to
what
was
taking
place
in
the
waitingroom
in
fact
he
had
his
back
turned
ivan
ossipovitch
approached
the
subject
in
a
roundabout
way
almost
in
a
whisper
but
kept
getting
a
little
muddled
nikolay
looked
anything
but
cordial
not
at
all
as
a
relation
should
he
was
pale
and
sat
looking
down
and
continually
moving
his
eyebrows
as
though
trying
to
control
acute
pain
you
have
a
kind
heart
and
a
generous

a

of
great
culture
youve
grown
up
in
the
highest
circles

here
too
your
behaviour
has
hitherto
been
a
model

has
been
a
great
consolation
to
your
mother
who
is
so
precious
to
all
of
us
and
now
again
everything
has
appeared
in
such
an
unaccountable
light
so
detrimental
to
all
i
speak
as
a
friend
of
your
family
as
an
old
man
who
loves
you
sincerely

a

at
whose
words
you
cannot
take
offence
tell
me
what
drives
you
to
such
reckless
proceedings
so
contrary
to
all
accepted
rules
and
habits
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
such
acts

seem
almost
like
outbreaks

delirium

listened
with
vexation
and
impatience
all
at
once
there
was
a
gleam
of
something
sly
and
mocking
in
his
eyes
ill
tell
you
what
drives
me
to
it
he
said
sullenly
and
looking
round
him
he
bent
down
to
ivan
ossipovitchs
ear
the
refined
alyosha
telyatnikov
moved
three
steps
farther
away
towards
the
window
and
the
colonel
coughed
over
the
golos
poor
ivan
ossipovitch
hurriedly
and
trustfully
inclined
his
ear
he
was
exceedingly
curious
and
then
something
utterly
incredible
though
on
the
other
side
only
too
unmistakable
took
place
the
old
man
suddenly
felt
that
instead
of
telling
him
some
interesting
secret
nikolay
had
seized
the
upper
part
of
his
ear
between
his
teeth
and
was
nipping
it
rather
hard
he
shuddered
and
breath
failed
him
nicolas
this
is
beyond
a
joke
he
moaned
mechanically
in
a
voice
not
his
own
alyosha
and
the
colonel
had
not
yet
grasped
the
situation
besides
they
couldnt
see
and
fancied
up
to
the
end
that
the
two
were
whispering
together
and
yet
the
old
mans
desperate
face
alarmed
them
they
looked
at
one
another
with
wideopen
eyes
not
knowing
whether
to
rush
to
his
assistance
as
agreed
or
to
wait
nikolay
noticed
this
perhaps
and
bit
the
harder
nicolas
nicolas
his
victim
moaned
again
come
youve
had
your
joke
thats
enough
in
another
moment
the
poor
governor
would
certainly
have
died
of
terror
but
the
monster
had
mercy
on
him
and
let
go
his
ear
the
old
mans
deadly
terror
lasted
for
a
full
minute
and
it
was
followed
by
a
sort
of
fit
within
half
an
hour
nikolay
was
arrested
and
removed
for
the
time
to
the
guardroom
where
he
was
confined
in
a
special
cell
with
a
special
sentinel
at
the
door
this
decision
was
a
harsh
one
but
our
mild
governor
was
so
angry
that
he
was
prepared
to
take
the
responsibility
even
if
he
had
to
face
varvara
petrovna
to
the
general
amazement
when
this
lady
arrived
at
the
governors
in
haste
and
in
nervous
irritation
to
discuss
the
matter
with
him
at
once
she
was
refused
admittance
whereupon
without
getting
out
of
the
carriage
she
returned
home
unable
to
believe
her
senses
and
at
last
everything
was
explained
at
two
oclock
in
the
morning
the
prisoner
who
had
till
then
been
calm
and
had
even
slept
suddenly
became
noisy
began
furiously
beating
on
the
door
with
his
fistswith
unnatural
strength
wrenched
the
iron
grating
off
the
door
broke
the
window
and
cut
his
hands
all
over
when
the
officer
on
duty
ran
with
a
detachment
of
men
and
the
keys
and
ordered
the
cell
to
be
opened
that
they
might
rush
in
and
bind
the
maniac
it
appeared
that
he
was
suffering
from
acute
brain
fever
he
was
taken
home
to
his
mother
everything
was
explained
at
once
all
our
three
doctors
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
the
patient
might
well
have
been
in
a
delirious
state
for
three
days
before
and
that
though
he
might
have
apparently
been
in
possession
of
full
consciousness
and
cunning
yet
he
might
have
been
deprived
of
common
sense
and
will
which
was
indeed
borne
out
by
the
facts
so
it
turned
out
that
liputin
had
guessed
the
truth
sooner
than
any
one
ivan
ossipovitch
who
was
a
man
of
delicacy
and
feeling
was
completely
abashed
but
what
was
striking
was
that
he
too
had
considered
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
capable
of
any
mad
action
even
when
in
the
full
possession
of
his
faculties
at
the
club
too
people
were
ashamed
and
wondered
how
it
was
they
had
failed
to
see
the
elephant
and
had
missed
the
only
explanation
of
all
these
marvels
there
were
of
course
sceptics
among
them
but
they
could
not
long
maintain
their
position
nikolay
was
in
bed
for
more
than
two
months
a
famous
doctor
was
summoned
from
moscow
for
a
consultation
the
whole
town
called
on
varvara
petrovna
she
forgave
them
when
in
the
spring
nikolay
had
completely
recovered
and
assented
without
discussion
to
his
mothers
proposal
that
he
should
go
for
a
tour
to
italy
she
begged
him
further
to
pay
visits
of
farewell
to
all
the
neighbours
and
so
far
as
possible
to
apologise
where
necessary
nikolay
agreed
with
great
alacrity
it
became
known
at
the
club
that
he
had
had
a
most
delicate
explanation
with
pyotr
pavlovitch
gaganov
at
the
house
of
the
latter
who
had
been
completely
satisfied
with
his
apology
as
he
went
round
to
pay
these
calls
nikolay
was
very
grave
and
even
gloomy
every
one
appeared
to
receive
him
sympathetically
but
everybody
seemed
embarrassed
and
glad
that
he
was
going
to
italy
ivan
ossipovitch
was
positively
tearful
but
was
for
some
reason
unable
to
bring
himself
to
embrace
him
even
at
the
final
leavetaking
it
is
true
that
some
of
us
retained
the
conviction
that
the
scamp
had
simply
been
making
fun
of
us
and
that
the
illness
was
neither
here
nor
there
he
went
to
see
liputin
too
tell
me
he
said
how
could
you
guess
beforehand
what
i
should
say
about
your
sense
and
prime
agafya
with
an
answer
to
it
why
laughed
liputin
it
was
because
i
recognised
that
you
were
a
clever
man
and
so
i
foresaw
what
your
answer
would
be
anyway
it
was
a
remarkable
coincidence
but
excuse
me
did
you
consider
me
a
sensible
man
and
not
insane
when
you
sent
agafya
for
the
cleverest
and
most
rational
and
i
only
pretended
to
believe
that
you
were
insane
and
you
guessed
at
once
what
was
in
my
mind
and
sent
a
testimonial
to
my
wit
through
agafya
well
there
youre
a
little
mistaken
i
really
was
unwell
muttered
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
frowning
bah
he
cried
do
you
suppose
im
capable
of
attacking
people
when
im
in
my
senses
what
object
would
there
be
in
it
liputin
shrank
together
and
didnt
know
what
to
answer
nikolay
turned
pale
or
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
liputin
you
have
a
very
peculiar
way
of
looking
at
things
anyhow
nikolay
went
on
but
as
for
agafya
i
understand
of
course
that
you
simply
sent
her
to
be
rude
to
me
i
couldnt
challenge
you
to
a
duel
could
i
oh
no
of
course
i
seem
to
have
heard
that
youre
not
fond
of
duels
why
borrow
from
the
french
said
liputin
doubling
up
again
youre
for
nationalism
then
liputin
shrank
into
himself
more
than
ever
bah
bah
what
do
i
see
cried
nicolas
noticing
a
volume
of
considrant
in
the
most
conspicuous
place
on
the
table
you
dont
mean
to
say
youre
a
fourierist
im
afraid
you
must
be
and
isnt
this
too
borrowing
from
the
french
he
laughed
tapping
the
book
with
his
finger
no
thats
not
taken
from
the
french
liputin
cried
with
positive
fury
jumping
up
from
his
chair
that
is
taken
from
the
universal
language
of
humanity
not
simply
from
the
french
from
the
language
of
the
universal
social
republic
and
harmony
of
mankind
let
me
tell
you
not
simply
from
the
french
foo
hang
it
all
theres
no
such
language
laughed
nikolay
sometimes
a
trifle
will
catch
the
attention
and
exclusively
absorb
it
for
a
time
most
of
what
i
have
to
tell
of
young
stavrogin
will
come
later
but
i
will
note
now
as
a
curious
fact
that
of
all
the
impressions
made
on
him
by
his
stay
in
our
town
the
one
most
sharply
imprinted
on
his
memory
was
the
unsightly
and
almost
abject
figure
of
the
little
provincial
official
the
coarse
and
jealous
family
despot
the
miserly
moneylender
who
picked
up
the
candleends
and
scraps
left
from
dinner
and
was
at
the
same
time
a
passionate
believer
in
some
visionary
future
social
harmony
who
at
night
gloated
in
ecstasies
over
fantastic
pictures
of
a
future
phalanstery
in
the
approaching
realisation
of
which
in
russia
and
in
our
province
he
believed
as
firmly
as
in
his
own
existence
and
that
in
the
very
place
where
he
had
saved
up
to
buy
himself
a
little
home
where
he
had
married
for
the
second
time
getting
a
dowry
with
his
bride
where
perhaps
for
a
hundred
miles
round
there
was
not
one
man
himself
included
who
was
the
very
least
like
a
future
member
of
the
universal
human
republic
and
social
harmony
god
knows
how
these
people
come
to
exist
nikolay
wondered
recalling
sometimes
the
unlookedfor
fourierist
iv
our
prince
travelled
for
over
three
years
so
that
he
was
almost
forgotten
in
the
town
we
learned
from
stepan
trofimovitch
that
he
had
travelled
all
over
europe
that
he
had
even
been
in
egypt
and
had
visited
jerusalem
and
then
had
joined
some
scientific
expedition
to
iceland
and
he
actually
did
go
to
iceland
it
was
reported
too
that
he
had
spent
one
winter
attending
lectures
in
a
german
university
he
did
not
write
often
to
his
mother
twice
a
year
or
even
less
but
varvara
petrovna
was
not
angry
or
offended
at
this
she
accepted
submissively
and
without
repining
the
relations
that
had
been
established
once
for
all
between
her
son
and
herself
she
fretted
for
her
nicolas
and
dreamed
of
him
continually
she
kept
her
dreams
and
lamentations
to
herself
she
seemed
to
have
become
less
intimate
even
with
stepan
trofimovitch
she
was
forming
secret
projects
and
seemed
to
have
become
more
careful
about
money
than
ever
she
was
more
than
ever
given
to
saving
money
and
being
angry
at
stepan
trofimovitchs
losses
at
cards
at
last
in
the
april
of
this
year
she
received
a
letter
from
paris
from
praskovya
ivanovna
drozdov
the
widow
of
the
general
and
the
friend
of
varvara
petrovnas
childhood
praskovya
ivanovna
whom
varvara
petrovna
had
not
seen
or
corresponded
with
for
eight
years
wrote
informing
her
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
become
very
intimate
with
them
and
a
great
friend
of
her
only
daughter
liza
and
that
he
was
intending
to
accompany
them
to
switzerland
to
verneymontreux
though
in
the
household
of
count
k
a
very
influential
personage
in
petersburg
who
was
now
staying
in
paris
he
was
received
like
a
son
of
the
family
so
that
he
almost
lived
at
the
counts
the
letter
was
brief
and
the
object
of
it
was
perfectly
clear
though
it
contained
only
a
plain
statement
of
the
abovementioned
facts
without
drawing
any
inferences
from
them
varvara
petrovna
did
not
pause
long
to
consider
she
made
up
her
mind
instantly
made
her
preparations
and
taking
with
her
her
protge
dasha
shatovs
sister

set
off
in
the
middle
of
april
for
paris
and
from
there
went
on
to
switzerland
she
returned
in
july
alone
leaving
dasha
with
the
drozdovs
she
brought
us
the
news
that
the
drozdovs
themselves
had
promised
to
arrive
among
us
by
the
end
of
august
the
drozdovs
too
were
landowners
of
our
province

had
been
a
friend
of

a
colleague

her
husbands
had
always
prevented
them
from
visiting
their
magnificent
estate
on
the
death
of
the
general
which
had
taken
place
the
year
before
the
inconsolable
widow
had
gone
abroad
with
her
daughter
partly
in
order
to
try
the
grapecure
which
she
proposed
to
carry
out
at
verneymontreux
during
the
latter
half
of

be
reckoned
at
200000
roubles
to
say
nothing
of
the
propertywhich
was
bound
to
come
to
her
at
the
death
of
her
mother
who
had
no
children
by
her
second
marriage
varvara
petrovna
seemed
to
be
very
well
satisfied
with
her
expedition
in
her
own
opinion
she
had
succeeded
in
coming
to
a
satisfactory
understanding
with
praskovya
ivanovna
and
immediately
on
her
arrival
she
confided
everything
to
stepan
trofimovitch
she
was
positively
effusive
with
him
as
she
had
not
been
for
a
very
long
time
hurrah
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
and
snapped
his
fingers
he
was
in
a
perfect
rapture
especially
as
he
had
spent
the
whole
time
of
his
friends
absence
in
extreme
dejection
on
setting
off
she
had
not
even
taken
leave
of
him
properly
and
had
said
nothing
of
her
plan
to
that
old
woman
dreading
perhaps
that
he
might
chatter
about
it
she
was
cross
with
him
at
the
time
on
account
of
a
considerable
gambling
debt
which
she
had
suddenly
discovered
but
before
she
left
switzerland
she
had
felt
that
on
her
return
she
must
make
up
for
it
to
her
forsaken
friend
especially
as
she
had
treated
him
very
curtly
for
a
long
time
past
her
abrupt
and
mysterious
departure
had
made
a
profound
and
poignant
impression
on
the
timid
heart
of
stepan
trofimovitch
and
to
make
matters
worse
he
was
beset
with
other
difficulties
at
the
same
time
he
was
worried
by
a
very
considerable
money
obligation
which
had
weighed
upon
him
for
a
long
time
and
which
he
could
never
hope
to
meet
without
varvara
petrovnas
assistance
moreover
in
the
may
of
this
year
the
term
of
office
of
our
mild
and
gentle
ivan
ossipovitch
came
to
an
end
he
was
superseded
under
rather
unpleasant
circumstances
then
while
varvara
petrovna
was
still
away
there
followed
the
arrival
of
our
new
governor
andrey
antonovitch
von
lembke
and
with
that
a
change
began
at
once
to
be
perceptible
in
the
attitude
of
almost
the
whole
of
our
provincial
society
towards
varvara
petrovna
and
consequently
towards
stepan
trofimovitch
he
had
already
had
time
anyway
to
make
some
disagreeable
though
valuable
observations
and
seemed
very
apprehensive
alone
without
varvara
petrovna
he
had
an
agitating
suspicion
that
he
had
already
been
mentioned
to
the
governor
as
a
dangerous
man
he
knew
for
a
fact
that
some
of
our
ladies
meant
to
give
up
calling
on
varvara
petrovna
of
our
governors
wife
who
was
only
expected
to
arrive
in
the
autumn
it
was
reported
that
though
she
was
so
it
was
heard
proud
she
was
a
real
aristocrat
and
not
like
that
poor
varvara
petrovna
everybody
seemed
to
know
for
a
fact
and
in
the
greatest
detail
that
our
governors
wife
and
varvara
petrovna
had
met
already
in
society
and
had
parted
enemies
so
that
the
mere
mention
of
madame
von
lembkes
name
would
it
was
said
make
a
painful
impression
on
varvara
petrovna
the
confident
and
triumphant
air
of
varvara
petrovna
the
contemptuous
indifference
with
which
she
heard
of
the
opinions
of
our
provincial
ladies
and
the
agitation
in
local
society
revived
the
flagging
spirits
of
stepan
trofimovitch
and
cheered
him
up
at
once
with
peculiar
gleefullyobsequious
humour
he
was
beginning
to
describe
the
new
governors
arrival
you
are
no
doubt
aware
excellente
amie
he
said
jauntily
and
coquettishly
drawling
his
words
what
is
meant
by
a
russian
administrator
speaking
generally
and
what
is
meant
by
a
new
russian
administrator
that
is
the
newlybaked
newlyestablished
ces
interminables

but
i
dont
think
you
can
know
in
practice
what
is
meant
by
administrative
ardour
and
what
sort
of
thing
that
is
administrative

i
dont
know
what
that
is

that

sent

into

that

makes
you
think
hes
a
handsome
man
he
has
eyes
like
a
sheeps
precisely
so
but
in
this
i
yield
of
course
to
the
opinion
of
our
ladies
lets
get
on
stepan
trofimovitch
i
beg
you
by
the
way
youre
wearing
a
red
necktie
is
it
long
since
youve
taken
to
it
ive
ive
only
put
it
on
today
and
do
you
take
your
constitutional
do
you
go
for
a
fourmile
walk
every
day
as
the
doctor
told
you
to
nnot
always
i
knew
you
didnt
i
felt
sure
of
that
when
i
was
in
switzerland
she
cried
irritably
now
you
must
go
not
four
but
six
miles
a
day
youve
grown
terribly
slack
terribly
terribly
youre
not
simply
getting
old
youre
getting
decrepit
you
shocked
me
when
i
first
saw
you
just
now
in
spite
of
your
red
tie
quelle
idee
rouge
go
on
about
von
lembke
if
youve
really
something
to
tell
me
and
do
finish
some
time
i
entreat
you
im
tired
en
un
mot
i
only
wanted
to
say
that
he
is
one
of
those
administrators
who
begin
to
have
power
at
forty
who
till
theyre
forty
have
been
stagnating
in
insignificance
and
then
suddenly
come
to
the
front
through
suddenly
acquiring
a
wife
or
some
other
equally
desperate
means
that
is
he
has
gone
away
now
that
is
i
mean
to
say
it
was
at
once
whispered
in
both
his
ears
that
i
am
a
corrupter
of
youth
and
a
hotbed
of
provincial
atheism
he
began
making
inquiries
at
once
is
that
true
i
took
steps
about
it
in
fact
when
he
was
informed
that
you
ruled
the
province
vous
savez
he
allowed
himself
to
use
the
expression
that
there
shall
be
nothing
of
that
sort
in
the
future
did
he
say
that
that
there
shall
be
nothing
of
the
sort
in
future
and
avec
cette
morgue
his
wife
yulia
mihailovna
we
shall
behold
at
the
end
of
august
shes
coming
straight
from
petersburg
from
abroad
we
met
there
vraiment
in
paris
and
in
switzerland
shes
related
to
the
drozdovs
related
what
an
extraordinary
coincidence
they
say
she
is
ambitious
and
supposed
to
have
great
connections
nonsense
connections
indeed
she
was
an
old
maid
without
a
farthing
till
she
was
fiveandforty
but
now
shes
hooked
her
von
lembke
and
of
course
her
whole
object
is
to
push
him
forward
theyre
both
intriguers
and
they
say
shes
two
years
older
than
he
is
five
her
mother
used
to
wear
out
her
skirts
on
my
doorsteps
in
moscow
she
used
to
beg
for
an
invitation
to
our
balls
as
a
favour
when
my
husband
was
living
and
this
creature
used
to
sit
all
night
alone
in
a
corner
without
dancing
with
her
turquoise
fly
on
her
forehead
so
that
simply
from
pity
i
used
to
have
to
send
her
her
first
partner
at
two
oclock
in
the
morning
she
was
fiveandtwenty
then
and
they
used
to
rig
her
out
in
short
skirts
like
a
little
girl
it
was
improper
to
have
them
about
at
last
i
seem
to
see
that
fly
i
tell
you
as
soon
as
i
arrived
i
was
in
the
thick
of
an
intrigue
you
read
madame
drozdovs
letter
of
course
what
could
be
clearer
what
did
i
find
that
fool
praskovya
herselfshe
always
was
a
foollooked
at
me
as
much
as
to
ask
why
id
come
you
can
fancy
how
surprised
i
was
i
looked
round
and
there
was
that
lembke
woman
at
her
tricks
and
that
cousin
of
hersold
drozdovs
nephewit
was
all
clear
you
may
be
sure
i
changed
all
that
in
a
twinkling
and
praskovya
is
on
my
side
again
but
what
an
intrigue
in
which
you
came
off
victor
however
bismarck
without
being
a
bismarck
im
equal
to
falseness
and
stupidity
wherever
i
meet
it
falseness
and
praskovyas
folly
i
dont
know
when
ive
met
such
a
flabby
woman
and
whats
more
her
legs
are
swollen
and
shes
a
goodnatured
simpleton
too
what
can
be
more
foolish
than
a
goodnatured
simpleton
a
spiteful
fool
ma
bonne
amie
a
spiteful
fool
is
still
more
foolish
stepan
trofimovitch
protested
magnanimously
youre
right
perhaps
do
you
remember
liza
charmante
enfant
but
shes
not
an
enfant
now
but
a
woman
and
a
woman
of
character
shes
a
generous
passionate
creature
and
what
i
like
about
her
she
stands
up
to
that
confiding
fool
her
mother
there
was
almost
a
row
over
that
cousin
bah
and
of
course
hes
no
relation
of
lizaveta
nikolaevnas
at
all
has
he
designs
on
her
you
see
hes
a
young
officer
not
by
any
means
talkative
modest
in
fact
i
always
want
to
be
just
i
fancy
he
is
opposed
to
the
intrigue
himself
and
isnt
aiming
at
anything
and
it
was
only
the
von
lembkes
tricks
he
had
a
great
respect
for
nicolas
you
understand
it
all
depends
on
liza
but
i
left
her
on
the
best
of
terms
with
nicolas
and
he
promised
he
would
come
to
us
in
november
so
its
only
the
von
lembke
who
is
intriguing
and
praskovya
is
a
blind
woman
she
suddenly
tells
me
that
all
my
suspicions
are
fancy
i
told
her
to
her
face
she
was
a
fool
i
am
ready
to
repeat
it
at
the
day
of
judgment
and
if
it
hadnt
been
for
nicolas
begging
me
to
leave
it
for
a
time
i
wouldnt
have
come
away
without
unmasking
that
false
woman
shes
been
trying
to
ingratiate
herself
with
count
k
through
nicolas
she
wants
to
come
between
mother
and
son
but
lizas
on
our
side
and
i
came
to
an
understanding
with
praskovya
do
you
know
that
karmazinov
is
a
relation
of
hers
what
a
relation
of
madame
von
lembke
yes
of
hers
distant
karmazinov
the
novelist
yes
the
writer
why
does
it
surprise
you
of
course
he
considers
himself
a
great
man
stuckup
creature
shes
coming
here
with
him
now
shes
making
a
fuss
of
him
out
there
shes
got
a
notion
of
setting
up
a
sort
of
literary
society
here
hes
coming
for
a
month
he
wants
to
sell
his
last
piece
of
property
here
i
very
nearly
met
him
in
switzerland
and
was
very
anxious
not
to
though
i
hope
he
will
deign
to
recognise
me
he
wrote
letters
to
me
in
the
old
days
he
has
been
in
my
house

should
like

i
i
understand
the
same
as

and
drinking
the
club
and
cards
and
the
reputation
of
an
atheist

dont
like
that
reputation
stepan
trofimovitch
i
dont
care
for
you
to
be
called
an
atheist
particularly
now
i
didnt
care
for
it
in
old
days
for
its
all
nothing

empty
chatter

must
be
said

here
i
thought
a
great
deal
about
you
ive
come
to
one
conclusion
what
conclusion
that
you
and
i
are
not
the
wisest
people
in
the
world
but
that
there
are
people
wiser
than
we
are
witty
and
apt
if
there
are
people
wiser
than
we
are
then
there
are
people
more
right
than
we
are
and
we
may
be
mistaken
you
mean
mais
ma
bonne
amie
granted
that
i
may
make
a
mistake
yet
have
i
not
the
common
human
eternal
supreme
right
of
freedom
of
conscience
i
have
the
right
not
to
be
bigoted
or
superstitious
if
i
dont
wish
to
and
for
that
i
shall
naturally
be
hated
by
certain
persons
to
the
end
of
time
et
puis
comme
on
trouve
toujours
plus
de
moines
que
de
raison
and
as
i
thoroughly
agree
with
that
what
what
did
you
say
i
said
on
trouve
toujours
plus
de
moines
que
de
raison
and
as
i
thoroughly
im
sure
thats
not
your
saying
you
must
have
taken
it
from
somewhere
it
was
pascal
said
that
just
as
i
thoughtits
not
your
own
why
dont
you
ever
say
anything
like
that
yourself
so
shortly
and
to
the
point
instead
of
dragging
things
out
to
such
a
length
thats
much
better
than
what
you
said
just
now
about
administrative
ardour
ma
foi
chre
why
in
the
first
place
probably
because
im
not
a
pascal
after
all
et
puis
secondly
we
russians
never
can
say
anything
in
our
own
language
we
never
have
said
anything
hitherto
at
any
rate
hm
thats
not
true
perhaps
anyway
youd
better
make
a
note
of
such
phrases
and
remember
them
you
know
in
case
you
have
to
talk
ach
stephan
trofimovitch
i
have
come
to
talk
to
you
seriously
quite
seriously
chre
chre
amie
now
that
all
these
von
lembkes
and
karmazinovs
oh
my
goodness
how
you
have
deteriorated
oh
my
goodness
how
you
do
torment
me
i
should
have
liked
these
people
to
feel
a
respect
for
you
for
theyre
not
worth
your
little
fingerbut
the
way
you
behave
what
will
they
see
what
shall
i
have
to
show
them
instead
of
nobly
standing
as
an
example
keeping
up
the
tradition
of
the
past
you
surround
yourself
with
a
wretched
rabble
you
have
picked
up
impossible
habits
youve
grown
feeble
you
cant
do
without
wine
and
cards
you
read
nothing
but
paul
de
kock
and
write
nothing
while
all
of
them
write
all
your
times
wasted
in
gossip
how
can
you
bring
yourself
to
be
friends
with
a
wretched
creature
like
your
inseparable
liputin
why
is
he
mine
and
inseparable
stepan
trofimovitch
protested
timidly
where
is
he
now
varvara
petrovna
went
on
sharply
and
sternly
he
he
has
an
infinite
respect
for
you
and
hes
gone
to
sk
to
receive
an
inheritance
left
him
by
his
mother
he
seems
to
do
nothing
but
get
money
and
hows
shatov
is
he
just
the
same
irascible
mais
bon
i
cant
endure
your
shatov
hes
spiteful
and
he
thinks
too
much
of
himself
how
is
darya
pavlovna
you
mean
dasha
what
made
you
think
of
her
varvara
petrovna
looked
at
him
inquisitively
shes
quite
well
i
left
her
with
the
drozdovs
i
heard
something
about
your
son
in
switzerland
nothing
good
oh
cest
un
histoire
bien
bte
je
vous
attendais
ma
bonne
amie
pour
vous
raconter
enough
stepan
trofimovitch
leave
me
in
peace
im
worn
out
we
shall
have
time
to
talk
to
our
hearts
content
especially
of
whats
unpleasant
youve
begun
to
splutter
when
you
laugh
its
a
sign
of
senility
and
what
a
strange
way
of
laughing
youve
taken
to
good
heavens
what
a
lot
of
bad
habits
youve
fallen
into
karmazinov
wont
come
and
see
you
and
people
are
only
too
glad
to
make
the
most
of
anything
as
it
is
youve
betrayed
yourself
completely
now
well
come
thats
enough
thats
enough
im
tired
you
really
might
have
mercy
upon
one
stepan
trofimovitch
had
mercy
but
he
withdrew
in
great
perturbation
v
our
friend
certainly
had
fallen
into
not
a
few
bad
habits
especially
of
late
he
had
obviously
and
rapidly
deteriorated
and
it
was
true
that
he
had
become
slovenly
he
drank
more
and
had
become
more
tearful
and
nervous
and
had
grown
too
impressionable
on
the
artistic
side
his
face
had
acquired
a
strange
facility
for
changing
with
extraordinary
quickness
from
the
most
solemn
expression
for
instance
to
the
most
absurd
and
even
foolish
he
could
not
endure
solitude
and
was
always
craving
for
amusement
one
had
always
to
repeat
to
him
some
gossip
some
local
anecdote
and
every
day
a
new
one
if
no
one
came
to
see
him
for
a
long
time
he
wandered
disconsolately
about
the
rooms
walked
to
the
window
puckering
up
his
lips
heaved
deep
sighs
and
almost
fell
to
whimpering
at
last
he
was
always
full
of
forebodings
was
afraid
of
something
unexpected
and
inevitable
he
had
become
timorous
he
began
to
pay
great
attention
to
his
dreams
he
spent
all
that
day
and
evening
in
great
depression
he
sent
for
me
was
very
much
agitated
talked
a
long
while
gave
me
a
long
account
of
things
but
all
rather
disconnected
varvara
petrovna
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
he
concealed
nothing
from
me
it
seemed
to
me
at
last
that
he
was
worried
about
something
particular
and
was
perhaps
unable
to
form
a
definite
idea
of
it
himself
as
a
rule
when
we
met
ttette
and
he
began
making
long
complaints
to
me
a
bottle
was
almost
always
brought
in
after
a
little
time
and
things
became
much
more
comfortable
this
time
there
was
no
wine
and
he
was
evidently
struggling
all
the
while
against
the
desire
to
send
for
it
and
why
is
she
always
so
cross
he
complained
every
minute
like
a
child
tous
les
hommes
de
gnie
et
de
progrs
en
russie
taient
sont
et
seront
toujours
des
gamblers
et
des
drunkards
qui
boivent
in
outbreaks
and
im
not
such
a
gambler
after
all
and
im
not
such
a
drunkard
she
reproaches
me
for
not
writing
anything
strange
idea
she
asks
why
i
lie
down
she
says
i
ought
to
stand
an
example
and
reproach
mais
entre
nous
soit
dit
what
is
a
man
to
do
who
is
destined
to
stand
as
a
reproach
if
not
to
lie
down
does
she
understand
that
and
at
last
it
became
clear
to
me
what
was
the
chief
particular
trouble
which
was
worrying
him
so
persistently
at
this
time
many
times
that
evening
he
went
to
the
lookingglass
and
stood
a
long
while
before
it
at
last
he
turned
from
the
lookingglass
to
me
and
with
a
sort
of
strange
despair
said
mon
cher
je
suis
un
brokendown
man
yes
certainly
up
to
that
time
up
to
that
very
day
there
was
one
thing
only
of
which
he
had
always
felt
confident
in
spite
of
the
new
views
and
of
the
change
in
varvara
petrovnas
ideas
that
was
the
conviction
that
still
he
had
a
fascination
for
her
feminine
heart
not
simply
as
an
exile
or
a
celebrated
man
of
learning
but
as
a
handsome
man
for
twenty
years
this
soothing
and
flattering
opinion
had
been
rooted
in
his
mind
and
perhaps
of
all
his
convictions
this
was
the
hardest
to
part
with
had
he
any
presentiment
that
evening
of
the
colossal
ordeal
which
was
preparing
for
him
in
the
immediate
future
vi
i
will
now
enter
upon
the
description
of
that
almost
forgotten
incident
with
which
my
story
properly
speaking
begins
at
last
at
the
very
end
of
august
the
drozdovs
returned
their
arrival
made
a
considerable
sensation
in
local
society
and
took
place
shortly
before
their
relation
our
new
governors
wife
made
her
longexpected
appearance
but
of
all
these
interesting
events
i
will
speak
later
for
the
present
i
will
confine
myself
to
saying
that
praskovya
ivanovna
brought
varvara
petrovna
who
was
expecting
her
so
impatiently
a
most
perplexing
problem
nikolay
had
parted
from
them
in
july
and
meeting
count
k
on
the
rhine
had
set
off
with
him
and
his
family
for
petersburg
nbthe
counts
three
daughters
were
all
of
marriageable
age
lizaveta
is
so
proud
and
obstinate
that
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
her
praskovya
ivanovna
said
in
conclusion
but
i
saw
for
myself
that
something
had
happened
between
her
and
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
i
dont
know
the
reasons
but
i
fancy
my
dear
varvara
petrovna
that
you
will
have
to
ask
your
darya
pavlovna
for
them
to
my
thinking
liza
was
offended
im
glad
i
can
tell
you
that
ive
brought
you
back
your
favourite
at
last
and
handed
her
over
to
you
its
a
weight
off
my
mind
these
venomous
words
were
uttered
with
remarkable
irritability
it
was
evident
that
the
flabby
woman
had
prepared
them
and
gloated
beforehand
over
the
effect
they
would
produce
but
varvara
petrovna
was
not
the
woman
to
be
disconcerted
by
sentimental
effects
and
enigmas
she
sternly
demanded
the
most
precise
and
satisfactory
explanations
praskovya
ivanovna
immediately
lowered
her
tone
and
even
ended
by
dissolving
into
tears
and
expressions
of
the
warmest
friendship
this
irritable
but
sentimental
lady
like
stepan
trofimovitch
was
forever
yearning
for
true
friendship
and
her
chief
complaint
against
her
daughter
lizaveta
nikolaevna
was
just
that
her
daughter
was
not
a
friend
to
her
but
from
all
her
explanations
and
outpourings
nothing
certain
could
be
gathered
but
that
there
actually
had
been
some
sort
of
quarrel
between
liza
and
nikolay
but
of
the
nature
of
the
quarrel
praskovya
ivanovna
was
obviously
unable
to
form
a
definite
idea
as
for
her
imputations
against
darya
pavlovna
she
not
only
withdrew
them
completely
in
the
end
but
even
particularly
begged
varvara
petrovna
to
pay
no
attention
to
her
words
because
they
had
been
said
in
irritation
in
fact
it
had
all
been
left
very
far
from
clearsuspicious
indeed
according
to
her
account
the
quarrel
had
arisen
from
lizas
obstinate
and
ironical
character
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
is
proud
too
and
though
he
was
very
much
in
love
yet
he
could
not
endure
sarcasm
and
began
to
be
sarcastic
himself
soon
afterwards
we
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
man
the
nephew
i
believe
of
your
professor
and
indeed
the
surnames
the
same
the
son
not
the
nephew
varvara
petrovna
corrected
her
even
in
old
days
praskovya
ivanovna
had
been
always
unable
to
recall
stepan
trofimovitchs
name
and
had
always
called
him
the
professor
well
his
son
then
so
much
the
better
of
course
its
all
the
same
to
me
an
ordinary
young
man
very
lively
and
free
in
his
manners
but
nothing
special
in
him
well
then
liza
herself
did
wrong
she
made
friends
with
the
young
man
with
the
idea
of
making
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
jealous
i
dont
see
much
harm
in
that
its
the
way
of
girls
quite
usual
even
charming
in
them
only
instead
of
being
jealous
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
made
friends
with
the
young
man
himself
just
as
though
he
saw
nothing
and
didnt
care
this
made
liza
furious
the
young
man
soon
went
away
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
somewhere
and
liza
took
to
picking
quarrels
with
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
at
every
opportunity
she
noticed
that
he
used
sometimes
to
talk
to
dasha
and
well
she
got
in
such
a
frantic
state
that
even
my
life
wasnt
worth
living
my
dear
the
doctors
have
forbidden
my
being
irritated
and
i
was
so
sick
of
their
lake
they
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
simply
gave
me
toothache
i
had
such
rheumatism
its
stated
in
print
that
the
lake
of
geneva
does
give
people
the
toothache
its
a
feature
of
the
place
then
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
suddenly
got
a
letter
from
the
countess
and
he
left
us
at
once
he
packed
up
in
one
day
they
parted
in
a
friendly
way
and
liza
became
very
cheerful
and
frivolous
and
laughed
a
great
deal
seeing
him
off
only
that
was
all
put
on
when
he
had
gone
she
became
very
thoughtful
and
she
gave
up
speaking
of
him
altogether
and
wouldnt
let
me
mention
his
name
and
i
should
advise
you
dear
varvara
petrovna
not
to
approach
the
subject
with
liza
youll
only
do
harm
but
if
you
hold
your
tongue
shell
begin
to
talk
of
it
herself
and
then
youll
learn
more
i
believe
theyll
come
together
again
if
only
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
doesnt
put
off
coming
as
he
promised
ill
write
to
him
at
once
if
thats
how
it
was
there
was
nothing
in
the
quarrel
all
nonsense
and
i
know
darya
too
well
its
nonsense
im
sorry
for
what
i
said
about
dashenka
i
did
wrong
their
conversations
were
quite
ordinary
and
they
talked
out
loud
too
but
it
all
upset
me
so
much
at
the
time
my
dear
and
liza
i
saw
got
on
with
her
again
as
affectionately
as
before
that
very
day
varvara
petrovna
wrote
to
nikolay
and
begged
him
to
come
if
only
one
month
earlier
than
the
date
he
had
fixed
but
yet
she
still
felt
that
there
was
something
unexplained
and
obscure
in
the
matter
she
pondered
over
it
all
the
evening
and
all
night
praskovyas
opinion
seemed
to
her
too
innocent
and
sentimental
praskovya
has
always
been
too
sentimental
from
the
old
schooldays
upwards
she
reflected
nicolas
is
not
the
man
to
run
away
from
a
girls
taunts
theres
some
other
reason
for
it
if
there
really
has
been
a
breach
between
them
that
officers
here
though
theyve
brought
him
with
them
as
a
relation
he
lives
in
their
house
and
as
for
darya
praskovya
was
in
too
much
haste
to
apologise
she
must
have
kept
something
to
herself
which
she
wouldnt
tell
me
by
the
morning
varvara
petrovna
had
matured
a
project
for
putting
a
stop
once
for
all
to
one
misunderstanding
at
least
a
project
amazing
in
its
unexpectedness
what
was
in
her
heart
when
she
conceived
it
it
would
be
hard
to
decide
and
i
will
not
undertake
to
explain
beforehand
all
the
incongruities
of
which
it
was
made
up
i
simply
confine
myself
as
chronicler
to
recording
events
precisely
as
they
happened
and
it
is
not
my
fault
if
they
seem
incredible
yet
i
must
once
more
testify
that
by
the
morning
there
was
not
the
least
suspicion
of
dasha
left
in
varvara
petrovnas
mind
though
in
reality
there
never
had
been
anyshe
had
too
much
confidence
in
her
besides
she
could
not
admit
the
idea
that
nicolas
could
be
attracted
by
her
darya
next
morning
when
darya
pavlovna
was
pouring
out
tea
at
the
table
varvara
petrovna
looked
for
a
long
while
intently
at
her
and
perhaps
for
the
twentieth
time
since
the
previous
day
repeated
to
herself
its
all
nonsense
all
she
noticed
was
that
dasha
looked
rather
tired
and
that
she
was
even
quieter
and
more
apathetic
than
she
used
to
be
after
their
morning
tea
according
to
their
invariable
custom
they
sat
down
to
needlework
varvara
petrovna
demanded
from
her
a
full
account
of
her
impressions
abroad
especially
of
nature
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
towns
the
customs
their
arts
and
commerceof
everything
she
had
time
to
observe
she
asked
no
questions
about
the
drozdovs
or
how
she
had
got
on
with
them
dasha
sitting
beside
her
at
the
worktable
helping
her
with
the
embroidery
talked
for
half
an
hour
in
her
even
monotonous
but
rather
weak
voice
darya
varvara
petrovna
interrupted
suddenly
is
there
nothing
special
you
want
to
tell
me
no
nothing
said
dasha
after
a
moments
thought
and
she
glanced
at
varvara
petrovna
with
her
lightcoloured
eyes
nothing
on
your
soul
on
your
heart
or
your
conscience
nothing
dasha
repeated
quietly
but
with
a
sort
of
sullen
firmness
i
knew
there
wasnt
believe
me
darya
i
shall
never
doubt
you
now
sit
still
and
listen
in
front
of
me
on
that
chair
i
want
to
see
the
whole
of
you
thats
right
listen
do
you
want
to
be
married
dasha
responded
with
a
long
inquiring
but
not
greatly
astonished
look
stay
hold
your
tongue
in
the
first
place
there
is
a
very
great
difference
in
age
but
of
course
you
know
better
than
anyone
what
nonsense
that
is
youre
a
sensible
girl
and
there
must
be
no
mistakes
in
your
life
besides
hes
still
a
handsome
man
in
short
stepan
trofimovitch
for
whom
you
have
always
had
such
a
respect
well
dasha
looked
at
her
still
more
inquiringly
and
this
time
not
simply
with
surprise
she
blushed
perceptibly
stay
hold
your
tongue
dont
be
in
a
hurry
though
you
will
have
money
under
my
will
yet
when
i
die
what
will
become
of
you
even
if
you
have
money
youll
be
deceived
and
robbed
of
your
money
youll
be
lost
in
fact
but
married
to
him
youre
the
wife
of
a
distinguished
man
look
at
him
on
the
other
hand
though
ive
provided
for
him
if
i
die
what
will
become
of
him
but
i
could
trust
him
to
you
stay
ive
not
finished
hes
frivolous
shillyshally
cruel
egoistic
he
has
low
habits
but
mind
you
think
highly
of
him
in
the
first
place
because
there
are
many
worse
i
dont
want
to
get
you
off
my
hands
by
marrying
you
to
a
rascal
you
dont
imagine
anything
of
that
sort
do
you
and
above
all
because
i
ask
you
youll
think
highly
of
him
she
broke
off
suddenly
and
irritably
do
you
hear
why
wont
you
say
something
dasha
still
listened
and
did
not
speak
stay
wait
a
little
hes
an
old
woman
but
you
know
thats
all
the
better
for
you
besides
hes
a
pathetic
old
woman
he
doesnt
deserve
to
be
loved
by
a
woman
at
all
but
he
deserves
to
be
loved
for
his
helplessness
and
you
must
love
him
for
his
helplessness
you
understand
me
dont
you
do
you
understand
me
dasha
nodded
her
head
affirmatively
i
knew
you
would
i
expected
as
much
of
you
he
will
love
you
because
he
ought
he
ought
he
ought
to
adore
you
varvara
petrovna
almost
shrieked
with
peculiar
exasperation
besides
he
will
be
in
love
with
you
without
any
ought
about
it
i
know
him
and
another
thing
i
shall
always
be
here
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
always
be
here
he
will
complain
of
you
hell
begin
to
say
things
against
you
behind
your
back
hell
whisper
things
against
you
to
any
stray
person
he
meets
hell
be
for
ever
whining
and
whining
hell
write
you
letters
from
one
room
to
another
two
a
day
but
he
wont
be
able
to
get
on
without
you
all
the
same
and
thats
the
chief
thing
make
him
obey
you
if
you
cant
make
him
youll
be
a
fool
hell
want
to
hang
himself
and
threaten
todont
you
believe
it
its
nothing
but
nonsense
dont
believe
it
but
still
keep
a
sharp
lookout
you
never
can
tell
and
one
day
he
may
hang
himself
it
does
happen
with
people
like
that
its
not
through
strength
of
will
but
through
weakness
that
people
hang
themselves
and
so
never
drive
him
to
an
extreme
thats
the
first
rule
in
married
life
remember
too
that
hes
a
poet
listen
dasha
theres
no
greater
happiness
than
selfsacrifice
and
besides
youll
be
giving
me
great
satisfaction
and
thats
the
chief
thing
dont
think
ive
been
talking
nonsense
i
understand
what
im
saying
im
an
egoist
you
be
an
egoist
too
of
course
im
not
forcing
you
its
entirely
for
you
to
decide
as
you
say
so
it
shall
be
well
whats
the
good
of
sitting

this

varvara

married
said
dasha
firmly
must
what
are
you
hinting
at
varvara
petrovna
looked
sternly
and
intently
at
her
dasha
was
silent
picking
at
her
embroidery
canvas
with
her
needle
though
youre
a
clever
girl
youre
talking
nonsense

it
is
true
that
i
have
certainly
set
my
heart
on
marrying
you
yet
its
not
because
its
necessary
but
simply
because
the
idea
has
occurred
to
me
and
only
to
stepan
trofimovitch
if
it
had
not
been
for
stepan
trofimovitch
i
should
not
have
thought
of
marrying
you

though
you
are
twenty
well
ill
do
as
you

thousand

something
and
let
his
friends
come
to

him
once
a
week
but
if

will
speak
directly
she
jumped
up
at
once
and
threw
on
a
black
shawl
dasha
flushed
a
little
again
and
watched
her
with
questioning
eyes
varvara
petrovna
turned
suddenly
to
her
with
a
face
flaming
with
anger
youre
a
fool
she
swooped
down
on
her
like
a
hawk
an
ungrateful
fool
whats
in
your
mind
can
you
imagine
that
id
compromise
you
in
any
way
in
the
smallest
degree
why
he
shall
crawl
on
his
knees
to
ask
you
he
must
be
dying
of
happiness
thats
how
it
shall
be
arranged
why
you
know
that
id
never
let

or

the
sake
of
that
eight
thousand
and
that

a
fool

fool

all
ungrateful
fools
give
me
my
umbrella
and
she
flew
off
to
walk
by
the
wet
brick
pavements
and
the
wooden
planks
to
stepan
trofimovitchs
vii
it
was
true
that
she
would
never
have
let
dasha
suffer
on
the
contrary
she
considered
now
that
she
was
acting
as
her
benefactress
the
most
generous
and
legitimate
indignation
was
glowing
in
her
soul
when
as
she
put
on
her
shawl
she
caught
fixed
upon
her
the
embarrassed
and
mistrustful
eyes
of
her
protge
she
had
genuinely
loved
the
girl
from
her
childhood
upwards
praskovya
ivanovna
had
with
justice
called
darya
pavlovna
her
favourite
long
ago
varvara
petrovna
had
made
up
her
mind
once
for
all
that
daryas
disposition
was
not
like
her
brothers
not
that
is
like
ivan
shatovs
that
she
was
quiet
and
gentle
and
capable
of
great
selfsacrifice
that
she
was
distinguished
by
a
power
of
devotion
unusual
modesty
rare
reasonableness
and
above
all
by
gratitude
till
that
time
dasha
had
to
all
appearances
completely
justified
her
expectations
in
that
life
there
will
be
no
mistakes
said
varvara
petrovna
when
the
girl
was
only
twelve
years
old
and
as
it
was
characteristic
of
her
to
attach
herself
doggedly
and
passionately
to
any
dream
that
fascinated
her
any
new
design
any
idea
that
struck
her
as
noble
she
made
up
her
mind
at
once
to
educate
dasha
as
though
she
were
her
own
daughter
she
at
once
set
aside
a
sum
of
money
for
her
and
sent
for
a
governess
miss
criggs
who
lived
with
them
until
the
girl
was
sixteen
but
she
was
for
some
reason
suddenly
dismissed
teachers
came
for
her
from
the
high
school
among
them
a
real
frenchman
who
taught
dasha
french
he
too
was
suddenly
dismissed
almost
turned
out
of
the
house
a
poor
lady
a
widow
of
good
family
taught
her
to
play
the
piano
yet
her
chief
tutor
was
stepan
trofimovitch
in
reality
he
first
discovered
dasha
he
began
teaching
the
quiet
child
even
before
varvara
petrovna
had
begun
to
think
about
her
i
repeat
again
it
was
wonderful
how
children
took
to
him
lizaveta
nikolaevna
tushin
had
been
taught
by
him
from
the
age
of
eight
till
eleven
stepan
trofimovitch
took
no
fees
of
course
for
his
lessons
and
would
not
on
any
account
have
taken
payment
from
the
drozdovs
but
he
fell
in
love
with
the
charming
child
and
used
to
tell
her
poems
of
a
sort
about
the
creation
of
the
world
about
the
earth
and
the
history
of
humanity
his
lectures
about
the
primitive
peoples
and
primitive
man
were
more
interesting
than
the
arabian
nights
liza
who
was
ecstatic
over
these
stories
used
to
mimic
stepan
trofimovitch
very
funnily
at
home
he
heard
of
this
and
once
peeped
in
on
her
unawares
liza
overcome
with
confusion
flung
herself
into
his
arms
and
shed
tears
stepan
trofimovitch
wept
too
with
delight
but
liza
soon
after
went
away
and
only
dasha
was
left
when
dasha
began
to
have
other
teachers
stepan
trofimovitch
gave
up
his
lessons
with
her
and
by
degrees
left
off
noticing
her
things
went
on
like
this
for
a
long
time
once
when
she
was
seventeen
he
was
struck
by
her
prettiness
it
happened
at
varvara
petrovnas
table
he
began
to
talk
to
the
young
girl
was
much
pleased
with
her
answers
and
ended
by
offering
to
give
her
a
serious
and
comprehensive
course
of
lessons
on
the
history
of
russian
literature
varvara
petrovna
approved
and
thanked
him
for
his
excellent
idea
and
dasha
was
delighted
stepan
trofimovitch
proceeded
to
make
special
preparations
for
the
lectures
and
at
last
they
began
they
began
with
the
most
ancient
period
the
first
lecture
went
off
enchantingly
varvara
petrovna
was
present
when
stepan
trofimovitch
had
finished
and
as
he
was
going
informed
his
pupil
that
the
next
time
he
would
deal
with
the
story
of
the
expedition
of
igor
varvara
petrovna
suddenly
got
up
and
announced
that
there
would
be
no
more
lessons
stepan
trofimovitch
winced
but
said
nothing
and
dasha
flushed
crimson
it
put
a
stop
to
the
scheme
however
this
had
happened
just
three
years
before
varvara
petrovnas
unexpected
fancy
poor
stepan
trofimovitch
was
sitting
alone
free
from
all
misgivings
plunged
in
mournful
reveries
he
had
for
some
time
been
looking
out
of
the
window
to
see
whether
any
of
his
friends
were
coming
but
nobody
would
come
it
was
drizzling
it
was
turning
cold
he
would
have
to
have
the
stove
heated
he
sighed
suddenly
a
terrible
apparition
flashed
upon
his
eyes
varvara
petrovna
in
such
weather
and
at
such
an
unexpected
hour
to
see
him
and
on
foot
he
was
so
astounded
that
he
forgot
to
put
on
his
coat
and
received
her
as
he
was
in
his
everlasting
pinkwadded
dressingjacket
ma
bonne

he
cried
faintly
to
greet
her

from
the
next
room

she
told
him
everything
at
once
abruptly
and
impressively
she
hinted
at
the
eight
thousand
of
which
he
stood
in
such
terrible
need
she
told
him
in
detail
of
the
dowry
stepan
trofimovitch
sat
trembling
opening
his
eyes
wider
and
wider
he
heard
it
all
but
he
could
not
realise
it
clearly
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
kept
breaking
all
he
knew
was
that
everything
would
be
as
she
said
that
to
protest
and
refuse
to
agree
would
be
useless
and
that
he
was
a
married

i

fact
he
muttered
at
once
flattered
by
varvara
petrovnas
adroit
insinuations
i
was
just
preparing
to
sit
down
to
my
tales
from
spanish
history

worry
about
her
and
theres
no
need
for
you
to
be
inquisitive
of
course
you
must
ask
her
yourself
entreat
her
to
do
you
the
honour
you
understand
but
dont
be
uneasy

besides
you

her
stepan
trofimovitch
felt
giddy
the
walls
were
going
round
there
was
one
terrible
idea
underlying
this
to
which
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
excellente
amie
his
voice
quivered
suddenly
i
could
never
have
conceived
that
you
would
make
up
your
mind
to
give
me
in
marriage
to
another
woman
youre
not
a
girl
stepan
trofimovitch
only
girls

given
in
marriage
you
are
taking
a
wife
varvara
petrovna
hissed
malignantly
oui
jai
pris
un
mot
pour
un
autre
mais
cest
gal
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
hopeless
air
i
see
that
cest
gal
she
muttered
contemptuously
through
her
teeth
good
heavens
why
hes
going
to
faint
nastasya
nastasya
water
but
water
was
not

he
came
to
himself
varvara
petrovna
took
up
her
umbrella
i
see
its
no
use
talking
to
you
now
oui

again
at
this
time

for
a
final
answer
and
i
trust
it
will
be
satisfactory

nastasya
the
next
day
of
course
he
consented
and
indeed
he
could
do
nothing
else
there
was
one
circumstance
viii
stepan
trofimovitchs
estate
as
we
used
to
call
it
which
consisted
of
fifty
souls
reckoning
in
the
old
fashion
and
bordered
on
skvoreshniki
was
not
really
his
at
all
but
his
first
wifes
and
so
belonged
now
to
his
son
pyotr
stepanovitch
verhovensky
stepan
trofimovitch
was
simply
his
trustee
and
so
when
the
nestling
was
fullfledged
he
had
given
his
father
a
formal
authorisation
to
manage
the
estate
this
transaction
was
a
profitable
one
for
the
young
man
he
received
as
much
as
a
thousand
roubles
a
year
by
way
of
revenue
from
the
estate
though
under
the
new
regime
it
could
not
have
yielded
more
than
five
hundred
and
possibly
not
that
god
knows
how
such
an
arrangement
had
arisen
the
whole
sum
however
was
sent
the
young
man
by
varvara
petrovna
and
stepan
trofimovitch
had
nothing
to
do
with
a
single
rouble
of
it
on
the
other
hand
the
whole
revenue
from
the
land
remained
in
his
pocket
and
he
had
besides
completely
ruined
the
estate
letting
it
to
a
mercenary
rogue
and
without
the
knowledge
of
varvara
petrovna
selling
the
timber
which
gave
the
estate
its
chief
value
he
had
some
time
before
sold
the
woods
bit
by
bit
it
was
worth
at
least
eight
thousand
yet
he
had
only
received
five
thousand
for
it
but
he
sometimes
lost
too
much
at
the
club
and
was
afraid
to
ask
varvara
petrovna
for
the
money
she
clenched
her
teeth
when
she
heard
at
last
of
everything
and
now
all
at
once
his
son
announced
that
he
was
coming
himself
to
sell
his
property
for
what
he
could
get
for
it
and
commissioned
his
father
to
take
steps
promptly
to
arrange
the
sale
it
was
clear
that
stepan
trofimovitch
being
a
generous
and
disinterested
man
felt
ashamed
of
his
treatment
of
ce
cher
enfant
whom
he
had
seen
for
the
last
time
nine
years
before
as
a
student
in
petersburg
the
estate
might
originally
have
been
worth
thirteen
or
fourteen
thousand
now
it
was
doubtful
whether
anyone
would
give
five
for
it
no
doubt
stepan
trofimovitch
was
fully
entitled
by
the
terms
of
the
trust
to
sell
the
wood
and
taking
into
account
the
incredibly
large
yearly
revenue
of
a
thousand
roubles
which
had
been
sent
punctually
for
so
many
years
he
could
have
put
up
a
good
defence
of
his
management
but
stepan
trofimovitch
was
a
generous
man
of
exalted
impulses
a
wonderfully
fine
inspiration
occurred
to
his
mind
when
petrusha
returned
to
lay
on
the
table
before
him
the
maximum
price
of
fifteen
thousand
roubles
without
a
hint
at
the
sums
that
had
been
sent
him
hitherto
and
warmly
and
with
tears
to
press
ce
cher
fils
to
his
heart
and
so
to
make
an
end
of
all
accounts
between
them
he
began
cautiously
and
indirectly
unfolding
this
picture
before
varvara
petrovna
he
hinted
that
this
would
add
a
peculiarly
noble
note
to
their
friendship
to
their
idea
this
would
set
the
parents
of
the
last
generationand
people
of
the
last
generation
generallyin
such
a
disinterested
and
magnanimous
light
in
comparison
with
the
new
frivolous
and
socialistic
younger
generation
he
said
a
great
deal
more
but
varvara
petrovna
was
obstinately
silent
at
last
she
informed
him
airily
that
she
was
prepared
to
buy
their
estate
and
to
pay
for
it
the
maximum
price
that
is
six
or
seven
thousand
though
four
would
have
been
a
fair
price
for
it
of
the
remaining
eight
thousand
which
had
vanished
with
the
woods
she
said
not
a
word
this
conversation
took
place
a
month
before
the
match
was
proposed
to
him
stepan
trofimovitch
was
overwhelmed
and
began
to
ponder
there
might
in
the
past
have
been
a
hope
that
his
son
would
not
come
after
allan
outsider
that
is
to
say
might
have
hoped
so
stepan
trofimovitch
as
a
father
would
have
indignantly
rejected
the
insinuation
that
he
could
entertain
such
a
hope
anyway
queer
rumours
had
hitherto
been
reaching
us
about
petrusha
to
begin
with
on
completing
his
studies
at
the
university
six
years
before
he
had
hung
about
in
petersburg
without
getting
work
suddenly
we
got
the
news
that
he
had
taken
part
in
issuing
some
anonymous
manifesto
and
that
he
was
implicated
in
the
affair
then
he
suddenly
turned
up
abroad
in
switzerland
at
genevahe
had
escaped
very
likely
its
surprising
to
me
stepan
trofimovitch
commented
greatly
disconcerted
petrusha
cest
une
si
pauvre
tte
hes
good
noblehearted
very
sensitive
and
i
was
so
delighted
with
him
in
petersburg
comparing
him
with
the
young
people
of
today
but
cest
un
pauvre
sire
tout
de
mme
and
you
know
it
all
comes
from
that
same
halfbakedness
that
sentimentality
they
are
fascinated
not
by
realism
but
by
the
emotional
ideal
side
of
socialism
by
the
religious
note
in
it
so
to
say
by
the
poetry
of
it
secondhand
of
course
and
for
me
for
me
think
what
it
means
i
have
so
many
enemies
here
and
more
still
there
theyll
put
it
down
to
the
fathers
influence
good
god
petrusha
a
revolutionist
what
times
we
live
in
very
soon
however
petrusha
sent
his
exact
address
from
switzerland
for
money
to
be
sent
him
as
usual
so
he
could
not
be
exactly
an
exile
and
now
after
four
years
abroad
he
was
suddenly
making
his
appearance
again
in
his
own
country
and
announced
that
he
would
arrive
shortly
so
there
could
be
no
charge
against
him
what
was
more
someone
seemed
to
be
interested
in
him
and
protecting
him
he
wrote
now
from
the
south
of
russia
where
he
was
busily
engaged
in
some
private
but
important
business
all
this
was
capital
but
where
was
his
father
to
get
that
other
seven
or
eight
thousand
to
make
up
a
suitable
price
for
the
estate
and
what
if
there
should
be
an
outcry
and
instead
of
that
imposing
picture
it
should
come
to
a
lawsuit
something
told
stepan
trofimovitch
that
the
sensitive
petrusha
would
not
relinquish
anything
that
was
to
his
interest
why
is
itas
ive
noticed
stepan
trofimovitch
whispered
to
me
once
why
is
it
that
all
these
desperate
socialists
and
communists
are
at
the
same
time
such
incredible
skinflints
so
avaricious
so
keen
over
property
and
in
fact
the
more
socialistic
the
more
extreme
they
are
the
keener
they
are
over
property
why
is
it
can
that
too
come
from
sentimentalism
i
dont
know
whether
there
is
any
truth
in
this
observation
of
stepan
trofimovitchs
i
only
know
that
petrusha
had
somehow
got
wind
of
the
sale
of
the
woods
and
the
rest
of
it
and
that
stepan
trofimovitch
was
aware
of
the
fact
i
happened
too
to
read
some
of
petrushas
letters
to
his
father
he
wrote
extremely
rarely
once
a
year
or
even
less
often
only
recently
to
inform
him
of
his
approaching
visit
he
had
sent
two
letters
one
almost
immediately
after
the
other
all
his
letters
were
short
dry
consisting
only
of
instructions
and
as
the
father
and
son
had
since
their
meeting
in
petersburg
adopted
the
fashionable
thou
and
thee
petrushas
letters
had
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
missives
that
used
to
be
sent
by
landowners
of
the
old
school
from
the
town
to
their
serfs
whom
they
had
left
in
charge
of
their
estates
and
now
suddenly
this
eight
thousand
which
would
solve
the
difficulty
would
be
wafted
to
him
by
varvara
petrovnas
proposition
and
at
the
same
time
she
made
him
distinctly
feel
that
it
never
could
be
wafted
to
him
from
anywhere
else
of
course
stepan
trofimovitch
consented
he
sent
for
me
directly
she
had
gone
and
shut
himself
up
for
the
whole
day
admitting
no
one
else
he
cried
of
course
talked
well
and
talked
a
great
deal
contradicted
himself
continually
made
a
casual
pun
and
was
much
pleased
with
it
then
he
had
a
slight
attack
of
his
summer
choleraeverything
in
fact
followed
the
usual
course
then
he
brought
out
the
portrait
of
his
german
bride
now
twenty
years
deceased
and
began
plaintively
appealing
to
her
will
you
forgive
me
in
fact
he
seemed
somehow
distracted
our
grief
led
us
to
get
a
little
drunk
he
soon
fell
into
a
sweet
sleep
however
next
morning
he
tied
his
cravat
in
masterly
fashion
dressed
with
care
and
went
frequently
to
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
sprinkled
his
handkerchief
with
scent
only
a
slight
dash
of
it
however
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
varvara
petrovna
out
of
the
window
he
hurriedly
took
another
handkerchief
and
hid
the
scented
one
under
the
pillow
excellent
varvara
petrovna
approved
on
receiving
his
consent
in
the
first
place
you
show
a
fine
decision
and
secondly
youve
listened
to
the
voice
of
reason
to
which
you
generally
pay
so
little
heed
in
your
private
affairs
theres
no
need
of
haste
however
she
added
scanning
the
knot
of
his
white
tie
for
the
present
say
nothing
and
i
will
say
nothing
it
will
soon
be
your
birthday
i
will
come
to
see
you
with
her
give
us
tea
in
the
evening
and
please
without
wine
or
other
refreshments
but
ill
arrange
it
all
myself
invite
your
friends
but
well
make
the
list
together
you
can
talk
to
her
the
day
before
if
necessary
and
at
your
party
we
wont
exactly
announce
it
or
make
an
engagement
of
any
sort
but
only
hint
at
it
and
let
people
know
without
any
sort
of
ceremony
and
then
the
wedding
a
fortnight
later
as
far
as
possible
without
any
fuss
you
two
might
even
go
away
for
a
time
after
the
wedding
to
moscow
for
instance
ill
go
with
you
too
perhaps
the
chief
thing
is
keep
quiet
till
then
stepan
trofimovitch
was
surprised
he
tried
to
falter
that
he
could
not
do
like
that
that
he
must
talk
it
over
with
his
bride
but
varvara
petrovna
flew
at
him
in
exasperation
what
for
in
the
first
place
it
may
perhaps
come
to
nothing
come
to
nothing
muttered
the
bridegroom
utterly
dumbfoundered
yes
ill
see
but
everything
shall
be
as
ive
told
you
and
dont
be
uneasy
ill
prepare
her
myself
theres
really
no
need
for
you
everything
necessary
shall
be
said
and
done
and
theres
no
need
for
you
to
meddle
why
should
you
in
what
character
dont
come
and
dont
write
letters
and
not
a
sight
or
sound
of
you
i
beg
i
will
be
silent
too
she
absolutely
refused
to
explain
herself
and
went
away
obviously
upset
stepan
trofimovitchs
excessive
readiness
evidently
impressed
her
alas
he
was
utterly
unable
to
grasp
his
position
and
the
question
had
not
yet
presented
itself
to
him
from
certain
other
points
of
view
on
the
contrary
a
new
note
was
apparent
in
him
a
sort
of
conquering
and
jaunty
air
he
swaggered
i
do
like
that
he
exclaimed
standing
before
me
and
flinging
wide
his
arms
did
you
hear
she
wants
to
drive
me
to
refusing
at
last
why
i
may
lose
patience
too
and
refuse
sit
still
theres
no
need
for
you
to
go
to
her
but
after
all
why
should
i
be
married
simply
because
shes
taken
an
absurd
fancy
into
her
heart
but
im
a
serious
man
and
i
can
refuse
to
submit
to
the
idle
whims
of
a
giddywoman
i
have
duties
to
my
son
andand
to
myself
im
making
a
sacrifice
does
she
realise
that
i
have
agreed
perhaps
because
i
am
weary
of
life
and
nothing
matters
to
me
but
she
may
exasperate
me
and
then
it
will
matter
i
shall
resent
it
and
refuse

time
a
sort
of
capricious
complacency
something
frivolous
and

be

in

chapter
iii
the
sins
of
others
i
about
a
week
had
passed
and
the
position
had
begun
to
grow
more
complicated
i
may
mention
in
passing
that
i
suffered
a
great
deal
during
that
unhappy
week
as
i
scarcely
left
the
side
of
my
affianced
friend
in
the
capacity
of
his
most
intimate
confidant
what
weighed
upon
him
most
was
the
feeling
of
shame
though
we
saw
no
one
all
that
week
and
sat
indoors
alone
but
he
was
even
ashamed
before
me
and
so
much
so
that
the
more
he
confided
to
me
the
more
vexed
he
was
with
me
for
it
he
was
so
morbidly
apprehensive
that
he
expected
that
every
one
knew
about
it
already
the
whole
town
and
was
afraid
to
show
himself
not
only
at
the
club
but
even
in
his
circle
of
friends
he
positively
would
not
go
out
to
take
his
constitutional
till
well
after
dusk
when
it
was
quite
dark
a
week
passed
and
he
still
did
not
know
whether
he
were
betrothed
or
not
and
could
not
find
out
for
a
fact
however
much
he
tried
he
had
not
yet
seen
his
future
bride
and
did
not
know
whether
she
was
to
be
his
bride
or
not
did
not
in
fact
know
whether
there
was
anything
serious
in
it
at
all
varvara
petrovna
for
some
reason
resolutely
refused
to
admit
him
to
her
presence
in
answer
to
one
of
his
first
letters
to
her
and
he
wrote
a
great
number
of
them
she
begged
him
plainly
to
spare
her
all
communications
with
him
for
a
time
because
she
was
very
busy
and
having
a
great
deal
of
the
utmost
importance
to
communicate
to
him
she
was
waiting
for
a
more
free
moment
to
do
so
and
that
she
would
let
him
know
in
time
when
he
could
come
to
see
her
she
declared
she
would
send
back
his
letters
unopened
as
they
were
simple
selfindulgence
i
read
that
letter
myselfhe
showed
it
me
yet
all
this
harshness
and
indefiniteness
were
nothing
compared
with
his
chief
anxiety
that
anxiety
tormented
him
to
the
utmost
and
without
ceasing
he
grew
thin
and
dispirited
through
it
it
was
something
of
which
he
was
more
ashamed
than
of
anything
else
and
of
which
he
would
not
on
any
account
speak
even
to
me
on
the
contrary
he
lied
on
occasion
and
shuffled
before
me
like
a
little
boy
and
at
the
same
time
he
sent
for
me
himself
every
day
could
not
stay
two
hours
without
me
needing
me
as
much
as
air
or
water
such
conduct
rather
wounded
my
vanity
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
had
long
ago
privately
guessed
this
great
secret
of
his
and
saw
through
it
completely
it
was
my
firmest
conviction
at
the
time
that
the
revelation
of
this
secret
this
chief
anxiety
of
stepan
trofimovitchs
would
not
have
redounded
to
his
credit
and
therefore
as
i
was
still
young
i
was
rather
indignant
at
the
coarseness
of
his
feelings
and
the
ugliness
of
some
of
his
suspicions
in
my
warmthand
i
must
confess
in
my
weariness
of
being
his
confidanti
perhaps
blamed
him
too
much
i
was
so
cruel
as
to
try
and
force
him
to
confess
it
all
to
me
himself
though
i
did
recognise
that
it
might
be
difficult
to
confess
some
things
he
too
saw
through
me
that
is
he
clearly
perceived
that
i
saw
through
him
and
that
i
was
angry
with
him
indeed
and
he
was
angry
with
me
too
for
being
angry
with
him
and
seeing
through
him
my
irritation
was
perhaps
petty
and
stupid
but
the
unrelieved
solitude
of
two
friends
together
is
sometimes
extremely
prejudicial
to
true
friendship
from
a
certain
point
of
view
he
had
a
very
true
understanding
of
some
aspects
of
his
position
and
defined
it
indeed
very
subtly
on
those
points
about
which
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
be
secret
oh
how
different
she
was
then
he
would
sometimes
say
to
me
about
varvara
petrovna
how
different
she
was
in
the
old
days
when
we
used
to
talk
together
do
you
know
that
she
could
talk
in
those
days
can
you
believe
that
she
had
ideas
in
those
days
original
ideas
now
everything
has
changed
she
says
all
thats
only
oldfashioned
twaddle
she
despises
the
past
now
shes
like
some
shopman
or
cashier
she
has
grown
hardhearted
and
shes
always
cross
why
is
she
cross
now
if
you
are
carrying
out
her
orders
i
answered
he
looked
at
me
subtly
cher
ami
if
i
had
not
agreed
she
would
have
been
dreadfully
angry
dreadfully
but
yet
less
than
now
that
i
have
consented
he
was
pleased
with
this
saying
of
his
and
we
emptied
a
bottle
between
us
that
evening
but
that
was
only
for
a
moment
next
day
he
was
worse
and
more
illhumoured
than
ever
but
what
i
was
most
vexed
with
him
for
was
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
call
on
the
drozdovs
as
he
should
have
done
on
their
arrival
to
renew
the
acquaintance
of
which
so
we
heard
they
were
themselves
desirous
since
they
kept
asking
about
him
it
was
a
source
of
daily
distress
to
him
he
talked
of
lizaveta
nikolaevna
with
an
ecstasy
which
i
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
no
doubt
he
remembered
in
her
the
child
whom
he
had
once
loved
but
besides
that
he
imagined
for
some
unknown
reason
that
he
would
at
once
find
in
her
company
a
solace
for
his
present
misery
and
even
the
solution
of
his
more
serious
doubts
he
expected
to
meet
in
lizaveta
nikolaevna
an
extraordinary
being
and
yet
he
did
not
go
to
see
her
though
he
meant
to
do
so
every
day
the
worst
of
it
was
that
i
was
desperately
anxious
to
be
presented
to
her
and
to
make
her
acquaintance
and
i
could
look
to
no
one
but
stepan
trofimovitch
to
effect
this
i
was
frequently
meeting
her
in
the
street
of
course
when
she
was
out
riding
wearing
a
ridinghabit
and
mounted
on
a
fine
horse
and
accompanied
by
her
cousin
socalled
a
handsome
officer
the
nephew
of
the
late
general
drozdovand
these
meetings
made
an
extraordinary
impression
on
me
at
the
time
my
infatuation
lasted
only
a
moment
and
i
very
soon
afterwards
recognised
the
impossibility
of
my
dreams
myselfbut
though
it
was
a
fleeting
impression
it
was
a
very
real
one
and
so
it
may
well
be
imagined
how
indignant
i
was
at
the
time
with
my
poor
friend
for
keeping
so
obstinately
secluded
all
the
members
of
our
circle
had
been
officially
informed
from
the
beginning
that
stepan
trofimovitch
would
see
nobody
for
a
time
and
begged
them
to
leave
him
quite
alone
he
insisted
on
sending
round
a
circular
notice
to
this
effect
though
i
tried
to
dissuade
him
i
went
round
to
every
one
at
his
request
and
told
everybody
that
varvara
petrovna
had
given
our
old
man
as
we
all
used
to
call
stepan
trofimovitch
among
ourselves
a
special
job
to
arrange
in
order
some
correspondence
lasting
over
many
years
that
he
had
shut
himself
up
to
do
it
and
i
was
helping
him
liputin
was
the
only
one
i
did
not
have
time
to
visit
and
i
kept
putting
it
offto
tell
the
real
truth
i
was
afraid
to
go
to
him
i
knew
beforehand
that
he
would
not
believe
one
word
of
my
story
that
he
would
certainly
imagine
that
there
was
some
secret
at
the
bottom
of
it
which
they
were
trying
to
hide
from
him
alone
and
as
soon
as
i
left
him
he
would
set
to
work
to
make
inquiries
and
gossip
all
over
the
town
while
i
was
picturing
all
this
to
myself
i
happened
to
run
across
him
in
the
street
it
turned
out
that
he
had
heard
all
about
it
from
our
friends
whom
i
had
only
just
informed
but
strange
to
say
instead
of
being
inquisitive
and
asking
questions
about
stepan
trofimovitch
he
interrupted
me
when
i
began
apologising
for
not
having
come
to
him
before
and
at
once
passed
to
other
subjects
it
is
true
that
he
had
a
great
deal
stored
up
to
tell
me
he
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
and
was
delighted
to
have
got
hold
of
me
for
a
listener
he
began
talking
of
the
news
of
the
town
of
the
arrival
of
the
governors
wife
with
new
topics
of
conversation
of
an
opposition
party
already
formed
in
the
club
of
how
they
were
all
in
a
hubbub
over
the
new
ideas
and
how
charmingly
this
suited
him
and
so
on
he
talked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
so
amusingly
that
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
though
i
could
not
endure
him
yet
i
must
admit
he
had
the
gift
of
making
one
listen
to
him
especially
when
he
was
very
angry
at
something
this
man
was
in
my
opinion
a
regular
spy
from
his
very
nature
at
every
moment
he
knew
the
very
latest
gossip
and
all
the
trifling
incidents
of
our
town
especially
the
unpleasant
ones
and
it
was
surprising
to
me
how
he
took
things
to
heart
that
were
sometimes
absolutely
no
concern
of
his
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
the
leading
feature
of
his
character
was
envy
when
i
told
stepan
trofimovitch
the
same
evening
of
my
meeting
liputin
that
morning
and
our
conversation
the
latter
to
my
amazement
became
greatly
agitated
and
asked
me
the
wild
question
does
liputin
know
or
not
i
began
trying
to
prove
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
his
finding
it
out
so
soon
and
that
there
was
nobody
from
whom
he
could
hear
it
but
stepan
trofimovitch
was
not
to
be
shaken
well
you
may
believe
it
or
not
he
concluded
unexpectedly
at
last
but
im
convinced
that
he
not
only
knows
every
detail
of
our
position
but
that
he
knows
something
else
besides
something
neither
you
nor
i
know
yet
and
perhaps
never
shall
or
shall
only
know
when
its
too
late
when
theres
no
turning
back
i
said
nothing
but
these
words
suggested
a
great
deal
for
five
whole
days
after
that
we
did
not
say
one
word
about
liputin
it
was
clear
to
me
that
stepan
trofimovitch
greatly
regretted
having
let
his
tongue
run
away
with
him
and
having
revealed
such
suspicions
before
me
ii
one
morning
on
the
seventh
or
eighth
day
after
stepan
trofimovitch
had
consented
to
become
engaged
about
eleven
oclock
when
i
was
hurrying
as
usual
to
my
afflicted
friend
i
had
an
adventure
on
the
way
i
met
karmazinov
the
great
writer
as
liputin
called
him
i
had
read
karmazinov
from
a
child
his
novels
and
tales
were
well
known
to
the
past
and
even
to
the
present
generation
i
revelled
in
them
they
were
the
great
enjoyment
of
my
childhood
and
youth
afterwards
i
grew
rather
less
enthusiastic
over
his
work
i
did
not
care
so
much
for
the
novels
with
a
purpose
which
he
had
been
writing
of
late
as
for
his
first
early
works
which
were
so
full
of
spontaneous
poetry
and
his
latest
publications
i
had
not
liked
at
all
speaking
generally
if
i
may
venture
to
express
my
opinion
on
so
delicate
a
subject
all
these
talented
gentlemen
of
the
middling
sort
who
are
sometimes
in
their
lifetime
accepted
almost
as
geniuses
pass
out
of
memory
quite
suddenly
and
without
a
trace
when
they
die
and
whats
more
it
often
happens
that
even
during
their
lifetime
as
soon
as
a
new
generation
grows
up
and
takes
the
place
of
the
one
in
which
they
have
flourished
they
are
forgotten
and
neglected
by
every
one
in
an
incredibly
short
time
this
somehow
happens
among
us
quite
suddenly
like
the
shifting
of
the
scenes
on
the
stage
oh
its
not
at
all
the
same
as
with
pushkin
gogol
molire
voltaire
all
those
great
men
who
really
had
a
new
original
word
to
say
its
true
too
that
these
talented
gentlemen
of
the
middling
sort
in
the
decline
of
their
venerable
years
usually
write
themselves
out
in
the
most
pitiful
way
though
they
dont
observe
the
fact
themselves
it
happens
not
infrequently
that
a
writer
who
has
been
for
a
long
time
credited
with
extraordinary
profundity
and
expected
to
exercise
a
great
and
serious
influence
on
the
progress
of
society
betrays
in
the
end
such
poverty
such
insipidity
in
his
fundamental
ideas
that
no
one
regrets
that
he
succeeded
in
writing
himself
out
so
soon
but
the
old
greybeards
dont
notice
this
and
are
angry
their
vanity
sometimes
especially
towards
the
end
of
their
career
reaches
proportions
that
may
well
provoke
wonder
god
knows
what
they
begin
to
take
themselves
forfor
gods
at
least
people
used
to
say
about
karmazinov
that
his
connections
with
aristocratic
society
and
powerful
personages
were
dearer
to
him
than
his
own
soul
people
used
to
say
that
on
meeting
you
he
would
be
cordial
that
he
would
fascinate
and
enchant
you
with
his
openheartedness
especially
if
you
were
of
use
to
him
in
some
way
and
if
you
came
to
him
with
some
preliminary
recommendation
but
that
before
any
stray
prince
any
stray
countess
anyone
that
he
was
afraid
of
he
would
regard
it
as
his
sacred
duty
to
forget
your
existence
with
the
most
insulting
carelessness
like
a
chip
of
wood
like
a
fly
before
you
had
even
time
to
get
out
of
his
sight
he
seriously
considered
this
the
best
and
most
aristocratic
style
in
spite
of
the
best
of
breeding
and
perfect
knowledge
of
good
manners
he
is
they
say
vain
to
such
an
hysterical
pitch
that
he
cannot
conceal
his
irritability
as
an
author
even
in
those
circles
of
society
where
little
interest
is
taken
in
literature
if
anyone
were
to
surprise
him
by
being
indifferent
he
would
be
morbidly
chagrined
and
try
to
revenge
himself
a
year
before
i
had
read
an
article
of
his
in
a
review
written
with
an
immense
affectation
of
nave
poetry
and
psychology
too
he
described
the
wreck
of
some
steamer
on
the
english
coast
of
which
he
had
been
the
witness
and
how
he
had
seen
the
drowning
people
saved
and
the
dead
bodies
brought
ashore
all
this
rather
long
and
verbose
article
was
written
solely
with
the
object
of
selfdisplay
one
seemed
to
read
between
the
lines
concentrate
yourselves
on
me
behold
what
i
was
like
at
those
moments
what
are
the
sea
the
storm
the
rocks
the
splinters
of
wrecked
ships
to
you
i
have
described
all
that
sufficiently
to
you
with
my
mighty
pen
why
look
at
that
drowned
woman
with
the
dead
child
in
her
dead
arms
look
rather
at
me
see
how
i
was
unable
to
bear
that
sight
and
turned
away
from
it
here
i
stood
with
my
back
to
it
here
i
was
horrified
and
could
not
bring
myself
to
look
i
blinked
my
eyesisnt
that
interesting
when
i
told
stepan
trofimovitch
my
opinion
of
karmazinovs
article
he
quite
agreed
with
me
when
rumours
had
reached
us
of
late
that
karmazinov
was
coming
to
the
neighbourhood
i
was
of
course
very
eager
to
see
him
and
if
possible
to
make
his
acquaintance
i
knew
that
this
might
be
done
through
stepan
trofimovitch
they
had
once
been
friends
and
now
i
suddenly
met
him
at
the
crossroads
i
knew
him
at
once
he
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
two
or
three
days
before
when
he
drove
past
with
the
governors
wife
he
was
a
short
stifflooking
old
man
though
not
over
fiftyfive
with
a
rather
red
little
face
with
thick
grey
locks
of
hair
clustering
under
his
chimneypot
hat
and
curling
round
his
clean
little
pink
ears
his
clean
little
face
was
not
altogether
handsome
with
its
thin
long
craftylooking
lips
with
its
rather
fleshy
nose
and
its
sharp
shrewd
little
eyes
he
was
dressed
somewhat
shabbily
in
a
sort
of
cape
such
as
would
be
worn
in
switzerland
or
north
italy
at
that
time
of
year
but
at
any
rate
all
the
minor
details
of
his
costume
the
little
studs
and
collar
the
buttons
the
tortoiseshell
lorgnette
on
a
narrow
black
ribbon
the
signetring
were
all
such
as
are
worn
by
persons
of
the
most
irreproachable
good
form
i
am
certain
that
in
summer
he
must
have
worn
light
prunella
shoes
with
motherofpearl
buttons
at
the
side
when
we
met
he
was
standing
still
at
the
turning
and
looking
about
him
attentively
noticing
that
i
was
looking
at
him
with
interest
he
asked
me
in
a
sugary
though
rather
shrill
voice
allow
me
to
ask
which
is
my
nearest
way
to
bykovy
street
to
bykovy
street
oh
thats
here
close
by
i
cried
in
great
excitement
straight
on
along
this
street
and
the
second
turning
to
the
left
very
much
obliged
to
you
a
curse
on
that
minute
i
fancy
i
was
shy
and
looked
cringing
he
instantly
noticed
all
that
and
of
course
realised
it
all
at
once
that
is
realised
that
i
knew
who
he
was
that
i
had
read
him
and
revered
him
from
a
child
and
that
i
was
shy
and
looked
at
him
cringingly
he
smiled
nodded
again
and
walked
on
as
i
had
directed
him
i
dont
know
why
i
turned
back
to
follow
him
i
dont
know
why
i
ran
for
ten
paces
beside
him
he
suddenly
stood
still
again
and
could
you
tell
me
where
is
the
nearest
cabstand
he
shouted
out
to
me
again
it
was
a
horrid
shout
a
horrid
voice
a
cabstand
the
nearest
cabstand
is
by
the
cathedral
there
are
always
cabs
standing
there
and
i
almost
turned
to
run
for
a
cab
for
him
i
almost
believe
that
that
was
what
he
expected
me
to
do
of
course
i
checked
myself
at
once
and
stood
still
but
he
had
noticed
my
movement
and
was
still
watching
me
with
the
same
horrid
smile
then
something
happened
which
i
shall
never
forget
he
suddenly
dropped
a
tiny
bag
which
he
was
holding
in
his
left
hand
though
indeed
it
was
not
a
bag
but
rather
a
little
box
or
more
probably
some
part
of
a
pocketbook
or
to
be
more
accurate
a
little
reticule
rather
like
an
oldfashioned
ladys
reticule
though
i
really
dont
know
what
it
was
i
only
know
that
i
flew
to
pick
it
up
i
am
convinced
that
i
did
not
really
pick
it
up
but
my
first
motion
was
unmistakable
i
could
not
conceal
it
and
like
a
fool
i
turned
crimson
the
cunning
fellow
at
once
got
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
the
circumstance
dont
trouble
ill
pick
it
up
he
pronounced
charmingly
that
is
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
i
was
not
going
to
pick
up
the
reticule
he
picked
it
up
as
though
forestalling
me
nodded
once
more
and
went
his
way
leaving
me
to
look
like
a
fool
it
was
as
good
as
though
i
had
picked
it
up
myself
for
five
minutes
i
considered
myself
utterly
disgraced
forever
but
as
i
reached
stepan
trofimovitchs
house
i
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
the
meeting
struck
me
as
so
amusing
that
i
immediately
resolved
to
entertain
stepan
trofimovitch
with
an
account
of
it
and
even
to
act
the
whole
scene
to
him
iii
but
this
time
to
my
surprise
i
found
an
extraordinary
change
in
him
he
pounced
on
me
with
a
sort
of
avidity
it
is
true
as
soon
as
i
went
in
and
began
listening
to
me
but
with
such
a
distracted
air
that
at
first
he
evidently
did
not
take
in
my
words
but
as
soon
as
i
pronounced
the
name
of
karmazinov
he
suddenly
flew
into
a
frenzy
dont
speak
of
him
dont
pronounce
that
name
he
exclaimed
almost
in
a
fury
here
look
read
it
read
it
he
opened
the
drawer
and
threw
on
the
table
three
small
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
a
hurried
pencil
scrawl
all
from
varvara
petrovna
the
first
letter
was
dated
the
day
before
yesterday
the
second
had
come
yesterday
and
the
last
that
day
an
hour
before
their
contents
were
quite
trivial
and
all
referred
to
karmazinov
and
betrayed
the
vain
and
fussy
uneasiness
of
varvara
petrovna
and
her
apprehension
that
karmazinov
might
forget
to
pay
her
a
visit
here
is
the
first
one
dating
from
two
days
before
probably
there
had
been
one
also
three
days
before
and
possibly
another
four
days
before
as
well
if
he
deigns
to
visit
you
today
not
a
word
about
me
i
beg
not
the
faintest
hint
dont
speak
of
me
dont
mention
mev
s
the
letter
of
the
day
before
if
he
decides
to
pay
you
a
visit
this
morning
i
think
the
most
dignified
thing
would
be
not
to
receive
him
thats
what
i
think
about
it
i
dont
know
what
you
thinkv
s
todays
the
last
i
feel
sure
that
youre
in
a
regular
litter
and
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
im
sending
you
marya
and
fomushka
theyll
tidy
you
up
in
half
an
hour

and

in
the
kitchen
while
they
clear
up
im
sending
you
a
bokhara
rug
and
two
china
vases

long
been
meaning
to
make
you
a
present
of
them
and
im
sending
you
my
teniers
too
for
a
time
you
can
put
the
vases
in
the
window
and
hang
the
teniers
on
the
right
under
the
portrait
of
goethe
it
will
be
more
conspicuous
there
and
its
always
light
there
in
the
morning
if
he
does
turn
up
at
last
receive
him
with
the
utmost
courtesy
but
try
and
talk
of
trifling
matters
of
some
intellectual
subject
and
behave
as
though
you
had
seen
each
other
lately
not
a
word
about
me
perhaps
i
may
look
in
on
you
in
the
eveningv
s
psif
he
does
not
come
today
he
wont
come
at
all
i
read
and
was
amazed
that
he
was
in
such
excitement
over
such
trifles
looking
at
him
inquiringly
i
noticed
that
he
had
had
time
while
i
was
reading
to
change
the
everlasting
white
tie
he
always
wore
for
a
red
one
his
hat
and
stick
lay
on
the
table
he
was
pale
and
his
hands
were
positively
trembling
i
dont
care
a
hang
about
her
anxieties
he
cried
frantically
in
response
to
my
inquiring
look
je
men
fiche
she
has
the
face
to
be
excited
about
karmazinov
and
she
does
not
answer
my
letters
here
is
my
unopened
letter
which
she
sent
me
back
yesterday
here
on
the
table
under
the
book
under

ive
hidden
the
vases
in
the
entry
and
the
teniers
in
the
chest
of
drawers
and
i
have
demanded
that
she
is
to
see
me
at
once
do
you
hear
ive
insisted
ive
sent
her
just
such
a
scrap
of
paper
a
pencil
scrawl
unsealed
by
nastasya
and
im
waiting
i
want
darya
pavlovna
to
speak
to
me
with
her
own
lips
before
the
face
of
heaven
or
at
least
before

i
dont
want
to
have
to
blush
to
lie
i
dont
want
secrets
i
wont
have
secrets
in
this
matter
let
them
confess
everything
to
me
openly
frankly
honourably
and
then
then
perhaps
i
may
surprise
the
whole
generation
by
my
magnanimity
am
i
a
scoundrel
or
not
my
dear
sir
he
concluded
suddenly
looking
menacingly
at
me
as
though
id
considered
him
a
scoundrel
i
offered
him
a
sip
of
water
i
had
never
seen
him
like
this
before
all
the
while
he
was
talking
he
kept
running
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
but
he
suddenly
stood
still
before
me
in
an
extraordinary
attitude
can
you
suppose
he
began
again
with
hysterical
haughtiness
looking
me
up
and
down
can
you
imagine
that
i
stepan
verhovensky
cannot
find
in
myself
the
moral
strength
to
take
my
bagmy
beggars
bagand
laying
it
on
my
feeble
shoulders
to
go
out
at
the
gate
and
vanish
forever
when
honour
and
the
great
principle
of
independence
demand
it
its
not
the
first
time
that
stepan
verhovensky
has
had
to
repel
despotism
by
moral
force
even
though
it
be
the
despotism
of
a
crazy
woman
that
is
the
most
cruel
and
insulting
despotism
which
can
exist
on
earth
although
you
have
i
fancy
forgotten
yourself
so
much
as
to
laugh
at
my
phrase
my
dear
sir
oh
you
dont
believe
that
i
can
find
the
moral
strength
in
myself
to
end
my
life
as
a
tutor
in
a
merchants
family
or
to
die
of
hunger
in
a
ditch
answer
me
answer
at
once
do
you
believe
it
or
dont
you
believe
it
but
i
was
purposely
silent
i
even
affected
to
hesitate
to
wound
him
by
answering
in
the
negative
but
to
be
unable
to
answer
affirmatively
in
all
this
nervous
excitement
of
his
there
was
something
which
really
did
offend
me
and
not
personally
oh
no
but
i
will
explain
later
on
he
positively
turned
pale
perhaps
you
are
bored
with
me
gv
this
is
my
surname
and
you
would
like
not
to
come
and
see
me
at
all
he
said
in
that
tone
of
pale
composure
which
usually
precedes
some
extraordinary
outburst
i
jumped
up
in
alarm
at
that
moment
nastasya
came
in
and
without
a
word
handed
stepan
trofimovitch
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
something
was
written
in
pencil
he
glanced
at
it
and
flung
it
to
me
on
the
paper
in
varvara
petrovnas
hand
three
words
were
written
stay
at
home
stepan
trofimovitch
snatched
up
his
hat
and
stick
in
silence
and
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
mechanically
i
followed
him
suddenly
voices
and
sounds
of
rapid
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
he
stood
still
as
though
thunderstruck
its
liputin
i
am
lost
he
whispered
clutching
at
my
arm
at
the
same
instant
liputin
walked
into
the
room
iv
why
he
should
be
lost
owing
to
liputin
i
did
not
know
and
indeed
i
did
not
attach
much
significance
to
the
words
i
put
it
all
down
to
his
nerves
his
terror
however
was
remarkable
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
a
careful
watch
on
him
the
very
appearance
of
liputin
as
he
came
in
assured
us
that
he
had
on
this
occasion
a
special
right
to
come
in
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
he
brought
with
him
an
unknown
gentleman
who
must
have
been
a
new
arrival
in
the
town
in
reply
to
the
senseless
stare
of
my
petrified
friend
he
called
out
immediately
in
a
loud
voice
im
bringing
you
a
visitor
a
special
one
i
make
bold
to
intrude
on
your
solitude
mr
kirillov
a
very
distinguished
civil
engineer
and
whats
more
he
knows
your
son
the
much
esteemed
pyotr
stepanovitch
very
intimately
and
he
has
a
message
from
him
hes
only
just
arrived
the
message
is
your
own
addition
the
visitor
observed
curtly
theres
no
message
at
all
but
i
certainly
do
know
verhovensky
i
left
him
in
the
x
province
ten
days
ahead
of
us
stepan
trofimovitch
mechanically
offered
his
hand
and
motioned
him
to
sit
down
he
looked
at
me
he
looked
at
liputin
and
then
as
though
suddenly
recollecting
himself
sat
down
himself
though
he
still
kept
his
hat
and
stick
in
his
hands
without
being
aware
of
it
bah
but
you
were
going
out
yourself
i
was
told
that
you
were
quite
knocked
up
with
work
yes
im
ill
and
you
see
i
meant
to
go
for
a
walk
i
stepan
trofimovitch
checked
himself
quickly
flung
his
hat
and
stick
on
the
sofa
andturned
crimson
meantime
i
was
hurriedly
examining
the
visitor
he
was
a
young
man
about
twentyseven
decently
dressed
well
made
slender
and
dark
with
a
pale
rather
muddycoloured
face
and
black
lustreless
eyes
he
seemed
rather
thoughtful
and
absentminded
spoke
jerkily
and
ungrammatically
transposing
words
in
rather
a
strange
way
and
getting
muddled
if
he
attempted
a
sentence
of
any
length
liputin
was
perfectly
aware
of
stepan
trofimovitchs
alarm
and
was
obviously
pleased
at
it
he
sat
down
in
a
wicker
chair
which
he
dragged
almost
into
the
middle
of
the
room
so
as
to
be
at
an
equal
distance
between
his
host
and
the
visitor
who
had
installed
themselves
on
sofas
on
opposite
sides
of
the
room
his
sharp
eyes
darted
inquisitively
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
another
its
a
long
while
since
ive
seen
petrusha
you
met
abroad
stepan
trofimovitch
managed
to
mutter
to
the
visitor
both
here
and
abroad
alexey
nilitch
has
only
just
returned
himself
after
living
four
years
abroad
put
in
liputin
he
has
been
travelling
to
perfect
himself
in
his
speciality
and
has
come
to
us
because
he
has
good
reasons
to
expect
a
job
on
the
building
of
our
railway
bridge
and
hes
now
waiting
for
an
answer
about
it
he
knows
the
drozdovs
and
lizaveta
nikolaevna
through
pyotr
stepanovitch
the
engineer
sat
as
it
were
with
a
ruffled
air
and
listened
with
awkward
impatience
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
angry
about
something
he
knows
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
too
do
you
know
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
inquired
stepan
trofimovitch
i
know
him
too
its
its
a
very
long
time
since
ive
seen
petrusha
and
i
feel
i
have
so
little
right
to
call
myself
a
father
cest
le
mot
i
how
did
you
leave
him
oh
yes
i
left
him
he
comes
himself
replied
mr
kirillov
in
haste
to
be
rid
of
the
question
again
he
certainly
was
angry
hes
coming
at
last
i
you
see
its
very
long
since
ive
seen
petrusha
stepan
trofimovitch
could
not
get
away
from
this
phrase
now
i
expect
my
poor
boy
to
whom
to
whom
i
have
been
so
much
to
blame
that
is
i
mean
to
say
when
i
left
him
in
petersburg
i
in
short
i
looked
on
him
as
a
nonentity
quelque
chose
dans
ce
genre
he
was
a
very
nervous
boy
you
know
emotional
and
very
timid
when
he
said
his
prayers
going
to
bed
he
used
to
bow
down
to
the
ground
and
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
pillow
that
he
might
not
die
in
the
night
je
men
souviens
enfin
no
artistic
feeling
whatever
not
a
sign
of
anything
higher
of
anything
fundamental
no
embryo
of
a
future
idealctait
comme
un
petit
idiot
but
im
afraid
i
am
incoherent
excuse
me
you
came
upon
me
you
say
seriously
that
he
crossed
his
pillow
the
engineer
asked
suddenly
with
marked
curiosity
yes
he
used
to
all
right
i
just
asked
go
on
stepan
trofimovitch
looked
interrogatively
at
liputin
im
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
visit
but
i
must
confess
im
not
in
a
condition
just
now
but
allow
me
to
ask
where
you
are
lodging
at
filipovs
in
bogoyavlensky
street
ach
thats
where
shatov
lives
i
observed
involuntarily
just
so
in
the
very
same
house
cried
liputin
only
shatov
lodges
above
in
the
attic
while
hes
down
below
at
captain
lebyadkins
he
knows
shatov
too
and
he
knows
shatovs
wife
he
was
very
intimate
with
her
abroad
comment
do
you
really
know
anything
about
that
unhappy
marriage
de
ce
pauvre
ami
and
that
woman
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
carried
away
by
sudden
feeling
you
are
the
first
man
ive
met
who
has
known
her
personally
and
if
only
what
nonsense
the
engineer
snapped
out
flushing
all
over
how
you
add
to
things
liputin
ive
not
seen
shatovs
wife
ive
only
once
seen
her
in
the
distance
and
not
at
all
close
i
know
shatov
why
do
you
add
things
of
all
sorts
he
turned
round
sharply
on
the
sofa
clutched
his
hat
then
laid
it
down
again
and
settling
himself
down
once
more
as
before
fixed
his
angry
black
eyes
on
stepan
trofimovitch
with
a
sort
of
defiance
i
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
such
strange
irritability
excuse
me
stepan
trofimovitch
observed
impressively
i
understand
that
it
may
be
a
very
delicate
subject
no
sort
of
delicate
subject
in
it
and
indeed
its
shameful
and
i
didnt
shout
at
you
that
its
nonsense
but
at
liputin
because
he
adds
things
excuse
me
if
you
took
it
to
yourself
i
know
shatov
but
i
dont
know
his
wife
at
all
i
dont
know
her
at
all
i
understand
i
understand
and
if
i
insisted
its
only
because
im
very
fond
of
our
poor
friend
notre
irascible
ami
and
have
always
taken
an
interest
in
him
in
my
opinion
that
man
changed
his
former
possibly
overyouthful
but
yet
sound
ideas
too
abruptly
and
now
he
says
all
sorts
of
things
about
notre
sainte
russie
to
such
a
degree
that
ive
long
explained
this
upheaval
in
his
whole
constitution
i
can
only
call
it
that
to
some
violent
shock
in
his
family
life
and
in
fact
to
his
unsuccessful
marriage
i
who
know
my
poor
russia
like
the
fingers
on
my
hand
and
have
devoted
my
whole
life
to
the
russian
people
i
can
assure
you
that
he
does
not
know
the
russian
people
and
whats
more
i
dont
know
the
russian
people
at
all
either
and
i
havent
time
to
study
them
the
engineer
snapped
out
again
and
again
he
turned
sharply
on
the
sofa
stepan
trofimovitch
was
pulled
up
in
the
middle
of
his
speech
he
is
studying
them
he
is
studying
them
interposed
liputin
he
has
already
begun
the
study
of
them
and
is
writing
a
very
interesting
article
dealing
with
the
causes
of
the
increase
of
suicide
in
russia
and
generally
speaking
the
causes
that
lead
to
the
increase
or
decrease
of
suicide
in
society
he
has
reached
amazing
results
the
engineer
became
dreadfully
excited
you
have
no
right
at
all
he
muttered
wrathfully
im
not
writing
an
article
im
not
going
to
do
silly
things
i
asked
you
confidentially
quite
by
chance
theres
no
article
at
all
im
not
publishing
and
you
havent
the
right
liputin
was
obviously
enjoying
himself
i
beg
your
pardon
perhaps
i
made
a
mistake
in
calling
your
literary
work
an
article
he
is
only
collecting
observations
and
the
essence
of
the
question
or
so
to
say
its
moral
aspect
he
is
not
touching
at
all
and
indeed
he
rejects
morality
itself
altogether
and
holds
with
the
last
new
principle
of
general
destruction
for
the
sake
of
ultimate
good
he
demands
already
more
than
a
hundred
million
heads
for
the
establishment
of
common
sense
in
europe
many
more
than
they
demanded
at
the
last
peace
congress
alexey
nilitch
goes
further
than
anyone
in
that
sense
the
engineer
listened
with
a
pale
and
contemptuous
smile
for
half
a
minute
every
one
was
silent
all
this
is
stupid
liputin
mr
kirillov
observed
at
last
with
a
certain
dignity
if
i
by
chance
had
said
some
things
to
you
and
you
caught
them
up
again
as
you
like
but
you
have
no
right
for
i
never
speak
to
anyone
i
scorn
to
talk
if
one
has
a
conviction
then
its
clear
to
me
but
youre
doing
foolishly
i
dont
argue
about
things
when
everythings
settled
i
cant
bear
arguing
i
never
want
to
argue
and
perhaps
you
are
very
wise
stepan
trofimovitch
could
not
resist
saying
i
apologise
to
you
but
i
am
not
angry
with
anyone
here
the
visitor
went
on
speaking
hotly
and
rapidly
i
have
seen
few
people
for
four
years
for
four
years
i
have
talked
little
and
have
tried
to
see
no
one
for
my
own
objects
which
do
not
concern
anyone
else
for
four
years
liputin
found
this
out
and
is
laughing
i
understand
and
dont
mind
im
not
ready
to
take
offence
only
annoyed
at
his
liberty
and
if
i
dont
explain
my
ideas
to
you
he
concluded
unexpectedly
scanning
us
all
with
resolute
eyes
its
not
at
all
that
im
afraid
of
your
giving
information
to
the
government
thats
not
so
please
do
not
imagine
nonsense
of
that
sort
no
one
made
any
reply
to
these
words
we
only
looked
at
each
other
even
liputin
forgot
to
snigger
gentlemen
im
very
sorrystepan
trofimovitch
got
up
resolutely
from
the
sofabut
i
feel
ill
and
upset
excuse
me
ach
thats
for
us
to
go
mr
kirillov
started
snatching
up
his
cap
its
a
good
thing
you
told
us
im
so
forgetful
he
rose
and
with
a
goodnatured
air
went
up
to
stepan
trofimovitch
holding
out
his
hand
im
sorry
youre
not
well
and
i
came
i
wish
you
every
success
among
us
answered
stepan
trofimovitch
shaking
hands
with
him
heartily
and
without
haste
i
understand
that
if
as
you
say
you
have
lived
so
long
abroad
cutting
yourself
off
from
people
for
objects
of
your
own
and
forgetting
russia
you
must
inevitably
look
with
wonder
on
us
who
are
russians
to
the
backbone
and
we
must
feel
the
same
about
you
mais
cela
passera
im
only
puzzled
at
one
thing
you
want
to
build
our
bridge
and
at
the
same
time
you
declare
that
you
hold
with
the
principle
of
universal
destruction
they
wont
let
you
build
our
bridge
what
whats
that
you
said
ach
i
say
kirillov
cried
much
struck
and
he
suddenly
broke
into
the
most
frank
and
goodhumoured
laughter
for
a
moment
his
face
took
a
quite
childlike
expression
which
i
thought
suited
him
particularly
liputin
rubbed
his
hand
with
delight
at
stepan
trofimovitchs
witty
remark
i
kept
wondering
to
myself
why
stepan
trofimovitch
was
so
frightened
of
liputin
and
why
he
had
cried
out
i
am
lost
when
he
heard
him
coming
v
we
were
all
standing
in
the
doorway
it
was
the
moment
when
hosts
and
guests
hurriedly
exchange
the
last
and
most
cordial
words
and
then
part
to
their
mutual
gratification
the
reason
hes
so
cross
today
liputin
dropped
all
at
once
as
it
were
casually
when
he
was
just
going
out
of
the
room
is
because
he
had
a
disturbance
today
with
captain
lebyadkin
over
his
sister
captain
lebyadkin
thrashes
that
precious
sister
of
his
the
mad
girl
every
day
with
a
whip
a
real
cossack
whip
every
morning
and
evening
so
alexey
nilitch
has
positively
taken
the
lodge
so
as
not
to
be
present
well
goodbye
a
sister
an
invalid
with
a
whip
stepan
trofimovitch
cried
out
as
though
he
had
suddenly
been
lashed
with
a
whip
himself
what
sister
what
lebyadkin
all
his
former
terror
came
back
in
an
instant
lebyadkin
oh
thats
the
retired
captain
he
used
only
to
call
himself
a
lieutenant
before
oh
what
is
his
rank
to
me
what
sister
good
heavens
you
say
lebyadkin
but
there
used
to
be
a
lebyadkin
here
thats
the
very
man
our
lebyadkin
at
virginskys
you
remember
but
he
was
caught
with
forged
papers
well
now
hes
come
back
hes
been
here
almost
three
weeks
and
under
the
most
peculiar
circumstances
why
but
hes
a
scoundrel
as
though
no
one
could
be
a
scoundrel
among
us
liputin
grinned
suddenly
his
knavish
little
eyes
seeming
to
peer
into
stepan
trofimovitchs
soul
good
heavens
i
didnt
mean
that
at
all
though
i
quite
agree
with
you
about
that
with
you
particularly
but
what
then
what
then
what
did
you
mean
by
that
you
certainly
meant
something
by
that
why
its
all
so
trivial
this
captain
to
all
appearances
went
away
from
us
at
that
time
not
because
of
the
forged
papers
but
simply
to
look
for
his
sister
who
was
in
hiding
from
him
somewhere
it
seems
well
and
now
hes
brought
her
and
thats
the
whole
story
why
do
you
seem
frightened
stepan
trofimovitch
i
only
tell
this
from
his
drunken
chatter
though
he
doesnt
speak
of
it
himself
when
hes
sober
hes
an
irritable
man
and
so
to
speak
sthetic
in
a
military
style
only
he
has
bad
taste
and
this
sister
is
lame
as
well
as
mad
she
seems
to
have
been
seduced
by
someone
and
mr
lebyadkin
has
it
seems
for
many
years
received
a
yearly
grant
from
the
seducer
by
way
of
compensation
for
the
wound
to
his
honour
so
it
would
seem
at
least
from
his
chatter
though
i
believe
its
only
drunken
talk
its
simply
his
brag
besides
that
sort
of
thing
is
done
much
cheaper
but
that
he
has
a
sum
of
money
is
perfectly
certain
ten
days
ago
he
was
walking
barefoot
and
now
ive
seen
hundreds
in
his
hands
his
sister
has
fits
of
some
sort
every
day
she
shrieks
and
he
keeps
her
in
order
with
the
whip
you
must
inspire
a
woman
with
respect
he
says
what
i
cant
understand
is
how
shatov
goes
on
living
above
him
alexey
nilitch
has
only
been
three
days
with
them
they
were
acquainted
in
petersburg
and
now
hes
taken
the
lodge
to
get
away
from
the
disturbance
is
this
all
true
said
stepan
trofimovitch
addressing
the
engineer
you
do
gossip
a
lot
liputin
the
latter
muttered
wrathfully
mysteries
secrets
where
have
all
these
mysteries
and
secrets
among
us
sprung
from
stepan
trofimovitch
could
not
refrain
from
exclaiming
the
engineer
frowned
flushed
red
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
out
of
the
room
alexey
nilitch
positively
snatched
the
whip
out
of
his
hand
broke
it
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
and
they
had
a
violent
quarrel
added
liputin
why
are
you
chattering
liputin
its
stupid
what
for
alexey
nilitch
turned
again
instantly
why
be
so
modest
and
conceal
the
generous
impulses
of
ones
soul
that
is
of
your
soul
im
not
speaking
of
my
own
how
stupid
it
is
and
quite
unnecessary
lebyadkins
stupid
and
quite
worthlessand
no
use
to
the
cause
and
utterly
mischievous
why
do
you
keep
babbling
all
sorts
of
things
im
going
oh
what
a
pity
cried
liputin
with
a
candid
smile
or
id
have
amused
you
with
another
little
story
stepan
trofimovitch
i
came
indeed
on
purpose
to
tell
you
though
i
dare
say
youve
heard
it
already
well
till
another
time
alexey
nilitch
is
in
such
a
hurry
goodbye
for
the
present
the
story
concerns
varvara
petrovna
she
amused
me
the
day
before
yesterday
she
sent
for
me
on
purpose
its
simply
killing
goodbye
but
at
this
stepan
trofimovitch
absolutely
would
not
let
him
go
he
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
turned
him
sharply
back
into
the
room
and
sat
him
down
in
a
chair
liputin
was
positively
scared
why
to
be
sure
he
began
looking
warily
at
stepan
trofimovitch
from
his
chair
she
suddenly
sent
for
me
and
asked
me
confidentially
my
private
opinion
whether
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
is
mad
or
in
his
right
mind
isnt
that
astonishing
youre
out
of
your
mind
muttered
stepan
trofimovitch
and
suddenly
as
though
he
were
beside
himself
liputin
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
only
came
here
to
tell
me
something
insulting
of
that
sort
and
something
worse
in
a
flash
i
recalled
his
conjecture
that
liputin
knew
not
only
more
than
we
did
about
our
affair
but
something
else
which
we
should
never
know
upon
my
word
stepan
trofimovitch
muttered
liputin
seeming
greatly
alarmed
upon
my
word
hold
your
tongue
and
begin
i
beg
you
mr
kirillov
to
come
back
too
and
be
present
i
earnestly
beg
you
sit
down
and
you
liputin
begin
directly
simply
and
without
any
excuses
if
i
had
only
known
it
would
upset
you
so
much
i
wouldnt
have
begun
at
all
and
of
course
i
thought
you
knew
all
about
it
from
varvara
petrovna
herself
you
didnt
think
that
at
all
begin
begin
i
tell
you
only
do
me
the
favour
to
sit
down
yourself
or
how
can
i
sit
here
when
you
are
running
about
before
me
in
such
excitement
i
cant
speak
coherently
stepan
trofimovitch
restrained
himself
and
sank
impressively
into
an
easy
chair
the
engineer
stared
gloomily
at
the
floor
liputin
looked
at
them
with
intense
enjoyment
how
am
i
to
begin
im
too
overwhelmed
vi
the
day
before
yesterday
a
servant
was
suddenly
sent
to
me
you
are
asked
to
call
at
twelve
oclock
said
he
can
you
fancy
such
a
thing
i
threw
aside
my
work
and
precisely
at
midday
yesterday
i
was
ringing
at
the
bell
i
was
let
into
the
drawing
room
i
waited
a
minuteshe
came
in
she
made
me
sit
down
and
sat
down
herself
opposite
i
sat
down
and
i
couldnt
believe
it
you
know
how
she
has
always
treated
me
she
began
at
once
without
beating
about
the
bush
you
know
her
way
you
remember
she
said
that
four
years
ago
when
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
ill
he
did
some
strange
things
which
made
all
the
town
wonder
till
the
position
was
explained
one
of
those
actions
concerned
you
personally
when
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
recovered
he
went
at
my
request
to
call
on
you
i
know
that
he
talked
to
you
several
times
before
too
tell
me
openly
and
candidly
what
you
she
faltered
a
little
at
this
point
what
you
thought
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
then
what
was
your
view
of
him
altogether
what
idea
you
were
able
to
form
of
him
at
that
time
and
still
have
here
she
was
completely
confused
so
that
she
paused
for
a
whole
minute
and
suddenly
flushed
i
was
alarmed
she
began
againtouchingly
is
not
quite
the
word
its
not
applicable
to
herbut
in
a
very
impressive
tone
i
want
you
she
said
to
understand
me
clearly
and
without
mistake
ive
sent
for
you
now
because
i
look
upon
you
as
a
keensighted
and
quickwitted
man
qualified
to
make
accurate
observations
what
compliments
youll
understand
too
she
said
that
i
am
a
mother
appealing
to
you
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
has
suffered
some
calamities
and
has
passed
through
many
changes
of
fortune
in
his
life
all
that
she
said
might
well
have
affected
the
state
of
his
mind
im
not
speaking
of
madness
of
course
she
said
thats
quite
out
of
the
question
this
was
uttered
proudly
and
resolutely
but
there
might
be
something
strange
something
peculiar
some
turn
of
thought
a
tendency
to
some
particular
way
of
looking
at
things
those
were
her
exact
words
and
i
admired
stepan
trofimovitch
the
exactness
with
which
varvara
petrovna
can
put
things
shes
a
lady
of
superior
intellect
i
have
noticed
in
him
anyway
she
said
a
perpetual
restlessness
and
a
tendency
to
peculiar
impulses
but
i
am
a
mother
and
you
are
an
impartial
spectator
and
therefore
qualified
with
your
intelligence
to
form
a
more
impartial
opinion
i
implore
you
in
fact
yes
that
word
implore
was
uttered
to
tell
me
the
whole
truth
without
mincing
matters
and
if
you
will
give
me
your
word
never
to
forget
that
i
have
spoken
to
you
in
confidence
you
may
reckon
upon
my
always
being
ready
to
seize
every
opportunity
in
the
future
to
show
my
gratitude
well
what
do
you
say
to
that
you
have
so
amazed
me
faltered
stepan
trofimovitch
that
i
dont
believe
you
yes
observe
observe
cried
liputin
as
though
he
had
not
heard
stepan
trofimovitch
observe
what
must
be
her
agitation
and
uneasiness
if
she
stoops
from
her
grandeur
to
appeal
to
a
man
like
me
and
even
condescends
to
beg
me
to
keep
it
secret
what
do
you
call
that
hasnt
she
received
some
news
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
something
unexpected
i
dont
know
of
news
of
any
sort
i
havent
seen
her
for
some
days
but
but
i
must
say
lisped
stepan
trofimovitch
evidently
hardly
able
to
think
clearly
but
i
must
say
liputin
that
if
it
was
said
to
you
in
confidence
and
here
youre
telling
it
before
every
one
absolutely
in
confidence
but
god
strike
me
dead
if
i
but
as
for
telling
it
here
what
does
it
matter
are
we
strangers
even
alexey
nilitch
i
dont
share
that
attitude
no
doubt
we
three
here
will
keep
the
secret
but
im
afraid
of
the
fourth
you
and
wouldnt
trust
you
in
anything
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
its
more
to
my
interest
than
anyones
seeing
i
was
promised
eternal
gratitude
what
i
wanted
was
to
point
out
in
this
connection
one
extremely
strange
incident
rather
to
say
psychological
than
simply
strange
yesterday
evening
under
the
influence
of
my
conversation
with
varvara
petrovnayou
can
fancy
yourself
what
an
impression
it
made
on
mei
approached
alexey
nilitch
with
a
discreet
question
you
knew
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
abroad
said
i
and
used
to
know
him
before
in
petersburg
too
what
do
you
think
of
his
mind
and
his
abilities
said
i
he
answered
laconically
as
his
way
is
that
he
was
a
man
of
subtle
intellect
and
sound
judgment
and
have
you
never
noticed
in
the
course
of
years
said
i
any
turn
of
ideas
or
peculiar
way
of
looking
at
things
or
any
so
to
say
insanity
in
fact
i
repeated
varvara
petrovnas
own
question
and
would
you
believe
it
alexey
nilitch
suddenly
grew
thoughtful
and
scowled
just
as
hes
doing
now
yes
said
he
i
have
sometimes
thought
there
was
something
strange
take
note
too
that
if
anything
could
have
seemed
strange
even
to
alexey
nilitch
it
must
really
have
been
something
mustnt
it
is
that
true
said
stepan
trofimovitch
turning
to
alexey
nilitch
i
should
prefer
not
to
speak
of
it
answered
alexey
nilitch
suddenly
raising
his
head
and
looking
at
him
with
flashing
eyes
i
wish
to
contest
your
right
to
do
this
liputin
youve
no
right
to
drag
me
into
this
i
did
not
give
my
whole
opinion
at
all
though
i
knew
nikolay
stavrogin
in
petersburg
that
was
long
ago
and
though
ive
met
him
since
i
know
him
very
little
i
beg
you
to
leave
me
out
and
all
this
is
something
like
scandal
liputin
threw
up
his
hands
with
an
air
of
oppressed
innocence
a
scandalmonger
why
not
say
a
spy
while
youre
about
it
its
all
very
well
for
you
alexey
nilitch
to
criticise
when
you
stand
aloof
from
everything
but
you
wouldnt
believe
it
stepan
trofimovitchtake
captain
lebyadkin
he
is
stupid
enough
one
may
say
in
fact
ones
ashamed
to
say
how
stupid
he
is
there
is
a
russian
comparison
to
signify
the
degree
of
it
and
do
you
know
he
considers
himself
injured
by
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
though
he
is
full
of
admiration
for
his
wit
im
amazed
said
he
at
that
man
hes
a
subtle
serpent
his
own
words
and
i
said
to
him
still
under
the
influence
of
my
conversation
and
after
i
had
spoken
to
alexey
nilitch
what
do
you
think
captain
is
your
subtle
serpent
mad
or
not
would
you
believe
it
it
was
just
as
if
id
given
him
a
sudden
lash
from
behind
he
simply
leapt
up
from
his
seat
yes
said
he

yes
only
that
he
said
cannot
affect
affect
what
he
didnt
finish
yes
and
then
he
fell
to
thinking
so
bitterly
thinking
so
much
that
his
drunkenness
dropped
off
him
we
were
sitting
in
filipovs
restaurant
and
it
wasnt
till
half
an
hour
later
that
he
suddenly
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
yes
said
he
maybe
hes
mad
but
that
cant
affect
it
again
he
didnt
say
what
it
couldnt
affect
of
course
im
only
giving
you
an
extract
of
the
conversation
but
one
can
understand
the
sense
of
it
you
may
ask
whom
you
like
they
all
have
the
same
idea
in
their
heads
though
it
never
entered
anyones
head
before
yes
they
say
hes
mad
hes
very
clever
but
perhaps
hes
mad
too
stepan
trofimovitch
sat
pondering
and
thought
intently
and
how
does
lebyadkin
know
do
you
mind
inquiring
about
that
of
alexey
nilitch
who
has
just
called
me
a
spy
im
a
spy
yet
i
dont
know
but
alexey
nilitch
knows
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
and
holds
his
tongue
i
know
nothing
about
it
or
hardly
anything
answered
the
engineer
with
the
same
irritation
you
make
lebyadkin
drunk
to
find
out
you
brought
me
here
to
find
out
and
to
make
me
say
and
so
you
must
be
a
spy
i
havent
made
him
drunk
yet
and
hes
not
worth
the
money
either
with
all
his
secrets
they
are
not
worth
that
to
me
i
dont
know
what
they
are
to
you
on
the
contrary
he
is
scattering
the
money
though
twelve
days
ago
he
begged
fifteen
kopecks
of
me
and
its
he
treats
me
to
champagne
not
i
him
but
youve
given
me
an
idea
and
if
there
should
be
occasion
i
will
make
him
drunk
just
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
and
maybe
i
shall
find
out
all
your
little
secrets
liputin
snapped
back
spitefully
stepan
trofimovitch
looked
in
bewilderment
at
the
two
disputants
both
were
giving
themselves
away
and
whats
more
were
not
standing
on
ceremony
the
thought
crossed
my
mind
that
liputin
had
brought
this
alexey
nilitch
to
us
with
the
simple
object
of
drawing
him
into
a
conversation
through
a
third
person
for
purposes
of
his
ownhis
favourite
manoeuvre
alexey
nilitch
knows
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
quite
well
he
went
on
irritably
only
he
conceals
it
and
as
to
your
question
about
captain
lebyadkin
he
made
his
acquaintance
before
any
of
us
did
six
years
ago
in
petersburg
in
that
obscure
if
one
may
so
express
it
epoch
in
the
life
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
before
he
had
dreamed
of
rejoicing
our
hearts
by
coming
here
our
prince
one
must
conclude
surrounded
himself
with
rather
a
queer
selection
of
acquaintances
it
was
at
that
time
it
seems
that
he
made
acquaintance
with
this
gentleman
here
take
care
liputin
i
warn
you
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
meant
to
be
here
soon
himself
and
he
knows
how
to
defend
himself
why
warn
me
i
am
the
first
to
cry
out
that
he
is
a
man
of
the
most
subtle
and
refined
intelligence
and
i
quite
reassured
varvara
petrovna
yesterday
on
that
score
its
his
character
i
said
to
her
that
i
cant
answer
for
lebyadkin
said
the
same
thing
yesterday
a
lot
of
harm
has
come
to
me
from
his
character
he
said
stepan
trofimovitch
its
all
very
well
for
you
to
cry
out
about
slander
and
spying
and
at
the
very
time
observe
that
you
wring
it
all
out
of
me
and
with
such
immense
curiosity
too
now
varvara
petrovna
went
straight
to
the
point
yesterday
you
have
had
a
personal
interest
in
the
business
she
said
thats
why
i
appeal
to
you
i
should
say
so
what
need
to
look
for
motives
when
ive
swallowed
a
personal
insult
from
his
excellency
before
the
whole
society
of
the
place
i
should
think
i
have
grounds
to
be
interested
not
merely
for
the
sake
of
gossip
he
shakes
hands
with
you
one
day
and
next
day
for
no
earthly
reason
he
returns
your
hospitality
by
slapping
you
on
the
cheeks
in
the
face
of
all
decent
society
if
the
fancy
takes
him
out
of
sheer
wantonness
and
whats
more
the
fair
sex
is
everything
for
them
these
butterflies
and
mettlesome
cocks
grand
gentlemen
with
little
wings
like
the
ancient
cupids
ladykilling
petchorins
its
all
very
well
for
you
stepan
trofimovitch
a
confirmed
bachelor
to
talk
like
that
stick
up
for
his
excellency
and
call
me
a
slanderer
but
if
you
married
a
pretty
young
wifeas
youre
still
such
a
fine
fellowthen
i
dare
say
youd
bolt
your
door
against
our
prince
and
throw
up
barricades
in
your
house
why
if
only
that
mademoiselle
lebyadkin
who
is
thrashed
with
a
whip
were
not
mad
and
bandylegged
by
jove
i
should
fancy
she
was
the
victim
of
the
passions
of
our
general
and
that
it
was
from
him
that
captain
lebyadkin
had
suffered
in
his
family
dignity
as
he
expresses
it
himself
only
perhaps
that
is
inconsistent
with
his
refined
taste
though
indeed
even
thats
no
hindrance
to
him
every
berry
is
worth
picking
if
only
hes
in
the
mood
for
it
you
talk
of
slander
but
im
not
crying
this
aloud
though
the
whole
town
is
ringing
with
it
i
only
listen
and
assent
thats
not
prohibited
the
towns
ringing
with
it
whats
the
town
ringing
with
that
is
captain
lebyadkin
is
shouting
for
all
the
town
to
hear
and
isnt
that
just
the
same
as
the
marketplace
ringing
with
it
how
am
i
to
blame
i
interest
myself
in
it
only
among
friends
for
after
all
i
consider
myself
among
friends
here
he
looked
at
us
with
an
innocent
air
somethings
happened
only
consider
they
say
his
excellency
has
sent
three
hundred
roubles
from
switzerland
by
a
most
honourable
young
lady
and
so
to
say
modest
orphan
whom
i
have
the
honour
of
knowing
to
be
handed
over
to
captain
lebyadkin
and
lebyadkin
a
little
later
was
told
as
an
absolute
fact
also
by
a
very
honourable
and
therefore
trustworthy
person
i
wont
say
whom
that
not
three
hundred
but
a
thousand
roubles
had
been
sent
and
so
lebyadkin
keeps
crying
out
the
young
lady
has
grabbed
seven
hundred
roubles
belonging
to
me
and
hes
almost
ready
to
call
in
the
police
he
threatens
to
anyway
and
hes
making
an
uproar
all
over
the
town
this
is
vile
vile
of
you
cried
the
engineer
leaping
up
suddenly
from
his
chair
but
i
say
you
are
yourself
the
honourable
person
who
brought
word
to
lebyadkin
from
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
that
a
thousand
roubles
were
sent
not
three
hundred
why
the
captain
told
me
so
himself
when
he
was
drunk
its
its
an
unhappy
misunderstanding
some
ones
made
a
mistake
and
its
led
to
its
nonsense
and
its
base
of
you
but
im
ready
to
believe
that
its
nonsense
and
im
distressed
at
the
story
for
take
it
as
you
will
a
girl
of
an
honourable
reputation
is
implicated
first
over
the
seven
hundred
roubles
and
secondly
in
unmistakable
intimacy
with
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
for
how
much
does
it
mean
to
his
excellency
to
disgrace
a
girl
of
good
character
or
put
to
shame
another
mans
wife
like
that
incident
with
me
if
he
comes
across
a
generoushearted
man
hell
force
him
to
cover
the
sins
of
others
under
the
shelter
of
his
honourable
name
thats
just
what
i
had
to
put
up
with
im
speaking
of
myself
be
careful
liputin
stepan
trofimovitch
got
up
from
his
easy
chair
and
turned
pale
dont
believe
it
dont
believe
it
somebody
has
made
a
mistake
and
lebyadkins
drunk
exclaimed
the
engineer
in
indescribable
excitement
it
will
all
be
explained
but
i
cant
and
i
think
its
low
and
thats
enough
enough
he
ran
out
of
the
room
what
are
you
about
why
im
going
with
you
cried
liputin
startled
he
jumped
up
and
ran
after
alexey
nilitch
vii
stepan
trofimovitch
stood
a
moment
reflecting
looked
at
me
as
though
he
did
not
see
me
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
walked
quietly
out
of
the
room
i
followed
him
again
as
before
as
we
went
out
of
the
gate
noticing
that
i
was
accompanying
him
he
said
oh
yes
you
may
serve
as
a
witnessde
laccident
vous
maccompagnerez
nestce
pas
stepan
trofimovitch
surely
youre
not
going
there
again
think
what
may
come
of
it
with
a
pitiful
and
distracted
smile
a
smile
of
shame
and
utter
despair
and
at
the
same
time
of
a
sort
of
strange
ecstasy
he
whispered
to
me
standing
still
for
an
instant
i
cant
marry
to
cover
another
mans
sins
these
words
were
just
what
i
was
expecting
at
last
that
fatal
sentence
that
he
had
kept
hidden
from
me
was
uttered
aloud
after
a
whole
week
of
shuffling
and
pretence
i
was
positively
enraged
and
you
stepan
verhovensky
with
your
luminous
mind
your
kind
heart
can
harbour
such
a
dirty
such
a
low
idea
and
could
before
liputin
came
he
looked
at
me
made
no
answer
and
walked
on
in
the
same
direction
i
did
not
want
to
be
left
behind
i
wanted
to
give
varvara
petrovna
my
version
i
could
have
forgiven
him
if
he
had
simply
with
his
womanish
faintheartedness
believed
liputin
but
now
it
was
clear
that
he
had
thought
of
it
all
himself
long
before
and
that
liputin
had
only
confirmed
his
suspicions
and
poured
oil
on
the
flames
he
had
not
hesitated
to
suspect
the
girl
from
the
very
first
day
before
he
had
any
kind
of
grounds
even
liputins
words
to
go
upon
varvara
petrovnas
despotic
behaviour
he
had
explained
to
himself
as
due
to
her
haste
to
cover
up
the
aristocratic
misdoings
of
her
precious
nicolas
by
marrying
the
girl
to
an
honourable
man
i
longed
for
him
to
be
punished
for
it
oh
dieu
qui
est
si
grand
et
si
bon
oh
who
will
comfort
me
he
exclaimed
halting
suddenly
again
after
walking
a
hundred
paces
come
straight
home
and
ill
make
everything
clear
to
you
i
cried
turning
him
by
force
towards
home
its
he
stepan
trofimovitch
its
you
you
a
fresh
joyous
young
voice
rang
out
like
music
behind
us
we
had
seen
nothing
but
a
lady
on
horseback
suddenly
made
her
appearance
beside
uslizaveta
nikolaevna
with
her
invariable
companion
she
pulled
up
her
horse
come
here
come
here
quickly
she
called
to
us
loudly
and
merrily
its
twelve
years
since
ive
seen
him
and
i
know
him
while
he
do
you
really
not
know
me
stepan
trofimovitch
clasped
the
hand
held
out
to
him
and
kissed
it
reverently
he
gazed
at
her
as
though
he
were
praying
and
could
not
utter
a
word
he
knows
me
and
is
glad
mavriky
nikolaevitch
hes
delighted
to
see
me
why
is
it
you
havent
been
to
see
us
all
this
fortnight
auntie
tried
to
persuade
me
you
were
ill
and
must
not
be
disturbed
but
i
know
auntie
tells
lies
i
kept
stamping
and
swearing
at
you
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
you
should
come
to
me
first
that
was
why
i
didnt
send
to
you
heavens
why
he
hasnt
changed
a
bit
she
scrutinised
him
bending
down
from
the
saddle
hes
absurdly
unchanged
oh
yes
he
has
wrinkles
a
lot
of
wrinkles
round
his
eyes
and
on
his
cheeks
some
grey
hair
but
his
eyes
are
just
the
same
and
have
i
changed
have
i
changed
why
dont
you
say
something
i
remembered
at
that
moment
the
story
that
she
had
been
almost
ill
when
she
was
taken
away
to
petersburg
at
eleven
years
old
and
that
she
had
cried
during
her
illness
and
asked
for
stepan
trofimovitch
you
i
he
faltered
now
in
a
voice
breaking
with
joy
i
was
just
crying
out
who
will
comfort
me
and
i
heard
your
voice
i
look
on
it
as
a
miracle
et
je
commence

croire
en
dieu
en
dieu
qui
est
lhaut
et
qui
est
si
grand
et
si
bon
you
see
i
know
all
your
lectures
by
heart
mavriky
nikolaevitch
what
faith
he
used
to
preach
to
me
then
en
dieu
qui
est
si
grand
et
si
bon
and
do
you
remember
your
story
of
how
columbus
discovered
america
and
they
all
cried
out
land
land
my
nurse
alyona
frolovna
says
i
was
lightheaded
at
night
afterwards
and
kept
crying
out
land
land
in
my
sleep
and
do
you
remember
how
you
told
me
the
story
of
prince
hamlet
and
do
you
remember
how
you
described
to
me
how
the
poor
emigrants
were
transported
from
europe
to
america
and
it
was
all
untrue
i
found
out
afterwards
how
they
were
transited
but
what
beautiful
fibs
he
used
to
tell
me
then
mavriky
nikolaevitch
they
were
better
than
the
truth
why
do
you
look
at
mavriky
nikolaevitch
like
that
he
is
the
best
and
finest
man
on
the
face
of
the
globe
and
you
must
like
him
just
as
you
do
me
il
fait
tout
ce
que
je
veux
but
dear
stepan
trofimovitch
you
must
be
unhappy
again
since
you
cry
out
in
the
middle
of
the
street

garden
and
i
comforted
you
and
crieddont
be
afraid
of
mavriky
nikolaevitch
he

everything
for
ever
so
long
you

weep

i

ladys

of
the
window
come
closer
closer
heavens
how

and
bending
over
in
the
saddle
she

on
the
forehead

and
she
galloped
off
with
her
cavalier
we
returned
stepan
trofimovitch
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
began
to
cry
dieu
dieu
he
exclaimed
enfin
une
minute
de
bonheur
not
more
than
ten
minutes
afterwards
she
reappeared
according
to
her
promise
escorted
by
her
mavriky
nikolaevitch
vous
et
le
bonheur
vous
arrivez
en
mme
temps
he
got
up
to
meet
her
heres
a
nosegay
for
you
i
rode
just
now
to
madame
chevaliers
she
has
flowers
all
the
winter
for
namedays
heres
mavriky
nikolaevitch
please
make
friends
i
wanted
to
bring
you
a
cake
instead
of
a
nosegay
but
mavriky
nikolaevitch
declares
that
is
not
in
the
russian
spirit
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
an
artillery
captain
a
tall
and
handsome
man
of
thirtythree
irreproachably
correct
in
appearance
with
an
imposing
and
at
first
sight
almost
stern
countenance
in
spite
of
his
wonderful
and
delicate
kindness
which
no
one
could
fail
to
perceive
almost
the
first
moment
of
making
his
acquaintance
he
was
taciturn
however
seemed
very
selfpossessed
and
made
no
efforts
to
gain
friends
many
of
us
said
later
that
he
was
by
no
means
clever
but
this
was
not
altogether
just
i
wont
attempt
to
describe
the
beauty
of
lizaveta
nikolaevna
the
whole
town
was
talking
of
it
though
some
of
our
ladies
and
young
girls
indignantly
differed
on
the
subject
there
were
some
among
them
who
already
detested
her
and
principally
for
her
pride
the
drozdovs
had
scarcely
begun
to
pay
calls
which
mortified
them
though
the
real
reason
for
the
delay
was
praskovya
ivanovnas
invalid
state
they
detested
her
in
the
second
place
because
she
was
a
relative
of
the
governors
wife
and
thirdly
because
she
rode
out
every
day
on
horseback
we
had
never
had
young
ladies
who
rode
on
horseback
before
it
was
only
natural
that
the
appearance
of
lizaveta
nikolaevna
on
horseback
and
her
neglect
to
pay
calls
was
bound
to
offend
local
society
yet
every
one
knew
that
riding
was
prescribed
her
by
the
doctors
orders
and
they
talked
sarcastically
of
her
illness
she
really
was
ill
what
struck
me
at
first
sight
in
her
was
her
abnormal
nervous
incessant
restlessness
alas
the
poor
girl
was
very
unhappy
and
everything
was
explained
later
today
recalling
the
past
i
should
not
say
she
was
such
a
beauty
as
she
seemed
to
me
then
perhaps
she
was
really
not
pretty
at
all
tall
slim
but
strong
and
supple
she
struck
one
by
the
irregularities
of
the
lines
of
her
face
her
eyes
were
set
somewhat
like
a
kalmucks
slanting
she
was
pale
and
thin
in
the
face
with
high
cheekbones
but
there
was
something
in
the
face
that
conquered
and
fascinated
there
was
something
powerful
in
the
ardent
glance
of
her
dark
eyes
she
always
made
her
appearance
like
a
conquering
heroine
and
to
spread
her
conquests
she
seemed
proud
and
at
times
even
arrogant
i
dont
know
whether
she
succeeded
in
being
kind
but
i
know
that
she
wanted
to
and
made
terrible
efforts
to
force
herself
to
be
a
little
kind
there
were
no
doubt
many
fine
impulses
and
the
very
best
elements
in
her
character
but
everything
in
her
seemed
perpetually
seeking
its
balance
and
unable
to
find
it
everything
was
in
chaos
in
agitation
in
uneasiness
perhaps
the
demands
she
made
upon
herself
were
too
severe
and
she
was
never
able
to
find
in
herself
the
strength
to
satisfy
them
she
sat
on
the
sofa
and
looked
round
the
room
why
do
i
always
begin
to
feel
sad
at
such
moments
explain
that
mystery
you
learned
person
ive
been
thinking
all
my
life
that
i
should
be
goodness
knows
how
pleased
at
seeing
you
and
recalling
everything
and
here
i
somehow
dont
feel
pleased
at
all
although
i
do
love
you
ach
heavens
he
has
my
portrait
on
the
wall
give
it
here
i
remember
it
i
remember
it
an
exquisite
miniature
in
watercolour
of
liza
at
twelve
years
old
had
been
sent
nine
years
before
to
stepan
trofimovitch
from
petersburg
by
the
drozdovs
he
had
kept
it
hanging
on
his
wall
ever
since
was
i
such
a
pretty
child
can
that
really
have
been
my
face
she
stood
up
and
with
the
portrait
in
her
hand
looked
in
the
lookingglass
make
haste
take
it
she
cried
giving
back
the
portrait
dont
hang
it
up
now
afterwards
i
dont
want
to
look
at
it
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
again
one
life
is
over
and
another
is
begun
then
that
one
is
overa
third
begins
and
so
on
endlessly
all
the
ends
are
snipped
off
as
it
were
with
scissors
see
what
stale
things
im
telling
you
yet
how
much
truth
there
is
in
them
she
looked
at
me
smiling
she
had
glanced
at
me
several
times
already
but
in
his
excitement
stepan
trofimovitch
forgot
that
he
had
promised
to
introduce
me
and
why
have
you
hung
my
portrait
under
those
daggers
and
why
have
you
got
so
many
daggers
and
sabres
he
had
as
a
fact
hanging
on
the
wall
i
dont
know
why
two
crossed
daggers
and
above
them
a
genuine
circassian
sabre
as
she
asked
this
question
she
looked
so
directly
at
me
that
i
wanted
to
answer
but
hesitated
to
speak
stepan
trofimovitch
grasped
the
position
at
last
and
introduced
me
i
know
i
know
she
said
im
delighted
to
meet
you
mother
has
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
too
let
me
introduce
you
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
too
hes
a
splendid
person
i
had
formed
a
funny
notion
of
you

youre
stepan
trofimovitchs
confidant
arent
you
i
turned
rather
red
ach

me
please
i
used
quite
the
wrong
word
not
funny
at
all
but
only
she
was
confused
and
blushed
why
be
ashamed
though
at
your
being
a
splendid
person
well
its
time
we
were
going

cried
in
astonishment

it
i
wouldnt
believe

et
malade
et
puis
she
laughed
and
your
confidant
didnt
happen
to
be
at
hand
and
nastasya
turned
up
well
that

the
whole

full
of
her
cronies

they
went
away
i
ran
at
once
of
course
to
shatov
mon
ami
said
stepan
trofimovitch
overtaking
me
on
the
steps
be
sure
to
be
at
my
lodging
at
ten
or
eleven
oclock
when
i
come
back
oh
ive
acted
very
wrongly
in
my
conduct
to
you
and
to
every
one
viii
i
did
not
find
shatov
at
home
i
ran
round
again
two
hours
later
he
was
still
out
at
last
at
eight
oclock
i
went
to
him
again
meaning
to
leave
a
note
if
i
did
not
find
him
again
i
failed
to
find
him
his
lodging
was
shut
up
and
he
lived
alone
without
a
servant
of
any
sort
i
did
think
of
knocking
at
captain
lebyadkins
down
below
to
ask
about
shatov
but
it
was
all
shut
up
below
too
and
there
was
no
sound
or
light
as
though
the
place
were
empty
i
passed
by
lebyadkins
door
with
curiosity
remembering
the
stories
i
had
heard
that
day
finally
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
very
early
next
morning
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
not
put
much
confidence
in
the
effect
of
a
note
shatov
might
take
no
notice
of
it
he
was
so
obstinate
and
shy
cursing
my
want
of
success
i
was
going
out
of
the
gate
when
all
at
once
i
stumbled
on
mr
kirillov
he
was
going
into
the
house
and
he
recognised
me
first
as
he
began
questioning
me
of
himself
i
told
him
how
things
were
and
that
i
had
a
note
let
us
go
in
said
he
i
will
do
everything
i
remembered
that
liputin
had
told
us
he
had
taken
the
wooden
lodge
in
the
yard
that
morning
in
the
lodge
which
was
too
large
for
him
a
deaf
old
woman
who
waited
upon
him
was
living
too
the
owner
of
the
house
had
moved
into
a
new
house
in
another
street
where
he
kept
a
restaurant
and
this
old
woman
a
relation
of
his
i
believe
was
left
behind
to
look
after
everything
in
the
old
house
the
rooms
in
the
lodge
were
fairly
clean
though
the
wallpapers
were
dirty
in
the
one
we
went
into
the
furniture
was
of
different
sorts
picked
up
here
and
there
and
all
utterly
worthless
there
were
two
cardtables
a
chest
of
drawers
made
of
elder
a
big
deal
table
that
must
have
come
from
some
peasant
hut
or
kitchen
chairs
and
a
sofa
with
trelliswork
back
and
hard
leather
cushions
in
one
corner
there
was
an
oldfashioned
ikon
in
front
of
which
the
old
woman
had
lighted
a
lamp
before
we
came
in
and
on
the
walls
hung
two
dingy
oilpaintings
one
a
portrait
of
the
tsar
nikolas
i
painted
apparently
between
1820
and
1830
the
other
the
portrait
of
some
bishop
mr
kirillov
lighted
a
candle
and
took
out
of
his
trunk
which
stood
not
yet
unpacked
in
a
corner
an
envelope
sealingwax
and
a
glass
seal
seal
your
note
and
address
the
envelope
i
would
have
objected
that
this
was
unnecessary
but
he
insisted
when
i
had
addressed
the
envelope
i
took
my
cap
i
was
thinking
youd
have
tea
he
said
i
have
bought
tea
will
you
i
could
not
refuse
the
old
woman
soon
brought
in
the
tea
that
is
a
very
large
teapot
of
boiling
water
a
little
teapot
full
of
strong
tea
two
large
earthenware
cups
coarsely
decorated
a
fancy
loaf
and
a
whole
deep
saucer
of
lump
sugar
i
love
tea
at
night
said
he
i
walk
much
and
drink
it
till
daybreak
abroad
tea
at
night
is
inconvenient
you
go
to
bed
at
daybreak
always
for
a
long
while
i
eat
little
always
tea
liputins
sly
but
impatient
i
was
surprised
at
his
wanting
to
talk
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
there
were
unpleasant
misunderstandings
this
morning
i
observed
he
scowled
thats
foolishness
thats
great
nonsense
all
this
is
nonsense
because
lebyadkin
is
drunk
i
did
not
tell
liputin
but
only
explained
the
nonsense
because
he
got
it
all
wrong
liputin
has
a
great
deal
of
fantasy
he
built
up
a
mountain
out
of
nonsense
i
trusted
liputin
yesterday
and
me
today
i
said
laughing
but
you
see
you
knew
all
about
it
already
this
morning
liputin
is
weak
or
impatient
or
malicious
or
hes
envious
the
last
word
struck
me
youve
mentioned
so
many
adjectives
however
that
it
would
be
strange
if
one
didnt
describe
him
or
all
at
once
yes
and
thats
what
liputin
really
ishes
a
chaos
he
was
lying
this
morning
when
he
said
you
were
writing
something
wasnt
he
why
should
he
he
said
scowling
again
and
staring
at
the
floor
i
apologised
and
began
assuring
him
that
i
was
not
inquisitive
he
flushed
he
told
the
truth
i
am
writing
only
thats
no
matter
we
were
silent
for
a
minute
he
suddenly
smiled
with
the
childlike
smile
i
had
noticed
that
morning
he
invented
that
about
heads
himself
out
of
a
book
and
told
me
first
himself
and
understands
badly
but
i
only
seek
the
causes
why
men
dare
not
kill
themselves
thats
all
and
its
all
no
matter
how
do
you
mean
they
dont
dare
are
there
so
few
suicides
very
few
do
you
really
think
so
he
made
no
answer
got
up
and
began
walking
to
and
fro
lost
in
thought
what
is
it
restrains
people
from
suicide
do
you
think
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
absentmindedly
as
though
trying
to
remember
what
we
were
talking
about
i
i
dont
know
much
yet
two
prejudices
restrain
them
two
things
only
two
one
very
little
the
other
very
big
what
is
the
little
thing
pain
pain
can
that
be
of
importance
at
such
a
moment
of
the
greatest
there
are
two
sorts
those
who
kill
themselves
either
from
great
sorrow
or
from
spite
or
being
mad
or
no
matter
what
they
do
it
suddenly
they
think
little
about
the
pain
but
kill
themselves
suddenly
but
some
do
it
from
reasonthey
think
a
great
deal
why
are
there
people
who
do
it
from
reason
very
many
if
it
were
not
for
superstition
there
would
be
more
very
many
all
what
all
he
did
not
answer
but
arent
there
means
of
dying
without
pain
imaginehe
stopped
before
meimagine
a
stone
as
big
as
a
great
house
it
hangs
and
you
are
under
it
if
it
falls
on
you
on
your
head
will
it
hurt
you
a
stone
as
big
as
a
house
of
course
it
would
be
fearful
i
speak
not
of
the
fear
will
it
hurt
a
stone
as
big
as
a
mountain
weighing
millions
of
tons
of
course
it
wouldnt
hurt
but
really
stand
there
and
while
it
hangs
you
will
fear
very
much
that
it
will
hurt
the
most
learned
man
the
greatest
doctor
all
all
will
be
very
much
frightened
every
one
will
know
that
it
wont
hurt
and
every
one
will
be
afraid
that
it
will
hurt
well
and
the
second
cause
the
big
one
the
other
world
you
mean
punishment
thats
no
matter
the
other
world
only
the
other
world
are
there
no
atheists
such
as
dont
believe
in
the
other
world
at
all
again
he
did
not
answer
you
judge
from
yourself
perhaps
every
one
cannot
judge
except
from
himself
he
said
reddening
there
will
be
full
freedom
when
it
will
be
just
the
same
to
live
or
not
to
live
thats
the
goal
for
all
the
goal
but
perhaps
no
one
will
care
to
live
then
no
one
he
pronounced
with
decision
man
fears
death
because
he
loves
life
thats
how
i
understand
it
i
observed
and
thats
determined
by
nature
thats
abject
and
thats
where
the
deception
comes
in
his
eyes
flashed
life
is
pain
life
is
terror
and
man
is
unhappy
now
all
is
pain
and
terror
now
man
loves
life
because
he
loves
pain
and
terror
and
so
they
have
done
according
life
is
given
now
for
pain
and
terror
and
thats
the
deception
now
man
is
not
yet
what
he
will
be
there
will
be
a
new
man
happy
and
proud
for
whom
it
will
be
the
same
to
live
or
not
to
live
he
will
be
the
new
man
he
who
will
conquer
pain
and
terror
will
himself
be
a
god
and
this
god
will
not
be
then
this
god
does
exist
according
to
you
he
does
not
exist
but
he
is
in
the
stone
there
is
no
pain
but
in
the
fear
of
the
stone
is
the
pain
god
is
the
pain
of
the
fear
of
death
he
who
will
conquer
pain
and
terror
will
become
himself
a
god
then
there
will
be
a
new
life
a
new
man
everything
will
be
new
then
they
will
divide
history
into
two
parts
from
the
gorilla
to
the
annihilation
of
god
and
from
the
annihilation
of
god
to
to
the
gorilla

to
the
transformation
of
the
earth
and
of
man
physically
man
will
be
god
and
will
be
transformed
physically
and
the
world
will
be
transformed
and
things
will
be
transformed
and
thoughts
and
all
feelings
what
do
you
think
will
man
be
changed
physically
then
if
it
will
be
just
the
same
living
or
not
living
all
will
kill
themselves
and
perhaps
thats
what
the
change
will
be
thats
no
matter
they
will
kill
deception
every
one
who
wants
the
supreme
freedom
must
dare
to
kill
himself
he
who
dares
to
kill
himself
has
found
out
the
secret
of
the
deception
there
is
no
freedom
beyond
that
is
all
and
there
is
nothing
beyond
he
who
dares
kill
himself
is
god
now
every
one
can
do
so
that
there
shall
be
no
god
and
shall
be
nothing
but
no
one
has
once
done
it
yet
there
have
been
millions
of
suicides
but
always
not
for
that
always
with
terror
and
not
for
that
object
not
to
kill
fear
he
who
kills
himself
only
to
kill
fear
will
become
a
god
at
once
he
wont
have
time
perhaps
i
observed
thats
no
matter
he
answered
softly
with
calm
pride
almost
disdain
im
sorry
that
you
seem
to
be
laughing
he
added
half
a
minute
later
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
you
were
so
irritable
this
morning
and
are
now
so
calm
though
you
speak
with
warmth
this
morning
it
was
funny
this
morning
he
answered
with
a
smile
i
dont
like
scolding
and
i
never
laugh
he
added
mournfully
yes
you
dont
spend
your
nights
very
cheerfully
over
your
tea
i
got
up
and
took
my
cap
you
think
not
he
smiled
with
some
surprise
why
no
i
i
dont
know
he
was
suddenly
confused
i
know
not
how
it
is
with
the
others
and
i
feel
that
i
cannot
do
as
others
everybody
thinks
and
then
at
once
thinks
of
something
else
i
cant
think
of
something
else
i
think
all
my
life
of
one
thing
god
has
tormented
me
all
my
life
he
ended
up
suddenly
with
astonishing
expansiveness
and
tell
me
if
i
may
ask
why
is
it
you
speak
russian
not
quite
correctly
surely
you
havent
forgotten
it
after
five
years
abroad
dont
i
speak
correctly
i
dont
know
no
its
not
because
of
abroad
i
have
talked
like
that
all
my
life
its
no
matter
to
me
another
question
a
more
delicate
one
i
quite
believe
you
that
youre
disinclined
to
meet
people
and
talk
very
little
why
have
you
talked
to
me
now
to
you
this
morning
you
sat
so
nicely
and
you
but
its
all
no
matter
you
are
like
my
brother
very
much
extremely
he
added
flushing
he
has
been
dead
seven
years
he
was
older
very
very
much
i
suppose
he
had
a
great
influence
on
your
way
of
thinking
nno
he
said
little
he
said
nothing
ill
give
your
note
he
saw
me
to
the
gate
with
a
lantern
to
lock
it
after
me
of
course
hes
mad
i
decided
in
the
gateway
i
met
with
another
encounter
ix
i
had
only
just
lifted
my
leg
over
the
high
barrier
across
the
bottom
of
the
gateway
when
suddenly
a
strong
hand
clutched
at
my
chest
whos
this
roared
a
voice
a
friend
or
an
enemy
own
up
hes
one
of
us
one
of
us
liputins
voice
squealed
near
by
its
mr
gv
a
young
man
of
classical
education
in
touch
with
the
highest
society
i
love
him
if
hes
in
society
classi
that
means
hes
highly
educated
the
retired
captain
ignat
lebyadkin
at
the
service
of
the
world
and
his
friends
if
theyre
true
ones
if
theyre
true
ones
the
scoundrels
captain
lebyadkin
a
stout
fleshy
man
over
six
feet
in
height
with
curly
hair
and
a
red
face
was
so
extremely
drunk
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
up
before
me
and
articulated
with
difficulty
i
had
seen
him
before
however
in
the
distance
and
this
one
he
roared
again
noticing
kirillov
who
was
still
standing
with
the
lantern
he
raised
his
fist
but
let
it
fall
again
at
once

away

all
my
might

only
a
serf
she
darent
at
this
point
he
fell
down
for
i
pulled
myself
violently
out
of
his
hands
and
ran
into
the
street
liputin
clung
on
to
me
alexey

pick
him
up

what
ive
just
found
out
from

babbled
in
desperate
haste
did
you
hear
his
verses
hes
sealed
those
verses
to
the
starry
amazon
in
an
envelope
and

going
to

them
tomorrow

laughed
liputin
hes
in
love
in
love
like
a
cat
and
do
you
know
it
began
with
hatred
he
hated
lizaveta
nikolaevna
at
first
so
much
for
riding
on
horseback
that
he
almost
swore
aloud
at
her
in
the
street
yes
he
did
abuse
her
only
the
day
before
yesterday
he
swore
at
her
when
she
rode
byluckily
she
didnt
hear
and
suddenly
todaypoetry
do
you
know
he
means
to
risk
a
proposal
seriously
seriously
i
wonder
at
you
liputin
whenever
theres
anything
nasty
going
on
youre
always
on
the
spot
taking
a
leading
part
in
it
i
said
angrily
youre
going
rather
far
mr
gv
isnt
your
poor
little
heart
quaking
perhaps
in
terror
of
a
rival
whaat
i
cried
standing
still
well
now
to
punish
you
i
wont
say
anything
more
and
wouldnt
you
like
to
know
though
take
this
alone
that
that
lout
is
not
a
simple
captain
now
but
a
landowner
of
our
province
and
rather
an
important
one
too
for
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
sold
him
all
his
estate
the
other
day
formerly
of
two
hundred
serfs
and
as
gods
above
im
not
lying
ive
only
just
heard
it
but
it
was
from
a
most
reliable
source
and
now
you
can
ferret
it
out
for
yourself
ill
say
nothing
more
goodbye
x
stepan
trofimovitch
was
awaiting
me
with
hysterical
impatience
it
was
an
hour
since
he
had
returned
i
found
him
in
a
state
resembling
intoxication
for
the
first
five
minutes
at
least
i
thought
he
was
drunk
alas
the
visit
to
the
drozdovs
had
been
the
finishingstroke
mon
ami
i
have
completely
lost
the
thread
lise
i
love
and
respect
that
angel
as
before
just
as
before
but
it
seems
to
me
they
both
asked
me
simply
to
find
out
something
from
me
that
is
more
simply
to
get
something
out
of
me
and
then
to
get
rid
of
me
thats
how
it
is
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
i
couldnt
help
exclaiming
my
friend
now
i
am
utterly
alone
enfin
cest
ridicule
would
you
believe
it
the
place
is
positively
packed
with
mysteries
there
too
they
simply
flew
at
me
about
those
ears
and
noses
and
some
mysteries
in
petersburg
too
you
know
they
hadnt
heard
till
they
came
about
the
tricks
nicolas
played
here
four
years
ago
you
were
here
you
saw
it
is
it
true
that
he
is
mad
where
they
got
the
idea
i
cant
make
out
why
is
it
that
praskovya
is
so
anxious
nicolas
should
be
mad
the
woman
will
have
it
so
she
will
ce
maurice
or
whats
his
name
mavriky
nikolaevitch
brave
homme
tout
de
mme
but
can
it
be
for
his
sake
and
after
she
wrote
herself
from
paris
to
cette
pauvre
amie
enfin
this
praskovya
as
cette
chre
amie
calls
her
is
a
type
shes
gogols
madame
box
of
immortal
memory
only
shes
a
spiteful
madame
box
a
malignant
box
and
in
an
immensely
exaggerated
form
thats
making
her
out
a
regular
packingcase
if
its
an
exaggerated
form
well
perhaps
its
the
opposite
its
all
the
same
only
dont
interrupt
me
for
im
all
in
a
whirl
they
are
all
at
loggerheads
except
lise
she
keeps
on
with
her
auntie
auntie
but
lises
sly
and
theres
something
behind
it
too
secrets
she
has
quarrelled
with
the
old
lady
cette
pauvre
auntie
tyrannises
over
every
one
its
true
and
then
theres
the
governors
wife
and
the
rudeness
of
local
society
and
karmazinovs
rudeness
and
then
this
idea
of
madness
ce
lipoutine
ce
que
je
ne
comprends
pas
and
and
they
say
shes
been
putting
vinegar
on
her
head
and
here
are
we
with
our
complaints
and
letters
oh
how
i
have
tormented
her
and
at
such
a
time
je
suis
un
ingrat
only
imagine
i
come
back
and
find
a
letter
from
her
read
it
read
it
oh
how
ungrateful
it
was
of
me
he
gave
me
a
letter
he
had
just
received
from
varvara
petrovna
she
seemed
to
have
repented
of
her
stay
at
home
the
letter
was
amiable
but
decided
in
tone
and
brief
she
invited
stepan
trofimovitch
to
come
to
her
the
day
after
tomorrow
which
was
sunday
at
twelve
oclock
and
advised
him
to
bring
one
of
his
friends
with
him
my
name
was
mentioned
in
parenthesis
she
promised
on
her
side
to
invite
shatov
as
the
brother
of
darya
pavlovna
you
can
obtain
a
final
answer
from
her
will
that
be
enough
for
you
is
this
the
formality
you
were
so
anxious
for
observe
that
irritable
phrase
about
formality
poor
thing
poor
thing
the
friend
of
my
whole
life
i
confess
the
sudden
determination
of
my
whole
future
almost
crushed
me
i
confess
i
still
had
hopes
but
now
tout
est
dit
i
know
now
that
all
is
over
cest
terrible
oh
that
that
sunday
would
never
come
and
everything
would
go
on
in
the
old
way
you
would
have
gone
on
coming
and
id
have
gone
on
here
youve
been
upset
by
all
those
nasty
things
liputin
said
those
slanders
my
dear
you
have
touched
on
another
sore
spot
with
your
friendly
finger
such
friendly
fingers
are
generally
merciless
and
sometimes
unreasonable
pardon
you
may
not
believe
it
but
id
almost
forgotten
all
that
all
that
nastiness
not
that
i
forgot
it
indeed
but
in
my
foolishness
i
tried
all
the
while
i
was
with
lise
to
be
happy
and
persuaded
myself
i
was
happy
but
now
oh
now
im
thinking
of
that
generous
humane
woman
so
longsuffering
with
my
contemptible
failingsnot
that
shes
been
altogether
longsuffering
but
what
have
i
been
with
my
horrid
worthless
character
im
a
capricious
child
with
all
the
egoism
of
a
child
and
none
of
the
innocence
for
the
last
twenty
years
shes
been
looking
after
me
like
a
nurse
cette
pauvre
auntie
as
lise
so
charmingly
calls
her
and
now
after
twenty
years
the
child
clamours
to
be
married
sending
letter
after
letter
while
her
heads
in
a
vinegarcompress
and
now
hes
got
iton
sunday
i
shall
be
a
married
man
thats
no
joke
and
why
did
i
keep
insisting
myself
what
did
i
write
those
letters
for
oh
i
forgot
lise
idolizes
darya
pavlovna
she
says
so
anyway
she
says
of
her
cest
un
ange
only
rather
a
reserved
one
they
both
advised
me
even
praskovya

praskovya
didnt
advise
me
though
oh
what
venom
lies
concealed
in
that
box
and
lise
didnt
exactly
advise
me
what
do
you
want
to
get
married
for
she
said
your
intellectual
pleasures
ought
to
be
enough
for
you
she
laughed
i
forgive
her
for
laughing
for
theres
an
ache
in
her
own
heart
you
cant
get
on
without
a
woman
though
they
said
to
me
the
infirmities
of
age
are
coming
upon
you
and
she
will
tuck
you
up
or
whatever
it
is
ma
foi
ive
been
thinking
myself
all
this
time
ive
been
sitting
with
you
that
providence
was
sending
her
to
me
in
the
decline
of
my
stormy
years
and
that
she
would
tuck
me
up
or
whatever
they
call
it
enfin
shell
be
handy
for
the
housekeeping
see
what
a
litter
there
is
look
how
everythings
lying
about
i
said
it
must
be
cleared
up
this
morning
and
look
at
the
book
on
the
floor
la
pauvre
amie
was
always
angry
at
the
untidiness
here

ah
now
i
shall
no
longer
hear
her
voice
vingt
ans
and
it
seems
theyve
had
anonymous
letters
only
fancy
its
said
that
nicolas
has
sold
lebyadkin
his
property
cest
un
monstre
et
enfin
what
is
lebyadkin
lise
listens
and
listens
ooh
how
she
listens
i
forgave
her
laughing
i
saw
her
face
as
she
listened
and
ce
mauricei
shouldnt
care
to
be
in
his
shoes
now
brave
homme
tout
de
mme
but
rather
shy
but
never
mind
him
he
paused
he
was
tired
and
upset
and
sat
with
drooping
head
staring
at
the
floor
with
his
tired
eyes
i
took
advantage
of
the
interval
to
tell
him
of
my
visit
to
filipovs
house
and
curtly
and
dryly
expressed
my
opinion
that
lebyadkins
sister
whom
i
had
never
seen
really
might
have
been
somehow
victimised
by
nicolas
at
some
time
during
that
mysterious
period
of
his
life
as
liputin
had
called
it
and
that
it
was
very
possible
that
lebyadkin
received
sums
of
money
from
nicolas
for
some
reason
but
that
was
all
as
for
the
scandal
about
darya
pavlovna
that
was
all
nonsense
all
that
brute
liputins
misrepresentations
that
this
was
anyway
what
alexey
nilitch
warmly
maintained
and
we
had
no
grounds
for
disbelieving
him
stepan
trofimovitch
listened
to
my
assurances
with
an
absent
air
as
though
they
did
not
concern
him
i
mentioned
by
the
way
my
conversation
with
kirillov
and
added
that
he
might
be
mad
hes
not
mad
but
one
of
those
shallowminded
people
he
mumbled
listlessly
ces
gensl
supposent
la
nature
et
la
societ
humaine
autres
que
dieu
ne
les
a
faites
et
quelles
ne
sont
rellement
people
try
to
make
up
to
them
but
stepan
verhovensky
does
not
anyway
i
saw
them
that
time
in
petersburg
avec
cette
chre
amie
oh
how
i
used
to
wound
her
then
and
i
wasnt
afraid
of
their
abuse
or
even
of
their
praise
im
not
afraid
now
either
mais
parlons
dautre
chose
i
believe
i
have
done
dreadful
things
only
fancy
i
sent
a
letter
yesterday
to
darya
pavlovna
and
how
i
curse
myself
for
it
what
did
you
write
about
oh
my
friend
believe
me
it
was
all
done
in
a
noble
spirit
i
let
her
know
that
i
had
written
to
nicolas
five
days
before
also
in
a
noble
spirit
i
understand
now
i
cried
with
heat
and
what
right
had
you
to
couple
their
names
like
that
but
mon
cher
dont
crush
me
completely
dont
shout
at
me
as
it
is
im
utterly
squashed
like
a
blackbeetle
and
after
all
i
thought
it
was
all
so
honourable
suppose
that
something
really
happened
en
suisseor
was
beginning
i
was
bound
to
question
their
hearts
beforehand
that
ienfin
that
i
might
not
constrain
their
hearts
and
be
a
stumblingblock
in
their
paths
i
acted
simply
from
honourable
feeling
oh
heavens
what
a
stupid
thing
youve
done
i
cried
involuntarily
yes
yes
he
assented
with
positive
eagerness
you
have
never
said
anything
more
just
ctait
bte
mais

my
brides
brother
shatov

succeeded
in
saying

would
gladly

his
phrase
well
here
i
am
ready
to
conquer
myself

i
conquering
by
way
of
the
whole

my
friend
marriage
is
the
moral
death
of
every
proud
soul
of
all
independence
married
life

corrupt
me

will
sap
my
energy
my
courage
in
the

of
the

children
will
come
probably
not

a

a

knew
what
he
was
in
for
when
he
was
creating
woman
but
im
sure
that
she
meddled
in
it
herself
and
forced
him
to
create
her
such
as
she
is
and
with
such
attributes
for
who
would
have
incurred
so
much
trouble
for
nothing

he
wouldnt
have
been

if
he
could
have
dispensed
with
the
cheap
gibing
freethought
which
was
in
vogue
in
his
day
now
at
any

he
comforted
himself
with
a
gibe
but
not
for
long
oh
if
that
day
after
tomorrow
that
sunday
might
never
come
he
exclaimed
suddenly
this
time
in
utter
despair
why
could
not
this
one
week
be
without
a

it
be

to
prove

oh
how
i
loved
her
twenty
years
these
twenty
years
and
she
has
never
understood
me
but
of
whom
are
you
talking
even
i
dont
understand
you
i
asked
wondering
vingt

and
she
has
not
once
understood
me
oh
its
cruel
and
can
she
really
believe
that
i
am
marrying
from
fear
from
poverty
oh
the
shame
of
it
oh
auntie
auntie
i
do

that
auntie
that
she
is
the
one
woman
i
have
adored
for
twenty
years
she
must
learn
this
it
must
be
so
if
not
they
will
need
force
to
drag
me
under
ce

le

it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
this
confession
and
so
vigorously
uttered
i
wont
conceal
the
fact
that
i
was
terribly
tempted
to
laugh
i
was
wrong
he
is
the
only
one
left
me
now
the
only
one
my
one

he
cried
suddenly
clasping
his
hands
as
though
struck
by
a
new
idea
only
he
my
poor
boy
can
save
me
now
and
oh
why
doesnt
he
come
oh
my
son
oh

down
a

to

oclock
chapter
iv
the
cripple
i
shatov
was
not
perverse
but
acted
on
my
note
and
called
at
midday
on
lizaveta
nikolaevna
we
went
in
almost
together
i
was
also
going
to
make
my
first
call
they
were
all
that
is
liza
her
mother
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
sitting
in
the
big
drawingroom
arguing
the
mother
was
asking
liza
to
play
some
waltz
on
the
piano
and
as
soon
as
liza
began
to
play
the
piece
asked
for
declared
it
was
not
the
right
one
mavriky
nikolaevitch
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
took
lizas
part
maintaining
that
it
was
the
right
waltz
the
elder
lady
was
so
angry
that
she
began
to
cry
she
was
ill
and
walked
with
difficulty
her
legs
were
swollen
and
for
the
last
few
days
she
had
been
continually
fractious
quarrelling
with
every
one
though
she
always
stood
rather
in
awe
of
liza
they
were
pleased
to
see
us
liza
flushed
with
pleasure
and
saying
merci
to
me
on
shatovs
account
of
course
went
to
meet
him
looking
at
him
with
interest
shatov
stopped
awkwardly
in
the
doorway
thanking
him
for
coming
she
led
him
up
to
her
mother
this
is
mr
shatov
of
whom
i
have
told
you
and
this
is
mr
gv
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
of
stepan
trofimovitchs
mavriky
nikolaevitch
made
his
acquaintance
yesterday
too
and
which
is
the
professor
theres
no
professor
at
all
maman
but
there
is
you
said
yourself
that
thered
be
a
professor
its
this
one
probably
she
disdainfully
indicated
shatov
i
didnt
tell
you
that
thered
be
a
professor
mr
gv
is
in
the
service
and
mr
shatov
is
a
former
student
a
student
or
professor
they
all
come
from
the
university
just
the
same
you
only
want
to
argue
but
the
swiss
one
had
moustaches
and
a
beard
its
the
son
of
stepan
trofimovitch
that
maman
always
calls
the
professor
said
liza
and
she
took
shatov
away
to
the
sofa
at
the
other
end
of
the
drawingroom
when
her
legs
swell
shes
always
like
this
you
understand
shes
ill
she
whispered
to
shatov
still
with
the
same
marked
curiosity
scrutinising
him
especially
his
shock
of
hair
are
you
an
officer
the
old
lady
inquired
of
me
liza
had
mercilessly
abandoned
me
to
her
nnoim
in
the
service
mr
gv
is
a
great
friend
of
stepan
trofimovitchs
liza
chimed
in
immediately
are
you
in
stepan
trofimovitchs
service
yes
and
hes
a
professor
too
isnt
he
ah
maman
you
must
dream
at
night
of
professors
cried
liza
with
annoyance
i
see
too
many
when
im
awake
but
you
always
will
contradict
your
mother
were
you
here
four
years
ago
when
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
in
the
neighbourhood
i
answered
that
i
was
and
there
was
some
englishman
with
you
no
there
was
not
liza
laughed
well
you
see
there
was
no
englishman
so
it
must
have
been
idle
gossip
and
varvara
petrovna
and
stepan
trofimovitch
both
tell
lies
and
they
all
tell
lies
auntie
and
stepan
trofimovitch
yesterday
thought
there
was
a
resemblance
between
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
prince
harry
in
shakespeares
henry
iv
and
in
answer
to
that
maman
says
that
there
was
no
englishman
here
liza
explained
to
us
if
harry
wasnt
here
there
was
no
englishman
it
was
no
one
else
but
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
at
his
tricks
i
assure
you
that
mamans
doing
it
on
purpose
liza
thought
necessary
to
explain
to
shatov
shes
really
heard
of
shakespeare
i
read
her
the
first
act
of
othello
myself
but
shes
in
great
pain
now
maman
listen
its
striking
twelve
its
time
you
took
your
medicine
the
doctors
come
a
maidservant
announced
at
the
door
the
old
lady
got
up
and
began
calling
her
dog
zemirka
zemirka
you
come
with
me
at
least
zemirka
a
horrid
little
old
dog
instead
of
obeying
crept
under
the
sofa
where
liza
was
sitting
dont
you
want
to
then
i
dont
want
you
goodbye
my
good
sir
i
dont
know
your
name
or
your
fathers
she
said
addressing
me
anton
lavrentyevitch
well
it
doesnt
matter
with
me
it
goes
in
at
one
ear
and
out
of
the
other
dont
you
come
with
me
mavriky
nikolaevitch
it
was
zemirka
i
called
thank
god
i
can
still
walk
without
help
and
tomorrow
i
shall
go
for
a
drive
she
walked
angrily
out
of
the
drawingroom
anton
lavrentyevitch
will
you
talk
meanwhile
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
i
assure
you
youll
both
be
gainers
by
getting
to
know
one
another
better
said
liza
and
she
gave
a
friendly
smile
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
beamed
all
over
as
she
looked
at
him
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
remained
to
talk
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
ii
lizaveta
nikolaevnas
business
with
shatov
turned
out
to
my
surprise
to
be
really
only
concerned
with
literature
i
had
imagined
i
dont
know
why
that
she
had
asked
him
to
come
with
some
other
object
we
mavriky
nikolaevitch
and
i
that
is
seeing
that
they
were
talking
aloud
and
not
trying
to
hide
anything
from
us
began
to
listen
and
at
last
they
asked
our
advice
it
turned
out
that
lizaveta
nikolaevna
was
thinking
of
bringing
out
a
book
which
she
thought
would
be
of
use
but
being
quite
inexperienced
she
needed
someone
to
help
her
the
earnestness
with
which
she
began
to
explain
her
plan
to
shatov
quite
surprised
me
she
must
be
one
of
the
new
people
i
thought
she
has
not
been
to
switzerland
for
nothing
shatov
listened
with
attention
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
showing
not
the
slightest
surprise
that
a
giddy
young
lady
in
society
should
take
up
work
that
seemed
so
out
of
keeping
with
her
her
literary
scheme
was
as
follows
numbers
of
papers
and
journals
are
published
in
the
capitals
and
the
provinces
of
russia
and
every
day
a
number
of
events
are
reported
in
them
the
year
passes
the
newspapers
are
everywhere
folded
up
and
put
away
in
cupboards
or
are
torn
up
and
become
litter
or
are
used
for
making
parcels
or
wrapping
things
numbers
of
these
facts
make
an
impression
and
are
remembered
by
the
public
but
in
the
course
of
years
they
are
forgotten
many
people
would
like
to
look
them
up
but
it
is
a
labour
for
them
to
embark
upon
this
sea
of
paper
often
knowing
nothing
of
the
day
or
place
or
even
year
in
which
the
incident
occurred
yet
if
all
the
facts
for
a
whole
year
were
brought
together
into
one
book
on
a
definite
plan
and
with
a
definite
object
under
headings
with
references
arranged
according
to
months
and
days
such
a
compilation
might
reflect
the
characteristics
of
russian
life
for
the
whole
year
even
though
the
facts
published
are
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
events
that
take
place
instead
of
a
number
of
newspapers
there
would
be
a
few
fat
books
thats
all
observed
shatov
but
lizaveta
nikolaevna
clung
to
her
idea
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
of
carrying
it
out
and
her
inability
to
describe
it
it
ought
to
be
one
book
and
not
even
a
very
thick
one
she
maintained
but
even
if
it
were
thick
it
would
be
clear
for
the
great
point
would
be
the
plan
and
the
character
of
the
presentation
of
facts
of
course
not
all
would
be
collected
and
reprinted
the
decrees
and
acts
of
government
local
regulations
lawsall
such
facts
however
important
might
be
altogether
omitted
from
the
proposed
publication
they
could
leave
out
a
great
deal
and
confine
themselves
to
a
selection
of
events
more
or
less
characteristic
of
the
moral
life
of
the
people
of
the
personal
character
of
the
russian
people
at
the
present
moment
of
course
everything
might
be
put
in
strange
incidents
fires
public
subscriptions
anything
good
or
bad
every
speech
or
word
perhaps
even
floodings
of
the
rivers
perhaps
even
some
government
decrees
but
only
such
things
to
be
selected
as
are
characteristic
of
the
period
everything
would
be
put
in
with
a
certain
view
a
special
significance
and
intention
with
an
idea
which
would
illuminate
the
facts
looked
at
in
the
aggregate
as
a
whole
and
finally
the
book
ought
to
be
interesting
even
for
light
reading
apart
from
its
value
as
a
work
of
reference
it
would
be
so
to
say
a
presentation
of
the
spiritual
moral
inner
life
of
russia
for
a
whole
year
we
want
every
one
to
buy
it
we
want
it
to
be
a
book
that
will
be
found
on
every
table
liza
declared
i
understand
that
all
lies
in
the
plan
and
thats
why
i
apply
to
you
she
concluded
she
grew
very
warm
over
it
and
although
her
explanation
was
obscure
and
incomplete
shatov
began
to
understand
so
it
would
amount
to
something
with
a
political
tendency
a
selection
of
facts
with
a
special
tendency
he
muttered
still
not
raising
his
head
not
at
all
we
must
not
select
with
a
particular
bias
and
we
ought
not
to
have
any
political
tendency
in
it
nothing
but
impartialitythat
will
be
the
only
tendency
but
a
tendency
would
be
no
harm
said
shatov
with
a
slight
movement
and
one
can
hardly
avoid
it
if
there
is
any
selection
at
all
the
very
selection
of
facts
will
suggest
how
they
are
to
be
understood
your
idea
is
not
a
bad
one
then
such
a
book
is
possible
cried
liza
delightedly
we
must
look
into
it
and
consider
its
an
immense
undertaking
one
cant
work
it
out
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
we
need
experience
and
when
we
do
publish
the
book
i
doubt
whether
we
shall
find
out
how
to
do
it
possibly
after
many
trials
but
the
thought
is
alluring
its
a
useful
idea
he
raised
his
eyes
at
last
and
they
were
positively
sparkling
with
pleasure
he
was
so
interested
was
it
your
own
idea
he
asked
liza
in
a
friendly
and
as
it
were
bashful
way
the
ideas
no
trouble
you
know
its
the
plan
is
the
trouble
liza
smiled
i
understand
very
little
i
am
not
very
clever
and
i
only
pursue
what
is
clear
to
me
myself
pursue
perhaps
thats
not
the
right
word
liza
inquired
quickly
the
word
is
all
right
i
meant
nothing
i
thought
while
i
was
abroad
that
even
i
might
be
of
some
use
i
have
money
of
my
own
lying
idle
why
shouldnt
ieven
iwork
for
the
common
cause
besides
the
idea
somehow
occurred
to
me
all
at
once
of
itself
i
didnt
invent
it
at
all
and
was
delighted
with
it
but
i
saw
at
once
that
i
couldnt
get
on
without
someone
to
help
because
i
am
not
competent
to
do
anything
of
myself
my
helper
of
course
would
be
the
coeditor
of
the
book
we
would
go
halves
you
would
give
the
plan
and
the
work
mine
would
be
the
original
idea
and
the
means
for
publishing
it
would
the
book
pay
its
expenses
do
you
think
if
we
hit
on
a
good
plan
the
book
will
go
i
warn
you
that
i
am
not
doing
it
for
profit
but
i
am
very
anxious
that
the
book
should
circulate
and
should
be
very
proud
of
making
a
profit
well
but
how
do
i
come
in
why
i
invite
you
to
be
my
fellowworker
to
go
halves
you
will
think
out
the
plan
how
do
you
know
that
i
am
capable
of
thinking
out
the
plan
people
have
talked
about
you
to
me
and
here
ive
heard

i
know
that
you
are
very
clever
and
are
working
for
the
cause

and
think
a
great
deal
pyotr
stepanovitch
verhovensky
spoke
about
you
in
switzerland
she
added
hurriedly
hes
a
very
clever
man
isnt
he
shatov
stole
a
fleeting
momentary
glance
at
her
but
dropped
his
eyes
again
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
told
me
a
great
deal
about
you
too
shatov
suddenly
turned
red
but
here
are
the
newspapers
liza
hurriedly
picked
up
from
a
chair
a
bundle
of
newspapers
that
lay
tied
up
ready
ive
tried
to
mark
the
facts
here
for
selection
to
sort
them
and
i
have
put
the
papers
together
you
will
see
shatov
took
the
bundle
take
them
home
and
look
at
them
where
do
you
live
in
bogoyavlensky
street
filipovs
house
i
know
i
think
its
there
too
ive
been
told
a
captain
lives
beside
you
mr
lebyadkin
said
liza
in
the
same
hurried
manner
shatov
sat
for
a
full
minute
with
the
bundle
in
his
outstretched
hand
making
no
answer
and
staring
at
the
floor
youd
better
find
someone
else
for
these
jobs
i
shouldnt
suit
you
at
all
he
brought
out
at
last
dropping
his
voice
in
an
awfully
strange
way
almost
to
a
whisper
liza
flushed
crimson
what
jobs
are
you
speaking
of
mavriky
nikolaevitch
she
cried
please
bring
that
letter
here
i
too
followed
mavriky
nikolaevitch
to
the
table
look
at
this
she
turned
suddenly
to
me
unfolding
the
letter
in
great
excitement
have
you
ever
seen
anything
like
it
please
read
it
aloud
i
want
mr
shatov
to
hear
it
too
with
no
little
astonishment
i
read
aloud
the
following
missive
to
the
perfection
miss
tushin
gracious
lady
lizaveta
nikolaevna
oh
shes
a
sweet
queen
lizaveta
tushin
when
on
sidesaddle
she
gallops
by
and
in
the
breeze
her
fair
tresses
fly
or
when
with
her
mother
in
church
she
bows
low
and
on
devout
faces
a
red
flush
doth
flow
then
for
the
joys
of
lawful
wedlock
i
aspire
and
follow
her
and
her
mother
with
tears
of
desire
composed
by
an
unlearned
man
in
the
midst
of
a
discussion
gracious
lady
i
pity
myself
above
all
men
that
i
did
not
lose
my
arm
at
sevastopol
not
having
been
there
at
all
but
served
all
the
campaign
delivering
paltry
provisions
which
i
look
on
as
a
degradation
you
are
a
goddess
of
antiquity
and
i
am
nothing
but
have
had
a
glimpse
of
infinity
look
on
it
as
a
poem
and
no
more
for
after
all
poetry
is
nonsense
and
justifies
what
would
be
considered
impudence
in
prose
can
the
sun
be
angry
with
the
infusoria
if
the
latter
composes
verses
to
her
from
the
drop
of
water
where
there
is
a
multitude
of
them
if
you
look
through
the
microscope
even
the
club
for
promoting
humanity
to
the
larger
animals
in
tiptop
society
in
petersburg
which
rightly
feels
compassion
for
dogs
and
horses
despises
the
brief
infusoria
making
no
reference
to
it
whatever
because
it
is
not
big
enough
im
not
big
enough
either
the
idea
of
marriage
might
seem
droll
but
soon
i
shall
have
property
worth
two
hundred
souls
through
a
misanthropist
whom
you
ought
to
despise
i
can
tell
a
lot
and
i
can
undertake
to
produce
documents
that
would
mean
siberia
dont
despise
my
proposal
a
letter
from
an
infusoria
is
of
course
in
verse
captain
lebyadkin
your
most
humble
friend
and
he
has
time
no
end
that
was
written
by
a
man
in
a
drunken
condition
a
worthless
fellow
i
cried
indignantly
i
know
him
that
letter
i
received
yesterday
liza
began
to
explain
flushing
and
speaking
hurriedly
i
saw
myself
at
once
that
it
came
from
some
foolish
creature
and
i
havent
yet
shown
it
to
maman
for
fear
of
upsetting
her
more
but
if
he
is
going
to
keep
on
like
that
i
dont
know
how
to
act
mavriky
nikolaevitch
wants
to
go
out
and
forbid
him
to
do
it
as
i
have
looked
upon
you
as
a
colleague
she
turned
to
shatov
and
as
you
live
there
i
wanted
to
question
you
so
as
to
judge
what
more
is
to
be
expected
of
him
hes
a
drunkard
and
a
worthless
fellow
shatov
muttered
with
apparent
reluctance
is
he
always
so
stupid
no
hes
not
stupid
at
all
when
hes
not
drunk
i
used
to
know
a
general
who
wrote
verses
exactly
like
that
i
observed
laughing
one
can
see
from
the
letter
that
he
is
clever
enough
for
his
own
purposes
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
had
till
then
been
silent
put
in
unexpectedly
he
lives
with
some
sister
liza
queried
yes
with
his
sister
they
say
he
tyrannises
over
her
is
that
true
shatov
looked
at
liza
again
scowled
and
muttering
what
business
is
it
of
mine
moved
towards
the
door
ah
stay
cried
liza
in
a
flutter
where
are
you
going
we
have
so
much
still
to
talk
over
what
is
there
to
talk
over
ill
let
you
know
tomorrow
why
the
most
important
thing
of
allthe
printingpress
do
believe
me
that
i
am
not
in
jest
that
i
really
want
to
work
in
good
earnest
liza
assured
him
in
growing
agitation
if
we
decide
to
publish
it
where
is
it
to
be
printed
you
know
its
a
most
important
question
for
we
shant
go
to
moscow
for
it
and
the
printingpress
here
is
out
of
the
question
for
such
a
publication
i
made
up
my
mind
long
ago
to
set
up
a
printingpress
of
my
own
in
your
name
perhapsand
i
know
maman
will
allow
it
so
long
as
it
is
in
your
name
how
do
you
know
that
i
could
be
a
printer
shatov
asked
sullenly
why
pyotr
stepanovitch
told
me
of
you
in
switzerland
and
referred
me
to
you
as
one
who
knows
the
business
and
able
to
set
up
a
printingpress
he
even
meant
to
give
me
a
note
to
you
from
himself
but
i
forgot
it
shatovs
face
changed
as
i
recollect
now
he
stood
for
a
few
seconds
longer
then
went
out
of
the
room
liza
was
angry
does
he
always
go
out
like
that
she
asked
turning
to
me
i
was
just
shrugging
my
shoulders
when
shatov
suddenly
came
back
went
straight
up
to
the
table
and
put
down
the
roll
of
papers
he
had
taken
im
not
going
to
be
your
helper
i
havent
the
time
why
why
i
think
you
are
angry
liza
asked
him
in
a
grieved
and
imploring
voice
the
sound
of
her
voice
seemed
to
strike
him
for
some
moments
he
looked
at
her
intently
as
though
trying
to
penetrate
to
her
very
soul
no
matter
he
muttered
softly
i
dont
want
to
and
he
went
away
altogether
liza
was
completely
overwhelmed
quite
disproportionately
in
fact
so
it
seemed
to
me
wonderfully
queer
man
mavriky
nikolaevitch
observed
aloud
iii
he
certainly
was
queer
but
in
all
this
there
was
a
very
great
deal
not
clear
to
me
there
was
something
underlying
it
all
i
simply
did
not
believe
in
this
publication
then
that
stupid
letter
in
which
there
was
an
offer
only
too
barefaced
to
give
information
and
produce
documents
though
they
were
all
silent
about
that
and
talked
of
something
quite
different
finally
that
printingpress
and
shatovs
sudden
exit
just
because
they
spoke
of
a
printingpress
all
this
led
me
to
imagine
that
something
had
happened
before
i
came
in
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
consequently
that
it
was
no
business
of
mine
and
that
i
was
in
the
way
and
indeed
it
was
time
to
take
leave
i
had
stayed
long
enough
for
the
first
call
i
went
up
to
say
goodbye
to
lizaveta
nikolaevna
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
i
was
in
the
room
and
was
still
standing
in
the
same
place
by
the
table
with
her
head
bowed
plunged
in
thought
gazing
fixedly
at
one
spot
on
the
carpet
ah
you
too
are
going
goodbye
she
murmured
in
an
ordinary
friendly
tone
give
my
greetings
to
stepan
trofimovitch
and
persuade
him
to
come
and
see
me
as
soon
as
he
can
mavriky
nikolaevitch
anton
lavrentyevitch
is
going
excuse
mamans
not
being
able
to
come
out
and
say
goodbye
to
you
i
went
out
and
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
when
a
footman
suddenly
overtook
me
at
the
street
door
my
lady
begs
you
to
come
back
the
mistress
or
lizaveta
nikolaevna
the
young
lady
i
found
liza
not
in
the
big
room
where
we
had
been
sitting
but
in
the
receptionroom
next
to
it
the
door
between
it
and
the
drawingroom
where
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
left
alone
was
closed
liza
smiled
to
me
but
was
pale
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
evident
indecision
visibly
struggling
with
herself
but
she
suddenly
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
quickly
to
the
window
i
want
to
see
her
at
once
she
whispered
bending
upon
me
a
burning
passionate
impatient
glance
which
would
not
admit
a
hint
of
opposition
i
must
see
her
with
my
own
eyes
and
i
beg
you
to
help
me
she
was
in
a
perfect
frenzy
andin
despair
who
is
it
you
want
to
see
lizaveta
nikolaevna
i
inquired
in
dismay
that
lebyadkins
sister
that
lame
girl
is
it
true
that
shes
lame
i
was
astounded
i
have
never
seen
her
but
ive
heard
that
shes
lame
i
heard
it
yesterday
i
said
with
hurried
readiness
and
also
in
a
whisper
i
must
see
her
absolutely
could
you
arrange
it
today
i
felt
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
thats
utterly
impossible
and
besides
i
should
not
know
at
all
how
to
set
about
it
i
began
persuading
her
ill
go
to
shatov
if
you
dont
arrange
it
by
tomorrow
ill
go
to
her
by
myself
alone
for
mavriky
nikolaevitch
has
refused
i
rest
all
my
hopes
on
you
and
ive
no
one
else
i
spoke
stupidly
to
shatov
im
sure
that
you
are
perfectly
honest
and
perhaps
ready
to
do
anything
for
me
only
arrange
it
i
felt
a
passionate
desire
to
help
her
in
every
way
this
is
what
ill
do
i
said
after
a
moments
thought
ill
go
myself
today
and
will
see
her
for
sure
for
sure
i
will
manage
so
as
to
see
her
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
only
let
me
confide
in
shatov
tell
him
that
i
do
desire
it
and
that
i
cant
wait
any
longer
but
that
i
wasnt
deceiving
him
just
now
he
went
away
perhaps
because
hes
very
honest
and
he
didnt
like
my
seeming
to
deceive
him
i
wasnt
deceiving
him
i
really
do
want
to
edit
books
and
found
a
printingpress
he
is
honest
very
honest
i
assented
warmly
if
its
not
arranged
by
tomorrow
though
i
shall
go
myself
whatever
happens
and
even
if
every
one
were
to
know
i
cant
be
with
you
before
three
oclock
tomorrow
i
observed
after
a
moments
deliberation
at
three
oclock
then
then
it
was
true
what
i
imagined
yesterday
at
stepan
trofimovitchs
that
youare
rather
devoted
to
me
she
said
with
a
smile
hurriedly
pressing
my
hand
to
say
goodbye
and
hurrying
back
to
the
forsaken
mavriky
nikolaevitch
i
went
out
weighed
down
by
my
promise
and
unable
to
understand
what
had
happened
i
had
seen
a
woman
in
real
despair
not
hesitating
to
compromise
herself
by
confiding
in
a
man
she
hardly
knew
her
womanly
smile
at
a
moment
so
terrible
for
her
and
her
hint
that
she
had
noticed
my
feelings
the
day
before
sent
a
pang
to
my
heart
but
i
felt
sorry
for
her
very
sorrythat
was
all
her
secrets
became
at
once
something
sacred
for
me
and
if
anyone
had
begun
to
reveal
them
to
me
now
i
think
i
should
have
covered
my
ears
and
should
have
refused
to
hear
anything
more
i
only
had
a
presentiment
of
something
yet
i
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
see
how
i
could
do
anything
whats
more
i
did
not
even
yet
understand
exactly
what
i
had
to
arrange
an
interview
but
what
sort
of
an
interview
and
how
could
i
bring
them
together
my
only
hope
was
shatov
though
i
could
be
sure
that
he
wouldnt
help
me
in
any
way
but
all
the
same
i
hurried
to
him
iv
i
did
not
find
him
at
home
till
past
seven
oclock
that
evening
to
my
surprise
he
had
visitors
with
himalexey
nilitch
and
another
gentleman
i
hardly
knew
one
shigalov
the
brother
of
virginskys
wife
this
gentleman
must
i
think
have
been
staying
about
two
months
in
the
town
i
dont
know
where
he
came
from
i
had
only
heard
that
he
had
written
some
sort
of
article
in
a
progressive
petersburg
magazine
virginsky
had
introduced
me
casually
to
him
in
the
street
i
had
never
in
my
life
seen
in
a
mans
face
so
much
despondency
gloom
and
moroseness
he
looked
as
though
he
were
expecting
the
destruction
of
the
world
and
not
at
some
indefinite
time
in
accordance
with
prophecies
which
might
never
be
fulfilled
but
quite
definitely
as
though
it
were
to
be
the
day
after
tomorrow
at
twentyfive
minutes
past
ten
we
hardly
said
a
word
to
one
another
on
that
occasion
but
had
simply
shaken
hands
like
two
conspirators
i
was
most
struck
by
his
ears
which
were
of
unnatural
size
long
broad
and
thick
sticking
out
in
a
peculiar
way
his
gestures
were
slow
and
awkward
if
liputin
had
imagined
that
a
phalanstery
might
be
established
in
our
province
this
gentleman
certainly
knew
the
day
and
the
hour
when
it
would
be
founded
he
made
a
sinister
impression
on
me
i
was
the
more
surprised
at
finding
him
here
as
shatov
was
not
fond
of
visitors
i
could
hear
from
the
stairs
that
they
were
talking
very
loud
all
three
at
once
and
i
fancy
they
were
disputing
but
as
soon
as
i
went
in
they
all
ceased
speaking
they
were
arguing
standing
up
but
now
they
all
suddenly
sat
down
so
that
i
had
to
sit
down
too
there
was
a
stupid
silence
that
was
not
broken
for
fully
three
minutes
though
shigalov
knew
me
he
affected
not
to
know
me
probably
not
from
hostile
feelings
but
for
no
particular
reason
alexey
nilitch
and
i
bowed
to
one
another
in
silence
and
for
some
reason
did
not
shake
hands
shigalov
began
at
last
looking
at
me
sternly
and
frowningly
with
the
most
nave
assurance
that
i
should
immediately
get
up
and
go
away
at
last
shatov
got
up
from
his
chair
and
the
others
jumped
up
at
once
they
went
out
without
saying
goodbye
shigalov
only
said
in
the
doorway
to
shatov
who
was
seeing
him
out
remember
that
you
are
bound
to
give
an
explanation
hang
your
explanation
and
who
the
devil
am
i
bound
to
said
shatov
he
showed
them
out
and
fastened
the
door
with
the
latch
snipes
he
said
looking
at
me
with
a
sort
of
wry
smile
his
face
looked
angry
and
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
he
spoke
first
when
i
had
been
to
see
him
before
which
was
not
often
it
had
usually
happened
that
he
sat
scowling
in
a
corner
answered
illhumouredly
and
only
completely
thawed
and
began
to
talk
with
pleasure
after
a
considerable
time
even
so
when
he
was
saying
goodbye
he
always
scowled
and
let
one
out
as
though
he
were
getting
rid
of
a
personal
enemy
i
had
tea
yesterday
with
that
alexey
nilitch
i
observed
i
think
hes
mad
on
atheism
russian
atheism
has
never
gone
further
than
making
a
joke
growled
shatov
putting
up
a
new
candle
in
place
of
an
end
that
had
burnt
out
no
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
me
a
joker
i
think
he
doesnt
know
how
to
talk
let
alone
trying
to
make
jokes
men
made
of
paper
it
all
comes
from
flunkeyism
of
thought
shatov
observed
calmly
sitting
down
on
a
chair
in
the
corner
and
pressing
the
palms
of
both
hands
on
his
knees
theres
hatred
in
it
too
he
went
on
after
a
minutes
pause
theyd
be
the
first
to
be
terribly
unhappy
if
russia
could
be
suddenly
reformed
even
to
suit
their
own
ideas
and
became
extraordinarily
prosperous
and
happy
theyd
have
no
one
to
hate
then
no
one
to
curse
nothing
to
find
fault
with
there
is
nothing
in
it
but
an
immense
animal
hatred
for
russia
which
has
eaten
into
their
organism
and
it
isnt
a
case
of
tears
unseen
by
the
world
under
cover
of
a
smile
there
has
never
been
a
falser
word
said
in
russia
than
about
those
unseen
tears
he
cried
almost
with
fury
goodness
only
knows
what
youre
saying
i
laughed
oh
youre
a
moderate
liberal
said
shatov
smiling
too
do
you
know
he
went
on
suddenly
i
may
have
been
talking
nonsense
about
the
flunkeyism
of
thought
you
will
say
to
me
no
doubt
directly
its
you
who
are
the
son
of
a
flunkey
but
im
not
a
flunkey
i
wasnt
dreaming
of
such
a
thing
what
are
you
saying
you
need
not
apologise
im
not
afraid
of
you
once
i
was
only
the
son
of
a
flunkey
but
now
ive
become
a
flunkey
myself
like
you
our
russian
liberal
is
a
flunkey
before
everything
and
is
only
looking
for
someone
whose
boots
he
can
clean
what
boots
what
allegory
is
this
allegory
indeed
you
are
laughing
i
see
stepan
trofimovitch
said
truly
that
i
lie
under
a
stone
crushed
but
not
killed
and
do
nothing
but
wriggle
it
was
a
good
comparison
of
his
stepan
trofimovitch
declares
that
you
are
mad
over
the
germans
i
laughed
weve
borrowed
something
from
them
anyway
we
took
twenty
kopecks
but
we
gave
up
a
hundred
roubles
of
our
own
we
were
silent
a
minute
he
got
that
sore
lying
in
america
who
what
sore
i
mean
kirillov
i
spent
four
months
with
him
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
hut
why
have
you
been
in
america
i
asked
surprised
you
never
told
me
about
it
what
is
there
to
tell
the
year
before
last
we
spent
our
last
farthing
three
of
us
going
to
america
in
an
emigrant
steamer
to
test
the
life
of
the
american
workman
on
ourselves
and
to
verify
by
personal
experiment
the
state
of
a
man
in
the
hardest
social
conditions
that
was
our
object
in
going
there
good
lord
i
laughed
youd
much
better
have
gone
somewhere
in
our
province
at
harvesttime
if
you
wanted
to
make
a
personal
experiment
instead
of
bolting
to
america
we
hired
ourselves
out
as
workmen
to
an
exploiter
there
were
six
of
us
russians
working
for
himstudents
even
landowners
coming
from
their
estates
some
officers
too
and
all
with
the
same
grand
object
well
so
we
worked
sweated
wore
ourselves
out
kirillov
and
i
were
exhausted
at
last
fell
illwent
awaywe
couldnt
stand
it
our
employer
cheated
us
when
he
paid
us
off
instead
of
thirty
dollars
as
he
had
agreed
he
paid
me
eight
and
kirillov
fifteen
he
beat
us
too
more
than
once
so
then
we
were
left
without
work
kirillov
and
i
and
we
spent
four
months
lying
on
the
floor
in
that
little
town
he
thought
of
one
thing
and
i
thought
of
another
you
dont
mean
to
say
your
employer
beat
you
in
america
how
you
must
have
sworn
at
him
not
a
bit
of
it
on
the
contrary
kirillov
and
i
made
up
our
minds
from
the
first
that
we
russians
were
like
little
children
beside
the
americans
and
that
one
must
be
born
in
america
or
at
least
live
for
many
years
with
americans
to
be
on
a
level
with
them
and
do
you
know
if
we
were
asked
a
dollar
for
a
thing
worth
a
farthing
we
used
to
pay
it
with
pleasure
in
fact
with
enthusiasm
we
approved
of
everything
spiritualism
lynchlaw
revolvers
tramps
once
when
we
were
travelling
a
fellow
slipped
his
hand
into
my
pocket
took
my
brush
and
began
brushing
his
hair
with
it
kirillov
and
i
only
looked
at
one
another
and
made
up
our
minds
that
that
was
the
right
thing
and
that
we
liked
it
very
much
the
strange
thing
is
that
with
us
all
this
is
not
only
in
the
brain
but
is
carried
out
in
practice
i
observed
men
made
of
paper
shatov
repeated
but
to
cross
the
ocean
in
an
emigrant
steamer
though
to
go
to
an
unknown
country
even
to
make
a
personal
experiment
and
all
thatby
jove
there
really
is
a
largehearted
staunchness
about
it
but
how
did
you
get
out
of
it
i
wrote
to
a
man
in
europe
and
he
sent
me
a
hundred
roubles
as
shatov
talked
he
looked
doggedly
at
the
ground
as
he
always
did
even
when
he
was
excited
at
this
point
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
do
you
want
to
know
the
mans
name
who
was
it
nikolay
stavrogin
he
got
up
suddenly
turned
to
his
limewood
writingtable
and
began
searching
for
something
on
it
there
was
a
vague
though
wellauthenticated
rumour
among
us
that
shatovs
wife
had
at
one
time
had
a
liaison
with
nikolay
stavrogin
in
paris
and
just
about
two
years
ago
that
is
when
shatov
was
in
america
it
is
true
that
this
was
long
after
his
wife
had
left
him
in
geneva
if
so
what
possesses
him
now
to
bring
his
name
forward
and
to
lay
stress
on
it
i
thought
i
havent
paid
him
back
yet
he
said
turning
suddenly
to
me
again
and
looking
at
me
intently
he
sat
down
in
the
same
place
as
before
in
the
corner
and
asked
abruptly
in
quite
a
different
voice
you
have
come
no
doubt
with
some
object
what
do
you
want
i
told
him
everything
immediately
in
its
exact
historical
order
and
added
that
though
i
had
time
to
think
it
over
coolly
after
the
first
excitement
was
over
i
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
i
saw
that
it
meant
something
very
important
to
lizaveta
nikolaevna
i
was
extremely
anxious
to
help
her
but
the
trouble
was
that
i
didnt
know
how
to
keep
the
promise
i
had
made
her
and
didnt
even
quite
understand
now
what
i
had
promised
her
then
i
assured
him
impressively
once
more
that
she
had
not
meant
to
deceive
him
and
had
had
no
thought
of
doing
so
that
there
had
been
some
misunderstanding
and
that
she
had
been
very
much
hurt
by
the
extraordinary
way
in
which
he
had
gone
off
that
morning
he
listened
very
attentively
perhaps
i
was
stupid
this
morning
as
i
usually
am
well
if
she
didnt
understand
why
i
went
away
like
that
so
much
the
better
for
her
he
got
up
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
began
listening
on
the
stairs
do
you
want
to
see
that
person
yourself
thats
just
what
i
wanted
but
how
is
it
to
be
done
i
cried
delighted
lets
simply
go
down
while
shes
alone
when
he
comes
in
hell
beat
her
horribly
if
he
finds
out
weve
been
there
i
often
go
in
on
the
sly
i
went
for
him
this
morning
when
he
began
beating
her
again
what
do
you
mean
i
dragged
him
off
her
by
the
hair
he
tried
to
beat
me
but
i
frightened
him
and
so
it
ended
im
afraid
hell
come
back
drunk
and
wont
forget
ithell
give
her
a
bad
beating
because
of
it
we
went
downstairs
at
once
the
lebyadkins
door
was
shut
but
not
locked
and
we
were
able
to
go
in
their
lodging
consisted
of
two
nasty
little
rooms
with
smokebegrimed
walls
on
which
the
filthy
wallpaper
literally
hung
in
tatters
it
had
been
used
for
some
years
as
an
eatinghouse
until
filipov
the
tavernkeeper
moved
to
another
house
the
other
rooms
below
what
had
been
the
eatinghouse
were
now
shut
up
and
these
two
were
all
the
lebyadkins
had
the
furniture
consisted
of
plain
benches
and
deal
tables
except
for
an
old
armchair
that
had
lost
its
arms
in
the
second
room
there
was
the
bedstead
that
belonged
to
mlle
lebyadkin
standing
in
the
corner
covered
with
a
chintz
quilt
the
captain
himself
went
to
bed
anywhere
on
the
floor
often
without
undressing
everything
was
in
disorder
wet
and
filthy
a
huge
soaking
rag
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
the
first
room
and
a
battered
old
shoe
lay
beside
it
in
the
wet
it
was
evident
that
no
one
looked
after
anything
here
the
stove
was
not
heated
food
was
not
cooked
they
had
not
even
a
samovar
as
shatov
told
me
the
captain
had
come
to
the
town
with
his
sister
utterly
destitute
and
had
as
liputin
said
at
first
actually
gone
from
house
to
house
begging
but
having
unexpectedly
received
some
money
he
had
taken
to
drinking
at
once
and
had
become
so
besotted
that
he
was
incapable
of
looking
after
things
mlle
lebyadkin
whom
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
was
sitting
quietly
at
a
deal
kitchen
table
on
a
bench
in
the
corner
of
the
inner
room
not
making
a
sound
when
we
opened
the
door
she
did
not
call
out
to
us
or
even
move
from
her
place
shatov
said
that
the
door
into
the
passage
would
not
lock
and
it
had
once
stood
wide
open
all
night
by
the
dim
light
of
a
thin
candle
in
an
iron
candlestick
i
made
out
a
woman
of
about
thirty
perhaps
sickly
and
emaciated
wearing
an
old
dress
of
dark
cotton
material
with
her
long
neck
uncovered
her
scanty
dark
hair
twisted
into
a
knot
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
no
larger
than
the
fist
of
a
twoyearold
child
she
looked
at
us
rather
cheerfully
besides
the
candlestick
she
had
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
a
little
peasant
lookingglass
an
old
pack
of
cards
a
tattered
book
of
songs
and
a
white
roll
of
german
bread
from
which
one
or
two
bites
had
been
taken
it
was
noticeable
that
mlle
lebyadkin
used
powder
and
rouge
and
painted
her
lips
she
also
blackened
her
eyebrows
which
were
fine
long
and
black
enough
without
that
three
long
wrinkles
stood
sharply
conspicuous
across
her
high
narrow
forehead
in
spite
of
the
powder
on
it
i
already
knew
that
she
was
lame
but
on
this
occasion
she
did
not
attempt
to
get
up
or
walk
at
some
time
perhaps
in
early
youth
that
wasted
face
may
have
been
pretty
but
her
soft
gentle
grey
eyes
were
remarkable
even
now
there
was
something
dreamy
and
sincere
in
her
gentle
almost
joyful
expression
this
gentle
serene
joy
which
was
reflected
also
in
her
smile
astonished
me
after
all
i
had
heard
of
the
cossack
whip
and
her
brothers
violence
strange
to
say
instead
of
the
oppressive
repulsion
and
almost
dread
one
usually
feels
in
the
presence
of
these
creatures
afflicted
by
god
i
felt
it
almost
pleasant
to
look
at
her
from
the
first
moment
and
my
heart
was
filled
afterwards
with
pity
in
which
there
was
no
trace
of
aversion
this
is
how
she
sits
literally
for
days
together
utterly
alone
without
moving
she
tries
her
fortune
with
the
cards
or
looks
in
the
lookingglass
said
shatov
pointing
her
out
to
me
from
the
doorway
he
doesnt
feed
her
you
know
the
old
woman
in
the
lodge
brings
her
something
sometimes
out
of
charity
how
can
they
leave
her
all
alone
like
this
with
a
candle
to
my
surprise
shatov
spoke
aloud
just
as
though
she
were
not
in
the
room
good
day
shatushka
mlle
lebyadkin
said
genially
ive
brought
you
a
visitor
marya
timofyevna
said
shatov
the
visitor
is
very
welcome
i
dont
know
who
it
is
youve
brought
i
dont
seem
to
remember
him
she
scrutinised
me
intently
from
behind
the
candle
and
turned
again
at
once
to
shatov
and
she
took
no
more
notice
of
me
for
the
rest
of
the
conversation
as
though
i
had
not
been
near
her
are
you
tired
of
walking
up
and
down
alone
in
your
garret
she
laughed
displaying
two
rows
of
magnificent
teeth
i
was
tired
of
it
and
i
wanted
to
come
and
see
you
shatov
moved
a
bench
up
to
the
table
sat
down
on
it
and
made
me
sit
beside
him
im
always
glad
to
have
a
talk
though
youre
a
funny
person
shatushka
just
like
a
monk
when
did
you
comb
your
hair
last
let
me
do
it
for
you
and
she
pulled
a
little
comb
out
of
her
pocket
i
dont
believe
youve
touched
it
since
i
combed
it
last
well
i
havent
got
a
comb
said
shatov
laughing
too
really
then
ill
give
you
mine
only
remind
me
not
this
one
but
another
with
a
most
serious
expression
she
set
to
work
to
comb
his
hair
she
even
parted
it
on
one
side
drew
back
a
little
looked
to
see
whether
it
was
right
and
put
the
comb
back
in
her
pocket
do
you
know
what
shatushka
she
shook
her
head
you
may
be
a
very
sensible
man
but
youre
dull
its
strange
for
me
to
look
at
all
of
you
i
dont
understand
how
it
is
people
are
dull
sadness
is
not
dullness
im
happy
and
are
you
happy
when
your
brothers
here
you
mean
lebyadkin
hes
my
footman
and
i
dont
care
whether
hes
here
or
not
i
call
to
him
lebyadkin
bring
the
water
or
lebyadkin
bring
my
shoes
and
he
runs
sometimes
one
does
wrong
and
cant
help
laughing
at
him
thats
just
how
it
is
said
shatov
addressing
me
aloud
without
ceremony
she
treats
him
just
like
a
footman
ive
heard
her
myself
calling
to
him
lebyadkin
give
me
some
water
and
she
laughed
as
she
said
it
the
only
difference
is
that
he
doesnt
fetch
the
water
but
beats
her
for
it
but
she
isnt
a
bit
afraid
of
him
she
has
some
sort
of
nervous
fits
almost
every
day
and
they
are
destroying
her
memory
so
that
afterwards
she
forgets
everything
thats
just
happened
and
is
always
in
a
muddle
over
time
you
imagine
she
remembers
how
you
came
in
perhaps
she
does
remember
but
no
doubt
she
has
changed
everything
to
please
herself
and
she
takes
us
now
for
different
people
from
what
we
are
though
she
knows
im
shatushka
it
doesnt
matter
my
speaking
aloud
she
soon
leaves
off
listening
to
people
who
talk
to
her
and
plunges
into
dreams
yes
plunges
shes
an
extraordinary
person
for
dreaming
shell
sit
for
eight
hours
for
whole
days
together
in
the
same
place
you
see
theres
a
roll
lying
there
perhaps
shes
only
taken
one
bite
at
it
since
the
morning
and
shell
finish
it
tomorrow
now
shes
begun
trying
her
fortune
on
cards
i
keep
trying
my
fortune
shatushka
but
it
doesnt
come
out
right
marya
timofyevna
put
in
suddenly
catching
the
last
word
and
without
looking
at
it
she
put
out
her
left
hand
for
the
roll
she
had
heard
something
about
the
roll
too
very
likely
she
got
hold
of
the
roll
at
last
and
after
keeping
it
for
some
time
in
her
left
hand
while
her
attention
was
distracted
by
the
conversation
which
sprang
up
again
she
put
it
back
again
on
the
table
unconsciously
without
having
taken
a
bite
of
it
it
always
comes
out
the
same
a
journey
a
wicked
man
somebodys
treachery
a
deathbed
a
letter
unexpected
news
i
think
its
all
nonsense
shatushka
what
do
you
think
if
people
can
tell
lies
why
shouldnt
a
card
she
suddenly
threw
the
cards
together
again
i
said
the
same
thing
to
mother
praskovya
shes
a
very
venerable
woman
she
used
to
run
to
my
cell
to
tell
her
fortune
on
the
cards
without
letting
the
mother
superior
know
yes
and
she
wasnt
the
only
one
who
came
to
me
they
sigh
and
shake
their
heads
at
me
they
talk
it
over
while
i
laugh
where
are
you
going
to
get
a
letter
from
mother
praskovya
i
say
when
you
havent
had
one
for
twelve
years
her
daughter
had
been
taken
away
to
turkey
by
her
husband
and
for
twelve
years
there
had
been
no
sight
nor
sound
of
her
only
i
was
sitting
the
next
evening
at
tea
with
the
mother
superior
she
was
a
princess
by
birth
there
was
some
lady
there
too
a
visitor
a
great
dreamer
and
a
little
monk
from
athos
was
sitting
there
too
a
rather
absurd
man
to
my
thinking
what
do
you
think
shatushka
that
monk
from
athos
had
brought
mother
praskovya
a
letter
from
her
daughter
in
turkey
that
morningso
much
for
the
knave
of
diamondsunexpected
news
we
were
drinking
our
tea
and
the
monk
from
athos
said
to
the
mother
superior
blessed
mother
superior
god
has
blessed
your
convent
above
all
things
in
that
you
preserve
so
great
a
treasure
in
its
precincts
said
he
what
treasure
is
that
asked
the
mother
superior
the
mother
lizaveta
the
blessed
this
lizaveta
the
blessed
was
enshrined
in
the
nunnery
wall
in
a
cage
seven
feet
long
and
five
feet
high
and
she
had
been
sitting
there
for
seventeen
years
in
nothing
but
a
hempen
shift
summer
and
winter
and
she
always
kept
pecking
at
the
hempen
cloth
with
a
straw
or
a
twig
of
some
sort
and
she
never
said
a
word
and
never
combed
her
hair
or
washed
for
seventeen
years
in
the
winter
they
used
to
put
a
sheepskin
in
for
her
and
every
day
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
water
the
pilgrims
gaze
at
her
sigh
and
exclaim
and
make
offerings
of
money
a
treasure
youve
pitched
on
answered
the
mother
superiorshe
was
angry
she
disliked
lizaveta
dreadfullylizaveta
only
sits
there
out
of
spite
out
of
pure
obstinacy
it
is
nothing
but
hypocrisy
i
didnt
like
this
i
was
thinking
at
the
time
of
shutting
myself
up
too
i
think
said
i
that
god
and
nature
are
just
the
same
thing
they
all
cried
out
with
one
voice
at
me
well
now
the
mother
superior
laughed
whispered
something
to
the
lady
and
called
me
up
petted
me
and
the
lady
gave
me
a
pink
ribbon
would
you
like
me
to
show
it
to
you
and
the
monk
began
to
admonish
me
but
he
talked
so
kindly
so
humbly
and
so
wisely
i
suppose
i
sat
and
listened
do
you
understand
he
asked
no
i
said
i
dont
understand
a
word
but
leave
me
quite
alone
ever
since
then
theyve
left
me
in
peace
shatushka
and
at
that
time
an
old
woman
who
was
living
in
the
convent
doing
penance
for
prophesying
the
future
whispered
to
me
as
she
was
coming
out
of
church
what
is
the
mother
of
god
what
do
you
think
the
great
mother
i
answer
the
hope
of
the
human
race
yes
she
answered
the
mother
of
god
is
the
great
motherthe
damp
earth
and
therein
lies
great
joy
for
men
and
every
earthly
woe
and
every
earthly
tear
is
a
joy
for
us
and
when
you
water
the
earth
with
your
tears
a
foot
deep
you
will
rejoice
at
everything
at
once
and
your
sorrow
will
be
no
more
such
is
the
prophecy
that
word
sank
into
my
heart
at
the
time
since
then
when
i
bow
down
to
the
ground
at
my
prayers
ive
taken
to
kissing
the
earth
i
kiss
it
and
weep
and
let
me
tell
you
shatushka
theres
no
harm
in
those
tears
and
even
if
one
has
no
grief
ones
tears
flow
from
joy
the
tears
flow
of
themselves
thats
the
truth
i
used
to
go
out
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
on
one
side
was
our
convent
and
on
the
other
the
pointed
mountain
they
called
it
the
peak
i
used
to
go
up
that
mountain
facing
the
east
fall
down
to
the
ground
and
weep
and
weep
and
i
dont
know
how
long
i
wept
and
i
dont
remember
or
know
anything
about
it
i
would
get
up
and
turn
back
when
the
sun
was
setting
it
was
so
big
and
splendid
and
gloriousdo
you
like
looking
at
the
sun
shatushka
its
beautiful
but
sad
i
would
turn
to
the
east
again
and
the
shadow
the
shadow
of
our
mountain
was
flying
like
an
arrow
over
our
lake
long
long
and
narrow
stretching
a
mile
beyond
right
up
to
the
island
on
the
lake
and
cutting
that
rocky
island
right
in
two
and
as
it
cut
it
in
two
the
sun
would
set
altogether
and
suddenly
all
would
be
darkness
and
then
i
used
to
be
quite
miserable
suddenly
i
used
to
remember
im
afraid
of
the
dark
shatushka
and
what
i
wept
for
most
was
my
baby
why
had
you
one
and
shatov
who
had
been
listening
attentively
all
the
time
nudged
me
with
his
elbow
why
of
course
a
little
rosy
baby
with
tiny
little
nails
and
my
only
grief
is
i
cant
remember
whether
it
was
a
boy
or
a
girl
sometimes
i
remember
it
was
a
boy
and
sometimes
it
was
a
girl
and
when
he
was
born
i
wrapped
him
in
cambric
and
lace
and
put
pink
ribbons
on
him
strewed
him
with
flowers
got
him
ready
said
prayers
over
him
i
took
him
away
unchristened
and
carried
him
through
the
forest
and
i
was
afraid
of
the
forest
and
i
was
frightened
and
what
i
weep
for
most
is
that
i
had
a
baby
and
i
never
had
a
husband
perhaps
you
had
one
shatov
queried
cautiously
youre
absurd
shatushka
with
your
reflections
i
had
perhaps
i
had
but
whats
the
use
of
my
having
had
one
if
its
just
the
same
as
though
i
hadnt
theres
an
easy
riddle
for
you
guess
it
she
laughed
where
did
you
take
your
baby
i
took
it
to
the
pond
she
said
with
a
sigh
shatov
nudged
me
again
and
what
if
you
never
had
a
baby
and
all
this
is
only
a
wild
dream
you
ask
me
a
hard
question
shatushka
she
answered
dreamily
without
a
trace
of
surprise
at
such
a
question
i
cant
tell
you
anything
about
that
perhaps
i
hadnt
i
think
thats
only
your
curiosity
i
shant
leave
off
crying
for
him
anyway
i
couldnt
have
dreamt
it
and
big
tears
glittered
in
her
eyes
shatushka
shatushka
is
it
true
that
your
wife
ran
away
from
you
she
suddenly
put
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
him
pityingly
dont
be
angry
i
feel
sick
myself
do
you
know
shatushka
ive
had
a
dream
he
came
to
me
again
he
beckoned
me
called
me
my
little
puss
he
cried
to
me
little
puss
come
to
me
and
i
was
more
delighted
at
that
little
puss
than
anything
he
loves
me
i
thought
perhaps
he
will
come
in
reality
shatov
muttered
in
an
undertone
no
shatushka
thats
a
dream
he
cant
come
in
reality
you
know
the
song
a
new
fine
house
i
do
not
crave
this
tiny
cells
enough
for
me
there
will
i
dwell
my
soul
to
save
and
ever
pray
to
god
for
thee
ach
shatushka
shatushka
my
dear
why
do
you
never
ask
me
about

why
you
wont
tell
thats
why
i
dont
ask
i
wont
tell

she
answered
quickly

wont
tell

may
burn
me
i
wont
tell
and

find
out
there
you
see
every
one
has
something
of
their
own
shatov
said
still
more
softly
his
head
drooping
lower
and
lower
but
if
you
were
to
ask
perhaps
i
should
tell
perhaps
i
should
she
repeated
ecstatically
why
dont
you
ask
ask
ask
me
nicely
shatushka
perhaps
i
shall
tell
you
entreat
me
shatushka
so
that
i
shall
consent
of
myself
shatushka
shatushka
but
shatushka
was
silent
there
was
complete
silence
lasting
a
minute
tears
slowly
trickled
down
her
painted
cheeks
she
sat
forgetting
her
two
hands
on
shatovs
shoulders
but
no
longer
looking
at
him
ach
what
is
it
to
do
with
me
and
its
a
sin
shatov
suddenly
got
up
from
the
bench
get
up
he
angrily
pulled
the
bench
from
under
me
and
put
it
back
where
it
stood
before
hell
be
coming

we
must
mind
he

guess
its
time

shouted

silence

minute
scououndrel
came
from

of

listened

while
and

answered
in
a
weary
and
disgusted
voice
and
he
sat
down
to
his
writingtable
i
went
away
an
improbable
idea
was
growing
stronger
and
stronger
in
my
mind
i
thought
of
the
next
day
with
distress
vii
this
next
day
the
very
sunday
which
was
to
decide
stepan
trofimovitchs
fate
irrevocably
was
one
of
the
most
memorable
days
in
my
chronicle
it
was
a
day
of
surprises
a
day
that
solved
past
riddles
and
suggested
new
ones
a
day
of
startling
revelations
and
still
more
hopeless
perplexity
in
the
morning
as
the
reader
is
already
aware
i
had
by
varvara
petrovnas
particular
request
to
accompany
my
friend
on
his
visit
to
her
and
at
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
i
had
to
be
with
lizaveta
nikolaevna
in
order
to
tell
heri
did
not
know
whatand
to
assist
heri
did
not
know
how
and
meanwhile
it
all
ended
as
no
one
could
have
expected
in
a
word
it
was
a
day
of
wonderful
coincidences
to
begin
with
when
stepan
trofimovitch
and
i
arrived
at
varvara
petrovnas
at
twelve
oclock
punctually
the
time
she
had
fixed
we
did
not
find
her
at
home
she
had
not
yet
come
back
from
church
my
poor
friend
was
so
disposed
or
more
accurately
speaking
so
indisposed
that
this
circumstance
crushed
him
at
once
he
sank
almost
helpless
into
an
armchair
in
the
drawingroom
i
suggested
a
glass
of
water
but
in
spite
of
his
pallor
and
the
trembling
of
his
hands
he
refused
it
with
dignity
his
getup
for
the
occasion
was
by
the
way
extremely
recherch
a
shirt
of
batiste
and
embroidered
almost
fit
for
a
ball
a
white
tie
a
new
hat
in
his
hand
new
strawcoloured
gloves
and
even
a
suspicion
of
scent
we
had
hardly
sat
down
when
shatov
was
shown
in
by
the
butler
obviously
also
by
official
invitation
stepan
trofimovitch
was
rising
to
shake
hands
with
him
but
shatov
after
looking
attentively
at
us
both
turned
away
into
a
corner
and
sat
down
there
without
even
nodding
to
us
stepan
trofimovitch
looked
at
me
in
dismay
again
we
sat
like
this
for
some
minutes
longer
in
complete
silence
stepan
trofimovitch
suddenly
began
whispering
something
to
me
very
quickly
but
i
could
not
catch
it
and
indeed
he
was
so
agitated
himself
that
he
broke
off
without
finishing
the
butler
came
in
once
more
ostensibly
to
set
something
straight
on
the
table
more
probably
to
take
a
look
at
us
shatov
suddenly
addressed
him
with
a
loud
question
alexey
yegorytch
do
you
know
whether
darya
pavlovna
has
gone
with
her
varvara
petrovna
was
pleased
to
drive
to
the
cathedral
alone
and
darya
pavlovna
was
pleased
to
remain
in
her
room
upstairs
being
indisposed
alexey
yegorytch
announced
formally
and
reprovingly
my
poor
friend
again
stole
a
hurried
and
agitated
glance
at
me
so
that
at
last
i
turned
away
from
him
suddenly
a
carriage
rumbled
at
the
entrance
and
some
commotion
at
a
distance
in
the
house
made
us
aware
of
the
ladys
return
we
all
leapt
up
from
our
easy
chairs
but
again
a
surprise
awaited
us
we
heard
the
noise
of
many
footsteps
so
our
hostess
must
have
returned
not
alone
and
this
certainly
was
rather
strange
since
she
had
fixed
that
time
herself
finally
we
heard
some
one
come
in
with
strange
rapidity
as
though
running
in
a
way
that
varvara
petrovna
could
not
have
come
in
and
all
at
once
she
almost
flew
into
the
room
panting
and
extremely
agitated
after
her
a
little
later
and
much
more
quickly
lizaveta
nikolaevna
came
in
and
with
her
hand
in
hand
marya
timofyevna
lebyadkin
if
i
had
seen
this
in
my
dreams
even
then
i
should
not
have
believed
it
to
explain
their
utterly
unexpected
appearance
i
must
go
back
an
hour
and
describe
more
in
detail
an
extraordinary
adventure
which
had
befallen
varvara
petrovna
in
church
in
the
first
place
almost
the
whole
town
that
is
of
course
all
of
the
upper
stratum
of
society
were
assembled
in
the
cathedral
it
was
known
that
the
governors
wife
was
to
make
her
appearance
there
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
amongst
us
i
must
mention
that
there
were
already
rumours
that
she
was
a
freethinker
and
a
follower
of
the
new
principles
all
the
ladies
were
also
aware
that
she
would
be
dressed
with
magnificence
and
extraordinary
elegance
and
so
the
costumes
of
our
ladies
were
elaborate
and
gorgeous
for
the
occasion
only
varvara
petrovna
was
modestly
dressed
in
black
as
she
always
was
and
had
been
for
the
last
four
years
she
had
taken
her
usual
place
in
church
in
the
first
row
on
the
left
and
a
footman
in
livery
had
put
down
a
velvet
cushion
for
her
to
kneel
on
everything
in
fact
had
been
as
usual
but
it
was
noticed
too
that
all
through
the
service
she
prayed
with
extreme
fervour
it
was
even
asserted
afterwards
when
people
recalled
it
that
she
had
had
tears
in
her
eyes
the
service
was
over
at
last
and
our
chief
priest
father
pavel
came
out
to
deliver
a
solemn
sermon
we
liked
his
sermons
and
thought
very
highly
of
them
we
used
even
to
try
to
persuade
him
to
print
them
but
he
never
could
make
up
his
mind
to
on
this
occasion
the
sermon
was
a
particularly
long
one
and
behold
during
the
sermon
a
lady
drove
up
to
the
church
in
an
old
fashioned
hired
droshky
that
is
one
in
which
the
lady
could
only
sit
sideways
holding
on
to
the
drivers
sash
shaking
at
every
jolt
like
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
breeze
such
droshkys
are
still
to
be
seen
in
our
town
stopping
at
the
corner
of
the
cathedralfor
there
were
a
number
of
carriages
and
mounted
police
too
at
the
gatesthe
lady
sprang
out
of
the
droshky
and
handed
the
driver
four
kopecks
in
silver
isnt
it
enough
vanya
she
cried
seeing
his
grimace
its
all
ive
got
she
added
plaintively
well
there
bless
you
i
took
you
without
fixing
the
price
said
the
driver
with
a
hopeless
gesture
and
looking
at
her
he
added
as
though
reflecting
and
it
would
be
a
sin
to
take
advantage
of
you
too
then
thrusting
his
leather
purse
into
his
bosom
he
touched
up
his
horse
and
drove
off
followed
by
the
jeers
of
the
drivers
standing
near
jeers
and
wonder
too
followed
the
lady
as
she
made
her
way
to
the
cathedral
gates
between
the
carriages
and
the
footmen
waiting
for
their
masters
to
come
out
and
indeed
there
certainly
was
something
extraordinary
and
surprising
to
every
one
in
such
a
persons
suddenly
appearing
in
the
street
among
people
she
was
painfully
thin
and
she
limped
she
was
heavily
powdered
and
rouged
her
long
neck
was
quite
bare
she
had
neither
kerchief
nor
pelisse
she
had
nothing
on
but
an
old
dark
dress
in
spite
of
the
cold
and
windy
though
bright
september
day
she
was
bareheaded
and
her
hair
was
twisted
up
into
a
tiny
knot
and
on
the
right
side
of
it
was
stuck
an
artificial
rose
such
as
are
used
to
dedicate
cherubs
sold
in
palm
week
i
had
noticed
just
such
a
one
with
a
wreath
of
paper
roses
in
a
corner
under
the
ikons
when
i
was
at
marya
timofyevnas
the
day
before
to
put
a
finishingtouch
to
it
though
the
lady
walked
with
modestly
downcast
eyes
there
was
a
sly
and
merry
smile
on
her
face
if
she
had
lingered
a
moment
longer
she
would
perhaps
not
have
been
allowed
to
enter
the
cathedral
but
she
succeeded
in
slipping
by
and
entering
the
building
gradually
pressed
forward
though
it
was
halfway
through
the
sermon
and
the
dense
crowd
that
filled
the
cathedral
was
listening
to
it
with
absorbed
and
silent
attention
yet
several
pairs
of
eyes
glanced
with
curiosity
and
amazement
at
the
newcomer
she
sank
on
to
the
floor
bowed
her
painted
face
down
to
it
lay
there
a
long
time
unmistakably
weeping
but
raising
her
head
again
and
getting
up
from
her
knees
she
soon
recovered
and
was
diverted
gaily
and
with
evident
and
intense
enjoyment
she
let
her
eyes
rove
over
the
faces
and
over
the
walls
of
the
cathedral
she
looked
with
particular
curiosity
at
some
of
the
ladies
even
standing
on
tiptoe
to
look
at
them
and
even
laughed
once
or
twice
giggling
strangely
but
the
sermon
was
over
and
they
brought
out
the
cross
the
governors
wife
was
the
first
to
go
up
to
the
cross
but
she
stopped
short
two
steps
from
it
evidently
wishing
to
make
way
for
varvara
petrovna
who
on
her
side
moved
towards
it
quite
directly
as
though
she
noticed
no
one
in
front
of
her
there
was
an
obvious
and
in
its
way
clever
malice
implied
in
this
extraordinary
act
of
deference
on
the
part
of
the
governors
wife
every
one
felt
this
varvara
petrovna
must
have
felt
it
too
but
she
went
on
as
before
apparently
noticing
no
one
and
with
the
same
unfaltering
air
of
dignity
kissed
the
cross
and
at
once
turned
to
leave
the
cathedral
a
footman
in
livery
cleared
the
way
for
her
though
every
one
stepped
back
spontaneously
to
let
her
pass
but
just
as
she
was
going
out
in
the
porch
the
closely
packed
mass
of
people
blocked
the
way
for
a
moment
varvara
petrovna
stood
still
and
suddenly
a
strange
extraordinary
creature
the
woman
with
the
paper
rose
on
her
head
squeezed
through
the
people
and
fell
on
her
knees
before
her
varvara
petrovna
who
was
not
easily
disconcerted
especially
in
public
looked
at
her
sternly
and
with
dignity
i
hasten
to
observe
here
as
briefly
as
possible
that
though
varvara
petrovna
had
become
it
was
said
excessively
careful
and
even
stingy
yet
sometimes
she
was
not
sparing
of
money
especially
for
benevolent
objects
she
was
a
member
of
a
charitable
society
in
the
capital
in
the
last
famine
year
she
had
sent
five
hundred
roubles
to
the
chief
committee
for
the
relief
of
the
sufferers
and
people
talked
of
it
in
the
town
moreover
just
before
the
appointment
of
the
new
governor
she
had
been
on
the
very
point
of
founding
a
local
committee
of
ladies
to
assist
the
poorest
mothers
in
the
town
and
in
the
province
she
was
severely
censured
among
us
for
ambition
but
varvara
petrovnas
wellknown
strenuousness
and
at
the
same
time
her
persistence
nearly
triumphed
over
all
obstacles
the
society
was
almost
formed
and
the
original
idea
embraced
a
wider
and
wider
scope
in
the
enthusiastic
mind
of
the
foundress
she
was
already
dreaming
of
founding
a
similar
society
in
moscow
and
the
gradual
expansion
of
its
influence
over
all
the
provinces
of
russia
and
now
with
the
sudden
change
of
governor
everything
was
at
a
standstill
and
the
new
governors
wife
had
it
was
said
already
uttered
in
society
some
biting
and
what
was
worse
apt
and
sensible
remarks
about
the
impracticability
of
the
fundamental
idea
of
such
a
committee
which
was
with
additions
of
course
repeated
to
varvara
petrovna
god
alone
knows
the
secrets
of
mens
hearts
but
i
imagine
that
varvara
petrovna
stood
still
now
at
the
very
cathedral
gates
positively
with
a
certain
pleasure
knowing
that
the
governors
wife
and
after
her
all
the
congregation
would
have
to
pass
by
immediately
and
let
her
see
for
herself
how
little
i
care
what
she
thinks
and
what
pointed
things
she
says
about
the
vanity
of
my
benevolence
so
much
for
all
of
you
what
is
it
my
dear
what
are
you
asking
said
varvara
petrovna
looking
more
attentively
at
the
kneeling
woman
before
her
who
gazed
at
her
with
a
fearfully
panicstricken
shamefaced
but
almost
reverent
expression
and
suddenly
broke
into
the
same
strange
giggle
what
does
she
want
who
is
she
varvara
petrovna
bent
an
imperious
and
inquiring
gaze
on
all
around
her
every
one
was
silent
you
are
unhappy
you
are
in
need
of
help
i
am
in
need
i
have
come

the
unhappy
creature
in
a
voice
broken
with
emotion
i
have
come
only
to
kiss
your
hand
again
she
giggled
with
the
childish
look
with
which
little
children
caress
someone
begging
for
a
favour
she
stretched
forward
to
seize
varvara
petrovnas
hand
but
as
though
panicstricken
drew
her
hands
back
is
that
all
you
have
come
for
said
varvara
petrovna
with
a
compassionate
smile
but
at
once
she
drew
her
motherofpearl
purse
out
of
her
pocket
took
out
a
tenrouble
note
and
gave
it
to
the
unknown
the
latter
took
it
varvara
petrovna
was
much
interested
and
evidently
did
not
look
upon
her
as
an
ordinary
lowclass
beggar
i
say
she
gave
her
ten
roubles
someone
said
in
the
crowd
let
me
kiss
your
hand
faltered
the
unknown
holding
tight
in
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
the
corner
of
the
tenrouble
note
which
fluttered
in
the
draught
varvara
petrovna
frowned
slightly
and
with
a
serious
almost
severe
face
held
out
her
hand
the
cripple
kissed
it
with
reverence
her
grateful
eyes
shone
with
positive
ecstasy
at
that
moment
the
governors
wife
came
up
and
a
whole
crowd
of
ladies
and
high
officials
flocked
after
her
the
governors
wife
was
forced
to
stand
still
for
a
moment
in
the
crush
many
people
stopped
you
are
trembling
are
you
cold
varvara
petrovna
observed
suddenly
and
flinging
off
her
pelisse
which
a
footman
caught
in
midair
she
took
from
her
own
shoulders
a
very
expensive
black
shawl
and
with
her
own
hands
wrapped
it
round
the
bare
neck
of
the
still
kneeling
woman
but
get
up
get
up
from
your
knees
i
beg
you
the
woman
got
up
where
do
you
live
is
it
possible
no
one
knows
where
she
lives
varvara
petrovna
glanced
round
impatiently
again
but
the
crowd
was
different
now
she
saw
only
the
faces
of
acquaintances
people
in
society
surveying
the
scene
some
with
severe
astonishment
others
with
sly
curiosity
and
at
the
same
time
guileless
eagerness
for
a
sensation
while
others
positively
laughed
i
believe
her
names
lebyadkin
a
goodnatured
person
volunteered
at
last
in
answer
to
varvara
petrovna

our
respectable
and
respected

a
man
in
spectacles
with
a

dress
and
holding
a
high
round
hat
in
his

himself
a

a
man
it
must
be
said
not
over
careful
in
his
behaviour
and
no
doubt
this
is
his
sister
she
must
have
escaped
from
under
control
nikon
semyonitch
went
on
dropping
his
voice
and
glancing
significantly
at
varvara
petrovna

the
voice
of
lizaveta
nikolaevna
cried
suddenly
i
must
observe
that
lizaveta
nikolaevna
had
come
to
the
cathedral
with
the
governors
wife
while
praskovya

by

for
a
drive
in
her
carriage
taking
mavriky
nikolaevitch
to

up

ill
run
after
your
carriage
screaming
she
whispered
rapidly
and
despairingly
in
varvara
petrovnas
ear
it
was
lucky
that
no
one
heard
varvara
petrovna
positively
staggered
back
and
bent
her
penetrating
gaze
on
the
mad
girl
that
gaze
settled
everything
she
made
up
her
mind
to
take
liza
with
her
we
must
put
an
end
to
this
broke
from
her
lips
very
well
ill
take
you
with
pleasure
liza
she
added
aloud
if
yulia
mihailovna
is
willing
to
let
you
come
of
course
with
a
candid
air
and
straightforward
dignity
she
addressed
the
governors
wife
directly
oh
certainly
i
dont
want
to
deprive
her
of
such
a
pleasure
especially
as
i
am
myself
yulia
mihailovna
lisped
with
amazing
affabilityi
myself
know
well
what
a
fantastic
wilful
little
head
it
is
yulia
mihailovna
gave
a
charming
smile
i
thank
you
extremely
said
varvara
petrovna
with
a
courteous
and
dignified
bow
and
i
am
the
more
gratified
yulia
mihailovna
went
on
lisping
almost
rapturously
flushing
all
over
with
agreeable
excitement
that
apart
from
the
pleasure
of
being
with
you
liza
should
be
carried
away
by
such
an
excellent
i
may
say
lofty
feeling
of
compassion
she
glanced
at
the
unhappy
creature
and
and
at
the
very
portal
of
the
temple
such
a
feeling
does
you
honour
varvara
petrovna
approved
magnificently
yulia
mihailovna
impulsively
held
out
her
hand
and
varvara
petrovna
with
perfect
readiness
touched
it
with
her
fingers
the
general
effect
was
excellent
the
faces
of
some
of
those
present
beamed
with
pleasure
some
bland
and
insinuating
smiles
were
to
be
seen
in
short
it
was
made
manifest
to
every
one
in
the
town
that
it
was
not
yulia
mihailovna
who
had
up
till
now
neglected
varvara
petrovna
in
not
calling
upon
her
but
on
the
contrary
that
varvara
petrovna
had
kept
yulia
mihailovna
within
bounds
at
a
distance
while
the
latter
would
have
hastened
to
pay
her
a
visit
going
on
foot
perhaps
if
necessary
had
she
been
fully
assured
that
varvara
petrovna
would
not
turn
her
away
and
varvara
petrovnas
prestige
was
enormously
increased
get
in
my
dear
varvara
petrovna
motioned
mlle
lebyadkin
towards
the
carriage
which
had
driven
up
the
unhappy
creature
hurried
gleefully
to
the
carriage
door
and
there
the
footman
lifted
her
in
what
youre
lame
cried
varvara
petrovna
seeming
quite
alarmed
and
she
turned
pale
every
one
noticed
it
at
the
time
but
did
not
understand
it
the
carriage
rolled
away
varvara
petrovnas
house
was
very
near
the
cathedral
liza
told
me
afterwards
that
miss
lebyadkin
laughed
hysterically
for
the
three
minutes
that
the
drive
lasted
while
varvara
petrovna
sat
as
though
in
a
mesmeric
sleep

easy
chair
by
the
window

my

she
motioned
marya

to
a
seat
in
the
middle
of

the

i
faltered
stepan

but
a
footman
came
in
a
cup
of
coffee
at
once
we
must
have
it
as
quickly
as
possible

exclaimed
in
a
dying
voice
ach
french
french
i
can
see
at
once
that
its
the
highest
society
cried
marya
timofyevna
clapping
her
hands
ecstatically
preparing
herself
to
listen
to
a
conversation
in
french
varvara
petrovna
stared
at
her
almost
in
dismay
we
all
sat
in
silence
waiting
to
see
how
it
would
end
shatov
did
not
lift
up
his
head
and
stepan
trofimovitch
was
overwhelmed
with
confusion
as
though
it
were
all
his
fault
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
temples
i
glanced
at
liza
she
was
sitting
in
the
corner
almost
beside
shatov
her
eyes
darted
keenly
from
varvara
petrovna
to
the
cripple
and
back
again
her
lips
were
drawn
into
a
smile
but
not
a
pleasant
one
varvara
petrovna
saw
that
smile
meanwhile
marya
timofyevna
was
absolutely
transported
with
evident
enjoyment
and
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
she
stared
at
varvara
petrovnas
beautiful
drawingroomthe
furniture
the
carpets
the
pictures
on
the
walls
the
oldfashioned
painted
ceiling
the
great
bronze
crucifix
in
the
corner
the
china
lamp
the
albums
the
objects
on
the
table
and
youre
here
too
shatushka
she
cried
suddenly
only
fancy
i
saw
you
a
long
time
ago
but
i
thought
it
couldnt
be
you
how
could
you
come
here
and
she
laughed
gaily
you
know
this
woman
said
varvara
petrovna
turning
to
him
at
once
i
know
her
muttered
shatov
he
seemed
about
to
move
from
his
chair
but
remained
sitting
what
do
you
know
of
her
make
haste
please
oh
well
he
stammered
with
an
incongruous
smile
you
see
for
yourself
what
do
i
see
come
now
say
something
she
lives
in
the
same
house
as
i
do
with
her
brother
an
officer
well
shatov
stammered
again
its
not
worth
talking
about
he
muttered
and
relapsed
into
determined
silence
he
positively
flushed
with
determination
of
course
one
can
expect
nothing
else
from
you
said
varvara
petrovna
indignantly
it
was
clear
to
her
now
that
they
all
knew
something
and
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
all
scared
that
they
were
evading
her
questions
and
anxious
to
keep
something
from
her
the
footman
came
in
and
brought
her
on
a
little
silver
tray
the
cup
of
coffee
she
had
so
specially
ordered
but
at
a
sign
from
her
moved
with
it
at
once
towards
marya
timofyevna
you
were
very
cold
just
now
my
dear
make
haste
and
drink
it
and
get
warm
merci
marya
timofyevna
took
the
cup
and
at
once
went
off
into
a
giggle
at
having
said
merci
to
the
footman
but
meeting
varvara
petrovnas
reproving
eyes
she
was
overcome
with
shyness
and
put
the
cup
on
the
table
auntie
surely
youre
not
angry
she
faltered
with
a
sort
of
flippant
playfulness
whaat
varvara
petrovna
started
and
drew
herself
up
in
her
chair
im
not
your
aunt
what
are
you
thinking
of
marya
timofyevna
not
expecting
such
an
angry
outburst
began
trembling
all
over
in
little
convulsive
shudders
as
though
she
were
in
a
fit
and
sank
back
in
her
chair
i
i
thought
that
was
the
proper
way
she
faltered
gazing
openeyed
at
varvara
petrovna
liza
called
you
that
what
liza

young
lady

her
finger
so

said
marya
timofyevna
growing
a
little
bolder
and
i
dreamed
of
a
beauty
like
that
she
added
laughing
as
it
were
accidentally
varvara
petrovna
reflected
and
grew
calmer
she
even
smiled
faintly
at
marya
timofyevnas
last
words
the
latter
catching
her
smile
got
up
from
her
chair
and
limping
went
timidly
towards
her
take

forgot
to
give
it
back

be
angry
with
my
rudeness

took
from
her
shoulders
the
black
shawl

petrovna
had
wrapped
round
her

it

well

her
to
come
here
say
that
i
want
her
particularly
even
if
shes
not
well
at
that
instant
there
was
again
as
before
an
unusual
noise
of
steps
and
voices
in
the
next
room
and
suddenly
praskovya
ivanovna
panting
and
distracted
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
mavriky
nikolaevitch
ach
heavens
i
could
scarcely
drag
myself
here
liza
you
mad
girl
how
you
treat
your
mother
she
squeaked
concentrating
in
that
squeak
as
weak
and
irritable
people
are
wont
to
do
all
her
accumulated
irritability
varvara
petrovna
ive
come
for
my
daughter
varvara
petrovna
looked
at
her
from
under
her
brows
half
rose
to
meet
her
and
scarcely
concealing
her
vexation
brought
out
good
morning
praskovya
ivanovna
please
be
seated
i
knew
you
would
come
ii
there
could
be
nothing
surprising
to
praskovya
ivanovna
in
such
a
reception
varvara
petrovna
had
from
childhood
upwards
treated
her
old
school
friend
tyrannically
and
under
a
show
of
friendship
almost
contemptuously
and
this
was
an
exceptional
occasion
too
during
the
last
few
days
there
had
almost
been
a
complete
rupture
between
the
two
households
as
i
have
mentioned
incidentally
already
the
reason
of
this
rupture
was
still
a
mystery
to
varvara
petrovna
which
made
it
all
the
more
offensive
but
the
chief
cause
of
offence
was
that
praskovya
ivanovna
had
succeeded
in
taking
up
an
extraordinarily
supercilious
attitude
towards
varvara
petrovna
varvara
petrovna
was
wounded
of
course
and
meanwhile
some
strange
rumours
had
reached
her
which
also
irritated
her
extremely
especially
by
their
vagueness
varvara
petrovna
was
of
a
direct
and
proudly
frank
character
somewhat
slapdash
in
her
methods
indeed
if
the
expression
is
permissible
there
was
nothing
she
detested
so
much
as
secret
and
mysterious
insinuations
she
always
preferred
war
in
the
open
anyway
the
two
ladies
had
not
met
for
five
days
the
last
visit
had
been
paid
by
varvara
petrovna
who
had
come
back
from
that
drozdov
woman
offended
and
perplexed
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
praskovya
ivanovna
had
come
on
this
occasion
with
the
nave
conviction
that
varvara
petrovna
would
for
some
reason
be
sure
to
stand
in
awe
of
her
this
was
evident
from
the
very
expression
of
her
face
evidently
too
varvara
petrovna
was
always
possessed
by
a
demon
of
haughty
pride
whenever
she
had
the
least
ground
for
suspecting
that
she
was
for
some
reason
supposed
to
be
humiliated
like
many
weak
people
who
for
a
long
time
allow
themselves
to
be
insulted
without
resenting
it
praskovya
ivanovna
showed
an
extraordinary
violence
in
her
attack
at
the
first
favourable
opportunity
it
is
true
that
she
was
not
well
and
always
became
more
irritable
in
illness
i
must
add
finally
that
our
presence
in
the
drawingroom
could
hardly
be
much
check
to
the
two
ladies
who
had
been
friends
from
childhood
if
a
quarrel
had
broken
out
between
them
we
were
looked
upon
as
friends
of
the
family
and
almost
as
their
subjects
i
made
that
reflection
with
some
alarm
at
the
time
stepan
trofimovitch
who
had
not
sat
down
since
the
entrance
of
varvara
petrovna
sank
helplessly
into
an
armchair
on
hearing
praskovya
ivanovnas
squeal
and
tried
to
catch
my
eye
with
a
look
of
despair
shatov
turned
sharply
in
his
chair
and
growled
something
to
himself
i
believe
he
meant
to
get
up
and
go
away
liza
rose
from
her
chair
but
sank
back
again
at
once
without
even
paying
befitting
attention
to
her
mothers
squealnot
from
waywardness
but
obviously
because
she
was
entirely
absorbed
by
some
other
overwhelming
impression
she
was
looking
absentmindedly
into
the
air
no
longer
noticing
even
marya
timofyevna
iii
ach
here
praskovya
ivanovna
indicated
an
easy
chair
near
the
table
and
sank
heavily
into
it
with
the
assistance
of
mavriky
nikolaevitch
i
wouldnt
have
sat
down
in
your
house
my
lady
if
it
werent
for
my
legs
she
added
in
a
breaking
voice
varvara
petrovna
raised
her
head
a
little
and
with
an
expression
of
suffering
pressed
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
to
her
right
temple
evidently
in
acute
pain
tic
douloureux
why
so
praskovya
ivanovna
why
wouldnt
you
sit
down
in
my
house
i
possessed
your
late
husbands
sincere
friendship
all
his
life
and
you
and
i
used
to
play
with
our
dolls
at
school
together
as
girls
praskovya
ivanovna
waved
her
hands
i
knew
that
was
coming
you
always
begin
about
the
school
when
you
want
to
reproach
methats
your
way
but
to
my
thinking
thats
only
fine
talk
i
cant
stand
the
school
youre
always
talking
about
youve
come
in
rather
a
bad
temper
im
afraid
how
are
your
legs
here
theyre
bringing
you
some
coffee
please
have
some
drink
it
and
dont
be
cross
varvara
petrovna
you
treat
me
as
though
i
were
a
child
i
wont
have
any
coffee
so
there
and
she
pettishly
waved
away
the
footman
who
was
bringing
her
coffee
all
the
others
refused
coffee
too
except
mavriky
nikolaevitch
and
me
stepan
trofimovitch
took
it
but
put
it
aside
on
the
table
though
marya
timofyevna
was
very
eager
to
have
another
cup
and
even
put
out
her
hand
to
take
it
on
second
thoughts
she
refused
it
ceremoniously
and
was
obviously
pleased
with
herself
for
doing
so
varvara
petrovna
gave
a
wry
smile
ill
tell
you
what
it
is
praskovya
ivanovna
my
friend
you
must
have
taken
some
fancy
into
your
head
again
and
thats
why
youve
come
youve
simply
lived
on
fancies
all
your
life
you
flew
into
a
fury
at
the
mere
mention
of
our
school
but
do
you
remember
how
you
came
and
persuaded
all
the
class
that
a
hussar
called
shablykin
had
proposed
to
you
and
how
mme
lefebure
proved
on
the
spot
you
were
lying
yet
you
werent
lying
you
were
simply
imagining
it
all
to
amuse
yourself
come
tell
me
what
is
it
now
what
are
you
fancying
now
what
is
it
vexes
you
and
you
fell
in
love
with
the
priest
who
used
to
teach
us
scripture
at
schoolso
much
for
you
since
youve
such
a
spiteful
memory
ha
ha
ha
she
laughed
viciously
and
went
off
into
a
fit
of
coughing
ah
youve
not
forgotten
the
priest
then
said
varvara
petrovna
looking
at
her
vindictively
her
face
turned
green
praskovya
ivanovna
suddenly
assumed
a
dignified
air
im
in
no
laughing
mood
now
madam
why
have
you
drawn
my
daughter
into
your
scandals
in
the
face
of
the
whole
town
thats
what
ive
come
about
my
scandals
varvara
petrovna
drew
herself
up
menacingly
maman
i
entreat
you
too
to
restrain
yourself
lizaveta
nikolaevna
brought
out
suddenly
whats
that
you
say
the
maman
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
a
squeal
again
but
catching
her
daughters
flashing
eye
she
subsided
suddenly
how
could
you
talk
about
scandal
maman
cried
liza
flushing
red
i
came
of
my
own
accord
with
yulia
mihailovnas
permission
because
i
wanted
to
learn
this
unhappy
womans
story
and
to
be
of
use
to
her
this
unhappy
womans
story
praskovya
ivanovna
drawled
with
a
spiteful
laugh
is
it
your
place
to
mix
yourself
up
with
such
stories
ach
enough
of
your
tyrannising
she
turned
furiously
to
varvara
petrovna
i
dont
know
whether
its
true
or
not
they
say
you
keep
the
whole
town
in
order
but
it
seems
your
turn
has
come
at
last
varvara
petrovna
sat
straight
as
an
arrow
ready
to
fly
from
the
bow
for
ten
seconds
she
looked
sternly
and
immovably
at
praskovya
ivanovna
well
praskovya
you
must
thank
god
that
all
here
present
are
our
friends
she
said
at
last
with
ominous
composure
youve
said
a
great
deal
better
unsaid
but
im
not
so
much
afraid
of
what
the
world
will
say
my
lady
as
some
people
its
you
who
under
a
show
of
pride
are
trembling
at
what
people
will
say
and
as
for
all
here
being
your
friends
its
better
for
you
than
if
strangers
had
been
listening
have
you
grown
wiser
during
this
last
week
its
not
that
ive
grown
wiser
but
simply
that
the
truth
has
come
out
this
week
what
truth
has
come
out
this
week
listen
praskovya
ivanovna
dont
irritate
me
explain
to
me
this
minute
i
beg
you
as
a
favour
what
truth
has
come
out
and
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
there
it
is
sitting
before
you
and
praskovya
ivanovna
suddenly
pointed
at
marya
timofyevna
with
that
desperate
determination
which
takes
no
heed
of
consequences
if
only
it
can
make
an
impression
at
the
moment
marya
timofyevna
who
had
watched
her
all
the
time
with
lighthearted
curiosity
laughed
exultingly
at
the
sight
of
the
wrathful
guests
finger
pointed
impetuously
at
her
and
wriggled
gleefully
in
her
easy
chair
god
almighty
have
mercy
on
us
theyve
all
gone
crazy
exclaimed
varvara
petrovna
and
turning
pale
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
she
turned
so
pale
that
it
caused
some
commotion
stepan
trofimovitch
was
the
first
to
rush
up
to
her
i
drew
near
also
even
liza
got
up
from
her
seat
though
she
did
not
come
forward
but
the
most
alarmed
of
all
was
praskovya
ivanovna
herself
she
uttered
a
scream
got
up
as
far
as
she
could
and
almost
wailed
in
a
lachrymose
voice
varvara
petrovna
dear
forgive
me
for
my
wicked
foolishness
give
her
some
water
somebody
dont
whimper
please
praskovya
ivanovna
and
leave
me
alone
gentlemen
please
i
dont
want
any
water
varvara
petrovna
pronounced
in
a
firm
though
low
voice
with
blanched
lips
varvara
petrovna
my
dear
praskovya
ivanovna
went
on
a
little
reassured
though
i
am
to
blame
for
my
reckless
words
whats
upset
me
more
than
anything
are
these
anonymous
letters
that
some
low
creatures
keep
bombarding
me
with
they
might
write
to
you
since
it
concerns
you
but
ive
a
daughter
varvara
petrovna
looked
at
her
in
silence
with
wideopen
eyes
listening
with
wonder
at
that
moment
a
sidedoor
in
the
corner
opened
noiselessly
and
darya
pavlovna
made
her
appearance
she
stood
still
and
looked
round
she
was
struck
by
our
perturbation
probably
she
did
not
at
first
distinguish
marya
timofyevna
of
whose
presence
she
had
not
been
informed
stepan
trofimovitch
was
the
first
to
notice
her
he
made
a
rapid
movement
turned
red
and
for
some
reason
proclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
darya
pavlovna
so
that
all
eyes
turned
on
the
newcomer
oh
is
this
your
darya
pavlovna
cried
marya
timofyevna
well
shatushka
your
sisters
not
like
you
how
can
my
fellow
call
such
a
charmer
the
serfwench
dasha
meanwhile
darya
pavlovna
had
gone
up
to
varvara
petrovna
but
struck
by
marya
timofyevnas
exclamation
she
turned
quickly
and
stopped
just
before
her
chair
looking
at
the
imbecile
with
a
long
fixed
gaze
sit
down
dasha
varvara
petrovna
brought
out
with
terrifying
composure
nearer
thats
right
you
can
see
this
woman
sitting
down
do
you
know
her
i
have
never
seen
her
dasha
answered
quietly
and
after
a
pause
she
added
at
once
she
must
be
the
invalid
sister
of
captain
lebyadkin
and
its
the
first
time
ive
set
eyes
on
you
my
love
though
ive
been
interested
and
wanted
to
know
you
a
long
time
for
i
see
how
wellbred
you
are
in
every
movement
you
make
marya
timofyevna
cried
enthusiastically
and
though
my
footman
swears
at
you
can
such
a
welleducated
charming
person
as
you
really
have
stolen
money
from
him
for
you
are
sweet
sweet
sweet
i
tell
you
that
from
myself
she
concluded
enthusiastically
waving
her
hand
can
you
make
anything
of
it
varvara
petrovna
asked
with
proud
dignity
i
understand
it
have
you
heard
about
the
money
no
doubt
its
the
money
that
i
undertook
at
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
request
to
hand
over
to
her
brother
captain
lebyadkin
a
silence
followed
did
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
himself
ask
you
to
do
so
he
was
very
anxious
to
send
that
money
three
hundred
roubles
to
mr
lebyadkin
and
as
he
didnt
know
his
address
but
only
knew
that
he
was
to
be
in
our
town
he
charged
me
to
give
it
to
mr
lebyadkin
if
he
came
what
is
the
money
lost
what
was
this
woman
speaking
about
just
now
that
i
dont
know
ive
heard
before
that
mr
lebyadkin
says
i
didnt
give
him
all
the
money
but
i
dont
understand
his
words
there
were
three
hundred
roubles
and
i
sent
him
three
hundred
roubles
darya
pavlovna
had
almost
completely
regained
her
composure
and
it
was
difficult
i
may
mention
as
a
rule
to
astonish
the
girl
or
ruffle
her
calm
for
longwhatever
she
might
be
feeling
she
brought
out
all
her
answers
now
without
haste
replied
immediately
to
every
question
with
accuracy
quietly
smoothly
and
without
a
trace
of
the
sudden
emotion
she
had
shown
at
first
or
the
slightest
embarrassment
which
might
have
suggested
a
consciousness
of
guilt
varvara
petrovnas
eyes
were
fastened
upon
her
all
the
time
she
was
speaking
varvara
petrovna
thought
for
a
minute
if
she
pronounced
at
last
firmly
evidently
addressing
all
present
though
she
only
looked
at
dasha
if
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
did
not
appeal
even
to
me
but
asked
you
to
do
this
for
him
he
must
have
had
his
reasons
for
doing
so
i
dont
consider
i
have
any
right
to
inquire
into
them
if
they
are
kept
secret
from
me
but
the
very
fact
of
your
having
taken
part
in
the
matter
reassures
me
on
that
score
be
sure
of
that
darya
in
any
case
but
you
see
my
dear
you
may
through
ignorance
of
the
world
have
quite
innocently
done
something
imprudent
and
you
did
so
when
you
undertook
to
have
dealings
with
a
low
character
the
rumours
spread
by
this
rascal
show
what
a
mistake
you
made
but
i
will
find
out
about
him
and
as
it
is
my
task
to
protect
you
i
shall
know
how
to
defend
you
but
now
all
this
must
be
put
a
stop
to
the
best
thing
to
do
said
marya
timofyevna
popping
up
from
her
chair
is
to
send
him
to
the
footmens
room
when
he
comes
let
him
sit
on
the
benches
there
and
play
cards
with
them
while
we
sit
here
and
drink
coffee
we
might
send
him
a
cup
of
coffee
too
but
i
have
a
great
contempt
for
him
and
she
wagged
her
head
expressively
we
must
put
a
stop
to
this
varvara

stepan

rang
and
suddenly
stepped
forward
all
excitement
if
if
he
faltered
feverishly
flushing
breaking
off
and
stuttering
if
i
too
have
heard
the
most
revolting
story
or
rather
slander

utter
indignationenfin

he
broke
down
and
could
not
go
on
varvara
petrovna
screwing
up
her
eyes
looked
him
up
and
down
the
ceremonious
butler
alexey

in

varvara

been

some
time
downstairs

has
been
begging
me
to
announce
him
thats
impossible
varvara
petrovna
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
had
sat
all
the
time
in
unbroken
silence
suddenly
came
forward
in
alarm
if
i
may
speak
he
is
not
a
man
who
can
be
admitted
into
society
he
he
hes
an
impossible
person
varvara

a
moment
said
varvara
petrovna
to
alexey

and
he
disappeared
at
once

muttered
again
and
again
he
flushed
red
and
broke
off
liza
its
time
we
were
going
announced
praskovya
ivanovna
disdainfully
getting
up
from
her
seat
she
seemed
sorry
that
in
her
alarm
she
had
called
herself
a
fool
while
darya
pavlovna
was
speaking
she
listened
pressing
her
lips
superciliously
but
what
struck
me
most
was
the
expression
of
lizaveta
nikolaevna
from
the
moment
darya
pavlovna
had
come
in
there
was
a
gleam
of
hatred
and
hardly
disguised
contempt
in
her
eyes
wait
one
minute
praskovya
ivanovna
i
beg
you
varvara
petrovna
detained
her
still
with
the
same
exaggerated
composure
kindly
sit
down
i
intend
to
speak
out
and
your
legs
are
bad
thats
right
thank
you
i
lost
my
temper
just
now
and
uttered
some
impatient
words
be
so
good
as
to
forgive
me
i
behaved
foolishly
and
im
the
first
to
regret
it
because
i
like
fairness
in
everything
losing
your
temper
too
of
course
you
spoke
of
certain
anonymous
letters
every
anonymous
communication
is
deserving
of
contempt
just
because
its
not
signed
if
you
think
differently
im
sorry
for
you
in
any
case
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
not
pry
into
such
dirty
corners
i
would
not
soil
my
hands
with
it
but
you
have
soiled
yours
however
since
you
have
begun
on
the
subject
yourself
i
must
tell
you
that
six
days
ago
i
too
received
a
clownish
anonymous
letter
in
it
some
rascal
informs
me
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
has
gone
out
of
his
mind
and
that
i
have
reason
to
fear
some
lame
woman
who
is
destined
to
play
a
great
part
in
my
life
i
remember
the
expression
reflecting
and
being
aware
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
has
very
numerous
enemies
i
promptly
sent
for
a
man
living
here
one
of
his
secret
enemies
and
the
most
vindictive
and
contemptible
of
them
and
from
my
conversation
with
him
i
gathered
what
was
the
despicable
source
of
the
anonymous
letter
if
you
too
my
poor
praskovya
ivanovna
have
been
worried
by
similar
letters
on
my
account
and
as
you
say
bombarded
with
them
i
am
of
course
the
first
to
regret
having
been
the
innocent
cause
of
it
thats
all
i
wanted
to
tell
you
by
way
of
explanation
im
very
sorry
to
see
that
you
are
so
tired
and
so
upset
besides
i
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
see
that
suspicious
personage
of
whom
mavriky
nikolaevitch
said
just
now
a
little
inappropriately
that
it
was
impossible
to
receive
him
liza
in
particular
need
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
come
to
me
liza
my
dear
let
me
kiss
you
again
liza
crossed
the
room
and
stood
in
silence
before
varvara
petrovna
the
latter
kissed
her
took
her
hands
and
holding
her
at
armslength
looked
at
her
with
feeling
then
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
her
and
kissed
her
again
well
goodbye
liza
there
was
almost
the
sound
of
tears
in
varvara
petrovnas
voice
believe
that
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
you
whatever
fate
has
in
store
for
you
god
be
with
you
i
have
always
blessed
his
holy
will
she
would
have
added
something
more
but
restrained
herself
and
broke
off
liza
was
walking
back
to
her
place
still
in
the
same
silence
as
it
were
plunged
in
thought
but
she
suddenly
stopped
before
her
mother
i
am
not
going
yet
mother
ill
stay
a
little
longer
at
aunties
she
brought
out
in
a
low
voice
but
there
was
a
note
of
iron
determination
in
those
quiet
words
my
goodness
what
now
wailed
praskovya
ivanovna
clasping
her
hands
helplessly
but
liza
did
not
answer
and
seemed
indeed
not
to
hear
her
she
sat
down
in
the
same
corner
and
fell
to
gazing
into
space
again
as
before
there
was
a
look
of
pride
and
triumph
in
varvara
petrovnas
face
mavriky
nikolaevitch
i
have
a
great
favour
to
ask
of
you
be
so
kind
as
to
go
and
take
a
look
at
that
person
downstairs
and
if
there
is
any
possibility
of
admitting
him
bring
him
up
here
mavriky
nikolaevitch
bowed
and
went
out
a
moment
later
he
brought
in
mr
lebyadkin
iv
i
have
said
something
of
this
gentlemans
outward
appearance
he
was
a
tall
curlyhaired
thickset
fellow
about
forty
with
a
purplish
rather
bloated
and
flabby
face
with
cheeks
that
quivered
at
every
movement
of
his
head
with
little
bloodshot
eyes
that
were
sometimes
rather
crafty
with
moustaches
and
sidewhiskers
and
with
an
incipient
double
chin
fleshy
and
rather
unpleasantlooking
but
what
was
most
striking
about
him
was
the
fact
that
he
appeared
now
wearing
a
dresscoat
and
clean
linen
there
are
people
on
whom
clean
linen
is
almost
unseemly
as
liputin
had
once
said
when
stepan
trofimovitch
reproached
him
in
jest
for
being
untidy
the
captain
had
perfectly
new
black
gloves
too
of
which
he
held
the
right
one
in
his
hand
while
the
left
tightly
stretched
and
unbuttoned
covered
part
of
the
huge
fleshy
fist
in
which
he
held
a
brandnew
glossy
round
hat
probably
worn
for
the
first
time
that
day
it
appeared
therefore
that
the
garb
of
love
of
which
he
had
shouted
to
shatov
the
day
before
really
did
exist
all
this
that
is
the
dresscoat
and
clean
linen
had
been
procured
by
liputins
advice
with
some
mysterious
object
in
view
as
i
found
out
later
there
was
no
doubt
that
his
coming
now
in
a
hired
carriage
was
at
the
instigation
and
with
the
assistance
of
someone
else
it
would
never
have
dawned
on
him
nor
could
he
by
himself
have
succeeded
in
dressing
getting
ready
and
making
up
his
mind
in
threequarters
of
an
hour
even
if
the
scene
in
the
porch
of
the
cathedral
had
reached
his
ears
at
once
he
was
not
drunk
but
was
in
the
dull
heavy
dazed
condition
of
a
man
suddenly
awakened
after
many
days
of
drinking
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
be
drunk
again
if
one
were
to
put
ones
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
rock
him
to
and
fro
once
or
twice
he
was
hurrying
into
the
drawingroom
but
stumbled
over
a
rug
near
the
doorway
marya
timofyevna
was
helpless
with
laughter
he
looked
savagely
at
her
and
suddenly
took
a
few
rapid
steps
towards
varvara
petrovna
i
have
come
madam
he
blared
out
like
a
trumpetblast
be
so
good
sir
as
to
take
a
seat
there
on
that
chair
said
varvara
petrovna
drawing
herself
up
i
shall
hear
you
as
well
from
there
and
it
will
be
more
convenient
for
me
to
look
at
you
from
here
the
captain
stopped
short
looking
blankly
before
him
he
turned
however
and
sat
down
on
the
seat
indicated
close
to
the
door
an
extreme
lack
of
selfconfidence
and
at
the
same
time
insolence
and
a
sort
of
incessant
irritability
were
apparent
in
the
expression
of
his
face
he
was
horribly
scared
that
was
evident
but
his
selfconceit
was
wounded
and
it
might
be
surmised
that
his
mortified
vanity
might
on
occasion
lead
him
to
any
effrontery
in
spite
of
his
cowardice
he
was
evidently
uneasy
at
every
movement
of
his
clumsy
person
we
all
know
that
when
such
gentlemen
are
brought
by
some
marvellous
chance
into
society
they
find
their
worst
ordeal
in
their
own
hands
and
the
impossibility
of
disposing
them
becomingly
of
which
they
are
conscious
at
every
moment
the
captain
sat
rigid
in
his
chair
with
his
hat
and
gloves
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes
fixed
with
a
senseless
stare
on
the
stern
face
of
varvara
petrovna
he
would
have
liked
perhaps
to
have
looked
about
more
freely
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
yet
marya
timofyevna
apparently
thinking
his
appearance
very
funny
laughed
again
but
he
did
not
stir
varvara
petrovna
ruthlessly
kept
him
in
this
position
for
a
long
time
a
whole
minute
staring
at
him
without
mercy
in
the
first
place
allow
me
to
learn
your
name
from
yourself
varvara
petrovna
pronounced
in
measured
and
impressive
tones
captain

thundered
the
captain
i
have
come
madam
he
made
a
movement
again
allow
me
varvara
petrovna
checked
him
again
is
this
unfortunate
person
who
interests
me
so
much
really
your
sister
my
sister
madam
who
has
escaped
from
control
for
she
is
in
a
certain
condition
he
suddenly
faltered
and
turned
crimson
dont
misunderstand
me
madam
he
said
terribly
confused
her
own
brothers
not
going
to
throw
mud
at
her
in
a
certain
condition
doesnt
mean
in
such
a
condition
in
the
sense
of
an
injured
reputation
in
the
last
stage
he
suddenly
broke
off
sir
said
varvara
petrovna
raising
her
head
in
this
condition
he
concluded
suddenly
tapping
the
middle
of
his
forehead
with
his
finger
a
pause
followed
and
has
she
suffered
in
this
way
for
long
asked
varvara
petrovna
with
a
slight
drawl
madam
i
have
come
to
thank
you
for
the
generosity
you
showed
in
the
porch
in
a
russian
brotherly
way
brotherly
i
mean
not
brotherly
but
simply
in
the
sense
that
i
am
my
sisters
brother
and
believe
me
madam
he
went
on
more
hurriedly
turning
crimson
again
i
am
not
so
uneducated
as
i
may
appear
at
first
sight
in
your
drawingroom
my
sister
and
i
are
nothing
madam
compared
with
the
luxury
we
observe
here
having
enemies
who
slander
us
besides
but
on
the
question
of
reputation
lebyadkin
is
proud
madam
and
and

and
ive
come
to
repay
with
thanks
here
is
money
madam
at
this
point
he
pulled
out
a
pocketbook
drew
out
of
it
a
bundle
of
notes
and
began
turning
them
over
with
trembling
fingers
in
a
perfect
fury
of
impatience
it
was
evident
that
he
was
in
haste
to
explain
something
and
indeed
it
was
quite
necessary
to
do
so
but
probably
feeling
himself
that
his
fluster
with
the
money
made
him
look
even
more
foolish
he
lost
the
last
traces
of
selfpossession
the
money
refused
to
be
counted
his
fingers
fumbled
helplessly
and
to
complete
his
shame
a
green
note
escaped
from
the
pocketbook
and
fluttered
in
zigzags
on
to
the
carpet
twenty
roubles
madam
he
leapt
up
suddenly
with
the
roll
of
notes
in
his
hand
his
face
perspiring
with
discomfort
noticing
the
note
which
had
dropped
on
the
floor
he
was
bending
down
to
pick
it
up
but
for
some
reason
overcome
by
shame
he
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
for
your
servants
madam
for
the
footman
who
picks
it
up
let
them
remember
my
sister
i
cannot
allow
that
varvara
petrovna
brought
out
hurriedly
even
with
some
alarm
in
that
case
he
bent
down
picked
it
up
flushing
crimson
and
suddenly
going
up
to
varvara
petrovna
held
out
the
notes
he
had
counted
whats
this
she
cried
really
alarmed
at
last
and
positively
shrinking
back
in
her
chair
mavriky
nikolaevitch
stepan
trofimovitch
and
i
all
stepped
forward
dont
be
alarmed
dont
be
alarmed
im
not
mad
by
god
im
not
mad
the
captain
kept
asseverating
excitedly
yes
sir
youre
out
of
your
senses
madam
shes
not
at
all
as
you
suppose
i
am
an
insignificant
link
oh
madam
wealthy
are
your
mansions
but
poor
is
the
dwelling
of
marya
anonyma
my
sister
whose
maiden
name
was
lebyadkin
but
whom
well
call
anonyma
for
the
time
only
for
the
time
madam
for
god
himself
will
not
suffer
it
forever
madam
you
gave
her
ten
roubles
and
she
took
it
because
it
was
from
you
madam
do
you
hear
madam
from
no
one
else
in
the
world
would
this
marya
anonyma
take
it
or
her
grandfather
the
officer
killed
in
the
caucasus
before
the
very
eyes
of
yermolov
would
turn
in
his
grave
but
from
you
madam
from
you
she
will
take
anything
but
with
one
hand
she
takes
it
and
with
the
other
she
holds
out
to
you
twenty
roubles
by
way
of
subscription
to
one
of
the
benevolent
committees
in
petersburg
and
moscow
of
which
you
are
a
member
for
you
published
yourself
madam
in
the
moscow
news
that
you
are
ready
to
receive
subscriptions
in
our
town
and
that
any
one
may
subscribe
the
captain
suddenly
broke
off
he
breathed
hard
as
though
after
some
difficult
achievement
all
he
said
about
the
benevolent
society
had
probably
been
prepared
beforehand
perhaps
under
liputins
supervision
he
perspired
more
than
ever
drops
literally
trickled
down
his
temples
varvara
petrovna
looked
searchingly
at
him
the
subscription
list
she
said
severely
is
always
downstairs
in
charge
of
my
porter
there
you
can
enter
your
subscriptions
if
you
wish
to
and
so
i
beg
you
to
put
your
notes
away
and
not
to
wave
them
in
the
air
thats
right
i
beg
you
also
to
go
back
to
your
seat
thats
right
i
am
very
sorry
sir
that
i
made
a
mistake
about
your
sister
and
gave
her
something
as
though
she
were
poor
when
she
is
so
rich
theres
only
one
thing
i
dont
understand
why
she
can
only
take
from
me
and
no
one
else
you
so
insisted
upon
that
that
i
should
like
a
full
explanation
madam
that
is
a
secret
that
may
be
buried
only
in
the
grave
answered
the
captain
why
varvara
petrovna
asked
not
quite
so
firmly
madam
madam
he
relapsed
into
gloomy
silence
looking
on
the
floor
laying
his
right
hand
on
his
heart
varvara
petrovna
waited
not
taking
her
eyes
off
him
madam
he
roared
suddenly
will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
one
question
only
one
but
frankly
directly
like
a
russian
from
the
heart
kindly
do
so
have
you
ever
suffered
madam
in
your
life
you
simply
mean
to
say
that
you
have
been
or
are
being
illtreated
by
someone
madam
madam
he
jumped
up
again
probably
unconscious
of
doing
so
and
struck
himself
on
the
breast
here
in
this
bosom
so
much
has
accumulated
so
much
that
god
himself
will
be
amazed
when
it
is
revealed
at
the
day
of
judgment
hm
a
strong
expression
madam
i
speak
perhaps
irritably
dont
be
uneasy
i
know
myself
when
to
stop
you
may
i
ask
you
another
question
madam
ask
another
question
can
one
die
simply
from
the
generosity
of
ones
feelings
i
dont
know
as
ive
never
asked
myself
such
a
question
you
dont
know
youve
never
asked
yourself
such
a
question
he
said
with
pathetic
irony
well
if
thats
it
if
thats
it
be
still
despairing
heart
and
he
struck
himself
furiously
on
the
chest
he
was
by
now
walking
about
the
room
again
it
is
typical
of
such
people
to
be
utterly
incapable
of
keeping
their
desires
to
themselves
they
have
on
the
contrary
an
irresistible
impulse
to
display
them
in
all
their
unseemliness
as
soon
as
they
arise
when
such
a
gentleman
gets
into
a
circle
in
which
he
is
not
at
home
he
usually
begins
timidlybut
you
have
only
to
give
him
an
inch
and
he
will
at
once
rush
into
impertinence
the
captain
was
already
excited
he
walked
about
waving
his
arms
and
not
listening
to
questions
talked
about
himself
very
very
quickly
so
that
sometimes
his
tongue
would
not
obey
him
and
without
finishing
one
phrase
he
passed
to
another
it
is
true
he
was
probably
not
quite
sober
moreover
lizaveta
nikolaevna
was
sitting
there
too
and
though
he
did
not
once
glance
at
her
her
presence
seemed
to
overexcite
him
terribly
that
however
is
only
my
supposition
there
must
have
been
some
reason
which
led
varvara
petrovna
to
resolve
to
listen
to
such
a
man
in
spite
of
her
repugnance
praskovya
ivanovna
was
simply
shaking
with
terror
though
i
believe
she
really
did
not
quite
understand
what
it
was
about
stepan
trofimovitch
was
trembling
too
but
that
was
on
the
contrary
because
he
was
disposed
to
understand
everything
and
exaggerate
it
mavriky
nikolaevitch
stood
in
the
attitude
of
one
ready
to
defend
all
present
liza
was
pale
and
she
gazed
fixedly
with
wideopen
eyes
at
the
wild
captain
shatov
sat
in
the
same
position
as
before
but
what
was
strangest
of
all
marya
timofyevna
had
not
only
ceased
laughing
but
had
become
terribly
sad
she
leaned
her
right
elbow
on
the
table
and
with
a
prolonged
mournful
gaze
watched
her
brother
declaiming
darya
pavlovna
alone
seemed
to
me
calm
all
that
is
nonsensical
allegory
said
varvara
petrovna
getting
angry
at
last
you
havent
answered
my
question
why
i
insist
on
an
answer
i
havent
answered
why
you
insist
on
an
answer
why
repeated
the
captain
winking
that
little
word
why
has
run
through
all
the
universe
from
the
first
day
of
creation
and
all
nature
cries
every
minute
to
its
creator
why
and
for
seven
thousand
years
it
has
had
no
answer
and
must
captain
lebyadkin
alone
answer
and
is
that
justice
madam
thats
all
nonsense
and
not
to
the
point
cried
varvara
petrovna
getting
angry
and
losing
patience
thats
allegory
besides
you
express
yourself
too
sensationally
sir
which
i
consider
impertinence
madam
the
captain
went
on
not
hearing
i
should
have
liked
perhaps
to
be
called
ernest
yet
i
am
forced
to
bear
the
vulgar
name
ignatwhy
is
that
do
you
suppose
i
should
have
liked
to
be
called
prince
de
monbart
yet
i
am
only
lebyadkin
derived
from
a
swan
why
is
that
i
am
a
poet
madam
a
poet
in
soul
and
might
be
getting
a
thousand
roubles
at
a
time
from
a
publisher
yet
i
am
forced
to
live
in
a
pig
pail
why
why
madam
to
my
mind
russia
is
a
freak
of
nature
and
nothing
else

from
lebyed
a
swan
can
you
really
say
nothing
more
definite
i
can
read
you
the
poem
the
cockroach
madam
whaat
madam
im
not
mad
yet
i
shall
be
mad
no
doubt
i
shall
be
but
im
not
so
yet
madam
a
friend
of
minea
most
honourable
manhas
written
a
krylovs
fable
called
the
cockroach
may
i
read
it
you
want
to
read
some
fable
of
krylovs
no
its
not
a
fable
of
krylovs
i
want
to
read
its
my
fable
my
own
composition
believe
me
madam
without
offence
im
not
so
uneducated
and
depraved
as
not
to
understand
that
russia
can
boast
of
a
great
fablewriter
krylov
to
whom
the
minister
of
education
has
raised
a
monument
in
the
summer
gardens
for
the
diversion
of
the
young
here
madam
you
ask
me
why
the
answer
is
at
the
end
of
this
fable
in
letters
of
fire
read
your
fable
lived
a
cockroach
in
the
world
such
was
his
condition
in
a
glass
he
chanced
to
fall
full
of
flyperdition
heavens
what
does
it
mean
cried
varvara
petrovna
thats
when
flies
get
into
a
glass
in
the
summertime
the
captain
explained
hurriedly
with
the
irritable
impatience
of
an
author
interrupted
in
reading
then
it
is
perdition
to
the
flies
any
fool
can
understand
dont
interrupt
dont
interrupt
youll
see
youll
see
he
kept
waving
his
arms
but
he
squeezed
against
the
flies
they
woke
up
and
cursed
him
raised
to
jove
their
angry
cries
the
glass
is
full
to
bursting
in
the
middle
of
the
din
came
along
nikifor
fine
old
man
and
looking
in
i
havent
quite
finished
it
but
no
matter
ill
tell
it
in
words
the
captain
rattled
on
nikifor
takes
the
glass
and
in
spite
of
their
outcry
empties
away
the
whole
stew
flies
and
beetles
and
all
into
the
pig
pail
which
ought
to
have
been
done
long
ago
but
observe
madam
observe
the
cockroach
doesnt
complain
thats
the
answer
to
your
question
why
he
cried
triumphantly
the
cockroach
does
not
complain
as
for
nikifor
he
typifies
nature
he
added
speaking
rapidly
and
walking
complacently
about
the
room
varvara
petrovna
was
terribly
angry
and
allow
me
to
ask
you
about
that
money
said
to
have
been
received
from
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
not
to
have
been
given
to
you
about
which
you
dared
to
accuse
a
person
belonging
to
my
household
its
a
slander
roared
lebyadkin
flinging
up
his
right
hand
tragically
no
its
not
a
slander
madam
there
are
circumstances
that
force
one
to
endure

lebyadkin
will
not
blab
madam
he
seemed
dazed
he
was
carried
away
he
felt
his
importance
he
certainly
had
some
fancy
in
his
mind
by
now
he
wanted
to
insult
some
one
to
do
something
nasty
to
show
his
power

please
stepan
trofimovitch
varvara
petrovna
asked
him
lebyadkins
cunning
madam
he
said
winking
with
his
evil
smile
hes
cunning
but
he
too
has
a
weak
spot
he
too
at
times
is
in
the
portals
of
passions
and
these
portals
are
the
old
military
hussars
bottle
celebrated
by
denis
davydov
so
when
he
is
in
those
portals
madam
he
may
happen
to
send
a
letter
in
verse
a
most
magnificent
letterbut
which
afterwards
he
would
have
wished
to
take
back
with
the
tears
of
all
his
life
for
the
feeling
of
the
beautiful
is
destroyed
but
the
bird
has
flown
you
wont
catch
it
by
the
tail
in
those
portals
now
madam
lebyadkin
may
have
spoken
about
an
honourable
young
lady
in
the
honourable
indignation
of
a
soul
revolted
by
wrongs
and
his
slanderers
have
taken
advantage
of
it
but
lebyadkin
is
cunning
madam
and
in
vain
a
malignant
wolf
sits
over
him
every
minute
filling
his
glass
and
waiting
for
the
end
lebyadkin
wont
blab
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
he
always
finds
instead
lebyadkins
cunning
but
enough
oh
enough
madam
your
splendid
halls
might
belong
to
the
noblest
in
the
land
but
the
cockroach
will
not
complain
observe
that
observe
that
he
does
not
complain
and
recognise
his
noble
spirit
at
that
instant
a
bell
rang
downstairs
from
the
porters
room
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
alexey
yegorytch
appeared
in
response
to
stepan
trofimovitchs
ring
which
he
had
somewhat
delayed
answering
the
correct
old
servant
was
unusually
excited
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
has
graciously
arrived
this
moment
and
is
coming
here
he
pronounced
in
reply
to
varvara
petrovnas
questioning
glance
i
particularly
remember
her
at
that
moment
at
first
she
turned
pale
but
suddenly
her
eyes
flashed
she
drew
herself
up
in
her
chair
with
an
air
of
extraordinary
determination
every
one
was
astounded
indeed
the
utterly
unexpected
arrival
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
who
was
not
expected
for
another
month
was
not
only
strange
from
its
unexpectedness
but
from
its
fateful
coincidence
with
the
present
moment
even
the
captain
remained
standing
like
a
post
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
mouth
wide
open
staring
at
the
door
with
a
fearfully
stupid
expression
and
behold
from
the
next
rooma
very
large
and
long
apartmentcame
the
sound
of
swiftly
approaching
footsteps
little
exceedingly
rapid
steps
someone
seemed
to
be
running
and
that
someone
suddenly
flew
into
the
drawingroom
not
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
but
a
young
man
who
was
a
complete
stranger
to
all
v
i
will
permit
myself
to
halt
here
to
sketch
in
a
few
hurried
strokes
this
person
who
had
so
suddenly
arrived
on
the
scene
he
was
a
young
man
of
twentyseven
or
thereabouts
a
little
above
the
medium
height
with
rather
long
lank
flaxen
hair
and
with
faintly
defined
irregular
moustache
and
beard
he
was
dressed
neatly
and
in
the
fashion
though
not
like
a
dandy
at
the
first
glance
he
looked
roundshouldered
and
awkward
but
yet
he
was
not
roundshouldered
and
his
manner
was
easy
he
seemed
a
queer
fish
and
yet
later
on
we
all
thought
his
manners
good
and
his
conversation
always
to
the
point
no
one
would
have
said
that
he
was
ugly
and
yet
no
one
would
have
liked
his
face
his
head
was
elongated
at
the
back
and
looked
flattened
at
the
sides
so
that
his
face
seemed
pointed
his
forehead
was
high
and
narrow
but
his
features
were
small
his
eyes
were
keen
his
nose
was
small
and
sharp
his
lips
were
long
and
thin
the
expression
of
his
face
suggested
illhealth
but
this
was
misleading
he
had
a
wrinkle
on
each
cheek
which
gave
him
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
just
recovered
from
a
serious
illness
yet
he
was
perfectly
well
and
strong
and
had
never
been
ill
he
walked
and
moved
very
hurriedly
yet
never
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
it
seemed
as
though
nothing
could
disconcert
him
in
every
circumstance
and
in
every
sort
of
society
he
remained
the
same
he
had
a
great
deal
of
conceit
but
was
utterly
unaware
of
it
himself
he
talked
quickly
hurriedly
but
at
the
same
time
with
assurance
and
was
never
at
a
loss
for
a
word
in
spite
of
his
hurried
manner
his
ideas
were
in
perfect
order
distinct
and
definiteand
this
was
particularly
striking
his
articulation
was
wonderfully
clear
his
words
pattered
out
like
smooth
big
grains
always
well
chosen
and
at
your
service
at
first
this
attracted
one
but
afterwards
it
became
repulsive
just
because
of
this
overdistinct
articulation
this
string
of
everready
words
one
somehow
began
to
imagine
that
he
must
have
a
tongue
of
special
shape
somehow
exceptionally
long
and
thin
extremely
red
with
a
very
sharp
everlastingly
active
little
tip
well
this
was
the
young
man
who
darted
now
into
the
drawingroom
and
really
i
believe
to
this
day
that
he
began
to
talk
in
the
next
room
and
came
in
speaking
he
was
standing
before
varvara
petrovna
in
a
trice

only
fancy
varvara
petrovna
he
pattered
on
i
came
in
expecting
to
find
hed
been
here
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
he
arrived
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
we
met
at
kirillovs
he
set
off
half
an
hour
ago
meaning
to
come
straight
here
and
told
me
to
come
here
too
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
but
who
who
told
you
to
come
here
varvara
petrovna
inquired
why
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
surely
this
isnt
the
first
youve
heard
of
it
but
his
luggage
must
have
been
here
a
long
while
anyway
how
is
it
you
werent
told
then
im
the
first
to
bring
the
news
one
might
send
out
to
look
for
him
hes
sure
to
be
here
himself
directly
though
and
i
fancy
at
the
moment
that
just
fits
in
with
some
of
his
expectations
and
is
far
as
i
can
judge
at
least
some
of
his
calculations
at
this
point
he
turned
his
eyes
about
the
room
and
fixed
them
with
special
attention
on
the
captain
ach
lizaveta
nikolaevna
how
glad
i
am
to
meet
you
at
the
very
first
step
delighted
to
shake
hands
with
you
he
flew
up
to
liza
who
was
smiling
gaily
to
take
her
proffered
hand
and
i
observe
that
my
honoured
friend
praskovya
ivanovna
has
not
forgotten
her
professor
and
actually
isnt
cross
with
him
as
she
always
used
to
be
in
switzerland
but
how
are
your
legs
here
praskovya
ivanovna
and
were
the
swiss
doctors
right
when
at
the
consultation
they
prescribed
your
native
air
what
fomentations
that
ought
to
do
good
but
how
sorry
i
was
varvara
petrovna
he
turned
rapidly
to
her
that
i
didnt
arrive
in
time
to
meet
you
abroad
and
offer
my
respects
to
you
in
person
i
had
so
much
to
tell
you
too
i
did
send
word
to
my
old
man
here
but
i
fancy
that
he
did
as
he
always
does
petrusha
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
instantly
roused
from
his
stupefaction
he
clasped
his
hands
and
flew
to
his
son
pierre
mon
enfant
why
i
didnt
know
you
he
pressed
him
in
his
arms
and
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
come
be
quiet
be
quiet
no
flourishes
thats
enough
thats
enough
please
petrusha
muttered
hurriedly
trying
to
extricate
himself
from
his
embrace
ive
always
sinned
against
you
always
well
thats
enough
we
can
talk
of
that
later
i
knew
youd
carry
on
come
be
a
little
more
sober
please
but
its
ten
years
since
ive
seen
you
the
less
reason
for
demonstrations
mon
enfant
come
i
believe
in
your
affection
i
believe
in
it
take
your
arms
away
you
see
youre
disturbing
other
people
ah
heres
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
keep
quiet
please
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
already
in
the
room
he
came
in
very
quietly
and
stood
still
for
an
instant
in
the
doorway
quietly
scrutinising
the
company
i
was
struck
by
the
first
sight
of
him
just
as
i
had
been
four
years
before
when
i
saw
him
for
the
first
time
i
had
not
forgotten
him
in
the
least
but
i
think
there
are
some
countenances
which
always
seem
to
exhibit
something
new
which
one
has
not
noticed
before
every
time
one
meets
them
though
one
may
have
seen
them
a
hundred
times
already
apparently
he
was
exactly
the
same
as
he
had
been
four
years
before
he
was
as
elegant
as
dignified
he
moved
with
the
same
air
of
consequence
as
before
indeed
he
looked
almost
as
young
his
faint
smile
had
just
the
same
official
graciousness
and
complacency
his
eyes
had
the
same
stern
thoughtful
and
as
it
were
preoccupied
look
in
fact
it
seemed
as
though
we
had
only
parted
the
day
before
but
one
thing
struck
me
in
old
days
though
he
had
been
considered
handsome
his
face
was
like
a
mask
as
some
of
our
sharptongued
ladies
had
expressed
it
nownow
i
dont
know
why
he
impressed
me
at
once
as
absolutely
incontestably
beautiful
so
that
no
one
could
have
said
that
his
face
was
like
a
mask
wasnt
it
perhaps
that
he
was
a
little
paler
and
seemed
rather
thinner
than
before
or
was
there
perhaps
the
light
of
some
new
idea
in
his
eyes
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
cried
varvara
petrovna
drawing
herself
up
but
not
rising
from
her
chair
stop
a
minute
she
checked
his
advance
with
a
peremptory
gesture
but
to
explain
the
awful
question
which
immediately
followed
that
gesture
and
exclamationa
question
which
i
should
have
imagined
to
be
impossible
even
in
varvara
petrovna
i
must
ask
the
reader
to
remember
what
that
ladys
temperament
had
always
been
and
the
extraordinary
impulsiveness
she
showed
at
some
critical
moments
i
beg
him
to
consider
also
that
in
spite
of
the
exceptional
strength
of
her
spirit
and
the
very
considerable
amount
of
common
sense
and
practical
so
to
say
business
tact
she
possessed
there
were
moments
in
her
life
in
which
she
abandoned
herself
altogether
entirely
and
if
its
permissible
to
say
so
absolutely
without
restraint
i
beg
him
to
take
into
consideration
also
that
the
present
moment
might
really
be
for
her
one
of
those
in
which
all
the
essence
of
life
of
all
the
past
and
all
the
present
perhaps
too
all
the
future
is
concentrated
as
it
were
focused
i
must
briefly
recall
too
the
anonymous
letter
of
which
she
had
spoken
to
praskovya
ivanovna
with
so
much
irritation
though
i
think
she
said
nothing
of
the
latter
part
of
it
yet
it
perhaps
contained
the
explanation
of
the
possibility
of
the
terrible
question
with
which
she
suddenly
addressed
her
son
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
she
repeated
rapping
out
her
words
in
a
resolute
voice
in
which
there
was
a
ring
of
menacing
challenge
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
at
once
without
moving
from
that
place
is
it
true
that
this
unhappy
cripplehere
she
is
here
look
at
heris
it
true
that
she
is
your
lawful
wife
i
remember
that
moment
only
too
well
he
did
not
wink
an
eyelash
but
looked
intently
at
his
mother
not
the
faintest
change
in
his
face
followed
at
last
he
smiled
a
sort
of
indulgent
smile
and
without
answering
a
word
went
quietly
up
to
his
mother
took
her
hand
raised
it
respectfully
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
and
so
great
was
his
invariable
and
irresistible
ascendancy
over
his
mother
that
even
now
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
pull
away
her
hand
she
only
gazed
at
him
her
whole
figure
one
concentrated
question
seeming
to
betray
that
she
could
not
bear
the
suspense
another
moment
but
he
was
still
silent
when
he
had
kissed
her
hand
he
scanned
the
whole
room
once
more
and
moving
as
before
without
haste
went
towards
marya
timofyevna
it
is
very
difficult
to
describe
peoples
countenances
at
certain
moments
i
remember
for
instance
that
marya
timofyevna
breathless
with
fear
rose
to
her
feet
to
meet
him
and
clasped
her
hands
before
her
as
though
beseeching
him
and
at
the
same
time
i
remember
the
frantic
ecstasy
which
almost
distorted
her
facean
ecstasy
almost
too
great
for
any
human
being
to
bear
perhaps
both
were
there
both
the
terror
and
the
ecstasy
but
i
remember
moving
quickly
towards
her
i
was
standing
not
far
off
for
i
fancied
she
was
going
to
faint
you
should
not
be
here
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
said
to
her
in
a
caressing
and
melodious
voice
and
there
was
the
light
of
an
extraordinary
tenderness
in
his
eyes
he
stood
before
her
in
the
most
respectful
attitude
and
every
gesture
showed
sincere
respect
for
her
the
poor
girl
faltered
impulsively
in
a
halfwhisper
but
may
i
kneel
down
to
you
now
no
you
cant
do
that
he
smiled
at
her
magnificently
so
that
she
too
laughed
joyfully
at
once
in
the
same
melodious
voice
coaxing
her
tenderly
as
though
she
were
a
child
he
went
on
gravely
only
think
that
you
are
a
girl
and
that
though
im
your
devoted
friend
im
an
outsider
not
your
husband
nor
your
father
nor
your
betrothed
give
me
your
arm
and
let
us
go
i
will
take
you
to
the
carriage
and
if
you
will
let
me
i
will
see
you
all
the
way
home
she
listened
and
bent
her
head
as
though
meditating
lets
go
she
said
with
a
sigh
giving
him
her
hand
but
at
that
point
a
slight
mischance
befell
her
she
must
have
turned
carelessly
resting
on
her
lame
leg
which
was
shorter
than
the
other
she
fell
sideways
into
the
chair
and
if
the
chair
had
not
been
there
would
have
fallen
on
to
the
floor
he
instantly
seized
and
supported
her
and
holding
her
arm
firmly
in
his
led
her
carefully
and
sympathetically
to
the
door
she
was
evidently
mortified
at
having
fallen
she
was
overwhelmed
blushed
and
was
terribly
abashed
looking
dumbly
on
the
ground
limping
painfully
she
hobbled
after
him
almost
hanging
on
his
arm
so
they
went
out
liza
i
saw
suddenly
jumped
up
from
her
chair
for
some
reason
as
they
were
going
out
and
she
followed
them
with
intent
eyes
till
they
reached
the
door
then
she
sat
down
again
in
silence
but
there
was
a
nervous
twitching
in
her
face
as
though
she
had
touched
a
viper
while
this
scene
was
taking
place
between
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
marya
timofyevna
every
one
was
speechless
with
amazement
one
could
have
heard
a
fly
but
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
out
every
one
began
suddenly
talking
vi
it
was
very
little
of
it
talk
however
it
was
mostly
exclamation
ive
forgotten
a
little
the
order
in
which
things
happened
for
a
scene
of
confusion
followed
stepan
trofimovitch
uttered
some
exclamation
in
french
clasping
his
hands
but
varvara
petrovna
had
no
thought
for
him
even
mavriky
nikolaevitch
muttered
some
rapid
jerky
comment
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
the
most
excited
of
all
he
was
trying
desperately
with
bold
gesticulations
to
persuade
varvara
petrovna
of
something
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
make
out
what
it
was
he
appealed
to
praskovya
ivanovna
and
lizaveta
nikolaevna
too
even
in
his
excitement
addressed
a
passing
shout
to
his
fatherin
fact
he
seemed
all
over
the
room
at
once
varvara
petrovna
flushing
all
over
sprang
up
from
her
seat
and
cried
to
praskovya
ivanovna
did
you
hear
what
he
said
to
her
here
just
now
did
you
hear
it
but
the
latter
was
incapable
of
replying
she
could
only
mutter
something
and
wave
her
hand
the
poor
woman
had
troubles
of
her
own
to
think
about
she
kept
turning
her
head
towards
liza
and
was
watching
her
with
unaccountable
terror
but
she
didnt
even
dare
to
think
of
getting
up
and
going
away
until
her
daughter
should
get
up
in
the
meantime
the
captain
wanted
to
slip
away
that
i
noticed
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
been
in
a
great
panic
from
the
instant
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
made
his
appearance
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
took
him
by
the
arm
and
would
not
let
him
go
it
is
necessary
quite
necessary
he
pattered
on
to
varvara
petrovna
still
trying
to
persuade
her
he
stood
facing
her
as
she
was
sitting
down
again
in
her
easy
chair
and
i
remember
was
listening
to
him
eagerly
he
had
succeeded
in
securing
her
attention
it
is
necessary
you
can
see
for
yourself
varvara
petrovna
that
there
is
a
misunderstanding
here
and
much
that
is
strange
on
the
surface
and
yet
the
things
as
clear
as
daylight
and
as
simple
as
my
finger
i
quite
understand
that
no
one
has
authorised
me
to
tell
the
story
and
i
dare
say
i
look
ridiculous
putting
myself
forward
but
in
the
first
place
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
attaches
no
sort
of
significance
to
the
matter
himself
and
besides
there
are
incidents
of
which
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
to
make
up
his
mind
to
give
an
explanation
himself
and
so
its
absolutely
necessary
that
it
should
be
undertaken
by
a
third
person
for
whom
its
easier
to
put
some
delicate
points
into
words
believe
me
varvara
petrovna
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
is
not
at
all
to
blame
for
not
immediately
answering
your
question
just
now
with
a
full
explanation
its
all
a
trivial
affair
ive
known
him
since
his
petersburg
days
besides
the
whole
story
only
does
honour
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
if
one
must
make
use
of
that
vague
word
honour
you
mean
to
say
that
you
were
a
witness
of
some
incident
which
gave
rise
to
this
misunderstanding
asked
varvara
petrovna
i
witnessed
it
and
took
part
in
it
pyotr
stepanovitch
hastened
to
declare
if
youll
give
me
your
word
that
this
will
not
wound
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
delicacy
in
regard
to
his
feeling
for
me
from
whom
he
neever
conceals
anything
and
if
you
are
convinced
also
that
your
doing
this
will
be
agreeable
to
him
certainly
it
will
be
agreeable
and
for
that
reason
i
consider
it
a
particularly
agreeable
duty
i
am
convinced
that
he
would
beg
me
to
do
it
himself
the
intrusive
desire
of
this
gentleman
who
seemed
to
have
dropped
on
us
from
heaven
to
tell
stories
about
other
peoples
affairs
was
rather
strange
and
inconsistent
with
ordinary
usage
but
he
had
caught
varvara
petrovna
by
touching
on
too
painful
a
spot
i
did
not
know
the
mans
character
at
that
time
and
still
less
his
designs
i
am
listening
varvara
petrovna
announced
with
a
reserved
and
cautious
manner
she
was
rather
painfully
aware
of
her
condescension
its
a
short
story
in
fact
if
you
like
its
not
a
story
at
all
he
rattled
on
though
a
novelist
might
work
it
up
into
a
novel
in
an
idle
hour
its
rather
an
interesting
little
incident
praskovya
ivanovna
and
i
am
sure
that
lizaveta
nikolaevna
will
be
interested
to
hear
it
because
there
are
a
great
many
things
in
it
that
are
odd
if
not
wonderful
five
years
ago
in
petersburg
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
made
the
acquaintance
of
this
gentleman
this
very
mr
lebyadkin
whos
standing
here
with
his
mouth
open
anxious
i
think
to
slip
away
at
once
excuse
me
varvara
petrovna
i
dont
advise
you
to
make
your
escape
though
you
discharged
clerk
in
the
former
commissariat
department
you
see
i
remember
you
very
well
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
i
know
very
well
what
youve
been
up
to
here
and
dont
forget
youll
have
to
answer
for
it
i
ask
your
pardon
once
more
varvara
petrovna
in
those
days
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
used
to
call
this
gentleman
his
falstaff
that
must
be
he
explained
suddenly
some
old
burlesque
character
at
whom
every
one
laughs
and
who
is
willing
to
let
every
one
laugh
at
him
if
only
theyll
pay
him
for
it
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
leading
at
that
time
in
petersburg
a
life
so
to
say
of
mockery
i
cant
find
another
word
to
describe
it
because
he
is
not
a
man
who
falls
into
disillusionment
and
he
disdained
to
be
occupied
with
work
at
that
time
im
only
speaking
of
that
period
varvara
petrovna
lebyadkin
had
a
sister
the
woman
who
was
sitting
here
just
now
the
brother
and
sister
hadnt
a
corner
of
their
own
but
were
always
quartering
themselves
on
different
people
he
used
to
hang
about
the
arcades
in
the
gostiny
dvor
always
wearing
his
old
uniform
and
would
stop
the
more
respectablelooking
passersby
and
everything
he
got
from
them
hed
spend
in
drink
his
sister
lived
like
the
birds
of
heaven
shed
help
people
in
their
corners
and
do
jobs
for
them
on
occasion
it
was
a
regular
bedlam
ill
pass
over
the
description
of
this
life
in
corners
a
life
to
which
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
taken

in
the
poorer
quarters
of
russian
towns
a
single
room
is
often
let
out
to
several
families
each
of
which
occupies
a
corner
at
that
time
from
eccentricity
im
only
talking
of
that
period
varvara
petrovna
as
for
eccentricity
thats
his
own
expression
he
does
not
conceal
much
from
me
mlle
lebyadkin
who
was
thrown
in
the
way
of
meeting
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
very
often
at
one
time
was
fascinated
by
his
appearance
he
was
so
to
say
a
diamond
set
in
the
dirty
background
of
her
life
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
describing
feelings
so
ill
pass
them
over
but
some
of
that
dirty
lot
took
to
jeering
at
her
once
and
it
made
her
sad
they
always
had
laughed
at
her
but
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
before
she
wasnt
quite
right
in
her
head
even
then
but
very
different
from
what
she
is
now
theres
reason
to
believe
that
in
her
childhood
she
received
something
like
an
education
through
the
kindness
of
a
benevolent
lady
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
never
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
her
he
used
to
spend
his
time
chiefly
in
playing
preference
with
a
greasy
old
pack
of
cards
for
stakes
of
a
quarterfarthing
with
clerks
but
once
when
she
was
being
illtreated
he
went
up
without
inquiring
into
the
cause
and
seized
one
of
the
clerks
by
the
collar
and
flung
him
out
of
a
secondfloor
window
it
was
not
a
case
of
chivalrous
indignation
at
the
sight
of
injured
innocence
the
whole
operation
took
place
in
the
midst
of
roars
of
laughter
and
the
one
who
laughed
loudest
was
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
himself
as
it
all
ended
without
harm
they
were
reconciled
and
began
drinking
punch
but
the
injured
innocent
herself
did
not
forget
it
of
course
it
ended
in
her
becoming
completely
crazy
i
repeat
im
a
poor
hand
at
describing
feelings
but
a
delusion
was
the
chief
feature
in
this
case
and
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
aggravated
that
delusion
as
though
he
did
it
on
purpose
instead
of
laughing
at
her
he
began
all
at
once
treating
mlle
lebyadkin
with
sudden
respect
kirillov
who
was
there
a
very
original
man
varvara
petrovna
and
very
abrupt
youll
see
him
perhaps
one
day
for
hes
here
now
well
this
kirillov
who
as
a
rule
is
perfectly
silent
suddenly
got
hot
and
said
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
i
remember
that
he
treated
the
girl
as
though
she
were
a
marquise
and
that
that
was
doing
for
her
altogether
i
must
add
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
rather
a
respect
for
this
kirillov
what
do
you
suppose
was
the
answer
he
gave
him
you
imagine
mr
kirillov
that
i
am
laughing
at
her
get
rid
of
that
idea
i
really
do
respect
her
for
shes
better
than
any
of
us
and
do
you
know
he
said
it
in
such
a
serious
tone
meanwhile
he
hadnt
really
said
a
word
to
her
for
two
or
three
months
except
good
morning
and
goodbye
i
remember
for
i
was
there
that
she
came
at
last
to
the
point
of
looking
on
him
almost
as
her
betrothed
who
dared
not
elope
with
her
simply
because
he
had
many
enemies
and
family
difficulties
or
something
of
the
sort
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
about
it
it
ended
in
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
making
provision
for
her
when
he
had
to
come
here
and
i
believe
he
arranged
to
pay
a
considerable
sum
three
hundred
roubles
a
year
if
not
more
as
a
pension
for
her
in
short
it
was
all
a
caprice
a
fancy
of
a
man
prematurely
weary
on
his
side
perhapsit
may
even
have
been
as
kirillov
says
a
new
experiment
of
a
blas
man
with
the
object
of
finding
out
what
you
can
bring
a
crazy
cripple
to
you
picked
out
on
purpose
he
said
the
lowest
creature
a
cripple
forever
covered
with
disgrace
and
blows
knowing
too
that
this
creature
was
dying
of
comic
love
for
you
and
set
to
work
to
mystify
her
completely
on
purpose
simply
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
though
how
is
a
man
so
particularly
to
blame
for
the
fancies
of
a
crazy
woman
to
whom
he
had
hardly
uttered
two
sentences
the
whole
time
there
are
things
varvara
petrovna
of
which
it
is
not
only
impossible
to
speak
sensibly
but
its
even
nonsensical
to
begin
speaking
of
them
at
all
well
eccentricity
then
let
it
stand
at
that
anyway
theres
nothing
worse
to
be
said
than
that
and
yet
now
theyve
made
this
scandal
out
of
it

i
am
to
some
extent
aware
varvara
petrovna
of
what
is
happening
here
the
speaker
suddenly
broke
off
and
was
turning
to
lebyadkin
but
varvara
petrovna
checked
him
she
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
exaltation
have
you
finished
she
asked
not
yet
to
complete
my
story
i
should
have
to
ask
this
gentleman
one
or
two
questions
if
youll
allow
me
youll
see
the
point
in
a
minute
varvara
petrovna
enough
afterwards
leave
it
for
the
moment
i
beg
you
oh
i
was
quite
right
to
let
you
speak
and
note
this
varvara
petrovna
pyotr
stepanovitch
said
hastily
could
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
have
explained
all
this
just
now
in
answer
to
your
question
which
was
perhaps
too
peremptory
oh
yes
it
was
and
wasnt
i
right
in
saying
that
in
some
cases
its
much
easier
for
a
third
person
to
explain
things
than
for
the
person
interested
yes
yes
but
in
one
thing
you
were
mistaken
and
i
see
with
regret
are
still
mistaken
really
whats
that
you
see
but
wont
you
sit
down
pyotr
stepanovitch
oh
as
you
please
i
am
tired
indeed
thank
you
he
instantly
moved
up
an
easy
chair
and
turned
it
so
that
he
had
varvara
petrovna
on
one
side
and
praskovya
ivanovna
at
the
table
on
the
other
while
he
faced
lebyadkin
from
whom
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
for
one
minute
you
are
mistaken
in
calling
this
eccentricity
oh
if
its
only
that
no
no
no
wait
a
little
said
varvara
petrovna
who
was
obviously
about
to
say
a
good
deal
and
to
speak
with
enthusiasm
as
soon
as
pyotr
stepanovitch
noticed
it
he
was
all
attention
no
it
was
something
higher
than
eccentricity
and
i
assure
you
something
sacred
even
a
proud
man
who
has
suffered
humiliation
early
in
life
and
reached
the
stage
of
mockery
as
you
so
subtly
called
itprince
harry
in
fact
to
use
the
capital
nickname
stepan
trofimovitch
gave
him
then
which
would
have
been
perfectly
correct
if
it
were
not
that
he
is
more
like
hamlet
to
my
thinking
at
least
et
vous
avez
raison
stepan
trofimovitch
pronounced
impressively
and
with
feeling
thank
you
stepan
trofimovitch
i
thank
you
particularly
too
for
your
unvarying
faith
in
nicolas
in
the
loftiness
of
his
soul
and
of
his
destiny
that
faith
you
have
even
strengthened
in
me
when
i
was
losing
heart
chre
chre
stepan
trofimovitch
was
stepping
forward
when
he
checked
himself
reflecting
that
it
was
dangerous
to
interrupt
and
if
nicolas
had
always
had
at
his
side
varvara
petrovna
almost
shouted
a
gentle
horatio
great
in
his
humilityanother
excellent
expression
of
yours
stepan
trofimovitchhe
might
long
ago
have
been
saved
from
the
sad
and
sudden
demon
of
irony
which
has
tormented
him
all
his
life
the
demon
of
irony
was
a
wonderful
expression
of
yours
again
stepan
trofimovitch
but
nicolas
has
never
had
an
horatio
or
an
ophelia
he
had
no
one
but
his
mother
and
what
can
a
mother
do
alone
and
in
such
circumstances
do
you
know
pyotr
stepanovitch
its
perfectly
comprehensible
to
me
now
that
a
being
like
nicolas
could
be
found
even
in
such
filthy
haunts
as
you
have
described
i
can
so
clearly
picture
now
that
mockery
of
life
a
wonderfully
subtle
expression
of
yours
that
insatiable
thirst
of
contrast
that
gloomy
background
against
which
he
stands
out
like
a
diamond
to
use
your
comparison
again
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
then
he
meets
there
a
creature
illtreated
by
every
one
crippled
half
insane
and
at
the
same
time
perhaps
filled
with
noble
feelings
hm
yes
perhaps
and
after
that
you
dont
understand
that
hes
not
laughing
at
her
like
every
one
oh
you
people
you
cant
understand
his
defending
her
from
insult
treating
her
with
respect
like
a
marquise
this
kirillov
must
have
an
exceptionally
deep
understanding
of
men
though
he
didnt
understand
nicolas
it
was
just
this
contrast
if
you
like
that
led
to
the
trouble
if
the
unhappy
creature
had
been
in
different
surroundings
perhaps
she
would
never
have
been
brought
to
entertain
such
a
frantic
delusion
only
a
woman
can
understand
it
pyotr
stepanovitch
only
a
woman
how
sorry
i
am
that
you
not
that
youre
not
a
woman
but
that
you
cant
be
one
just
for
the
moment
so
as
to
understand
you
mean
in
the
sense
that
the
worse
things
are
the
better
it
is
i
understand
i
understand
varvara
petrovna
its
rather
as
it
is
in
religion
the
harder
life
is
for
a
man
or
the
more
crushed
and
poor
the
people
are
the
more
obstinately
they
dream
of
compensation
in
heaven
and
if
a
hundred
thousand
priests
are
at
work
at
it
too
inflaming
their
delusion
and
speculating
on
it
then
i
understand
you
varvara
petrovna
i
assure
you
thats
not
quite
it
but
tell
me
ought
nicolas
to
have
laughed
at
her
and
have
treated
her
as
the
other
clerks
in
order
to
extinguish
the
delusion
in
this
unhappy
organism
why
varvara
petrovna
used
the
word
organism
i
couldnt
understand
can
you
really
refuse
to
recognise
the
lofty
compassion
the
noble
tremor
of
the
whole
organism
with
which
nicolas
answered
kirillov
i
do
not
laugh
at
her
a
noble
sacred
answer
sublime
muttered
stepan
trofimovitch
and
observe
too
that
he
is
by
no
means
so
rich
as
you
suppose
the
money
is
mine
and
not
his
and
he
would
take
next
to
nothing
from
me
then
i
understand
i
understand
all
that
varvara
petrovna
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
with
a
movement
of
some
impatience
oh
its
my
character
i
recognise
myself
in
nicolas
i
recognise
that
youthfulness
that
liability
to
violent
tempestuous
impulses
and
if
we
ever
come
to
be
friends
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
for
my
part
i
sincerely
hope
we
may
especially
as
i
am
so
deeply
indebted
to
you
then
perhaps
youll
understand
oh
i
assure
you
i
hope
for
it
too
pyotr
stepanovitch
muttered
jerkily
youll
understand
then
the
impulse
which
leads
one
in
the
blindness
of
generous
feeling
to
take
up
a
man
who
is
unworthy
of
one
in
every
respect
a
man
who
utterly
fails
to
understand
one
who
is
ready
to
torture
one
at
every
opportunity
and
in
contradiction
to
everything
to
exalt
such
a
man
into
a
sort
of
ideal
into
a
dream
to
concentrate
in
him
all
ones
hopes
to
bow
down
before
him
to
love
him
all
ones
life
absolutely
without
knowing
whyperhaps
just
because
he
was
unworthy
of
it
oh
how
ive
suffered
all
my
life
pyotr
stepanovitch
stepan
trofimovitch
with
a
look
of
suffering
on
his
face
began
trying
to
catch
my
eye
but
i
turned
away
in
time

and
only
lately
only
latelyoh
how
unjust
ive
been
to
nicolas

you
would
not
believe
how
they
have
been
worrying
me
on
all
sides
all
all
enemies
and
rascals
and
friends
friends
perhaps
more
than
enemies
when
the
first
contemptible
anonymous
letter
was
sent
to
me
pyotr
stepanovitch
youll
hardly
believe
it
but
i
had
not
strength
enough
to
treat
all
this
wickedness
with
contempt
i
shall
never
never
forgive
myself
for
my
weakness
i
had
heard
something
of
anonymous
letters
here
already
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
growing
suddenly
more
lively
and
ill
find
out
the
writers
of
them
you
may
be
sure
but
you
cant
imagine
the
intrigues
that
have
been
got
up
here
they
have
even
been
pestering
our
poor
praskovya
ivanovna
and
what
reason
can
they
have
for
worrying
her
i
was
quite
unfair
to
you
today
perhaps
my
dear
praskovya
ivanovna
she
added
in
a
generous
impulse
of
kindliness
though
not
without
a
certain
triumphant
irony
dont
say
any
more
my
dear
the
other
lady
muttered
reluctantly
to
my
thinking
wed
better
make
an
end
of
all
this
too
much
has
been
said
and
again
she
looked
timidly
towards
liza
but
the
latter
was
looking
at
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
i
intend
now
to
adopt
this
poor
unhappy
creature
this
insane
woman
who
has
lost
everything
and
kept
only
her
heart
varvara
petrovna
exclaimed
suddenly
its
a
sacred
duty
i
intend
to
carry
out
i
take
her
under
my
protection
from
this
day
and
that
will
be
a
very
good
thing
in
one
way
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
growing
quite
eager
again
excuse
me
i
did
not
finish
just
now
its
just
the
care
of
her
i
want
to
speak
of
would
you
believe
it
that
as
soon
as
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
gone
im
beginning
from
where
i
left
off
varvara
petrovna
this
gentleman
here
this
mr
lebyadkin
instantly
imagined
he
had
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
whole
pension
that
was
provided
for
his
sister
and
he
did
dispose
of
it
i
dont
know
exactly
how
it
had
been
arranged
by
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
at
that
time
but
a
year
later
when
he
learned
from
abroad
what
had
happened
he
was
obliged
to
make
other
arrangements
again
i
dont
know
the
details
hell
tell
you
them
himself
i
only
know
that
the
interesting
young
person
was
placed
somewhere
in
a
remote
nunnery
in
very
comfortable
surroundings
but
under
friendly
superintendenceyou
understand
but
what
do
you
think
mr
lebyadkin
made
up
his
mind
to
do
he
exerted
himself
to
the
utmost
to
begin
with
to
find
where
his
source
of
income
that
is
his
sister
was
hidden
only
lately
he
attained
his
object
took
her
from
the
nunnery
asserting
some
claim
to
her
and
brought
her
straight
here
here
he
doesnt
feed
her
properly
beats
her
and
bullies
her
as
soon
as
by
some
means
he
gets
a
considerable
sum
from
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
he
does
nothing
but
get
drunk
and
instead
of
gratitude
ends
by
impudently
defying
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
making
senseless
demands
threatening
him
with
proceedings
if
the
pension
is
not
paid
straight
into
his
hands
so
he
takes
what
is
a
voluntary
gift
from
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
as
a
taxcan
you
imagine
it
mr
lebyadkin
is
that
all
true
that
i
have
said
just
now
the
captain
who
had
till
that
moment
stood
in
silence
looking
down
took
two
rapid
steps
forward
and
turned
crimson
pyotr
stepanovitch
youve
treated
me
cruelly
he
brought
out
abruptly
why
cruelly
how
but
allow
us
to
discuss
the
question
of
cruelty
or
gentleness
later
on
now
answer
my
first
question
is
it
true
all
that
i
have
said
or
not
if
you
consider
its
false
you
are
at
liberty
to
give
your
own
version
at
once
i
you
know
yourself
pyotr
stepanovitch
the
captain
muttered
but
he
could
not
go
on
and
relapsed
into
silence
it
must
be
observed
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
with
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
while
the
captain
stood
before
him
in
the
most
respectful
attitude
lebyadkins
hesitation
seemed
to
annoy
pyotr
stepanovitch
a
spasm
of
anger
distorted
his
face
then
you
have
a
statement
you
want
to
make
he
said
looking
subtly
at
the
captain
kindly
speak
were
waiting
for
you
you
know
yourself
pyotr
stepanovitch
that
i
cant
say
anything
no
i
dont
know
it
its
the
first
time
ive
heard
it
why
cant
you
speak
the
captain
was
silent
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
allow
me
to
go
pyotr
stepanovitch
he
brought
out
resolutely
no
not
till
you
answer
my
question
is
it
all
true
that
ive
said
it
is
true
lebyadkin
brought
out
in
a
hollow
voice
looking
at
his
tormentor
drops
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
forehead
is
it
all
true
its
all
true
have
you
nothing
to
add
or
to
observe
if
you
think
that
weve
been
unjust
say
so
protest
state
your
grievance
aloud
no
i
think
nothing
did
you
threaten
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
lately
it
was
it
was
more
drink
than
anything
pyotr
stepanovitch
he
suddenly
raised
his
head
if
family
honour
and
undeserved
disgrace
cry
out
among
men
thenthen
is
a
man
to
blame
he
roared
suddenly
forgetting
himself
as
before
are
you
sober
now
mr
lebyadkin
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
at
him
penetratingly
i
am
sober
what
do
you
mean
by
family
honour
and
undeserved
disgrace
i
didnt
mean
anybody
anybody
at
all
i
meant
myself
the
captain
said
collapsing
again
you
seem
to
be
very
much
offended
by
what
ive
said
about
you
and
your
conduct
you
are
very
irritable
mr
lebyadkin
but
let
me
tell
you
ive
hardly
begun
yet
what
ive
got
to
say
about
your
conduct
in
its
real
sense
ill
begin
to
discuss
your
conduct
in
its
real
sense
i
shall
begin
that
may
very
well
happen
but
so
far
ive
not
begun
in
a
real
sense
lebyadkin
started
and
stared
wildly
at
pyotr
stepanovitch
pyotr
stepanovitch
i
am
just
beginning
to
wake
up
hm
and
its
i
who
have
waked
you
up
yes
its
you
who
have
waked
me
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
ive
been
asleep
for
the
last
four
years
with
a
stormcloud
hanging
over
me
may
i
withdraw
at
last
pyotr
stepanovitch
now
you
may
unless
varvara
petrovna
thinks
it
necessary
but
the
latter
dismissed
him
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
the
captain
bowed
took
two
steps
towards
the
door
stopped
suddenly
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
tried
to
say
something
did
not
say
it
and
was
moving
quickly
away
but
in
the
doorway
he
came
face
to
face
with
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
the
latter
stood
aside
the
captain
shrank
into
himself
as
it
were
before
him
and
stood
as
though
frozen
to
the
spot
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
like
a
rabbit
before
a
boaconstrictor
after
a
little
pause
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
waved
him
aside
with
a
slight
motion
of
his
hand
and
walked
into
the
drawingroom
vii
he
was
cheerful
and
serene
perhaps
something
very
pleasant
had
happened
to
him
of
which
we
knew
nothing
as
yet
but
he
seemed
particularly
contented
do
you
forgive
me
nicolas
varvara
petrovna
hastened
to
say
and
got
up
suddenly
to
meet
him
but
nicolas
positively
laughed
just
as
i
thought
he
said
goodhumouredly
and
jestingly
i
see
you
know
all
about
it
already
when
i
had
gone
from
here
i
reflected
in
the
carriage
that
i
ought
at
least
to
have
told
you
the
story
instead
of
going
off
like
that
but
when
i
remembered
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
still
here
i
thought
no
more
of
it
as
he
spoke
he
took
a
cursory
look
round
pyotr
stepanovitch
told
us
an
old
petersburg
episode
in
the
life
of
a
queer
fellow
varvara
petrovna
rejoined
enthusiasticallya
mad
and
capricious
fellow
though
always
lofty
in
his
feelings
always
chivalrous
and
noble
chivalrous
you
dont
mean
to
say
its
come
to
that
laughed
nicolas
however
im
very
grateful
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
for
being
in
such
a
hurry
this
time
he
exchanged
a
rapid
glance
with
the
latter
you
must
know
maman
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
is
the
universal
peacemaker
thats
his
part
in
life
his
weakness
his
hobby
and
i
particularly
recommend
him
to
you
from
that
point
of
view
i
can
guess
what
a
yarn
hes
been
spinning
hes
a
great
hand
at
spinning
them
he
has
a
perfect
recordoffice
in
his
head
hes
such
a
realist
you
know
that
he
cant
tell
a
lie
and
prefers
truthfulness
to
effect
except
of
course
in
special
cases
when
effect
is
more
important
than
truth
as
he
said
this
he
was
still
looking
about
him
so
you
see
clearly
maman
that
its
not
for
you
to
ask
my
forgiveness
and
if
theres
any
craziness
about
this
affair
its
my
fault
and
it
proves
that
when
alls
said
and
done
i
really
am
mad
i
must
keep
up
my
character
here
then
he
tenderly
embraced
his
mother
in
any
case
the
subject
has
been
fully
discussed
and
is
done
with
he
added
and
there
was
a
rather
dry
and
resolute
note
in
his
voice
varvara
petrovna
understood
that
note
but
her
exaltation
was
not
damped
quite
the
contrary
i
didnt
expect
you
for
another
month
nicolas
i
will
explain
everything
to
you
maman
of
course
but
now
and
he
went
towards
praskovya
ivanovna
but
she
scarcely
turned
her
head
towards
him
though
she
had
been
completely
overwhelmed
by
his
first
appearance
now
she
had
fresh
anxieties
to
think
of
at
the
moment
the
captain
had
stumbled
upon
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
as
he
was
going
out
liza
had
suddenly
begun
laughingat
first
quietly
and
intermittently
but
her
laughter
grew
more
and
more
violent
louder
and
more
conspicuous
she
flushed
crimson
in
striking
contrast
with
her
gloomy
expression
just
before
while
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
talking
to
varvara
petrovna
she
had
twice
beckoned
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
as
though
she
wanted
to
whisper
something
to
him
but
as
soon
as
the
young
man
bent
down
to
her
she
instantly
burst
into
laughter
so
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
was
at
poor
mavriky
nikolaevitch
that
she
was
laughing
she
evidently
tried
to
control
herself
however
and
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
lips
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
turned
to
greet
her
with
a
most
innocent
and
openhearted
air
please
excuse
me
she
responded
speaking
quickly
you
youve
seen
mavriky
nikolaevitch
of
course
my
goodness
how
inexcusably
tall
you
are
mavriky
nikolaevitch
and
laughter
again
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
tall
but
by
no
means
inexcusably
so
have
you
been
here
long
she
muttered
restraining
herself
again
genuinely
embarrassed
though
her
eyes
were
shining
more
than
two
hours
answered
nicolas
looking
at
her
intently
i
may
remark
that
he
was
exceptionally
reserved
and
courteous
but
that
apart
from
his
courtesy
his
expression
was
utterly
indifferent
even
listless
and
where
are
you
going
to
stay
here
varvara
petrovna
too
was
watching
liza
but
she
was
suddenly
struck
by
an
idea
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
nicolas
more
than
two
hours
she
said
going
up
to
him
the
train
comes
in
at
ten
oclock
i
first
took
pyotr
stepanovitch
to
kirillovs
i
came
across
pyotr
stepanovitch
at
matveyev
three
stations
away
and
we
travelled
together
i
had
been
waiting
at
matveyev
since
sunrise
put
in
pyotr
stepanovitch
the
last
carriages
of
our
train
ran
off
the
rails
in
the
night
and
we
nearly
had
our
legs
broken
your
legs
broken
cried
liza
maman
maman
you
and
i
meant
to
go
to
matveyev
last
week
we
should
have
broken
our
legs
too
heaven
have
mercy
on
us
cried
praskovya
ivanovna
crossing
herself
maman
maman
dear
maman
you
mustnt
be
frightened
if
i
break
both
my
legs
it
may
so
easily
happen
to
me
you
say
yourself
that
i
ride
so
recklessly
every
day
mavriky
nikolaevitch
will
you
go
about
with
me
when
im
lame
she
began
giggling
again
if
it
does
happen
i
wont
let
anyone
take
me
about
but
you
you
can
reckon
on
that
well
suppose
i
break
only
one
leg
come
be
polite
say
youll
think
it
a
pleasure
a
pleasure
to
be
crippled
said
mavriky
nikolaevitch
frowning
gravely
but
then
youll
lead
me
about
only
you
and
no
one
else
even
then
itll
be
you
leading
me
about
lizaveta
nikolaevna
murmured
mavriky
nikolaevitch
even
more
gravely
why
hes
trying
to
make
a
joke
cried
liza
almost
in
dismay
mavriky
nikolaevitch
dont
you
ever
dare
take
to
that
but
what
an
egoist
you
are
i
am
certain
that
to
your
credit
youre
slandering
yourself
it
will
be
quite
the
contrary
from
morning
till
night
youll
assure
me
that
i
have
become
more
charming
for
having
lost
my
leg
theres
one
insurmountable
difficultyyoure
so
fearfully
tall
and
when
ive
lost
my
leg
i
shall
be
so
very
tiny
how
will
you
be
able
to
take
me
on
your
arm
we
shall
look
a
strange
couple
and
she
laughed
hysterically
her
jests
and
insinuations
were
feeble
but
she
was
not
capable
of
considering
the
effect
she
was
producing
hysterics
pyotr
stepanovitch
whispered
to
me
a
glass
of
water
make
haste
he
was
right
a
minute
later
every
one
was
fussing
about
water
was
brought
liza
embraced
her
mother
kissed
her
warmly
wept
on
her
shoulder
then
drawing
back
and
looking
her
in
the
face
she
fell
to
laughing
again
the
mother
too
began
whimpering
varvara
petrovna
made
haste
to
carry
them
both
off
to
her
own
rooms
going
out
by
the
same
door
by
which
darya
pavlovna
had
come
to
us
but
they
were
not
away
long
not
more
than
four
minutes
i
am
trying
to
remember
now
every
detail
of
these
last
moments
of
that
memorable
morning
i
remember
that
when
we
were
left
without
the
ladies
except
darya
pavlovna
who
had
not
moved
from
her
seat
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
made
the
round
greeting
us
all
except
shatov
who
still
sat
in
his
corner
his
head
more
bowed
than
ever
stepan
trofimovitch
was
beginning
something
very
witty
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
but
the
latter
turned
away
hurriedly
to
darya
pavlovna
but
before
he
reached
her
pyotr
stepanovitch
caught
him
and
drew
him
away
almost
violently
towards
the
window
where
he
whispered
something
quickly
to
him
apparently
something
very
important
to
judge
by
the
expression
of
his
face
and
the
gestures
that
accompanied
the
whisper
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
listened
inattentively
and
listlessly
with
his
official
smile
and
at
last
even
impatiently
and
seemed
all
the
time
on
the
point
of
breaking
away
he
moved
away
from
the
window
just
as
the
ladies
came
back
varvara
petrovna
made
liza
sit
down
in
the
same
seat
as
before
declaring
that
she
must
wait
and
rest
another
ten
minutes
and
that
the
fresh
air
would
perhaps
be
too
much
for
her
nerves
at
once
she
was
looking
after
liza
with
great
devotion
and
sat
down
beside
her
pyotr
stepanovitch
now
disengaged
skipped
up
to
them
at
once
and
broke
into
a
rapid
and
lively
flow
of
conversation
at
that
point
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
at
last
went
up
to
darya
pavlovna
with
his
leisurely
step
dasha
began
stirring
uneasily
at
his
approach
and
jumped
up
quickly
in
evident
embarrassment
flushing
all
over
her
face
i
believe
one
may
congratulate
you
or
is
it
too
soon
he
brought
out
with
a
peculiar
line
in
his
face
dasha
made
him
some
answer
but
it
was
difficult
to
catch
it
forgive
my
indiscretion
he
added
raising
his
voice
but
you
know
i
was
expressly
informed
did
you
know
about

expressly
informed

not
done
any
harm
by
my
congratulations
he
laughed
and
if
stepan
trofimovitch
what
whats
the
congratulation
about
pyotr
stepanovitch
suddenly
skipped
up
to
them
what
are
you
being
congratulated
about
darya
pavlovna
bah
surely
thats
not
it

blush

right
and
indeed
what
else
does
one
congratulate
our
charming
and
virtuous
young
ladies
on
and
what
congratulations
make
them
blush
most
readily
well

mine
too
then
if
ive
guessed
right
and
pay
up
do
you
remember
when

in
switzerland

almost
forgetting

turned
quickly
to
stepan
trofimovitch
when
are

to
switzerland
i
to
switzerland

trofimovitch

wondering
and
confused

wrote
pierre
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
well

pierre

if
thatll
please
you
ive
flown
here
to
announce
that
im
not
at
all
against
it
since
you
were
set
on
having
my
opinion
as
quickly
as
possible
and
if
indeed
he
pattered
on
you
want
to
be
saved
as
you
wrote
beseeching
my
help
in
the
same
letter
i
am
at
your
service
again
is
it
true
that
he
is
going
to
be
married
varvara
petrovna
he
turned
quickly
to
her
i
hope
im
not
being
indiscreet
he
writes
himself
that
the
whole
town
knows
it
and
every
ones
congratulating
him
so
that
to
avoid
it
he
only
goes
out
at
night
ive
got
his
letters
in
my
pocket
but
would
you
believe
it
varvara
petrovna
i
cant
make
head
or
tail
of
it
just
tell
me
one
thing
stepan
trofimovitch
are
you
to
be
congratulated
or
are
you
to
be
saved
you
wouldnt
believe
it
in
one
line
hes
despairing
and
in
the
next
hes
most
joyful
to
begin
with
he
begs
my
forgiveness
well
of
course
thats
their
way
though
it
must
be
said
fancy
the
mans
only
seen
me
twice
in
his
life
and
then
by
accident
and
suddenly
now
when
hes
going
to
be
married
for
the
third
time
he
imagines
that
this
is
a
breach
of
some
sort
of
parental
duty
to
me
and
entreats
me
a
thousand
miles
away
not
to
be
angry
and
to
allow
him
to
please
dont
be
hurt
stepan
trofimovitch
its
characteristic
of
your
generation
i
take
a
broad
view
of
it
and
dont
blame
you
and
lets
admit
it
does
you
honour
and
all
the
rest
but
the
point
is
again
that
i
dont
see
the
point
of
it
theres
something
about
some
sort
of
sins
in
switzerland
im
getting
married
he
says
for
my
sins
or
on
account
of
the
sins
of
another
or
whatever
it
issins
anyway
the
girl
says
he
is
a
pearl
and
a
diamond
and
well
of
course
hes
unworthy
of
her
its
their
way
of
talking
but
on
account
of
some
sins
or
circumstances
he
is
obliged
to
lead
her
to
the
altar
and
go
to
switzerland
and
therefore
abandon
everything
and
fly
to
save
me
do
you
understand
anything
of
all
that
however
however
i
notice
from
the
expression
of
your
faceshe
turned
about
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
looking
with
an
innocent
smile
into
the
faces
of
the
companythat
as
usual
i
seem
to
have
put
my
foot
in
it
through
my
stupid
way
of
being
open
or
as
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
says
being
in
a
hurry
i
thought
of
course
that
we
were
all
friends
here
that
is
your
friends
stepan
trofimovitch
your
friends
i
am
really
a
stranger
and
i
see
and
i
see
that
you
all
know
something
and
that
just
that
something
i
dont
know
he
still
went
on
looking
about
him
so
stepan
trofimovitch
wrote
to
you
that
he
was
getting
married
for
the
sins
of
another
committed
in
switzerland
and
that
you
were
to
fly
here
to
save
him
in
those
very
words
said
varvara
petrovna
addressing
him
suddenly
her
face
was
yellow
and
distorted
and
her
lips
were
twitching
well
you
see
if
theres
anything
ive
not
understood
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
as
though
in
alarm
talking
more
quickly
than
ever
its
his
fault
of
course
for
writing
like
that
heres
the
letter
you
know
varvara
petrovna
his
letters
are
endless
and
incessant
and
you
know
for
the
last
two
or
three
months
there
has
been
letter
upon
letter
till
i
must
own
at
last
i
sometimes
didnt
read
them
through
forgive
me
stepan
trofimovitch
for
my
foolish
confession
but
you
must
admit
please
that
though
you
addressed
them
to
me
you
wrote
them
more
for
posterity
so
that
you
really
cant
mind
come
come
dont
be
offended
were
friends
anyway
but
this
letter
varvara
petrovna
this
letter
i
did
read
through
these
sinsthese
sins
of
anotherare
probably
some
little
sins
of
our
own
and
i
dont
mind
betting
very
innocent
ones
though
they
have
suddenly
made
us
take
a
fancy
to
work
up
a
terrible
story
with
a
glamour
of
the
heroic
about
it
and
its
just
for
the
sake
of
that
glamour
weve
got
it
up
you
see
theres
something
a
little
lame
about
our
accountsit
must
be
confessed
in
the
end
weve
a
great
weakness
for
cards
you
know
but
this
is
unnecessary
quite
unnecessary
im
sorry
i
chatter
too
much
but
upon
my
word
varvara
petrovna
he
gave
me
a
fright
and
i
really
was
half
prepared
to
save
him
he
really
made
me
feel
ashamed
did
he
expect
me
to
hold
a
knife
to
his
throat
or
what
am
i
such
a
merciless
creditor
he
writes
something
here
of
a
dowry
but
are
you
really
going
to
get
married
stepan
trofimovitch
that
would
be
just
like
you
to
say
a
lot
for
the
sake
of
talking
ach
varvara
petrovna
im
sure
you
must
be
blaming
me
now
and
just
for
my
way
of
talking
too
on
the
contrary
on
the
contrary
i
see
that
you
are
driven
out
of
all
patience
and
no
doubt
you
have
had
good
reason
varvara
petrovna
answered
spitefully
she
had
listened
with
spiteful
enjoyment
to
all
the
candid
outbursts
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
who
was
obviously
playing
a
part
what
part
i
did
not
know
then
but
it
was
unmistakable
and
overacted
indeed
on
the
contrary
she
went
on
im
only
too
grateful
to
you
for
speaking
but
for
you
i
might
not
have
known
of
it
my
eyes
are
opened
for
the
first
time
for
twenty
years
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
you
said
just
now
that
you
had
been
expressly
informed
surely
stepan
trofimovitch
hasnt
written
to
you
in
the
same
style
i
did
get
a
very
harmless
and
and
very
generous
letter
from
him
you
hesitate
you
pick
out
your
words
thats
enough
stepan
trofimovitch
i
request
a
great
favour
from
you
she
suddenly
turned
to
him
with
flashing
eyes
kindly
leave
us
at
once
and
never
set
foot
in
my
house
again
i
must
beg
the
reader
to
remember
her
recent
exaltation
which
had
not
yet
passed
its
true
that
stepan
trofimovitch
was
terribly
to
blame
but
what
was
a
complete
surprise
to
me
then
was
the
wonderful
dignity
of
his
bearing
under
his
sons
accusation
which
he
had
never
thought
of
interrupting
and
before
varvara
petrovnas
denunciation
how
did
he
come
by
such
spirit
i
only
found
out
one
thing
that
he
had
certainly
been
deeply
wounded
at
his
first
meeting
with
petrusha
by
the
way
he
had
embraced
him
it
was
a
deep
and
genuine
grief
at
least
in
his
eyes
and
to
his
heart
he
had
another
grief
at
the
same
time
that
is
the
poignant
consciousness
of
having
acted
contemptibly
he
admitted
this
to
me
afterwards
with
perfect
openness
and
you
know
real
genuine
sorrow
will
sometimes
make
even
a
phenomenally
frivolous
unstable
man
solid
and
stoical
for
a
short
time
at
any
rate
whats
more
even
fools
are
by
genuine
sorrow
turned
into
wise
men
also
only
for
a
short
time
of
course
it
is
characteristic
of
sorrow
and
if
so
what
might
not
happen
with
a
man
like
stepan
trofimovitch
it
worked
a
complete
transformationthough
also
only
for
a
time
of
course
he
bowed
with
dignity
to
varvara
petrovna
without
uttering
a
word
there
was
nothing
else
left
for
him
to
do
indeed
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
without
a
word
but
could
not
refrain
from
approaching
darya
pavlovna
she
seemed
to
foresee
that
he
would
do
so
for
she
began
speaking
of
her
own
accord
herself
in
utter
dismay
as
though
in
haste
to
anticipate
him
please
stepan
trofimovitch
for
gods
sake
dont
say
anything
she
began
speaking
with
haste
and
excitement
with
a
look
of
pain
in
her
face
hurriedly
stretching
out
her
hands
to
him
be
sure
that
i
still
respect
you
as
much
and
think
just
as
highly
of
you
and
think
well
of
me
too
stepan
trofimovitch
that
will
mean
a
great
deal
to
me
a
great
deal
stepan
trofimovitch
made
her
a
very
very
low
bow
its
for
you
to
decide
darya
pavlovna
you
know
that
you
are
perfectly
free
in
the
whole
matter
you
have
been
and
you
are
now
and
you
always
will
be
varvara
petrovna
concluded
impressively
bah
now
i
understand
it
all
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
slapping
himself
on
the
forehead
but
but
what
a
position
i
am
put
in
by
all
this
darya
pavlovna
please
forgive
me
what
do
you
call
your
treatment
of
me
eh
he
said
addressing
his
father
pierre
you
might
speak
to
me
differently
mightnt
you
my
boy
stepan
trofimovitch
observed
quite
quietly
dont
cry
out
please
said
pierre
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
believe
me
its
all
your
sick
old
nerves
and
crying
out
will
do
no
good
at
all
youd
better
tell
me
instead
why
didnt
you
warn
me
since
you
might
have
supposed
i
should
speak
out
at
the
first
chance
stepan
trofimovitch
looked
searchingly
at
him
pierre
you
who
know
so
much
of
what
goes
on
here
can
you
really
have
known
nothing
of
this
business
and
have
heard
nothing
about
it
what
what
a
set
so
its
not
enough
to
be
a
child
in
your
old
age
you
must
be
a
spiteful
child
too
varvara
petrovna
did
you
hear
what
he
said
there
was
a
general
outcry
but
then
suddenly
an
incident
took
place
which
no
one
could
have
anticipated
viii
first
of
all
i
must
mention
that
for
the
last
two
or
three
minutes
lizaveta
nikolaevna
had
seemed
to
be
possessed
by
a
new
impulse
she
was
whispering
something
hurriedly
to
her
mother
and
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
bent
down
to
listen
her
face
was
agitated
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
a
look
of
resolution
at
last
she
got
up
from
her
seat
in
evident
haste
to
go
away
and
hurried
her
mother
whom
mavriky
nikolaevitch
began
helping
up
from
her
low
chair
but
it
seemed
they
were
not
destined
to
get
away
without
seeing
everything
to
the
end
shatov
who
had
been
forgotten
by
every
one
in
his
corner
not
far
from
lizaveta
nikolaevna
and
who
did
not
seem
to
know
himself
why
he
went
on
sitting
there
got
up
from
his
chair
and
walked
without
haste
with
resolute
steps
right
across
the
room
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
the
latter
noticed
him
approaching
at
some
distance
and
faintly
smiled
but
when
shatov
was
close
to
him
he
left
off
smiling
when
shatov
stood
still
facing
him
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
without
uttering
a
word
every
one
suddenly
noticed
it
and
there
was
a
general
hush
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
the
last
to
cease
speaking
liza
and
her
mother
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
so
passed
five
seconds
the
look
of
haughty
astonishment
was
followed
by
one
of
anger
on
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
face
he
scowled
and
suddenly
shatov
swung
his
long
heavy
arm
and
with
all
his
might
struck
him
a
blow
in
the
face
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
staggered
violently
shatov
struck
the
blow
in
a
peculiar
way
not
at
all
after
the
conventional
fashion
if
one
may
use
such
an
expression
it
was
not
a
slap
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
but
a
blow
with
the
whole
fist
and
it
was
a
big
heavy
bony
fist
covered
with
red
hairs
and
freckles
if
the
blow
had
struck
the
nose
it
would
have
broken
it
but
it
hit
him
on
the
cheek
and
struck
the
left
corner
of
the
lip
and
the
upper
teeth
from
which
blood
streamed
at
once
i
believe
there
was
a
sudden
scream
perhaps
varvara
petrovna
screamedthat
i
dont
remember
because
there
was
a
dead
hush
again
the
whole
scene
did
not
last
more
than
ten
seconds
however
yet
a
very
great
deal
happened
in
those
seconds
i
must
remind
the
reader
again
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
was
one
of
those
natures
that
know
nothing
of
fear
at
a
duel
he
could
face
the
pistol
of
his
opponent
with
indifference
and
could
take
aim
and
kill
with
brutal
coolness
if
anyone
had
slapped
him
in
the
face
i
should
have
expected
him
not
to
challenge
his
assailant
to
a
duel
but
to
murder
him
on
the
spot
he
was
just
one
of
those
characters
and
would
have
killed
the
man
knowing
very
well
what
he
was
doing
and
without
losing
his
selfcontrol
i
fancy
indeed
that
he
never
was
liable
to
those
fits
of
blind
rage
which
deprive
a
man
of
all
power
of
reflection
even
when
overcome
with
intense
anger
as
he
sometimes
was
he
was
always
able
to
retain
complete
selfcontrol
and
therefore
to
realise
that
he
would
certainly
be
sent
to
penal
servitude
for
murdering
a
man
not
in
a
duel
nevertheless
hed
have
killed
any
one
who
insulted
him
and
without
the
faintest
hesitation
i
have
been
studying
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
of
late
and
through
special
circumstances
i
know
a
great
many
facts
about
him
now
at
the
time
i
write
i
should
compare
him
perhaps
with
some
gentlemen
of
the
past
of
whom
legendary
traditions
are
still
perceived
among
us
we
are
told
for
instance
about
the
decabrist
ln
that
he
was
always
seeking
for
danger
that
he
revelled
in
the
sensation
and
that
it
had
become
a
craving
of
his
nature
that
in
his
youth
he
had
rushed
into
duels
for
nothing
that
in
siberia
he
used
to
go
to
kill
bears
with
nothing
but
a
knife
that
in
the
siberian
forests
he
liked
to
meet
with
runaway
convicts
who
are
i
may
observe
in
passing
more
formidable
than
bears
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
legendary
gentlemen
were
capable
of
a
feeling
of
fear
and
even
to
an
extreme
degree
perhaps
or
they
would
have
been
a
great
deal
quieter
and
a
sense
of
danger
would
never
have
become
a
physical
craving
with
them
but
the
conquest
of
fear
was
what
fascinated
them
the
continual
ecstasy
of
vanquishing
and
the
consciousness
that
no
one
could
vanquish
them
was
what
attracted
them
the
same
ln
struggled
with
hunger
for
some
time
before
he
was
sent
into
exile
and
toiled
to
earn
his
daily
bread
simply
because
he
did
not
care
to
comply
with
the
requests
of
his
rich
father
which
he
considered
unjust
so
his
conception
of
struggle
was
manysided
and
he
did
not
prize
stoicism
and
strength
of
character
only
in
duels
and
bearfights
but
many
years
have
passed
since
those
times
and
the
nervous
exhausted
complex
character
of
the
men
of
today
is
incompatible
with
the
craving
for
those
direct
and
unmixed
sensations
which
were
so
sought
after
by
some
restlessly
active
gentlemen
of
the
good
old
days
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
would
perhaps
have
looked
down
on
ln
and
have
called
him
a
boastful
cockahoop
coward
its
true
he
wouldnt
have
expressed
himself
aloud
stavrogin
would
have
shot
his
opponent
in
a
duel
and
would
have
faced
a
bear
if
necessary
and
would
have
defended
himself
from
a
brigand
in
the
forest
as
successfully
and
as
fearlessly
as
ln
but
it
would
be
without
the
slightest
thrill
of
enjoyment
languidly
listlessly
even
with
ennui
and
entirely
from
unpleasant
necessity
in
anger
of
course
there
has
been
a
progress
compared
with
ln
even
compared
with
lermontov
there
was
perhaps
more
malignant
anger
in
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
than
in
both
put
together
but
it
was
a
calm
cold
if
one
may
so
say
reasonable
anger
and
therefore
the
most
revolting
and
most
terrible
possible
i
repeat
again
i
considered
him
then
and
i
still
consider
him
now
that
everything
is
over
a
man
who
if
he
received
a
slap
in
the
face
or
any
equivalent
insult
would
be
certain
to
kill
his
assailant
at
once
on
the
spot
without
challenging
him
yet
in
the
present
case
what
happened
was
something
different
and
amazing
he
had
scarcely
regained
his
balance
after
being
almost
knocked
over
in
this
humiliating
way
and
the
horrible
as
it
were
sodden
thud
of
the
blow
in
the
face
had
scarcely
died
away
in
the
room
when
he
seized
shatov
by
the
shoulders
with
both
hands
but
at
once
almost
at
the
same
instant
pulled
both
hands
away
and
clasped
them
behind
his
back
he
did
not
speak
but
looked
at
shatov
and
turned
as
white
as
his
shirt
but
strange
to
say
the
light
in
his
eyes
seemed
to
die
out
ten
seconds
later
his
eyes
looked
cold
and
im
sure
im
not
lyingcalm
only
he
was
terribly
pale
of
course
i
dont
know
what
was
passing
within
the
man
i
saw
only
his
exterior
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
man
should
snatch
up
a
bar
of
redhot
iron
and
hold
it
tight
in
his
hand
to
test
his
fortitude
and
after
struggling
for
ten
seconds
with
insufferable
pain
end
by
overcoming
it
such
a
man
would
i
fancy
go
through
something
like
what
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
enduring
during
those
ten
seconds
shatov
was
the
first
to
drop
his
eyes
and
evidently
because
he
was
unable
to
go
on
facing
him
then
he
turned
slowly
and
walked
out
of
the
room
but
with
a
very
different
step
he
withdrew
quietly
with
peculiar
awkwardness
with
his
shoulders
hunched
his
head
hanging
as
though
he
were
inwardly
pondering
something
i
believe
he
was
whispering
something
he
made
his
way
to
the
door
carefully
without
stumbling
against
anything
or
knocking
anything
over
he
opened
the
door
a
very
little
way
and
squeezed
through
almost
sideways
as
he
went
out
his
shock
of
hair
standing
on
end
at
the
back
of
his
head
was
particularly
noticeable
then
first
of
all
one
fearful
scream
was
heard
i
saw
lizaveta
nikolaevna
seize
her
mother
by
the
shoulder
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
by
the
arm
and
make
two
or
three
violent
efforts
to
draw
them
out
of
the
room
but
she
suddenly
uttered
a
shriek
and
fell
full
length
on
the
floor
fainting
i
can
hear
the
thud
of
her
head
on
the
carpet
to
this
day
part
ii
chapter
i
night
i
eight
days
had
passed
now
that
it
is
all
over
and
i
am
writing
a
record
of
it
we
know
all
about
it
but
at
the
time
we
knew
nothing
and
it
was
natural
that
many
things
should
seem
strange
to
us
stepan
trofimovitch
and
i
anyway
shut
ourselves
up
for
the
first
part
of
the
time
and
looked
on
with
dismay
from
a
distance
i
did
indeed
go
about
here
and
there
and
as
before
brought
him
various
items
of
news
without
which
he
could
not
exist
i
need
hardly
say
that
there
were
rumours
of
the
most
varied
kind
going
about
the
town
in
regard
to
the
blow
that
stavrogin
had
received
lizaveta
nikolaevnas
fainting
fit
and
all
that
happened
on
that
sunday
but
what
we
wondered
was
through
whom
the
story
had
got
about
so
quickly
and
so
accurately
not
one
of
the
persons
present
had
any
need
to
give
away
the
secret
of
what
had
happened
or
interest
to
serve
by
doing
so
the
servants
had
not
been
present
lebyadkin
was
the
only
one
who
might
have
chattered
not
so
much
from
spite
for
he
had
gone
out
in
great
alarm
and
fear
of
an
enemy
destroys
spite
against
him
but
simply
from
incontinence
of
speech
but
lebyadkin
and
his
sister
had
disappeared
next
day
and
nothing
could
be
heard
of
them
there
was
no
trace
of
them
at
filipovs
house
they
had
moved
no
one
knew
where
and
seemed
to
have
vanished
shatov
of
whom
i
wanted
to
inquire
about
marya
timofyevna
would
not
open
his
door
and
i
believe
sat
locked
up
in
his
room
for
the
whole
of
those
eight
days
even
discontinuing
his
work
in
the
town
he
would
not
see
me
i
went
to
see
him
on
tuesday
and
knocked
at
his
door
i
got
no
answer
but
being
convinced
by
unmistakable
evidence
that
he
was
at
home
i
knocked
a
second
time
then
jumping
up
apparently
from
his
bed
he
strode
to
the
door
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
shatov
is
not
at
home
with
that
i
went
away
stepan
trofimovitch
and
i
not
without
dismay
at
the
boldness
of
the
supposition
though
we
tried
to
encourage
one
another
reached
at
last
a
conclusion
we
made
up
our
mind
that
the
only
person
who
could
be
responsible
for
spreading
these
rumours
was
pyotr
stepanovitch
though
he
himself
not
long
after
assured
his
father
that
he
had
found
the
story
on
every
ones
lips
especially
at
the
club
and
that
the
governor
and
his
wife
were
familiar
with
every
detail
of
it
what
is
even
more
remarkable
is
that
the
next
day
monday
evening
i
met
liputin
and
he
knew
every
word
that
had
been
passed
so
that
he
must
have
heard
it
firsthand
many
of
the
ladies
and
some
of
the
leading
ones
were
very
inquisitive
about
the
mysterious
cripple
as
they
called
marya
timofyevna
there
were
some
indeed
who
were
anxious
to
see
her
and
make
her
acquaintance
so
the
intervention
of
the
persons
who
had
been
in
such
haste
to
conceal
the
lebyadkins
was
timely
but
lizaveta
nikolaevnas
fainting
certainly
took
the
foremost
place
in
the
story
and
all
society
was
interested
if
only
because
it
directly
concerned
yulia
mihailovna
as
the
kinswoman
and
patroness
of
the
young
lady
and
what
was
there
they
didnt
say
what
increased
the
gossip
was
the
mysterious
position
of
affairs
both
houses
were
obstinately
closed
lizaveta
nikolaevna
so
they
said
was
in
bed
with
brain
fever
the
same
thing
was
asserted
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
the
revolting
addition
of
a
tooth
knocked
out
and
a
swollen
face
it
was
even
whispered
in
corners
that
there
would
soon
be
murder
among
us
that
stavrogin
was
not
the
man
to
put
up
with
such
an
insult
and
that
he
would
kill
shatov
but
with
the
secrecy
of
a
corsican
vendetta
people
liked
this
idea
but
the
majority
of
our
young
people
listened
with
contempt
and
with
an
air
of
the
most
nonchalant
indifference
which
was
of
course
assumed
the
old
hostility
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
in
the
town
was
in
general
strikingly
manifest
even
soberminded
people
were
eager
to
throw
blame
on
him
though
they
could
not
have
said
for
what
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
ruined
lizaveta
nikolaevnas
reputation
and
that
there
had
been
an
intrigue
between
them
in
switzerland
cautious
people
of
course
restrained
themselves
but
all
listened
with
relish
there
were
other
things
said
though
not
in
public
but
in
private
on
rare
occasions
and
almost
in
secret
extremely
strange
things
to
which
i
only
refer
to
warn
my
readers
of
them
with
a
view
to
the
later
events
of
my
story
some
people
with
knitted
brows
said
god
knows
on
what
foundation
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
some
special
business
in
our
province
that
he
had
through
count
k
been
brought
into
touch
with
exalted
circles
in
petersburg
that
he
was
even
perhaps
in
government
service
and
might
almost
be
said
to
have
been
furnished
with
some
sort
of
commission
from
someone
when
very
soberminded
and
sensible
people
smiled
at
this
rumour
observing
very
reasonably
that
a
man
always
mixed
up
with
scandals
and
who
was
beginning
his
career
among
us
with
a
swollen
face
did
not
look
like
a
government
official
they
were
told
in
a
whisper
that
he
was
employed
not
in
the
official
but
so
to
say
the
confidential
service
and
that
in
such
cases
it
was
essential
to
be
as
little
like
an
official
as
possible
this
remark
produced
a
sensation
we
knew
that
the
zemstvo
of
our
province
was
the
object
of
marked
attention
in
the
capital
i
repeat
these
were
only
flitting
rumours
that
disappeared
for
a
time
when
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
first
came
among
us
but
i
may
observe
that
many
of
the
rumours
were
partly
due
to
a
few
brief
but
malicious
words
vaguely
and
disconnectedly
dropped
at
the
club
by
a
gentleman
who
had
lately
returned
from
petersburg
this
was
a
retired
captain
in
the
guards
artemy
pavlovitch
gaganov
he
was
a
very
large
landowner
in
our
province
and
district
a
man
used
to
the
society
of
petersburg
and
a
son
of
the
late
pavel
pavlovitch
gaganov
the
venerable
old
man
with
whom
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
over
four
years
before
had
the
extraordinarily
coarse
and
sudden
encounter
which
i
have
described
already
in
the
beginning
of
my
story
it
immediately
became
known
to
every
one
that
yulia
mihailovna
had
made
a
special
call
on
varvara
petrovna
and
had
been
informed
at
the
entrance
her
honour
was
too
unwell
to
see
visitors
it
was
known
too
that
yulia
mihailovna
sent
a
message
two
days
later
to
inquire
after
varvara
petrovnas
health
at
last
she
began
defending
varvara
petrovna
everywhere
of
course
only
in
the
loftiest
sense
that
is
in
the
vaguest
possible
way
she
listened
coldly
and
sternly
to
the
hurried
remarks
made
at
first
about
the
scene
on
sunday
so
that
during
the
later
days
they
were
not
renewed
in
her
presence
so
that
the
belief
gained
ground
everywhere
that
yulia
mihailovna
knew
not
only
the
whole
of
the
mysterious
story
but
all
its
secret
significance
to
the
smallest
detail
and
not
as
an
outsider
but
as
one
taking
part
in
it
i
may
observe
by
the
way
that
she
was
already
gradually
beginning
to
gain
that
exalted
influence
among
us
for
which
she
was
so
eager
and
which
she
was
certainly
struggling
to
win
and
was
already
beginning
to
see
herself
surrounded
by
a
circle
a
section
of
society
recognised
her
practical
sense
and
tact
but
of
that
later
her
patronage
partly
explained
pyotr
stepanovitchs
rapid
success
in
our
societya
success
with
which
stepan
trofimovitch
was
particularly
impressed
at
the
time
we
possibly
exaggerated
it
to
begin
with
pyotr
stepanovitch
seemed
to
make
acquaintance
almost
instantly
with
the
whole
town
within
the
first
four
days
of
his
arrival
he
only
arrived
on
sunday
and
on
tuesday
i
saw
him
in
a
carriage
with
artemy
pavlovitch
gaganov
a
man
who
was
proud
irritable
and
supercilious
in
spite
of
his
good
breeding
and
who
was
not
easy
to
get
on
with
at
the
governors
too
pyotr
stepanovitch
met
with
a
warm
welcome
so
much
so
that
he
was
at
once
on
an
intimate
footing
like
a
young
friend
treated
so
to
say
affectionately
he
dined
with
yulia
mihailovna
almost
every
day
he
had
made
her
acquaintance
in
switzerland
but
there
was
certainly
something
curious
about
the
rapidity
of
his
success
in
the
governors
house
in
any
case
he
was
reputed
whether
truly
or
not
to
have
been
at
one
time
a
revolutionist
abroad
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
some
publications
and
some
congresses
abroad
which
one
can
prove
from
the
newspapers
to
quote
the
malicious
remark
of
alyosha
telyatnikov
who
had
also
been
once
a
young
friend
affectionately
treated
in
the
house
of
the
late
governor
but
was
now
alas
a
clerk
on
the
retired
list
but
the
fact
was
unmistakable
the
former
revolutionist
far
from
being
hindered
from
returning
to
his
beloved
fatherland
seemed
almost
to
have
been
encouraged
to
do
so
so
perhaps
there
was
nothing
in
it
liputin
whispered
to
me
once
that
there
were
rumours
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
once
professed
himself
penitent
and
on
his
return
had
been
pardoned
on
mentioning
certain
names
and
so
perhaps
had
succeeded
in
expiating
his
offence
by
promising
to
be
of
use
to
the
government
in
the
future
i
repeated
these
malignant
phrases
to
stepan
trofimovitch
and
although
the
latter
was
in
such
a
state
that
he
was
hardly
capable
of
reflection
he
pondered
profoundly
it
turned
out
later
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
come
to
us
with
a
very
influential
letter
of
recommendation
that
he
had
at
any
rate
brought
one
to
the
governors
wife
from
a
very
important
old
lady
in
petersburg
whose
husband
was
one
of
the
most
distinguished
old
dignitaries
in
the
capital
this
old
lady
who
was
yulia
mihailovnas
godmother
mentioned
in
her
letter
that
count
k
knew
pyotr
stepanovitch
very
well
through
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
made
much
of
him
and
thought
him
a
very
excellent
young
man
in
spite
of
his
former
errors
yulia
mihailovna
set
the
greatest
value
on
her
relations
with
the
higher
spheres
which
were
few
and
maintained
with
difficulty
and
was
no
doubt
pleased
to
get
the
old
ladys
letter
but
still
there
was
something
peculiar
about
it
she
even
forced
her
husband
upon
a
familiar
footing
with
pyotr
stepanovitch
so
much
so
that
mr
von
lembke
complained
of
it
but
of
that
too
later
i
may
mention
too
that
the
great
author
was
also
favourably
disposed
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
at
once
invited
him
to
go
and
see
him
such
alacrity
on
the
part
of
a
man
so
puffed
up
with
conceit
stung
stepan
trofimovitch
more
painfully
than
anything
but
i
put
a
different
interpretation
on
it
in
inviting
a
nihilist
to
see
him
mr
karmazinov
no
doubt
had
in
view
his
relations
with
the
progressives
of
the
younger
generation
in
both
capitals
the
great
author
trembled
nervously
before
the
revolutionary
youth
of
russia
and
imagining
in
his
ignorance
that
the
future
lay
in
their
hands
fawned
upon
them
in
a
despicable
way
chiefly
because
they
paid
no
attention
to
him
whatever
ii
pyotr
stepanovitch
ran
round
to
see
his
father
twice
but
unfortunately
i
was
absent
on
both
occasions
he
visited
him
for
the
first
time
only
on
wednesday
that
is
not
till
the
fourth
day
after
their
first
meeting
and
then
only
on
business
their
difficulties
over
the
property
were
settled
by
the
way
without
fuss
or
publicity
varvara
petrovna
took
it
all
on
herself
and
paid
all
that
was
owing
taking
over
the
land
of
course
and
only
informed
stepan
trofimovitch
that
it
was
all
settled
and
her
butler
alexey
yegorytch
was
by
her
authorisation
bringing
him
something
to
sign
this
stepan
trofimovitch
did
in
silence
with
extreme
dignity
apropos
of
his
dignity
i
may
mention
that
i
hardly
recognised
my
old
friend
during
those
days
he
behaved
as
he
had
never
done
before
became
amazingly
taciturn
and
had
not
even
written
one
letter
to
varvara
petrovna
since
sunday
which
seemed
to
me
almost
a
miracle
whats
more
he
had
become
quite
calm
he
had
fastened
upon
a
final
and
decisive
idea
which
gave
him
tranquillity
that
was
evident
he
had
hit
upon
this
idea
and
sat
still
expecting
something
at
first
however
he
was
ill
especially
on
monday
he
had
an
attack
of
his
summer
cholera
he
could
not
remain
all
that
time
without
news
either
but
as
soon
as
i
departed
from
the
statement
of
facts
and
began
discussing
the
case
in
itself
and
formulated
any
theory
he
at
once
gesticulated
to
me
to
stop
but
both
his
interviews
with
his
son
had
a
distressing
effect
on
him
though
they
did
not
shake
his
determination
after
each
interview
he
spent
the
whole
day
lying
on
the
sofa
with
a
handkerchief
soaked
in
vinegar
on
his
head
but
he
continued
to
remain
calm
in
the
deepest
sense
sometimes
however
he
did
not
hinder
my
speaking
sometimes
too
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
mysterious
determination
he
had
taken
seemed
to
be
failing
him
and
he
appeared
to
be
struggling
with
a
new
seductive
stream
of
ideas
that
was
only
at
moments
but
i
made
a
note
of
it
i
suspected
that
he
was
longing
to
assert
himself
again
to
come
forth
from
his
seclusion
to
show
fight
to
struggle
to
the
last
cher
i
could
crush
them
broke
from
him
on
thursday
evening
after
his
second
interview
with
pyotr
stepanovitch
when
he
lay
stretched
on
the
sofa
with
his
head
wrapped
in
a
towel
till
that
moment
he
had
not
uttered
one
word
all
day
fils
fils
cher
and
so
on
i
agree
all
those
expressions
are
nonsense
kitchen
talk
and
so
be
it
i
see
it
for
myself
i
never
gave
him
food
or
drink
i
sent
him
a
tiny
baby
from
berlin
to
x
province
by
post
and
all
that
i
admit
it
you
gave
me
neither
food
nor
drink
and
sent
me
by
post
he
says
and
whats
more
youve
robbed
me
here
but
you
unhappy
boy
i
cried
to
him
my
heart
has
been
aching
for
you
all
my
life
though
i
did
send
you
by
post
il

but
i
admit
it
i
admit
it
granted
it
was
by
post
he
concluded
almost
in
delirium
passons
he
began
again
five
minutes
later
i
dont
understand
turgenev
that
bazarov
of
his
is
a
fictitious
figure
it
does
not
exist
anywhere
the
fellows
themselves
were
the
first
to
disown
him
as
unlike
anyone

is

cried
to

suddenly

cried

up

why

do
you

you

think
there
was
i
should
like
to
think
so
i
did
not
speak
he
too
was
silent
for
a
long
time
they
say
that
french
cleverness
he
babbled
suddenly
as
though
in
a
fever
thats
false
it
always
has
been
why
libel
french
cleverness
its
simply
russian
indolence
our
degrading
impotence
to
produce
ideas
our
revolting
parasitism
in
the
rank
of
nations
ils
sont
tout
simplement
des
paresseux
and
not
french
cleverness
oh
the
russians
ought
to
be
extirpated
for
the
good
of
humanity
like
noxious
parasites
weve
been
striving
for
something
utterly
utterly
different
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
i
have
given
up
understanding
do
you
understand
i
cried
to
him
that
if
you
have
the
guillotine
in
the
foreground
of
your
programme
and
are
so
enthusiastic
about
it
too
its
simply
because
nothings
easier
than
cutting
off
heads
and
nothings
harder
than
to
have
an
idea
vous
tes
des
paresseux
votre
drapeau
est
un
guenille
une
impuissance
its
those
carts
or
what
was
it
the
rumble
of
the
carts
carrying
bread
to
humanity
being
more
important
than
the
sistine
madonna
or
whats
the
saying
une
btise
dans
ce
genre
dont
you
understand
dont
you
understand
i
said
to
him
that
unhappiness
is
just
as
necessary
to
man
as
happiness
il
rit
all
you
do
is
to
make
a
bon
mot
he
said
with
your
limbs
snug
on
a
velvet
sofa
he
used
a
coarser
expression
and
this
habit
of
addressing
a
father
so
familiarly
is
very
nice
when
father
and
son
are
on
good
terms
but
what
do
you
think
of
it
when
they
are
abusing
one
another
we
were
silent
again
for
a
minute
cher
he
concluded
at
last
getting
up
quickly
do
you
know
this
is
bound
to
end
in
something
of
course
said
i
vous
ne
comprenez
pas
passons
but
usually
in
our
world
things
come
to
nothing
but
this
will
end
in
something
its
bound
to
its
bound
to
he
got
up
and
walked
across
the
room
in
violent
emotion
and
coming
back
to
the
sofa
sank
on
to
it
exhausted
on
friday
morning
pyotr
stepanovitch
went
off
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
and
remained
away
till
monday
i
heard
of
his
departure
from
liputin
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
learned
that
the
lebyadkins
brother
and
sister
had
moved
to
the
riverside
quarter
i
moved
them
he
added
and
dropping
the
lebyadkins
he
suddenly
announced
to
me
that
lizaveta
nikolaevna
was
going
to
marry
mavriky
nikolaevitch
that
although
it
had
not
been
announced
the
engagement
was
a
settled
thing
next
day
i
met
lizaveta
nikolaevna
out
riding
with
mavriky
nikolaevitch
she
was
out
for
the
first
time
after
her
illness
she
beamed
at
me
from
the
distance
laughed
and
nodded
in
a
very
friendly
way
i
told
all
this
to
stepan
trofimovitch
he
paid
no
attention
except
to
the
news
about
the
lebyadkins
and
now
having
described
our
enigmatic
position
throughout
those
eight
days
during
which
we
knew
nothing
i
will
pass
on
to
the
description
of
the
succeeding
incidents
of
my
chronicle
writing
so
to
say
with
full
knowledge
and
describing
things
as
they
became
known
afterwards
and
are
clearly
seen
today
i
will
begin
with
the
eighth
day
after
that
sunday
that
is
the
monday
eveningfor
in
reality
a
new
scandal
began
with
that
evening
iii
it
was
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
sitting
alone
in
his
studythe
room
he
had
been
fond
of
in
old
days
it
was
lofty
carpeted
with
rugs
and
contained
somewhat
heavy
oldfashioned
furniture
he
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
corner
dressed
as
though
to
go
out
though
he
did
not
seem
to
be
intending
to
do
so
on
the
table
before
him
stood
a
lamp
with
a
shade
the
sides
and
corners
of
the
big
room
were
left
in
shadow
his
eyes
looked
dreamy
and
concentrated
not
altogether
tranquil
his
face
looked
tired
and
had
grown
a
little
thinner
he
really
was
ill
with
a
swollen
face
but
the
story
of
a
tooth
having
been
knocked
out
was
an
exaggeration
one
had
been
loosened
but
it
had
grown
into
its
place
again
he
had
had
a
cut
on
the
inner
side
of
the
upper
lip
but
that
too
had
healed
the
swelling
on
his
face
had
lasted
all
the
week
simply
because
the
invalid
would
not
have
a
doctor
and
instead
of
having
the
swelling
lanced
had
waited
for
it
to
go
down
he
would
not
hear
of
a
doctor
and
would
scarcely
allow
even
his
mother
to
come
near
him
and
then
only
for
a
moment
once
a
day
and
only
at
dusk
after
it
was
dark
and
before
lights
had
been
brought
in
he
did
not
receive
pyotr
stepanovitch
either
though
the
latter
ran
round
to
varvara
petrovnas
two
or
three
times
a
day
so
long
as
he
remained
in
the
town
and
now
at
last
returning
on
the
monday
morning
after
his
three
days
absence
pyotr
stepanovitch
made
a
circuit
of
the
town
and
after
dining
at
yulia
mihailovnas
came
at
last
in
the
evening
to
varvara
petrovna
who
was
impatiently
expecting
him
the
interdict
had
been
removed
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
at
home
varvara
petrovna
herself
led
the
visitor
to
the
door
of
the
study
she
had
long
looked
forward
to
their
meeting
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
promised
to
run
to
her
and
repeat
what
passed
she
knocked
timidly
at
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
door
and
getting
no
answer
ventured
to
open
the
door
a
couple
of
inches
nicolas
may
i
bring
pyotr
stepanovitch
in
to
see
you
she
asked
in
a
soft
and
restrained
voice
trying
to
make
out
her
sons
face
behind
the
lamp
you
canyou
can
of
course
you
can
pyotr
stepanovitch
himself
cried
out
loudly
and
gaily
he
opened
the
door
with
his
hand
and
went
in
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
not
heard
the
knock
at
the
door
and
only
caught
his
mothers
timid
question
and
had
not
had
time
to
answer
it
before
him
at
that
moment
there
lay
a
letter
he
had
just
read
over
which
he
was
pondering
deeply
he
started
hearing
pyotr
stepanovitchs
sudden
outburst
and
hurriedly
put
the
letter
under
a
paperweight
but
did
not
quite
succeed
a
corner
of
the
letter
and
almost
the
whole
envelope
showed
i
called
out
on
purpose
that
you
might
be
prepared
pyotr
stepanovitch
said
hurriedly
with
surprising
navet
running
up
to
the
table
and
instantly
staring
at
the
corner
of
the
letter
which
peeped
out
from
beneath
the
paperweight
and
no
doubt
you
had
time
to
see
how
i
hid
the
letter
i
had
just
received
under
the
paperweight
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
calmly
without
moving
from
his
place
a
letter
bless
you
and
your
letters
what
are
they
to
do
with
me
cried
the
visitor
but
what
does
matter
he
whispered
again
turning
to
the
door
which
was
by
now
closed
and
nodding
his
head
in
that
direction
she
never
listens
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
observed
coldly
what
if
she
did
overhear
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
raising
his
voice
cheerfully
and
settling
down
in
an
armchair
ive
nothing
against
that
only
ive
come
here
now
to
speak
to
you
alone
well
at
last
ive
succeeded
in
getting
at
you
first
of
all
how
are
you
i
see
youre
getting
on
splendidly
tomorrow
youll
show
yourself
againeh
perhaps
set
their
minds
at
rest
set
mine
at
rest
at
last
he
gesticulated
violently
with
a
jocose
and
amiable
air
if
only
you
knew
what
nonsense
ive
had
to
talk
to
them
you
know
though
he
laughed
i
dont
know
everything
i
only
heard
from
my
mother
that
youve
been
very
active
oh
well
ive
said
nothing
definite
pyotr
stepanovitch
flared
up
at
once
as
though
defending
himself
from
an
awful
attack
i
simply
trotted
out
shatovs
wife
you
know
that
is
the
rumours
of
your
liaison
in
paris
which
accounted
of
course
for
what
happened
on
sunday
youre
not
angry
im
sure
youve
done
your
best
oh
thats
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
though
what
does
that
mean
done
your
best
thats
a
reproach
isnt
it
you
always
go
straight
for
things
though
what
i
was
most
afraid
of
as
i
came
here
was
that
you
wouldnt
go
straight
for
the
point
i
dont
want
to
go
straight
for
anything
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
some
irritation
but
he
laughed
at
once
i
didnt
mean
that
i
didnt
mean
that
dont
make
a
mistake
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
waving
his
hands
rattling
his
words
out
like
peas
and
at
once
relieved
at
his
companions
irritability
im
not
going
to
worry
you
with
our
business
especially
in
your
present
position
ive
only
come
about
sundays
affair
and
only
to
arrange
the
most
necessary
steps
because
you
see
its
impossible
ive
come
with
the
frankest
explanations
which
i
stand
in
more
need
of
than
youso
much
for
your
vanity
but
at
the
same
time
its
true
ive
come
to
be
open
with
you
from
this
time
forward
then
you
have
not
been
open
with
me
before
you
know
that
yourself
ive
been
cunning
with
you
many
times
you
smile
im
very
glad
of
that
smile
as
a
prelude
to
our
explanation
i
provoked
that
smile
on
purpose
by
using
the
word
cunning
so
that
you
might
get
cross
directly
at
my
daring
to
think
i
could
be
cunning
so
that
i
might
have
a
chance
of
explaining
myself
at
once
you
see
you
see
how
open
i
have
become
now
well
do
you
care
to
listen
in
the
expression
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
face
which
was
contemptuously
composed
and
even
ironical
in
spite
of
his
visitors
obvious
desire
to
irritate
him
by
the
insolence
of
his
premeditated
and
intentionally
coarse
navets
there
was
at
last
a
look
of
rather
uneasy
curiosity
listen
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
wriggling
more
than
ever
when
i
set
off
to
come
here
i
mean
here
in
the
large
sense
to
this
town
ten
days
ago
i
made
up
my
mind
of
course
to
assume
a
character
it
would
have
been
best
to
have
done
without
anything
to
have
kept
ones
own
character
wouldnt
it
there
is
no
better
dodge
than
ones
own
character
because
no
one
believes
in
it
i
meant
i
must
own
to
assume
the
part
of
a
fool
because
it
is
easier
to
be
a
fool
than
to
act
ones
own
character
but
as
a
fool
is
after
all
something
extreme
and
anything
extreme
excites
curiosity
i
ended
by
sticking
to
my
own
character
and
what
is
my
own
character
the
golden
mean
neither
wise
nor
foolish
rather
stupid
and
dropped
from
the
moon
as
sensible
people
say
here
isnt
that
it
perhaps
it
is
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
a
faint
smile
ah
you
agreeim
very
glad
i
knew
beforehand
that
it
was
your
own
opinion
you
neednt
trouble
i
am
not
annoyed
and
i
didnt
describe
myself
in
that
way
to
get
a
flattering
contradiction
from
youno
youre
not
stupid
youre
clever
ah
youre
smiling
again
ive
blundered
once
more
you
would
not
have
said
youre
clever
granted
ill
let
it
pass
anyway
passons
as
papa
says
and
in
parenthesis
dont
be
vexed
with
my
verbosity
by
the
way
i
always
say
a
lot
that
is
use
a
great
many
words
and
talk
very
fast
and
i
never
speak
well
and
why
do
i
use
so
many
words
and
why
do
i
never
speak
well
because
i
dont
know
how
to
speak
people
who
can
speak
well
speak
briefly
so
that
i
am
stupid
am
i
not
but
as
this
gift
of
stupidity
is
natural
to
me
why
shouldnt
i
make
skilful
use
of
it
and
i
do
make
use
of
it
its
true
that
as
i
came
here
i
did
think
at
first
of
being
silent
but
you
know
silence
is
a
great
talent
and
therefore
incongruous
for
me
and
secondly
silence
would
be
risky
anyway
so
i
made
up
my
mind
finally
that
it
would
be
best
to
talk
but
to
talk
stupidlythat
is
to
talk
and
talk
and
talkto
be
in
a
tremendous
hurry
to
explain
things
and
in
the
end
to
get
muddled
in
my
own
explanations
so
that
my
listener
would
walk
away
without
hearing
the
end
with
a
shrug
or
better
still
with
a
curse
you
succeed
straight
off
in
persuading
them
of
your
simplicity
in
boring
them
and
in
being
incomprehensiblethree
advantages
all
at
once
do
you
suppose
anybody
will
suspect
you
of
mysterious
designs
after
that
why
every
one
of
them
would
take
it
as
a
personal
affront
if
anyone
were
to
say
i
had
secret
designs
and
i
sometimes
amuse
them
too
and
thats
priceless
why
theyre
ready
to
forgive
me
everything
now
just
because
the
clever
fellow
who
used
to
publish
manifestoes
out
there
turns
out
to
be
stupider
than
themselvesthats
so
isnt
it
from
your
smile
i
see
you
approve
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
not
smiling
at
all
however
on
the
contrary
he
was
listening
with
a
frown
and
some
impatience
eh
what
i
believe
you
said
no
matter
pyotr
stepanovitch
rattled
on
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
said
nothing
at
all
of
course
of
course
i
assure
you
im
not
here
to
compromise
you
by
my
company
by
claiming
you
as
my
comrade
but
do
you
know
youre
horribly
captious
today
i
ran
in
to
you
with
a
light
and
open
heart
and
you
seem
to
be
laying
up
every
word
i
say
against
me
i
assure
you
im
not
going
to
begin
about
anything
shocking
today
i
give
you
my
word
and
i
agree
beforehand
to
all
your
conditions
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
obstinately
silent
eh
what
did
you
say
something
i
see
i
see
that
ive
made
a
blunder
again
it
seems
youve
not
suggested
conditions
and
youre
not
going
to
i
believe
you
i
believe
you
well
you
can
set
your
mind
at
rest
i
know
of
course
that
its
not
worth
while
for
me
to
suggest
them
is
it
ill
answer
for
you
beforehand
andjust
from
stupidity
of
course
stupidity
again
youre
laughing
eh
what
nothing
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
laughed
at
last
i
just
remembered
that
i
really
did
call
you
stupid
but
you
werent
there
then
so
they
must
have
repeated
it
i
would
ask
you
to
make
haste
and
come
to
the
point
why
but
i
am
at
the
point
i
am
talking
about
sunday
babbled
pyotr
stepanovitch
why
what
was
i
on
sunday
what
would
you
call
it
just
fussy
mediocre
stupidity
and
in
the
stupidest
way
i
took
possession
of
the
conversation
by
force
but
they
forgave
me
everything
first
because
i
dropped
from
the
moon
that
seems
to
be
settled
here
now
by
every
one
and
secondly
because
i
told
them
a
pretty
little
story
and
got
you
all
out
of
a
scrape
didnt
they
didnt
they
that
is
you
told
your
story
so
as
to
leave
them
in
doubt
and
suggest
some
compact
and
collusion
between
us
when
there
was
no
collusion
and
id
not
asked
you
to
do
anything
just
so
just
so
pyotr
stepanovitch
caught
him
up
apparently
delighted
thats
just
what
i
did
do
for
i
wanted
you
to
see
that
i
implied
it
i
exerted
myself
chiefly
for
your
sake
for
i
caught
you
and
wanted
to
compromise
you
above
all
i
wanted
to
find
out
how
far
youre
afraid
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
why
you
are
so
open
now
dont
be
angry
dont
be
angry
dont
glare
at
me
youre
not
though
you
wonder
why
i
am
so
open
why
just
because
its
all
changed
now
of
course
its
over
buried
under
the
sand
ive
suddenly
changed
my
ideas
about
you
the
old
way
is
closed
now
i
shall
never
compromise
you
in
the
old
way
it
will
be
in
a
new
way
now
youve
changed
your
tactics
there
are
no
tactics
now
its
for
you
to
decide
in
everything
that
is
if
you
want
to
say
yes
and
if
you
want
to
say
no
there
you
have
my
new
tactics
and
i
wont
say
a
word
about
our
cause
till
you
bid
me
yourself
you
laugh
laugh
away
im
laughing
myself
but
im
in
earnest
now
in
earnest
in
earnest
though
a
man
who
is
in
such
a
hurry
is
stupid
isnt
he
never
mind
i
may
be
stupid
but
im
in
earnest
in
earnest
he
really
was
speaking
in
earnest
in
quite
a
different
tone
and
with
a
peculiar
excitement
so
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
you
say
youve
changed
your
ideas
about
me
he
asked
i
changed
my
ideas
about
you
at
the
moment
when
you
drew
your
hands
back
after
shatovs
attack
and
thats
enough
thats
enough
no
questions
please
ill
say
nothing
more
now
he
jumped
up
waving
his
hands
as
though
waving
off
questions
but
as
there
were
no
questions
and
he
had
no
reason
to
go
away
he
sank
into
an
armchair
again
somewhat
reassured
by
the
way
in
parenthesis
he
rattled
on
at
once
some
people
here
are
babbling
that
youll
kill
him
and
taking
bets
about
it
so
that
lembke
positively
thought
of
setting
the
police
on
but
yulia
mihailovna
forbade
it
but
enough
about
that
quite
enough
i
only
spoke
of
it
to
let
you
know
by
the
way
i
moved
the
lebyadkins
the
same
day
you
know
did
you
get
my
note
with
their
address
i
received
it
at
the
time
i
didnt
do
that
by
way
of
stupidity
i
did
it
genuinely
to
serve
you
if
it
was
stupid
anyway
it
was
done
in
good
faith
oh
all
right
perhaps
it
was
necessary
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
dreamily
only
dont
write
any
more
letters
to
me
i
beg
you
impossible
to
avoid
it
it
was
only
one
so
liputin
knows
impossible
to
help
it
but
liputin
you
know
yourself
dare
not
by
the
way
you
ought
to
meet
our
fellows
that
is
the
fellows
not
our
fellows
or
youll
be
finding
fault
again
dont
disturb
yourself
not
just
now
but
sometime
just
now
its
raining
ill
let
them
know
theyll
meet
together
and
well
go
in
the
evening
theyre
waiting
with
their
mouths
open
like
young
crows
in
a
nest
to
see
what
present
weve
brought
them
theyre
a
hotheaded
lot
theyve
brought
out
leaflets
theyre
on
the
point
of
quarrelling
virginsky
is
a
universal
humanity
man
liputin
is
a
fourierist
with
a
marked
inclination
for
police
work
a
man
i
assure
you
who
is
precious
from
one
point
of
view
though
he
requires
strict
supervision
in
all
others
and
last
of
all
that
fellow
with
the
long
ears
hell
read
an
account
of
his
own
system
and
do
you
know
theyre
offended
at
my
treating
them
casually
and
throwing
cold
water
over
them
but
we
certainly
must
meet
youve
made
me
out
some
sort
of
chief
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
dropped
as
carelessly
as
possible
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
quickly
at
him
by
the
way
he
interposed
in
haste
to
change
the
subject
as
though
he
had
not
heard
ive
been
here
two
or
three
times
you
know
to
see
her
excellency
varvara
petrovna
and
i
have
been
obliged
to
say
a
great
deal
too
so
i
imagine
no
dont
imagine
ive
simply
told
her
that
you
wont
kill
him
well
and
other
sweet
things
and
only
fancy
the
very
next
day
she
knew
id
moved
marya
timofyevna
beyond
the
river
was
it
you
told
her
i
never
dreamed
of
it
i
knew
it
wasnt
you
who
else
could
it
be
its
interesting
liputin
of
course
nno
not
liputin
muttered
pyotr
stepanovitch
frowning
ill
find
out
who
its
more
like
shatov
thats
nonsense
though
lets
leave
that
though
its
awfully
important
by
the
way
i
kept
expecting
that
your
mother
would
suddenly
burst
out
with
the
great
question
ach
yes
she
was
horribly
glum
at
first
but
suddenly
when
i
came
today
she
was
beaming
all
over
what
does
that
mean
its
because
i
promised
her
today
that
within
five
days
ill
be
engaged
to
lizaveta
nikolaevna
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
said
with
surprising
openness
oh
yes
of
course
faltered
pyotr
stepanovitch
seeming
disconcerted
there
are
rumours
of
her
engagement
you
know
its
true
too
but
youre
right
shed
run
from
under
the
wedding
crown
youve
only
to
call
to
her
youre
not
angry
at
my
saying
so
no
im
not
angry
i
notice
its
awfully
hard
to
make
you
angry
today
and
i
begin
to
be
afraid
of
you
im
awfully
curious
to
know
how
youll
appear
tomorrow
i
expect
youve
got
a
lot
of
things
ready
youre
not
angry
at
my
saying
so
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
made
no
answer
at
all
which
completed
pyotr
stepanovitchs
irritation
by
the
way
did
you
say
that
in
earnest
to
your
mother
about
lizaveta
nikolaevna
he
asked
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
coldly
at
him
oh
i
understand
it
was
only
to
soothe
her
of
course
and
if
it
were
in
earnest
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
asked
firmly
oh
god
bless
you
then
as
they
say
in
such
cases
it
wont
hinder
the
cause
you
see
i
dont
say
our
you
dont
like
the
word
our
and
i

well
i

am
at
your
service
as
you
know
you
think
so
i
think
nothingnothing
pyotr
stepanovitch
hurriedly
declared
laughing
because
i
know
you
consider
what
youre
about
beforehand
for
yourself
and
everything
with
you
has
been
thought
out
i
only
mean
that
i
am
seriously
at
your
service
always
and
everywhere
and
in
every
sort
of
circumstance
every
sort
really
do
you
understand
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
yawned
ive
bored
you
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
jumping
up
suddenly
and
snatching
his
perfectly
new
round
hat
as
though
he
were
going
away
he
remained
and
went
on
talking
however
though
he
stood
up
sometimes
pacing
about
the
room
and
tapping
himself
on
the
knee
with
his
hat
at
exciting
parts
of
the
conversation
i
meant
to
amuse
you
with
stories
of
the
lembkes
too
he
cried
gaily
afterwards
perhaps
not
now
but
how
is
yulia
mihailovna
what
conventional
manners
all
of
you
have
her
health
is
no
more
to
you
than
the
health
of
the
grey
cat
yet
you
ask
after
it
i
approve
of
that
shes
quite
well
and
her
respect
for
you
amounts
to
a
superstition
her
immense
anticipations
of
you
amount
to
a
superstition
she
does
not
say
a
word
about
what
happened
on
sunday
and
is
convinced
that
you
will
overcome
everything
yourself
by
merely
making
your
appearance
upon
my
word
she
fancies
you
can
do
anything
youre
an
enigmatic
and
romantic
figure
now
more
than
ever
you
wereextremely
advantageous
position
it
is
incredible
how
eager
every
one
is
to
see
you
they
were
pretty
hot
when
i
went
away
but
now
it
is
more
so
than
ever
thanks
again
for
your
letter
they
are
all
afraid
of
count
k
do
you
know
they
look
upon
you
as
a
spy
i
keep
that
up
youre
not
angry
it
does
not
matter
it
does
not
matter
its
essential
in
the
long
run
they
have
their
ways
of
doing
things
here
i
encourage
it
of
course
yulia
mihailovna
in
the
first
place
gaganov
too
you
laugh
but
you
know
i
have
my
policy
i
babble
away
and
suddenly
i
say
something
clever
just
as
they
are
on
the
lookout
for
it
they
crowd
round
me
and
i
humbug
away
again
theyve
all
given
me
up
in
despair
by
now
hes
got
brains
but
hes
dropped
from
the
moon
lembke
invites
me
to
enter
the
service
so
that
i
may
be
reformed
you
know
i
treat
him
mockingly
that
is
i
compromise
him
and
he
simply
stares
yulia
mihailovna
encourages
it
oh
by
the
way
gaganov
is
in
an
awful
rage
with
you
he
said
the
nastiest
things
about
you
yesterday
at
duhovo
i
told
him
the
whole
truth
on
the
spot
that
is
of
course
not
the
whole
truth
i
spent

at
duhovo

nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
broke
in
suddenly
making
a
sudden
start
forward
and
almost
leaping
up
from
his
seat
no
he
drove
me
here
this
morning

pyotr
stepanovitch
appearing
not
to
notice
stavrogins
momentary
excitement

dropped
a
book
he
bent
down
to
pick
up
the
keepsake
he
had
knocked
down
the
women
of
balzac
with
illustrations

opened
it
suddenly

queried
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
as
though
beginning
to
be
interested
in
russian
on
the
sly
of
course
yulia
mihailovna
knows
and
allows
it
hes
henpecked
but
with
good
manners
its
their
system
such
strict
formsuch
selfrestraint
something
of
the
sort
would
be
the
thing
for
us
you
approve
of
government
methods
i
should
rather
think
so
its
the
one
thing
thats
natural
and
practicable
in
russia
i
wont
i
wont
he
cried
out
suddenly
im
not
referring
to
thatnot
a
word
on
delicate
subjects
goodbye
though
you
look
rather
green
im
feverish
i
can
well
believe
it
you
should
go
to
bed
by
the
way
there
are
skoptsi
here
in
the
neighbourhoodtheyre
curious
people
of
that
later
though
ah

another
anecdote
theres
an
infantry
regiment
here
in
the
district
i
was
drinking
last
friday
evening
with
the
officers
weve
three
friends
among
them
vous
comprenez
they
were
discussing
atheism
and
i
need
hardly
say
they
made
short
work
of
god
they
were
squealing
with
delight
by
the
way
shatov
declares
that
if
theres
to
be
a
rising
in
russia
we
must
begin
with
atheism
maybe
its
true
one
grizzled
old
stager
of
a
captain
sat
mum
not
saying
a
word
all
at
once
he
stands
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
says
aloud
as
though
speaking
to
himself
if
theres
no
god
how
can
i
be
a
captain
then
he
took
up
his
cap
and
went
out
flinging
up
his
hands
he
expressed
a
rather
sensible
idea
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
yawning
for
the
third
time
yes
i
didnt
understand
it
i
meant
to
ask
you
about
it

to
tell

shpigulin

hotbed
of
cholera

but
i
beg
your
pardon
i
wont

wont
speak
of
that

frown
there
he
turned
back
suddenly
i
quite
forgot
the
chief
thing
i
was
told
just
now
that
our
box
had
come
from
petersburg
you
mean
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
at
him
not
understanding
your
box
your
things
coats
trousers
and
linen
have
come
is
it
true
yes
they
said
something
about
it
this
morning
ach
then

open
it
at
once

alexey

nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
a
smile
is
it
true
youre
going
to
take
lessons
at
the
riding
school
pyotr
stepanovitch
smiled
a
wry
smile
i
say
he
said
suddenly
with
excessive
haste
in
a
voice
that
quivered
and
faltered
i
say
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
lets
drop
personalities
once
for
all
of
course
you
can
despise
me
as
much
as
you
like
if
it
amuses
youbut
wed
better
dispense
with
personalities
for
a
time
hadnt
we
all
right
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
assented
pyotr
stepanovitch
grinned
tapped
his
knee
with
his
hat
shifted
from
one
leg
to
the
other
and
recovered
his
former
expression
some
people
here
positively
look
upon
me
as
your
rival
with
lizaveta
nikolaevna
so
i
must
think
of
my
appearance
mustnt
i
he
laughed
who
was
it
told
you
that
though
hm
its
just
eight
oclock
well
i
must
be
off
i
promised
to
look
in
on
varvara
petrovna
but
i
shall
make
my
escape
and
you
go
to
bed
and
youll
be
stronger
tomorrow
its
raining
and
dark
but
ive
a
cab
its
not
over
safe
in
the
streets
here
at
night
ach
by
the
way
theres
a
runaway
convict
from
siberia
fedka
wandering
about
the
town
and
the
neighbourhood
only
fancy
he
used
to
be
a
serf
of
mine
and
my
papa
sent
him
for
a
soldier
fifteen
years
ago
and
took
the
money
for
him
hes
a
very
remarkable
person
you
have
been
talking
to
him
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
scanned
him
i
have
he
lets
me
know
where
he
is
hes
ready
for
anything
anything
for
money
of
course
but
he
has
convictions
too
of
a
sort
of
course
oh
yes
by
the
way
again
if
you
meant
anything
of
that
plan
you
remember
about
lizaveta
nikolaevna
i
tell
you
once
again
i
too
am
a
fellow
ready
for
anything
of
any
kind
you
like
and
absolutely
at
your
service
hullo
are
you
reaching
for
your
stick
oh
no
only
fancy
i
thought
you
were
looking
for
your
stick
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
looking
for
nothing
and
said
nothing
but
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
very
suddenly
with
a
strange
look
in
his
face
if
you
want
any
help
about
mr
gaganov
either
pyotr
stepanovitch
blurted
out
suddenly
this
time
looking
straight
at
the
paperweight
of
course
i
can
arrange
it
all
and
im
certain
you
wont
be
able
to
manage
without
me
he
went
out
suddenly
without
waiting
for
an
answer
but
thrust
his
head
in
at
the
door
once
more
i
mention
that
he
gabbled
hurriedly
because
shatov
had
no
right
either
you
know
to
risk
his
life
last
sunday
when
he
attacked
you
had
he
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
make
a
note
of
that
he
disappeared
again
without
waiting
for
an
answer
iv
perhaps
he
imagined
as
he
made
his
exit
that
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
would
begin
beating
on
the
wall
with
his
fists
and
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
this
if
that
had
been
possible
but
if
so
he
was
greatly
mistaken
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
still
calm
he
remained
standing
for
two
minutes
in
the
same
position
by
the
table
apparently
plunged
in
thought
but
soon
a
cold
and
listless
smile
came
on
to
his
lips
he
slowly
sat
down
again
in
the
same
place
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
shut
his
eyes
as
though
from
weariness
the
corner
of
the
letter
was
still
peeping
from
under
the
paperweight
but
he
didnt
even
move
to
cover
it
he
soon
sank
into
complete
forgetfulness
when
pyotr
stepanovitch
went
out
without
coming
to
see
her
as
he
had
promised
varvara
petrovna
who
had
been
worn
out
by
anxiety
during
these
days
could
not
control
herself
and
ventured
to
visit
her
son
herself
though
it
was
not
her
regular
time
she
was
still
haunted
by
the
idea
that
he
would
tell
her
something
conclusive
she
knocked
at
the
door
gently
as
before
and
again
receiving
no
answer
she
opened
the
door
seeing
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
sitting
strangely
motionless
she
cautiously
advanced
to
the
sofa
with
a
throbbing
heart
she
seemed
struck
by
the
fact
that
he
could
fall
asleep
so
quickly
and
that
he
could
sleep
sitting
like
that
so
erect
and
motionless
so
that
his
breathing
even
was
scarcely
perceptible
his
face
was
pale
and
forbidding
but
it
looked
as
it
were
numb
and
rigid
his
brows
were
somewhat
contracted
and
frowning
he
positively
had
the
look
of
a
lifeless
wax
figure
she
stood
over
him
for
about
three
minutes
almost
holding
her
breath
and
suddenly
she
was
seized
with
terror
she
withdrew
on
tiptoe
stopped
at
the
door
hurriedly
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
and
retreated
unobserved
with
a
new
oppression
and
a
new
anguish
at
her
heart
he
slept
a
long
while
more
than
an
hour
and
still
in
the
same
rigid
pose
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
twitched
there
was
not
the
faintest
movement
in
his
whole
body
and
his
brows
were
still
contracted
in
the
same
forbidding
frown
if
varvara
petrovna
had
remained
another
three
minutes
she
could
not
have
endured
the
stifling
sensation
that
this
motionless
lethargy
roused
in
her
and
would
have
waked
him
but
he
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
and
sat
for
ten
minutes
as
immovable
as
before
staring
persistently
and
curiously
as
though
at
some
object
in
the
corner
which
had
struck
him
although
there
was
nothing
new
or
striking
in
the
room
suddenly
there
rang
out
the
low
deep
note
of
the
clock
on
the
wall
with
some
uneasiness
he
turned
to
look
at
it
but
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
other
door
opened
and
the
butler
alexey
yegorytch
came
in
he
had
in
one
hand
a
greatcoat
a
scarf
and
a
hat
and
in
the
other
a
silver
tray
with
a
note
on
it
halfpast
nine
he
announced
softly
and
laying
the
other
things
on
a
chair
he
held
out
the
tray
with
the
notea
scrap
of
paper
unsealed
and
scribbled
in
pencil
glancing
through
it
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
took
a
pencil
from
the
table
added
a
few
words
and
put
the
note
back
on
the
tray
take
it
back
as
soon
as
i
have
gone
out
and
now
dress
me
he
said
getting
up
from
the
sofa
noticing
that
he
had
on
a
light
velvet
jacket
he
thought
a
minute
and
told
the
man
to
bring
him
a
cloth
coat
which
he
wore
on
more
ceremonious
occasions
at
last
when
he
was
dressed
and
had
put
on
his
hat
he
locked
the
door
by
which
his
mother
had
come
into
the
room
took
the
letter
from
under
the
paperweight
and
without
saying
a
word
went
out
into
the
corridor
followed
by
alexey
yegorytch
from
the
corridor
they
went
down
the
narrow
stone
steps
of
the
back
stairs
to
a
passage
which
opened
straight
into
the
garden
in
the
corner
stood
a
lantern
and
a
big
umbrella
owing
to
the
excessive
rain
the
mud
in
the
streets
is
beyond
anything
alexey
yegorytch
announced
making
a
final
effort
to
deter
his
master
from
the
expedition
but
opening
his
umbrella
the
latter
went
without
a
word
into
the
damp
and
sodden
garden
which
was
dark
as
a
cellar
the
wind
was
roaring
and
tossing
the
bare
treetops
the
little
sandy
paths
were
wet
and
slippery
alexey
yegorytch
walked
along
as
he
was
bareheaded
in
his
swallowtail
coat
lighting
up
the
path
for
about
three
steps
before
them
with
the
lantern
wont
it
be
noticed
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
asked
suddenly
not
from
the
windows
besides
i
have
seen
to
all
that
already
the
old
servant
answered
in
quiet
and
measured
tones
has
my
mother
retired
her
excellency
locked
herself
in
at
nine
oclock
as
she
has
done
the
last
few
days
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
her
knowing
anything
at
what
hour
am
i
to
expect
your
honour
at
one
or
halfpast
not
later
than
two
yes
sir
crossing
the
garden
by
the
winding
paths
that
they
both
knew
by
heart
they
reached
the
stone
wall
and
there
in
the
farthest
corner
found
a
little
door
which
led
out
into
a
narrow
and
deserted
lane
and
was
always
kept
locked
it
appeared
that
alexey
yegorytch
had
the
key
in
his
hand
wont
the
door
creak
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
inquired
again
but
alexey
yegorytch
informed
him
that
it
had
been
oiled
yesterday
as
well
as
today
he
was
by
now
wet
through
unlocking
the
door
he
gave
the
key
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
if
it
should
be
your
pleasure
to
be
taking
a
distant
walk
i
would
warn
your
honour
that
i
am
not
confident
of
the
folk
here
especially
in
the
back
lanes
and
especially
beyond
the
river
he
could
not
resist
warning
him
again
he
was
an
old
servant
who
had
been
like
a
nurse
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
at
one
time
used
to
dandle
him
in
his
arms
he
was
a
grave
and
severe
man
who
was
fond
of
listening
to
religious
discourse
and
reading
books
of
devotion
dont
be
uneasy
alexey
yegorytch
may
gods
blessing
rest
on
you
sir
but
only
in
your
righteous
undertakings
what
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
stopping
short
in
the
lane
alexey
yegorytch
resolutely
repeated
his
words
he
had
never
before
ventured
to
express
himself
in
such
language
in
his
masters
presence
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
locked
the
door
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
and
crossed
the
lane
sinking
five
or
six
inches
into
the
mud
at
every
step
he
came
out
at
last
into
a
long
deserted
street
he
knew
the
town
like
the
five
fingers
of
his
hand
but
bogoyavlensky
street
was
a
long
way
off
it
was
past
ten
when
he
stopped
at
last
before
the
locked
gates
of
the
dark
old
house
that
belonged
to
filipov
the
ground
floor
had
stood
empty
since
the
lebyadkins
had
left
it
and
the
windows
were
boarded
up
but
there
was
a
light
burning
in
shatovs
room
on
the
second
floor
as
there
was
no
bell
he
began
banging
on
the
gate
with
his
hand
a
window
was
opened
and
shatov
peeped
out
into
the
street
it
was
terribly
dark
and
difficult
to
make
out
anything
shatov
was
peering
out
for
some
time
about
a
minute
is
that
you
he
asked
suddenly
yes
replied
the
uninvited
guest
shatov
slammed
the
window
went
downstairs
and
opened
the
gate
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
stepped
over
the
high
sill
and
without
a
word
passed
by
him
straight
into
kirillovs
lodge
v
there
everything
was
unlocked
and
all
the
doors
stood
open
the
passage
and
the
first
two
rooms
were
dark
but
there
was
a
light
shining
in
the
last
in
which
kirillov
lived
and
drank
tea
and
laughter
and
strange
cries
came
from
it
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
towards
the
light
but
stood
still
in
the
doorway
without
going
in
there
was
tea
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
the
old
woman
who
was
a
relation
of
the
landlord
she
was
bareheaded
and
was
dressed
in
a
petticoat
and
a
hareskin
jacket
and
her
stockingless
feet
were
thrust
into
slippers
in
her
arms
she
had
an
eighteenmonthsold
baby
with
nothing
on
but
its
little
shirt
with
bare
legs
flushed
cheeks
and
ruffled
white
hair
it
had
only
just
been
taken
out
of
the
cradle
it
seemed
to
have
just
been
crying
there
were
still
tears
in
its
eyes
but
at
that
instant
it
was
stretching
out
its
little
arms
clapping
its
hands
and
laughing
with
a
sob
as
little
children
do
kirillov
was
bouncing
a
big
red
indiarubber
ball
on
the
floor
before
it
the
ball
bounced
up
to
the
ceiling
and
back
to
the
floor
the
baby
shrieked
baw
baw
kirillov
caught
the
baw
and
gave
it
to
it
the
baby
threw
it
itself
with
its
awkward
little
hands
and
kirillov
ran
to
pick
it
up
again
at
last
the
baw
rolled
under
the
cupboard
baw
baw
cried
the
child
kirillov
lay
down
on
the
floor
trying
to
reach
the
ball
with
his
hand
under
the
cupboard
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
into
the
room
the
baby
caught
sight
of
him
nestled
against
the
old
woman
and
went
off
into
a
prolonged
infantile
wail
the
woman
immediately
carried
it
out
of
the
room
stavrogin
said
kirillov
beginning
to
get
up
from
the
floor
with
the
ball
in
his
hand
and
showing
no
surprise
at
the
unexpected
visit
will
you
have
tea
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
should
be
very
glad
of
it
if
its
hot
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
im
wet
through
its
hot
nearly
boiling
in
fact
kirillov
declared
delighted
sit
down
youre
muddy
but
thats
nothing
ill
mop
up
the
floor
later
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
sat
down
and
emptied
the
cup
he
handed
him
almost
at
a
gulp
some
more
asked
kirillov
no
thank
you
kirillov
who
had
not
sat
down
till
then
seated
himself
facing
him
and
inquired
why
have
you
come
on
business
here
read
this
letter
from
gaganov
do
you
remember
i
talked
to
you
about
him
in
petersburg
kirillov
took
the
letter
read
it
laid
it
on
the
table
and
looked
at
him
expectantly
as
you
know
i
met
this
gaganov
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
a
month
ago
in
petersburg
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
began
to
explain
we
came
across
each
other
two
or
three
times
in
company
with
other
people
without
making
my
acquaintance
and
without
addressing
me
he
managed
to
be
very
insolent
to
me
i
told
you
so
at
the
time
but
now
for
something
you
dont
know
as
he
was
leaving
petersburg
before
i
did
he
sent
me
a
letter
not
like
this
one
yet
impertinent
in
the
highest
degree
and
what
was
queer
about
it
was
that
it
contained
no
sort
of
explanation
of
why
it
was
written
i
answered
him
at
once
also
by
letter
and
said
quite
frankly
that
he
was
probably
angry
with
me
on
account
of
the
incident
with
his
father
four
years
ago
in
the
club
here
and
that
i
for
my
part
was
prepared
to
make
him
every
possible
apology
seeing
that
my
action
was
unintentional
and
was
the
result
of
illness
i
begged
him
to
consider
and
accept
my
apologies
he
went
away
without
answering
and
now
here
i
find
him
in
a
regular
fury
several
things
he
has
said
about
me
in
public
have
been
repeated
to
me
absolutely
abusive
and
making
astounding
charges
against
me
finally
today
i
get
this
letter
a
letter
such
as
no
one
has
ever
had
before
i
should
think
containing
such
expressions
as
the
punch
you
got
in
your
ugly
face
i
came
in
the
hope
that
you
would
not
refuse
to
be
my
second
you
said
no
one
has
ever
had
such
a
letter
observed
kirillov
they
may
be
sent
in
a
rage
such
letters
have
been
written
more
than
once
pushkin
wrote
to
hekern
all
right
ill
come
tell
me
how
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
explained
that
he
wanted
it
to
be
tomorrow
and
that
he
must
begin
by
renewing
his
offers
of
apology
and
even
with
the
promise
of
another
letter
of
apology
but
on
condition
that
gaganov
on
his
side
should
promise
to
send
no
more
letters
the
letter
he
had
received
he
would
regard
as
unwritten
too
much
concession
he
wont
agree
said
kirillov
ive
come
first
of
all
to
find
out
whether
you
would
consent
to
be
the
bearer
of
such
terms
ill
take
them
its
your
affair
but
he
wont
agree
i
know
he
wont
agree
he
wants
to
fight
say
how
youll
fight
the
point
is
that
i
want
the
thing
settled
tomorrow
by
nine
oclock
in
the
morning
you
must
be
at
his
house
hell
listen
and
wont
agree
but
will
put
you
in
communication
with
his
secondlet
us
say
about
eleven
you
will
arrange
things
with
him
and
let
us
all
be
on
the
spot
by
one
or
two
oclock
please
try
to
arrange
that
the
weapons
of
course
will
be
pistols
and
i
particularly
beg
you
to
arrange
to
fix
the
barriers
at
ten
paces
apart
then
you
put
each
of
us
ten
paces
from
the
barrier
and
at
a
given
signal
we
approach
each
must
go
right
up
to
his
barrier
but
you
may
fire
before
on
the
way
i
believe
thats
all
ten
paces
between
the
barriers
is
very
near
observed
kirillov
well
twelve
then
but
not
more
you
understand
that
he
wants
to
fight
in
earnest
do
you
know
how
to
load
a
pistol
i
do
ive
got
pistols
ill
give
my
word
that
youve
never
fired
them
his
second
will
give
his
word
about
his
therell
be
two
pairs
of
pistols
and
well
toss
up
his
or
ours
excellent
would
you
like
to
look
at
the
pistols
very
well
kirillov
squatted
on
his
heels
before
the
trunk
in
the
corner
which
he
had
never
yet
unpacked
though
things
had
been
pulled
out
of
it
as
required
he
pulled
out
from
the
bottom
a
palmwood
box
lined
with
red
velvet
and
from
it
took
out
a
pair
of
smart
and
very
expensive
pistols
ive
got
everything
powder
bullets
cartridges
ive
a
revolver
besides
wait
he
stooped
down
to
the
trunk
again
and
took
out
a
sixchambered
american
revolver
youve
got
weapons
enough
and
very
good
ones
very
extremely
kirillov
who
was
poor
almost
destitute
though
he
never
noticed
his
poverty
was
evidently
proud
of
showing
precious
weapons
which
he
had
certainly
obtained
with
great
sacrifice
you
still
have
the
same
intentions
stavrogin
asked
after
a
moments
silence
and
with
a
certain
wariness
yes
answered
kirillov
shortly
guessing
at
once
from
his
voice
what
he
was
asking
about
and
he
began
taking
the
weapons
from
the
table
when
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
inquired
still
more
cautiously
after
a
pause
in
the
meantime
kirillov
had
put
both
the
boxes
back
in
his
trunk
and
sat
down
in
his
place
again
that
doesnt
depend
on
me
as
you
knowwhen
they
tell
me
he
muttered
as
though
disliking
the
question
but
at
the
same
time
with
evident
readiness
to
answer
any
other
question
he
kept
his
black
lustreless
eyes
fixed
continually
on
stavrogin
with
a
calm
but
warm
and
kindly
expression
in
them
i
understand
shooting
oneself
of
course
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
began
suddenly
frowning
a
little
after
a
dreamy
silence
that
lasted
three
minutes
i
sometimes
have
thought
of
it
myself
and
then
there
always
came
a
new
idea
if
one
did
something
wicked
or
worse
still
something
shameful
that
is
disgraceful
only
very
shameful
and
ridiculous
such
as
people
would
remember
for
a
thousand
years
and
hold
in
scorn
for
a
thousand
years
and
suddenly
the
thought
comes
one
blow
in
the
temple
and
there
would
be
nothing
more
one
wouldnt
care
then
for
men
and
that
they
would
hold
one
in
scorn
for
a
thousand
years
would
one
you
call
that
a
new
idea
said
kirillov
after
a
moments
thought
i
didnt
call
it
so
but
when
i
thought
it
i
felt
it
as
a
new
idea
you
felt
the
idea
observed
kirillov
thats
good
there
are
lots
of
ideas
that
are
always
there
and
yet
suddenly
become
new
thats
true
i
see
a
great
deal
now
as
though
it
were
for
the
first
time
suppose
you
had
lived
in
the
moon
stavrogin
interrupted
not
listening
but
pursuing
his
own
thought
and
suppose
there
you
had
done
all
these
nasty
and
ridiculous
things
you
know
from
here
for
certain
that
they
will
laugh
at
you
and
hold
you
in
scorn
for
a
thousand
years
as
long
as
the
moon
lasts
but
now
you
are
here
and
looking
at
the
moon
from
here
you
dont
care
here
for
anything
youve
done
there
and
that
the
people
there
will
hold
you
in
scorn
for
a
thousand
years
do
you
i
dont
know
answered
kirillov
ive
not
been
in
the
moon
he
added
without
any
irony
simply
to
state
the
fact
whose
baby
was
that
just
now
the
old
womans
motherinlaw
was
hereno
daughterinlaw
its
all
the
same
three
days
shes
lying
ill
with
the
baby
it
cries
a
lot
at
night
its
the
stomach
the
mother
sleeps
but
the
old
woman
picks
it
up
i
play
ball
with
it
the
balls
from
hamburg
i
bought
it
in
hamburg
to
throw
it
and
catch
it
it
strengthens
the
spine
its
a
girl
are
you
fond
of
children
i
am
answered
kirillov
though
rather
indifferently
then
youre
fond
of
life
yes
im
fond
of
life
what
of
it
though
youve
made
up
your

yourself
what
of
it
why
connect
it
lifes
one
thing
and
thats
another
life
exists
but
death
doesnt
at
all
youve
begun
to
believe
in
a
future
eternal
life
no
not
in
a
future
eternal
life
but
in
eternal
life
here
there
are
moments
you
reach
moments
and
time
suddenly
stands
still
and
it
will
become
eternal
you
hope
to
reach
such
a
moment
yes
thatll
scarcely
be
possible
in
our
time
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
responded
slowly
and
as
it
were
dreamily
the
two
spoke
without
the
slightest
irony
in
the
apocalypse
the
angel
swears
that
there
will
be
no
more
time
i
know
thats
very
true
distinct
and
exact
when
all
mankind
attains
happiness
then
there
will
be
no
more
time
for
therell
be
no
need
of
it
a
very
true
thought
where
will
they
put
it
nowhere
times
not
an
object
but
an
idea
it
will
be
extinguished
in
the
mind
the
old
commonplaces
of
philosophy
the
same
from
the
beginning
of
time
stavrogin
muttered
with
a
kind
of
disdainful
compassion
always
the
same
always
the
same
from
the
beginning
of
time
and
never
any
other
kirillov
said
with
sparkling
eyes
as
though
there
were
almost
a
triumph
in
that
idea
you
seem
to
be
very
happy
kirillov
yes
very
happy
he
answered
as
though
making
the
most
ordinary
reply
but
you
were
distressed
so
lately
angry
with
liputin
hm
im
not
scolding
now
i
didnt
know
then
that
i
was
happy
have
you
seen
a
leaf
a
leaf
from
a
tree
yes
i
saw
a
yellow
one
lately
a
little
green
it
was
decayed
at
the
edges
it
was
blown
by
the
wind
when
i
was
ten
years
old
i
used
to
shut
my
eyes
in
the
winter
on
purpose
and
fancy
a
green
leaf
bright
with
veins
on
it
and
the
sun
shining
i
used
to
open
my
eyes
and
not
believe
them
because
it
was
very
nice
and
i
used
to
shut
them
again
whats
that
an
allegory
nno
why
im
not
speaking
of
an
allegory
but
of
a
leaf
only
a
leaf
the
leaf
is
good
everythings
good
everything
everything
man
is
unhappy
because
he
doesnt
know
hes
happy
its
only
that
thats
all
thats
all
if
anyone
finds
out
hell
become
happy
at
once
that
minute
that
motherinlaw
will
die
but
the
baby
will
remain
its
all
good
i
discovered
it
all
of
a
sudden
and
if
anyone
dies
of
hunger
and
if
anyone
insults
and
outrages
the
little
girl
is
that
good
yes
and
if
anyone
blows
his
brains
out
for
the
baby
thats
good
too
and
if
anyone
doesnt
thats
good
too
its
all
good
all
its
good
for
all
those
who
know
that
its
all
good
if
they
knew
that
it
was
good
for
them
it
would
be
good
for
them
but
as
long
as
they
dont
know
its
good
for
them
it
will
be
bad
for
them
thats
the
whole
idea
the
whole
of
it
when
did
you
find
out
you
were
so
happy
last
week
on
tuesday
no
wednesday
for
it
was
wednesday
by
that
time
in
the
night
by
what
reasoning
i
dont
remember
i
was
walking
about
the
room
never
mind
i
stopped
my
clock
it
was
thirtyseven
minutes
past
two
as
an
emblem
of
the
fact
that
there
will
be
no
more
time
kirillov
was
silent
theyre
bad
because
they
dont
know
theyre
good
when
they
find
out
they
wont
outrage
a
little
girl
theyll
find
out
that
theyre
good
and
theyll
all
become
good
every
one
of
them
here
youve
found
it
out
so
have
you
become
good
then
i
am
good
that
i
agree
with
though
stavrogin
muttered
frowning
he
who
teaches
that
all
are
good
will
end
the
world
he
who
taught
it
was
crucified
he
will
come
and
his
name
will
be
the
mangod
the
godman
the
mangod
thats
the
difference
surely
it
wasnt
you
lighted
the
lamp
under
the
ikon
yes
it
was
i
lighted
it
did
you
do
it
believing
the
old
woman
likes
to
have
the
lamp
and
she
hadnt
time
to
do
it
today
muttered
kirillov
you
dont
say
prayers
yourself
i
pray
to
everything
you
see
the
spider
crawling
on
the
wall
i
look
at
it
and
thank
it
for
crawling
his
eyes
glowed
again
he
kept
looking
straight
at
stavrogin
with
firm
and
unflinching
expression
stavrogin
frowned
and
watched
him
disdainfully
but
there
was
no
mockery
in
his
eyes
ill
bet
that
when
i
come
next
time
youll
be
believing
in
god
too
he
said
getting
up
and
taking
his
hat
why
said
kirillov
getting
up
too
if
you
were
to
find
out
that
you
believe
in
god
then
youd
believe
in
him
but
since
you
dont
know
that
you
believe
in
him
then
you
dont
believe
in
him
laughed
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
thats
not
right
kirillov
pondered
youve
distorted
the
idea
its
a
flippant
joke
remember
what
you
have
meant
in
my
life
stavrogin
goodbye
kirillov
come
at
night
when
will
you
why
havent
you
forgotten
about
tomorrow
ach
id
forgotten
dont
be
uneasy
i
wont
oversleep
at
nine
oclock
i
know
how
to
wake
up
when
i
want
to
i
go
to
bed
saying
seven
oclock
and
i
wake
up
at
seven
oclock
ten
oclock
and
i
wake
up
at
ten
oclock
you
have
remarkable
powers
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looking
at
his
pale
face
ill
come
and
open
the
gate
dont
trouble
shatov
will
open
it
for
me
ah
shatov
very
well
goodbye
vi
the
door
of
the
empty
house
in
which
shatov
was
lodging
was
not
closed
but
making
his
way
into
the
passage
stavrogin
found
himself
in
utter
darkness
and
began
feeling
with
his
hand
for
the
stairs
to
the
upper
story
suddenly
a
door
opened
upstairs
and
a
light
appeared
shatov
did
not
come
out
himself
but
simply
opened
his
door
when
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
he
saw
shatov
standing
at
the
table
in
the
corner
waiting
expectantly
will
you
receive
me
on
business
he
queried
from
the
doorway
come
in
and
sit
down
answered
shatov
shut
the
door
stay
ill
shut
it
he
locked
the
door
returned
to
the
table
and
sat
down
facing
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
he
had
grown
thinner
during
that
week
and
now
he
seemed
in
a
fever
youve
been
worrying
me
to
death
he
said
looking
down
in
a
soft
halfwhisper
why
didnt
you
come
you
were
so
sure
i
should
come
then
yes
stay
i
have
been
delirious
perhaps
im
delirious
now
stay
a
moment
he
got
up
and
seized
something
that
was
lying
on
the
uppermost
of
his
three
bookshelves
it
was
a
revolver
one
night
in
delirium
i
fancied
that
you
were
coming
to
kill
me
and
early
next
morning
i
spent
my
last
farthing
on
buying
a
revolver
from
that
goodfornothing
fellow
lyamshin
i
did
not
mean
to
let
you
do
it
then
i
came
to
myself
again
ive
neither
powder
nor
shot
it
has
been
lying
there
on
the
shelf
till
now
wait
a
minute
he
got
up
and
was
opening
the
casement
dont
throw
it
away
why
should
you
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
checked
him
its
worth
something
besides
tomorrow
people
will
begin
saying
that
there
are
revolvers
lying
about
under
shatovs
window
put
it
back
thats
right
sit
down
tell
me
why
do
you
seem
to
be
penitent
for
having
thought
i
should
come
to
kill
you
i
have
not
come
now
to
be
reconciled
but
to
talk
of
something
necessary
enlighten
me
to
begin
with
you
didnt
give
me
that
blow
because
of
my
connection
with
your
wife
you
know
i
didnt
yourself
said
shatov
looking
down
again
and
not
because
you
believed
the
stupid
gossip
about
darya
pavlovna
no
no
of
course
not
its
nonsense
my
sister
told
me
from
the
very
first
shatov
said
harshly
and
impatiently
and
even
with
a
slight
stamp
of
his
foot
then
i
guessed
right
and
you
too
guessed
right
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
on
in
a
tranquil
voice
you
are
right
marya
timofyevna
lebyadkin
is
my
lawful
wife
married
to
me
four
and
a
half
years
ago
in
petersburg
i
suppose
the
blow
was
on
her
account
shatov
utterly
astounded
listened
in
silence
i
guessed
but
did
not
believe
it
he
muttered
at
last
looking
strangely
at
stavrogin
and
you
struck
me
shatov
flushed
and
muttered
almost
incoherently
because
of
your
fall
your
lie
i
didnt
go
up
to
you
to
punish
you
i
didnt
know
when
i
went
up
to
you
that
i
should
strike
you
i
did
it
because
you
meant
so
much
to
me
in
my
life
i
i
understand
i
understand
spare
your
words
i
am
sorry
you
are
feverish
ive
come
about
a
most
urgent
matter
i
have
been
expecting
you
too
long
shatov
seemed
to
be
quivering
all
over
and
he
got
up
from
his
seat
say
what
you
have
to
say
ill
speak
too
later
he
sat
down
what
i
have
come
about
is
nothing
of
that
kind
began
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
scrutinising
him
with
curiosity
owing
to
certain
circumstances
i
was
forced
this
very
day
to
choose
such
an
hour
to
come
and
tell
you
that
they
may
murder
you
shatov
looked
wildly
at
him
i
know
that
i
may
be
in
some
danger
he
said
in
measured
tones
but
how
can
you
have
come
to
know
of
it
because
i
belong
to
them
as
you
do
and
am
a
member
of
their
society
just
as
you
are
you
you
are
a
member
of
the
society
i
see
from
your
eyes
that
you
were
prepared
for
anything
from
me
rather
than
that
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
a
faint
smile
but
excuse
me
you
knew
then
that
there
would
be
an
attempt
on
your
life
nothing
of
the
sort
and
i
dont
think
so
now
in
spite
of
your
words
though
though
theres
no
being
sure
of
anything
with
these
fools
he
cried
suddenly
in
a
fury
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
im
not
afraid
of
them
ive
broken
with
them
that
fellows
run
here
four
times
to
tell
me
it
was
possible
buthe
looked
at
stavroginwhat
do
you
know
about
it
exactly
dont
be
uneasy
i
am
not
deceiving
you
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
on
rather
coldly
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
only
fulfilling
a
duty
you
question
me
as
to
what
i
know
i
know
that
you
entered
that
society
abroad
two
years
ago
at
the
time
of
the
old
organisation
just
before
you
went
to
america
and
i
believe
just
after
our
last
conversation
about
which
you
wrote
so
much
to
me
in
your
letter
from
america
by
the
way
i
must
apologise
for
not
having
answered
you
by
letter
but
confined
myself
to
to
sending
the
money
wait
a
bit
shatov
interrupted
hurriedly
pulling
out
a
drawer
in
the
table
and
taking
from
under
some
papers
a
rainbowcoloured
note
here
take
it
the
hundred
roubles
you
sent
me
but
for
you
i
should
have
perished
out
there
i
should
have
been
a
long
time
paying
it
back
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
mother
she
made
me
a
present
of
that
note
nine
months
ago
because
i
was
so
badly
off
after
my
illness
but
go
on
please
he
was
breathless
in
america
you
changed
your
views
and
when
you
came
back
you
wanted
to
resign
they
gave
you
no
answer
but
charged
you
to
take
over
a
printing
press
here
in
russia
from
someone
and
to
keep
it
till
you
handed
it
over
to
someone
who
would
come
from
them
for
it
i
dont
know
the
details
exactly
but
i
fancy
thats
the
position
in
outline
you
undertook
it
in
the
hope
or
on
the
condition
that
it
would
be
the
last
task
they
would
require
of
you
and
that
then
they
would
release
you
altogether
whether
that
is
so
or
not
i
learnt
it
not
from
them
but
quite
by
chance
but
now
for
what
i
fancy
you
dont
know
these
gentry
have
no
intention
of
parting
with
you
thats
absurd
cried
shatov
ive
told
them
honestly
that
ive
cut
myself
off
from
them
in
everything
that
is
my
right
the
right
to
freedom
of
conscience
and
of
thought
i
wont
put
up
with
it
theres
no
power
which
could
i
say
dont
shout
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
said
earnestly
checking
him
that
verhovensky
is
such
a
fellow
that
he
may
be
listening
to
us
now
in
your
passage
perhaps
with
his
own
ears
or
someone
elses
even
that
drunkard
lebyadkin
was
probably
bound
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
and
you
on
him
too
i
dare
say
youd
better
tell
me
has
verhovensky
accepted
your
arguments
now
or
not
he
has
he
has
said
that
it
can
be
done
and
that
i
have
the
right
well
then
hes
deceiving
you
i
know
that
even
kirillov
who
scarcely
belongs
to
them
at
all
has
given
them
information
about
you
and
they
have
lots
of
agents
even
people
who
dont
know
that
theyre
serving
the
society
theyve
always
kept
a
watch
on
you
one
of
the
things
pyotr
verhovensky
came
here
for
was
to
settle
your
business
once
for
all
and
he
is
fully
authorised
to
do
so
that
is
at
the
first
good
opportunity
to
get
rid
of
you
as
a
man
who
knows
too
much
and
might
give
them
away
i
repeat
that
this
is
certain
and
allow
me
to
add
that
they
are
for
some
reason
convinced
that
you
are
a
spy
and
that
if
you
havent
informed
against
them
yet
you
will
is
that
true
shatov
made
a
wry
face
at
hearing
such
a
question
asked
in
such
a
matterof
fact
tone
if
i
were
a
spy
whom
could
i
inform
he
said
angrily
not
giving
a
direct
answer
no
leave
me
alone
let
me
go
to
the
devil
he
cried
suddenly
catching
again
at
his
original
idea
which
agitated
him
violently
apparently
it
affected
him
more
deeply
than
the
news
of
his
own
danger
you
you
stavrogin
how
could
you
mix
yourself
up
with
such
shameful
stupid
secondhand
absurdity
you
a
member
of
the
society
what
an
exploit
for
stavrogin
he
cried
suddenly
in
despair
he
clasped
his
hands
as
though
nothing
could
be
a
bitterer
and
more
inconsolable
grief
to
him
than
such
a
discovery
excuse
me
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
extremely
surprised
but
you
seem
to
look
upon
me
as
a
sort
of
sun
and
on
yourself
as
an
insect
in
comparison
i
noticed
that
even
from
your
letter
in
america
you
you
know
oh
let
us
drop
me
altogether
shatov
broke
off
suddenly
and
if
you
can
explain
anything
about
yourself
explain
it
answer
my
question
he
repeated
feverishly
with
pleasure
you
ask
how
i
could
get
into
such
a
den
after
what
i
have
told
you
im
bound
to
be
frank
with
you
to
some
extent
on
the
subject
you
see
strictly
speaking
i
dont
belong
to
the
society
at
all
and
i
never
have
belonged
to
it
and
ive
much
more
right
than
you
to
leave
them
because
i
never
joined
them
in
fact
from
the
very
beginning
i
told
them
that
i
was
not
one
of
them
and
that
if
ive
happened
to
help
them
it
has
simply
been
by
accident
as
a
man
of
leisure
i
took
some
part
in
reorganising
the
society
on
the
new
plan
but
that
was
all
but
now
theyve
changed
their
views
and
have
made
up
their
minds
that
it
would
be
dangerous
to
let
me
go
and
i
believe
im
sentenced
to
death
too
oh
they
do
nothing
but
sentence
to
death
and
all
by
means
of
sealed
documents
signed
by
three
men
and
a
half
and
you
think
theyve
any
power
youre
partly
right
there
and
partly
not
stavrogin
answered
with
the
same
indifference
almost
listlessness
theres
no
doubt
that
theres
a
great
deal
thats
fanciful
about
it
as
there
always
is
in
such
cases
a
handful
magnifies
its
size
and
significance
to
my
thinking
if
you
will
have
it
the
only
one
is
pyotr
verhovensky
and
its
simply
goodnature
on
his
part
to
consider
himself
only
an
agent
of
the
society
but
the
fundamental
idea
is
no
stupider
than
others
of
the
sort
they
are
connected
with
the
internationale
they
have
succeeded
in
establishing
agents
in
russia
they
have
even
hit
on
a
rather
original
method
though
its
only
theoretical
of
course
as
for
their
intentions
here
the
movements
of
our
russian
organisation
are
something
so
obscure
and
almost
always
unexpected
that
really
they
might
try
anything
among
us
note
that
verhovensky
is
an
obstinate
man
hes
a
bug
an
ignoramus
a
buffoon
who
understands
nothing
in
russia
cried
shatov
spitefully
you
know
him
very
little
its
quite
true
that
none
of
them
understand
much
about
russia
but
not
much
less
than
you
and
i
do
besides
verhovensky
is
an
enthusiast
verhovensky
an
enthusiast
oh
yes
there
is
a
point
when
he
ceases
to
be
a
buffoon
and
becomes
a
madman
i
beg
you
to
remember
your
own
expression
do
you
know
how
powerful
a
single
man
may
be
please
dont
laugh
about
it
hes
quite
capable
of
pulling
a
trigger
they
are
convinced
that
i
am
a
spy
too
as
they
dont
know
how
to
do
things
themselves
theyre
awfully
fond
of
accusing
people
of
being
spies
but
youre
not
afraid
are
you
nno
im
not
very
much
afraid
but
your
case
is
quite
different
i
warned
you
that
you
might
anyway
keep
it
in
mind
to
my
thinking
theres
no
reason
to
be
offended
in
being
threatened
with
danger
by
fools
their
brains
dont
affect
the
question
theyve
raised
their
hand
against
better
men
than
you
or
me
its
a
quarter
past
eleven
though
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
got
up
from
his
chair
i
wanted
to
ask
you
one
quite
irrelevant
question
for
gods
sake
cried
shatov
rising
impulsively
from
his
seat
i
beg
your
pardon
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
at
him
inquiringly
ask
it
ask
your
question
for
gods
sake
shatov
repeated
in
indescribable
excitement
but
on
condition
that
i
ask
you
a
question
too
i
beseech
you
to
allow
me
i
cant
ask
your
question
stavrogin
waited
a
moment
and
then
began
ive
heard
that
you
have
some
influence
on
marya
timofyevna
and
that
she
was
fond
of
seeing
you
and
hearing
you
talk
is
that
so
yes
she
used
to
listen
said
shatov
confused
within
a
day
or
two
i
intend
to
make
a
public
announcement
of
our
marriage
here
in
the
town
is
that
possible
shatov
whispered
almost
with
horror
i
dont
quite
understand
you
theres
no
sort
of
difficulty
about
it
witnesses
to
the
marriage
are
here
everything
took
place
in
petersburg
perfectly
legally
and
smoothly
and
if
it
has
not
been
made
known
till
now
it
is
simply
because
the
witnesses
kirillov
pyotr
verhovensky
and
lebyadkin
whom
i
now
have
the
pleasure
of
claiming
as
a
brotherinlaw
promised
to
hold
their
tongues
i
dont
mean
that
you
speak
so
calmly
but
good
listen
you
werent
forced
into
that
marriage
were
you
no
no
one
forced
me
into
it
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
smiled
at
shatovs
importunate
haste
and
whats
that
talk
she
keeps
up
about
her
baby
shatov
interposed
disconnectedly
with
feverish
haste
she
talks
about
her
baby
bah
i
didnt
know
its
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
it
she
never
had
a
baby
and
couldnt
have
had
marya
timofyevna
is
a
virgin
ah
thats
just
what
i
thought
listen
whats
the
matter
with
you
shatov
shatov
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
turned
away
but
suddenly
clutched
stavrogin
by
the
shoulders
do
you
know
why
do
you
know
why
anyway
he
shouted
why
you
did
all
this
and
why
you
are
resolved
on
such
a
punishment
now
your
question
is
clever
and
malignant
but
i
mean
to
surprise
you
too
i
fancy
i
do
know
why
i
got
married
then
and
why
i
am
resolved
on
such
a
punishment
now
as
you
express
it
lets
leave
that
of
that
later
put
it
off
lets
talk
of
the
chief
thing
the
chief
thing
ive
been
waiting
two
years
for
you
yes
ive
waited
too
long
for
you
ive
been
thinking
of
you
incessantly
you
are
the
only
man
who
could
move
i
wrote
to
you
about
it
from
america
i
remember
your
long
letter
very
well
too
long
to
be
read
no
doubt
six
sheets
of
notepaper
dont
speak
dont
speak
tell
me
can
you
spare
me
another
ten
minutes
but
now
this
minute
i
have
waited
for
you
too
long
certainly
half
an
hour
if
you
like
but
not
more
if
that
will
suit
you
and
on
condition
too
shatov
put
in
wrathfully
that
you
take
a
different
tone
do
you
hear
i
demand
when
i
ought
to
entreat
do
you
understand
what
it
means
to
demand
when
one
ought
to
entreat
i
understand
that
in
that
way
you
lift
yourself
above
all
ordinary
considerations
for
the
sake
of
loftier
aims
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
a
faint
smile
i
see
with
regret
too
that
youre
feverish
i
beg
you
to
treat
me
with
respect
i
insist
on
it
shouted
shatov
not
my
personalityi
dont
care
a
hang
for
that
but
something
else
just
for
this
once
while
i
am
talking
we
are
two
beings
and
have
come
together
in
infinity
for
the
last
time
in
the
world
drop
your
tone
and
speak
like
a
human
being
speak
if
only
for
once
in
your
life
with
the
voice
of
a
man
i
say
it
not
for
my
sake
but
for
yours
do
you
understand
that
you
ought
to
forgive
me
that
blow
in
the
face
if
only
because
i
gave
you
the
opportunity
of
realising
your
immense
power

again
you
smile
your
disdainful
worldly
smile
oh
when
will
you
understand
me
have
done
with
being
a
snob
understand
that
i
insist
on
that
i
insist
on
it
else
i
wont
speak
im
not
going
to
for
anything
his
excitement
was
approaching
frenzy
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
frowned
and
seemed
to
become
more
on
his
guard
since
i
have
remained
another
halfhour
with
you
when
time
is
so
precious
he
pronounced
earnestly
and
impressively
you
may
rest
assured
that
i
mean
to
listen
to
you
at
least
with
interest
and
i
am
convinced
that
i
shall
hear
from
you
much
that
is
new
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
sit
down
cried
shatov
and
he
sat
down
himself
please
remember
stavrogin
interposed
once
more
that
i
was
about
to
ask
a
real
favour
of
you
concerning
marya
timofyevna
of
great
importance
for
her
anyway
what
shatov
frowned
suddenly
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
just
been
interrupted
at
the
most
important
moment
and
who
gazes
at
you
unable
to
grasp
the
question
and
you
did
not
let
me
finish
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
on
with
a
smile
oh
nonsense
afterwards
shatov
waved
his
hand
disdainfully
grasping
at
last
what
he
wanted
and
passed
at
once
to
his
principal
theme
vii
do
you
know
he
began
with
flashing
eyes
almost
menacingly
bending
right
forward
in
his
chair
raising
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
above
him
obviously
unaware
that
he
was
doing
so
do
you
know
who
are
the
only
godbearing
people
on
earth
destined
to
regenerate
and
save
the
world
in
the
name
of
a
new
god
and
to
whom
are
given
the
keys
of
life
and
of
the
new
world
do
you
know
which
is
that
people
and
what
is
its
name
from
your
manner
i
am
forced
to
conclude
and
i
think
i
may
as
well
do
so
at
once
that
it
is
the
russian
people
and
you
can
laugh
oh
what
a
race
shatov
burst
out
calm
yourself
i
beg
of
you
on
the
contrary
i
was
expecting
something
of
the
sort
from
you
you
expected
something
of
the
sort
and
dont
you
know
those
words
yourself
i
know
them
very
well
i
see
only
too
well
what
youre
driving
at
all
your
phrases
even
the
expression
godbearing
people
is
only
a
sequel
to
our
talk
two
years
ago
abroad
not
long
before
you
went
to
america

at
least
as
far
as
i
can
recall
it
now
its
your
phrase
altogether
not
mine
your
own
not
simply
the
sequel
of
our
conversation
our
conversation
it
was
not
at
all
it
was
a
teacher
uttering
weighty
words
and
a
pupil
who
was
raised
from
the
dead
i
was
that
pupil
and
you
were
the
teacher
but
if
you
remember
it
was
just
after
my
words
you
joined
their
society
and
only
afterwards
went
away
to
america
yes
and
i
wrote
to
you
from
america
about
that
i
wrote
to
you
about
everything
yes
i
could
not
at
once
tear
my
bleeding
heart
from
what
i
had
grown
into
from
childhood
on
which
had
been
lavished
all
the
raptures
of
my
hopes
and
all
the
tears
of
my
hatred
it
is
difficult
to
change
gods
i
did
not
believe
you
then
because
i
did
not
want
to
believe
i
plunged
for
the
last
time
into
that
sewer
but
the
seed
remained
and
grew
up
seriously
tell
me
seriously
didnt
you
read
all
my
letter
from
america
perhaps
you
didnt
read
it
at
all
i
read
three
pages
of
it
the
two
first
and
the
last
and
i
glanced
through
the
middle
as
well
but
i
was
always
meaning
ah
never
mind
drop
it
damn
it
cried
shatov
waving
his
hand
if
youve
renounced
those
words
about
the
people
now
how
could
you
have
uttered
them
then
thats
what
crushes
me
now
i
wasnt
joking
with
you
then
in
persuading
you
i
was
perhaps
more
concerned
with
myself
than
with
you
stavrogin
pronounced
enigmatically
you
werent
joking
in
america
i
was
lying
for
three
months
on
straw
beside
a
hapless
creature
and
i
learnt
from
him
that
at
the
very
time
when
you
were
sowing
the
seed
of
god
and
the
fatherland
in
my
heart
at
that
very
time
perhaps
during
those
very
days
you
were
infecting
the
heart
of
that
hapless
creature
that
maniac
kirillov
with
poison
you
confirmed
false
malignant
ideas
in
him
and
brought
him
to
the
verge
of
insanity
go
look
at
him
now
he
is
your
creation
youve
seen
him
though
in
the
first
place
i
must
observe
that
kirillov
himself
told
me
that
he
is
happy
and
that
hes
good
your
supposition
that
all
this
was
going
on
at
the
same
time
is
almost
correct
but
what
of
it
i
repeat
i
was
not
deceiving
either
of
you
are
you
an
atheist
an
atheist
now
yes
and
then
just
as
i
was
then
i
wasnt
asking
you
to
treat
me
with
respect
when
i
began
the
conversation
with
your
intellect
you
might
have
understood
that
shatov
muttered
indignantly
i
didnt
get
up
at
your
first
word
i
didnt
close
the
conversation
i
didnt
go
away
from
you
but
have
been
sitting
here
ever
since
submissively
answering
your
questions
and
cries
so
it
seems
i
have
not
been
lacking
in
respect
to
you
yet
shatov
interrupted
waving
his
hand
do
you
remember
your
expression
that
an
atheist
cant
be
a
russian
that
an
atheist
at
once
ceases
to
be
a
russian
do
you
remember
saying
that
did
i
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
questioned
him
back
you
ask
youve
forgotten
and
yet
that
was
one
of
the
truest
statements
of
the
leading
peculiarity
of
the
russian
soul
which
you
divined
you
cant
have
forgotten
it
i
will
remind
you
of
something
else
you
said
then
that
a
man
who
was
not
orthodox
could
not
be
russian
i
imagine
thats
a
slavophil
idea
the
slavophils
of
today
disown
it
nowadays
people
have
grown
cleverer
but
you
went
further
you
believed
that
roman
catholicism
was
not
christianity
you
asserted
that
rome
proclaimed
christ
subject
to
the
third
temptation
of
the
devil
announcing
to
all
the
world
that
christ
without
an
earthly
kingdom
cannot
hold
his
ground
upon
earth
catholicism
by
so
doing
proclaimed
antichrist
and
ruined
the
whole
western
world
you
pointed
out
that
if
france
is
in
agonies
now
its
simply
the
fault
of
catholicism
for
she
has
rejected
the
iniquitous
god
of
rome
and
has
not
found
a
new
one
thats
what
you
could
say
then
i
remember
our
conversations
if
i
believed
no
doubt
i
should
repeat
it
even
now
i
wasnt
lying
when
i
spoke
as
though
i
had
faith
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
pronounced
very
earnestly
but
i
must
tell
you
this
repetition
of
my
ideas
in
the
past
makes
a
very
disagreeable
impression
on
me
cant
you
leave
off
if
you
believe
it
repeated
shatov
paying
not
the
slightest
attention
to
this
request
but
didnt
you
tell
me
that
if
it
were
mathematically
proved
to
you
that
the
truth
excludes
christ
youd
prefer
to
stick
to
christ
rather
than
to
the
truth
did
you
say
that
did
you
but
allow
me
too
at
last
to
ask
a
question
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
raising
his
voice
what
is
the
object
of
this
irritable
and
malicious
crossexamination
this
examination
will
be
over
for
all
eternity
and
you
will
never
hear
it
mentioned
again
you
keep
insisting
that
we
are
outside
the
limits
of
time
and
space
hold
your
tongue
shatov
cried
suddenly
i
am
stupid
and
awkward
but
let
my
name
perish
in
ignominy
let
me
repeat
your
leading
idea
oh
only
a
dozen
lines
only
the
conclusion
repeat
it
if
its
only
the
conclusion
stavrogin
made
a
movement
to
look
at
his
watch
but
restrained
himself
and
did
not
look
shatov
bent
forward
in
his
chair
again
and
again
held
up
his
finger
for
a
moment
not
a
single
nation
he
went
on
as
though
reading
it
line
by
line
still
gazing
menacingly
at
stavrogin
not
a
single
nation
has
ever
been
founded
on
principles
of
science
or
reason
there
has
never
been
an
example
of
it
except
for
a
brief
moment
through
folly
socialism
is
from
its
very
nature
bound
to
be
atheism
seeing
that
it
has
from
the
very
first
proclaimed
that
it
is
an
atheistic
organisation
of
society
and
that
it
intends
to
establish
itself
exclusively
on
the
elements
of
science
and
reason
science
and
reason
have
from
the
beginning
of
time
played
a
secondary
and
subordinate
part
in
the
life
of
nations
so
it
will
be
till
the
end
of
time
nations
are
built
up
and
moved
by
another
force
which
sways
and
dominates
them
the
origin
of
which
is
unknown
and
inexplicable
that
force
is
the
force
of
an
insatiable
desire
to
go
on
to
the
end
though
at
the
same
time
it
denies
that
end
it
is
the
force
of
the
persistent
assertion
of
ones
own
existence
and
a
denial
of
death
its
the
spirit
of
life
as
the
scriptures
call
it
the
river
of
living
water
the
drying
up
of
which
is
threatened
in
the
apocalypse
its
the
sthetic
principle
as
the
philosophers
call
it
the
ethical
principle
with
which
they
identify
it
the
seeking
for
god
as
i
call
it
more
simply
the
object
of
every
national
movement
in
every
people
and
at
every
period
of
its
existence
is
only
the
seeking
for
its
god
who
must
be
its
own
god
and
the
faith
in
him
as
the
only
true
one
god
is
the
synthetic
personality
of
the
whole
people
taken
from
its
beginning
to
its
end
it
has
never
happened
that
all
or
even
many
peoples
have
had
one
common
god
but
each
has
always
had
its
own
its
a
sign
of
the
decay
of
nations
when
they
begin
to
have
gods
in
common
when
gods
begin
to
be
common
to
several
nations
the
gods
are
dying
and
the
faith
in
them
together
with
the
nations
themselves
the
stronger
a
people
the
more
individual
their
god
there
never
has
been
a
nation
without
a
religion
that
is
without
an
idea
of
good
and
evil
every
people
has
its
own
conception
of
good
and
evil
and
its
own
good
and
evil
when
the
same
conceptions
of
good
and
evil
become
prevalent
in
several
nations
then
these
nations
are
dying
and
then
the
very
distinction
between
good
and
evil
is
beginning
to
disappear
reason
has
never
had
the
power
to
define
good
and
evil
or
even
to
distinguish
between
good
and
evil
even
approximately
on
the
contrary
it
has
always
mixed
them
up
in
a
disgraceful
and
pitiful
way
science
has
even
given
the
solution
by
the
fist
this
is
particularly
characteristic
of
the
halftruths
of
science
the
most
terrible
scourge
of
humanity
unknown
till
this
century
and
worse
than
plague
famine
or
war
a
halftruth
is
a
despot
such
as
has
never
been
in
the
world
before
a
despot
that
has
its
priests
and
its
slaves
a
despot
to
whom
all
do
homage
with
love
and
superstition
hitherto
inconceivable
before
which
science
itself
trembles
and
cringes
in
a
shameful
way
these
are
your
own
words
stavrogin
all
except
that
about
the
halftruth
thats
my
own
because
i
am
myself
a
case
of
halfknowledge
and
thats
why
i
hate
it
particularly
i
havent
altered
anything
of
your
ideas
or
even
of
your
words
not
a
syllable
i
dont
agree
that
youve
not
altered
anything
stavrogin
observed
cautiously
you
accepted
them
with
ardour
and
in
your
ardour
have
transformed
them
unconsciously
the
very
fact
that
you
reduce
god
to
a
simple
attribute
of
nationality
he
suddenly
began
watching
shatov
with
intense
and
peculiar
attention
not
so
much
his
words
as
himself
i
reduce
god
to
the
attribute
of
nationality
cried
shatov
on
the
contrary
i
raise
the
people
to
god
and
has
it
ever
been
otherwise
the
people
is
the
body
of
god
every
people
is
only
a
people
so
long
as
it
has
its
own
god
and
excludes
all
other
gods
on
earth
irreconcilably
so
long
as
it
believes
that
by
its
god
it
will
conquer
and
drive
out
of
the
world
all
other
gods
such
from
the
beginning
of
time
has
been
the
belief
of
all
great
nations
all
anyway
who
have
been
specially
remarkable
all
who
have
been
leaders
of
humanity
there
is
no
going
against
facts
the
jews
lived
only
to
await
the
coming
of
the
true
god
and
left
the
world
the
true
god
the
greeks
deified
nature
and
bequeathed
the
world
their
religion
that
is
philosophy
and
art
rome
deified
the
people
in
the
state
and
bequeathed
the
idea
of
the
state
to
the
nations
france
throughout
her
long
history
was
only
the
incarnation
and
development
of
the
roman
god
and
if
they
have
at
last
flung
their
roman
god
into
the
abyss
and
plunged
into
atheism
which
for
the
time
being
they
call
socialism
it
is
solely
because
socialism
is
anyway
healthier
than
roman
catholicism
if
a
great
people
does
not
believe
that
the
truth
is
only
to
be
found
in
itself
alone
in
itself
alone
and
in
it
exclusively
if
it
does
not
believe
that
it
alone
is
fit
and
destined
to
raise
up
and
save
all
the
rest
by
its
truth
it
would
at
once
sink
into
being
ethnographical
material
and
not
a
great
people
a
really
great
people
can
never
accept
a
secondary
part
in
the
history
of
humanity
nor
even
one
of
the
first
but
will
have
the
first
part
a
nation
which
loses
this
belief
ceases
to
be
a
nation
but
there
is
only
one
truth
and
therefore
only
a
single
one
out
of
the
nations
can
have
the
true
god
even
though
other
nations
may
have
great
gods
of
their
own
only
one
nation
is
godbearing
thats
the
russian
people
and
and
and
can
you
think
me
such
a
fool
stavrogin
he
yelled
frantically
all
at
once
that
i
cant
distinguish
whether
my
words
at
this
moment
are
the
rotten
old
commonplaces
that
have
been
ground
out
in
all
the
slavophil
mills
in
moscow
or
a
perfectly
new
saying
the
last
word
the
sole
word
of
renewal
and
resurrection
and
and
what
do
i
care
for
your
laughter
at
this
minute
what
do
i
care
that
you
utterly
utterly
fail
to
understand
me
not
a
word
not
a
sound
oh
how
i
despise
your
haughty
laughter
and
your
look
at
this
minute
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
there
was
positively
foam
on
his
lips
on
the
contrary
shatov
on
the
contrary
stavrogin
began
with
extraordinary
earnestness
and
selfcontrol
still
keeping
his
seat
on
the
contrary
your
fervent
words
have
revived
many
extremely
powerful
recollections
in
me
in
your
words
i
recognise
my
own
mood
two
years
ago
and
now
i
will
not
tell
you
as
i
did
just
now
that
you
have
exaggerated
my
ideas
i
believe
indeed
that
they
were
even
more
exceptional
even
more
independent
and
i
assure
you
for
the
third
time
that
i
should
be
very
glad
to
confirm
all
that
youve
said
just
now
every
syllable
of
it
but
but
you
want
a
hare
what
your
own
nasty
expression
shatov
laughed
spitefully
sitting
down
again
to
cook
your
hare
you
must
first
catch
it
to
believe
in
god
you
must
first
have
a
god
you
used
to
say
that
in
petersburg
im
told
like
nozdryov
who
tried
to
catch
a
hare
by
his
hind
legs
no
what
he
did
was
to
boast
hed
caught
him
by
the
way
allow
me
to
trouble
you
with
a
question
though
for
indeed
i
think
i
have
the
right
to
one
now
tell
me
have
you
caught
your
hare
dont
dare
to
ask
me
in
such
words
ask
differently
quite
differently
shatov
suddenly
began
trembling
all
over
certainly
ill
ask
differently
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
coldly
at
him
i
only
wanted
to
know
do
you
believe
in
god
yourself
i
believe
in
russia
i
believe
in
her
orthodoxy
i
believe
in
the
body
of
christ
i
believe
that
the
new
advent
will
take
place
in
russia
i
believe
shatov
muttered
frantically
and
in
god
in
god
i
i
will
believe
in
god
not
one
muscle
moved
in
stavrogins
face
shatov
looked
passionately
and
defiantly
at
him
as
though
he
would
have
scorched
him
with
his
eyes
i
havent
told
you
that
i
dont
believe
he
cried
at
last
i
will
only
have
you
know
that
i
am
a
luckless
tedious
book
and
nothing
more
so
far
so
far
but
confound
me
were
discussing
you
not
me
im
a
man
of
no
talent
and
can
only
give
my
blood
nothing
more
like
every
man
without
talent
never
mind
my
blood
either
im
talking
about
you
ive
been
waiting
here
two
years
for
you
here
ive
been
dancing
about
in
my
nakedness
before
you
for
the
last
halfhour
you
only
you
can
raise
that
flag
he
broke
off
and
sat
as
though
in
despair
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hands
i
merely
mention
it
as
something
queer
stavrogin
interrupted
suddenly
every
one
for
some
inexplicable
reason
keeps
foisting
a
flag
upon
me
pyotr
verhovensky
too
is
convinced
that
i
might
raise
his
flag
thats
how
his
words
were
repeated
to
me
anyway
he
has
taken
it
into
his
head
that
im
capable
of
playing
the
part
of
stenka
razin
for
them
from
my
extraordinary
aptitude
for
crime
his
saying
too
what
cried
shatov
from
your
extraordinary
aptitude
for
crime
just
so
hm
and
is
it
true
he
asked
with
an
angry
smile
is
it
true
that
when
you
were
in
petersburg
you
belonged
to
a
secret
society
for
practising
beastly
sensuality
is
it
true
that
you
could
give
lessons
to
the
marquis
de
sade
is
it
true
that
you
decoyed
and
corrupted
children
speak
dont
dare
to
lie
he
cried
beside
himself
nikolay
stavrogin
cannot
lie
to
shatov
who
struck
him
in
the
face
tell
me
everything
and
if
its
true
ill
kill
you
here
on
the
spot
i
did
talk
like
that
but
it
was
not
i
who
outraged
children
stavrogin
brought
out
after
a
silence
that
lasted
too
long
he
turned
pale
and
his
eyes
gleamed
but
you
talked
like
that
shatov
went
on
imperiously
keeping
his
flashing
eyes
fastened
upon
him
is
it
true
that
you
declared
that
you
saw
no
distinction
in
beauty
between
some
brutal
obscene
action
and
any
great
exploit
even
the
sacrifice
of
life
for
the
good
of
humanity
is
it
true
that
you
have
found
identical
beauty
equal
enjoyment
in
both
extremes
its
impossible
to
answer
like
this
i
wont
answer
muttered
stavrogin
who
might
well
have
got
up
and
gone
away
but
who
did
not
get
up
and
go
away
i
dont
know
either
why
evil
is
hateful
and
good
is
beautiful
but
i
know
why
the
sense
of
that
distinction
is
effaced
and
lost
in
people
like
the
stavrogins
shatov
persisted
trembling
all
over
do
you
know
why
you
made
that
base
and
shameful
marriage
simply
because
the
shame
and
senselessness
of
it
reached
the
pitch
of
genius
oh
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
linger
on
the
brink
you
fly
head
foremost
you
married
from
a
passion
for
martyrdom
from
a
craving
for
remorse
through
moral
sensuality
it
was
a
laceration
of
the
nerves
defiance
of
common
sense
was
too
tempting
stavrogin
and
a
wretched
halfwitted
crippled
beggar
when
you
bit
the
governors
ear
did
you
feel
sensual
pleasure
did
you
you
idle
loafing
little
snob
did
you
youre
a
psychologist
said
stavrogin
turning
paler
and
paler
though
youre
partly
mistaken
as
to
the
reasons
of
my
marriage
but
who
can
have
given
you
all
this
information
he
asked
smiling
with
an
effort
was
it
kirillov
but
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
turn
pale
but
what
is
it
you
want
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
asked
raising
his
voice
at
last
ive
been
sitting
under
your
lash
for
the
last
halfhour
and
you
might
at
least
let
me
go
civilly
unless
you
really
have
some
reasonable
object
in
treating
me
like
this
reasonable
object
of
course
youre
in
duty
bound
anyway
to
let
me
know
your
object
ive
been
expecting
you
to
do
so
all
the
time
but
youve
shown
me
nothing
so
far
but
frenzied
spite
i
beg
you
to
open
the
gate
for
me
he
got
up
from
the
chair
shatov
rushed
frantically
after
him
kiss
the
earth
water
it
with
your
tears
pray
for
forgiveness
he
cried
clutching
him
by
the
shoulder
i
didnt
kill
you
that
morning
though
i
drew
back
my
hands
stavrogin
brought
out
almost
with
anguish
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
ground
speak
out
speak
out
you
came
to
warn
me
of
danger
you
have
let
me
speak
you
mean
tomorrow
to
announce
your
marriage
publicly
do
you
suppose
i
dont
see
from
your
face
that
some
new
menacing
idea
is
dominating
you
stavrogin
why
am
i
condemned
to
believe
in
you
through
all
eternity
could
i
speak
like
this
to
anyone
else
i
have
modesty
but
i
am
not
ashamed
of
my
nakedness
because
its
stavrogin
i
am
speaking
to
i
was
not
afraid
of
caricaturing
a
grand
idea
by
handling
it
because
stavrogin
was
listening
to
me
shant
i
kiss
your
footprints
when
youve
gone
i
cant

replied
coldly
i
know
you
cant
and
i
know
you
are
not
lying
listen
i
can
set
it
all
right
i
can
catch
your
hare
for
you
stavrogin
did
not
speak
youre
an
atheist
because
youre
a
snob
a
snob
of
the
snobs
youve
lost
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil
because
youve
lost
touch
with
your
own
people
a
new
generation
is
coming
straight
from
the
heart
of
the
people
and
you
will
know
nothing
of
it
neither
you

ah
you
laugh
youre
afraid
of
some
trick
but
stavrogin
was
not
laughing
you
suppose
that
one
may
attain
to
god
by
work
and
by
peasants
work
he
repeated
reflecting
as
though
he
had
really
come
across
something
new
and
serious
which
was
worth
considering
by
the
way
he
passed
suddenly
to
a
new
idea
you
reminded
me
just
now
do
you
know
that
im
not
rich
at
all
that
ive
nothing
to
give
up
im
scarcely
in
a
position
even
to
provide
for
marya
timofyevnas
future
another
thing
i
came
to
ask
you
if
it
would
be
possible
for
you
to
remain
near
marya
timofyevna
in
the
future
as
you
are
the
only
person
who
has
some
influence
over
her
poor
brain
i
say
this
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
anything
all
right
all
right
youre
speaking
of
marya
timofyevna
said
shatov
waving
one
hand
while
he
held
a
candle
in
the
other
all
right
afterwards
of
course
listen
go
to
tikhon
to
whom
to
tikhon
who
used
to
be
a
bishop
he
lives
retired
now
on
account
of
illness
here
in
the
town
in
the
bogorodsky
monastery
what

people

and

the
first
time
ive
heard
of
him
and
ive
never
seen
anything
of
that
sort
of
people
thank
you
ill
go
this
way
shatov
lighted
him
down
the
stairs
go
along
he
flung
open
the
gate
into
the
street
i
shant
come
to
you
any
more
shatov
said
stavrogin
quietly
as
he
stepped
through
the
gateway
the
darkness
and
the
rain
continued
as
before
chapter
ii
night
continued
i
he
walked
the
length
of
bogoyavlensky
street
at
last
the
road
began
to
go
downhill
his
feet
slipped
in
the
mud
and
suddenly
there
lay
open
before
him
a
wide
misty
as
it
were
empty
expansethe
river
the
houses
were
replaced
by
hovels
the
street
was
lost
in
a
multitude
of
irregular
little
alleys
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
a
long
while
making
his
way
between
the
fences
keeping
close
to
the
river
bank
but
finding
his
way
confidently
and
scarcely
giving
it
a
thought
indeed
he
was
absorbed
in
something
quite
different
and
looked
round
with
surprise
when
suddenly
waking
up
from
a
profound
reverie
he
found
himself
almost
in
the
middle
of
one
long
wet
floating
bridge
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
so
that
it
seemed
strange
to
him
when
suddenly
almost
at
his
elbow
he
heard
a
deferentially
familiar
but
rather
pleasant
voice
with
a
suave
intonation
such
as
is
affected
by
our
overrefined
tradespeople
or
befrizzled
young
shop
assistants
will
you
kindly
allow
me
sir
to
share
your
umbrella
there
actually
was
a
figure
that
crept
under
his
umbrella
or
tried
to
appear
to
do
so
the
tramp
was
walking
beside
him
almost
feeling
his
elbow
as
the
soldiers
say
slackening
his
pace
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
bent
down
to
look
more
closely
as
far
as
he
could
in
the
darkness
it
was
a
short
man
and
seemed
like
an
artisan
who
had
been
drinking
he
was
shabbily
and
scantily
dressed
a
cloth
cap
soaked
by
the
rain
and
with
the
brim
half
torn
off
perched
on
his
shaggy
curly
head
he
looked
a
thin
vigorous
swarthy
man
with
dark
hair
his
eyes
were
large
and
must
have
been
black
with
a
hard
glitter
and
a
yellow
tinge
in
them
like
a
gipsys
that
could
be
divined
even
in
the
darkness
he
was
about
forty
and
was
not
drunk
do
you
know
me
asked
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch

me

and
night
so
that
she
doesnt
waste
her
old
age
lying
on
the
stove
you
escaped
from
prison
ive
had
a
change
of
luck
i
gave
up
books
and
bells
and
churchgoing
because
id
a
life
sentence
so
that
i
had
a
very
long
time
to
finish
my
term
what
are
you
doing
here
well
i
do
what
i
can
my
uncle
too
died
last
week
in
prison
here
he
was
there
for
false
coin
so
i
threw
two
dozen
stones
at
the
dogs
by
way
of
memorial
thats
all
ive
been
doing
so
far
moreover
pyotr
stepanovitch
gives
me
hopes
of
a
passport
and
a
merchants
one
too
to
go
all
over
russia
so
im
waiting
on
his
kindness
because
says
he
my
papa
lost
you
at
cards
at
the
english
club
and
i
says
he
find
that
inhumanity
unjust
you
might
have
the
kindness
to
give
me
three
roubles
sir
for
a
glass
to
warm
myself
so
youve
been
spying
on
me
i
dont
like
that
by
whose
orders
as
to
orders
its
nothing
of
the
sort
its
simply
that
i
knew
of
your
benevolence
which
is
known
to
all
the
world
all
we
get
as
you
know
is
an
armful
of
hay
or
a
prod
with
a
fork
last
friday
i
filled
myself
as
full
of
pie
as
martin
did
of
soap
since
then
i
didnt
eat
one
day
and
the
day
after
i
fasted
and
on
the
third
id
nothing
again
ive
had
my
fill
of
water
from
the
river
im
breeding
fish
in
my
belly
so
wont
your
honour
give
me
something
ive
a
sweetheart
expecting
me
not
far
from
here
but
i
darent
show
myself
to
her
without
money
what
did
pyotr
stepanovitch
promise
you
from
me
he
didnt
exactly
promise
anything
but
only
said
that
i
might
be
of
use
to
your
honour
if
my
luck
turns
out
good
but
how
exactly
he
didnt
explain
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
wants
to
see
if
i
have
the
patience
of
a
cossack
and
feels
no
sort
of
confidence
in
me
why
pyotr
stepanovitch
is
an
astronomer
and
has
learnt
all
gods
planets
but
even
he
may
be
criticised
i
stand
before
you
sir
as
before
god
because
i
have
heard
so
much
about
you
pyotr
stepanovitch
is
one
thing
but
you
sir
maybe
are
something
else
when
hes
said
of
a
man
hes
a
scoundrel
he
knows
nothing
more
about
him
except
that
hes
a
scoundrel
or
if
hes
said
hes
a
fool
then
that
man
has
no
calling
with
him
except
that
of
fool
but
i
may
be
a
fool
tuesday
and
wednesday
and
on
thursday
wiser
than
he
here
now
he
knows
about
me
that
im
awfully
sick
to
get
a
passport
for
theres
no
getting
on
in
russia
without
papersso
he
thinks
that
hes
snared
my
soul
i
tell
you
sir
lifes
a
very
easy
business
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
for
he
fancies
a
man
to
be
this
and
that
and
goes
on
as
though
he
really
was
and
whats
more
hes
beastly
stingy
its
his
notion
that
apart
from
him
i
darent
trouble
you
but
i
stand
before
you
sir
as
before
god
this
is
the
fourth
night
ive
been
waiting
for
your
honour
on
this
bridge
to
show
that
i
can
find
my
own
way
on
the
quiet
without
him
id
better
bow
to
a
boot
thinks
i
than
to
a
peasants
shoe
and
who
told
you
that
i
was
going
to
cross
the
bridge
at
night
well
that
ill
own
came
out
by
chance
most
through
captain
lebyadkins
foolishness
because
he
cant
keep
anything
to
himself
so
that
three
roubles
from
your
honour
would
pay
me
for
the
weary
time
ive
had
these
three
days
and
nights
and
the
clothes
ive
had
soaked
i
feel
that
too
much
to
speak
of
it
im
going
to
the
left
youll
go
to
the
right
heres
the
end
of
the
bridge
listen
fyodor
i
like
people
to
understand
what
i
say
once
for
all

wont
give
you
a
farthing

meet
me
in
future
on
the
bridge
or
anywhere
ive
no
need
of
you
and
never
shall
have
and
if
you
dont
obey
ill
tie
you
and
take
you
to
the
police
march
ehheh
fling

something
for
my
company
anyhow

your
way

you
know
the
way
here
there
are
all
sorts
of
turnings
i
could
guide
you
for
this
town
is
for
all
the
world
as
though
the
devil
carried
it
in
his
basket
and
dropped
it
in
bits
here
and
there
ill
tie
you
up
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
turning
upon
him
menacingly
perhaps
youll
change
your
mind
sir
its
easy
to
illtreat
the
helpless
well
i
see
you
can
rely
on
yourself
i
rely
upon
you
sir
and
not
very
much
on
myself
ive
no
need
of
you
at
all
ive
told
you
so
already
but
i
have
need
thats
how
it
is
i
shall
wait
for
you
on
the
way
back
theres
nothing
for
it
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
if
i
meet
you
ill
tie
you
up
well
ill
get
a
belt
ready
for
you
to
tie
me
with
a
lucky
journey
to
you
sir
you
kept
the
helpless
snug
under
your
umbrella
for
that
alone
ill
be
grateful
to
you
to
my
dying
day
he
fell
behind
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
walked
on
to
his
destination
feeling
disturbed
this
man
who
had
dropped
from
the
sky
was
absolutely
convinced
that
he
was
indispensable
to
him
stavrogin
and
was
in
insolent
haste
to
tell
him
so
he
was
being
treated
unceremoniously
all
round
but
it
was
possible
too
that
the
tramp
had
not
been
altogether
lying
and
had
tried
to
force
his
services
upon
him
on
his
own
initiative
without
pyotr
stepanovitchs
knowledge
and
that
would
be
more
curious
still
ii
the
house
which
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
reached
stood
alone
in
a
deserted
lane
between
fences
beyond
which
market
gardens
stretched
at
the
very
end
of
the
town
it
was
a
very
solitary
little
wooden
house
which
was
only
just
built
and
not
yet
weatherboarded
in
one
of
the
little
windows
the
shutters
were
not
yet
closed
and
there
was
a
candle
standing
on
the
windowledge
evidently
as
a
signal
to
the
late
guest
who
was
expected
that
night
thirty
paces
away
stavrogin
made
out
on
the
doorstep
the
figure
of
a
tall
man
evidently
the
master
of
the
house
who
had
come
out
to
stare
impatiently
up
the
road
he
heard
his
voice
too
impatient
and
as
it
were
timid
is
that
you
you
yes
responded
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
but
not
till
he
had
mounted
the
steps
and
was
folding
up
his
umbrella
at
last
sir
captain
lebyadkin
for
it
was
he
ran
fussily
to
and
fro
let
me
take
your
umbrella
please
its
very
wet
ill
open
it
on
the
floor
here
in
the
corner
please
walk
in
please
walk
in
the
door
was
open
from
the
passage
into
a
room
that
was
lighted
by
two
candles
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
promise
that
you
would
certainly
come
i
should
have
given
up
expecting
you
a
quarter
to
one
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looking
at
his
watch
as
he
went
into
the
room
and
in
this
rain
and
such
an
interesting
distance
ive
no
clock
and
there
are
nothing
but
marketgardens
round
me
so
that
you
fall
behind
the
times
not
that
i
murmur
exactly
for
i
dare
not
i
dare
not
but
only
because
ive
been
devoured
with
impatience
all
the
week
to
have
things
settled
at
last
how
so
to
hear
my
fate
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
please
sit
down
he
bowed
pointing
to
a
seat
by
the
table
before
the
sofa
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
round
the
room
was
tiny
and
lowpitched
the
furniture
consisted
only
of
the
most
essential
articles
plain
wooden
chairs
and
a
sofa
also
newly
made
without
covering
or
cushions
there
were
two
tables
of
limewood
one
by
the
sofa
and
the
other
in
the
corner
was
covered
with
a
tablecloth
laid
with
things
over
which
a
clean
tablenapkin
had
been
thrown
and
indeed
the
whole
room
was
obviously
kept
extremely
clean
captain
lebyadkin
had
not
been
drunk
for
eight
days
his
face
looked
bloated
and
yellow
his
eyes
looked
uneasy
inquisitive
and
obviously
bewildered
it
was
only
too
evident
that
he
did
not
know
what
tone
he
could
adopt
and
what
line
it
would
be
most
advantageous
for
him
to
take
here
he
indicated
his
surroundings
i
live
like
zossima
sobriety
solitude
and
povertythe
vow
of
the
knights
of
old
you
imagine
that
the
knights
of
old
took
such
vows
perhaps
im
mistaken
alas
i
have
no
culture
ive
ruined
all
believe
me
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
here
first
i
have
recovered
from
shameful
propensitiesnot
a
glass
nor
a
drop
i
have
a
home
and
for
six
days
past
i
have
experienced
a
conscience
at
ease
even
the
walls
smell
of
resin
and
remind
me
of
nature
and
what
have
i
been
what
was
i
at
night
without
a
bed
i
wander
and
my
tongue
put
out
by
day
to
use
the
words
of
a
poet
of
genius
but
youre
wet
through
wouldnt
you
like
some
tea
dont
trouble
the
samovar
has
been
boiling
since
eight
oclock
but
it
went
out
at
last
like
everything
in
this
world
the
sun
too
they
say
will
go
out
in
its
turn
but
if
you
like
ill
get
up
the
samovar
agafya
is
not
asleep
tell
me
marya
timofyevna
shes
here
here
lebyadkin
replied
at
once
in
a
whisper
would
you
like
to
have
a
look
at
her
he
pointed
to
the
closed
door
to
the
next
room
shes
not
asleep
oh
no
no
how
could
she
be
on
the
contrary
shes
been
expecting
you
all
the
evening
and
as
soon
as
she
heard
you
were
coming
she
began
making
her
toilet
he
was
just
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
jocose
smile
but
he
instantly
checked
himself
how
is
she
on
the
whole
asked
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
frowning
on
the
whole
you
know
that
yourself
sir
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
commiseratingly
but
just
now
just
now
shes
telling
her
fortune
with
cards
very
good
later
on
first
of
all
i
must
finish
with
you
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
settled
himself
in
a
chair
the
captain
did
not
venture
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
but
at
once
moved
up
another
chair
for
himself
and
bent
forward
to
listen
in
a
tremor
of
expectation
what
have
you
got
there
under
the
tablecloth
asked
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
suddenly
noticing
it
that
said
lebyadkin
turning
towards
it
also
thats
from
your
generosity
by
way
of
housewarming
so
to
say
considering
also
the
length
of
the
walk
and
your
natural
fatigue
he
sniggered
ingratiatingly
then
he
got
up
on
tiptoe
and
respectfully
and
carefully
lifted
the
tablecloth
from
the
table
in
the
corner
under
it
was
seen
a
slight
meal
ham
veal
sardines
cheese
a
little
green
decanter
and
a
long
bottle
of
bordeaux
everything
had
been
laid
neatly
expertly
and
almost
daintily
was
that
your
effort
yes
sir
ever
since
yesterday
ive
done
my
best
and
all
to
do
you
honour
marya
timofyevna
doesnt
trouble
herself
as
you
know
on
that
score
and
whats
more
its
all
from
your
liberality
your
own
providing
as

the
master
of
the
house
and

same

independent
dont
take
away
from
me
this
last
possession
he
finished
up
pathetically
hm
you
might
sit
down
again
graateful
grateful
and
independent
he
sat
down
ah
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
so
much
has
been
fermenting
in
this
heart
that
i
have
not
known
how
to
wait
for
your
coming
now

as
i
used
to
in
old
days
four
years
ago
you
deigned
to
listen
to
me
then
you
read
my
verses
they
might
call
me
your
falstaff
from
shakespeare
in
those
days
but
you
meant
so
much
in
my
life
i
have
great
terrors
now
and
its
only
to
you
i
look
for
counsel
and
light
pyotr
stepanovitch
is
treating
me
abominably
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
listened
with
interest
and
looked
at
him
attentively
it
was
evident
that
though
captain
lebyadkin
had
left
off
drinking
he
was
far
from
being
in
a
harmonious
state
of
mind
drunkards
of
many
years
standing
like
lebyadkin
often
show
traces
of
incoherence
of
mental
cloudiness
of
something
as
it
were
damaged
and
crazy
though
they
may
deceive
cheat
and
swindle
almost
as
well
as
anybody
if
occasion
arises
i
see
that
you
havent
changed
a
bit
in
these
four
years
and
more
captain
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
somewhat
more
amiably
it
seems
in
fact
as
though
the
second
half
of
a
mans
life
is
usually
made
up
of
nothing
but
the
habits
he
has
accumulated
during
the
first
half
grand
words
you
solve
the
riddle
of
life
said
the
captain
half
cunningly
half
in
genuine
and
unfeigned
admiration
for
he
was
a
great
lover
of
words
of
all
your
sayings
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
i
remember
one
thing
above
all
you
were
in
petersburg
when
you
said
it
one
must
really
be
a
great
man
to
be
able
to
make
a
stand
even
against
common
sense
that
was
it
yes
and
a
fool
as
well
a
fool
as
well
maybe
but
youve
been
scattering
clever
sayings
all
your
life
while
they
imagine
liputin
imagine
pyotr
stepanovitch
saying
anything
like
that
oh
how
cruelly
pyotr
stepanovitch
has
treated
me
but
how
about
yourself
captain
what
can
you
say
of
your
behaviour
drunkenness
and
the
multitude
of
my
enemies
but
now
thats
all
over
all
over
and
i
have
a
new
skin
like
a
snake
do
you
know
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
i
am
making
my
will
in
fact
ive
made
it
already
thats
interesting
what
are
you
leaving
and
to
whom
to
my
fatherland
to
humanity
and
to
the
students
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
i
read
in
the
paper
the
biography
of
an
american
he
left
all
his
vast
fortune
to
factories
and
to
the
exact
sciences
and
his
skeleton
to
the
students
of
the
academy
there
and
his
skin
to
be
made
into
a
drum
so
that
the
american
national
hymn
might
be
beaten
upon
it
day
and
night
alas
we
are
pigmies
in
mind
compared
with
the
soaring
thought
of
the
states
of
north
america
russia
is
the
play
of
nature
but
not
of
mind
if
i
were
to
try
leaving
my
skin
for
a
drum
for
instance
to
the
akmolinsky
infantry
regiment
in
which
i
had
the
honour
of
beginning
my
service
on
condition
of
beating
the
russian
national
hymn
upon
it
every
day
in
face
of
the
regiment
theyd
take
it
for
liberalism
and
prohibit
my
skin
and
so
i
confine
myself
to
the
students
i
want
to
leave
my
skeleton
to
the
academy
but
on
the
condition
though
on
the
condition
that
a
label
should
be
stuck
on
the
forehead
forever
and
ever
with
the
words
a
repentant
freethinker
there
now
the
captain
spoke
excitedly
and
genuinely
believed
of
course
that
there
was
something
fine
in
the
american
will
but
he
was
cunning
too
and
very
anxious
to
entertain
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
whom
he
had
played
the
part
of
a
buffoon
for
a
long
time
in
the
past
but
the
latter
did
not
even
smile
on
the
contrary
he
asked
as
it
were
suspiciously
so
you
intend
to
publish
your
will
in
your
lifetime
and
get
rewarded
for
it
and
what
if
i
do
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
what
if
i
do
said
lebyadkin
watching
him
carefully
what
sort
of
luck
have
i
had
ive
given
up
writing
poetry
and
at
one
time
even
you
were
amused
by
my
verses
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
do
you
remember
our
reading
them
over
a
bottle
but
its
all
over
with
my
pen
ive
written
only
one
poem
like
gogols
the
last
story
do
you
remember
he
proclaimed
to
russia
that
it
broke
spontaneously
from
his
bosom
its
the
same
with
me
ive
sung
my
last
and
its
over
what
sort
of
poem
in
case
she
were
to
break
her
leg
whaat
that
was
all
the
captain
was
waiting
for
he
had
an
unbounded
admiration
for
his
own
poems
but
through
a
certain
cunning
duplicity
he
was
pleased
too
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
always
made
merry
over
his
poems
and
sometimes
laughed
at
them
immoderately
in
this
way
he
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
satisfying
at
once
his
poetical
aspirations
and
his
desire
to
be
of
service
but
now
he
had
a
third
special
and
very
ticklish
object
in
view
bringing
his
verses
on
the
scene
the
captain
thought
to
exculpate
himself
on
one
point
about
which
for
some
reason
he
always
felt
himself
most
apprehensive
and
most
guilty
in
case
of
her
breaking
her
leg
that
is
of
her
riding
on
horseback
its
a
fantasy
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
a
wild
fancy
but
the
fancy
of
a
poet
one
day
i
was
struck
by
meeting
a
lady
on
horseback
and
asked
myself
the
vital
question
what
would
happen
then
that
is
in
case
of
accident
all
her
followers
turn
away
all
her
suitors
are
gone
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
only
the
poet
remains
faithful
with
his
heart
shattered
in
his
breast
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
even
a
louse
may
be
in
love
and
is
not
forbidden
by
law
and
yet
the
lady
was
offended
by
the
letter
and
the
verses
im
told
that
even
you
were
angry
were
you
i
wouldnt
believe
in
anything
so
grievous
whom
could
i
harm
simply
by
imagination
besides
i
swear
on
my
honour
liputin
kept
saying
send
it
send
it
every
man
however
humble
has
a
right
to
send
a
letter
and
so
i
sent
it
you
offered
yourself
as
a
suitor
i
understand
enemies
enemies
enemies
repeat
the
verses
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
sternly
ravings
ravings
more
than
anything
however
he
drew
himself
up
stretched
out
his
hand
and
began
with
broken
limbs
my
beauteous
queen
is
twice
as
charming
as
before
and
deep
in
love
as
i
have
been
today
i
love
her
even
more
come
thats
enough
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
i
dream
of
petersburg
cried
lebyadkin
passing
quickly
to
another
subject
as
though
there
had
been
no
mention
of
verses
i
dream
of
regeneration
benefactor
may
i
reckon
that
you
wont
refuse
the
means
for
the
journey
ive
been
waiting
for
you
all
the
week
as
my
sunshine
ill
do
nothing
of
the
sort
ive
scarcely
any
money
left
and
why
should
i
give
you
money
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
seemed
suddenly
angry
dryly
and
briefly
he
recapitulated
all
the
captains
misdeeds
his
drunkenness
his
lying
his
squandering
of
the
money
meant
for
marya
timofyevna
his
having
taken
her
from
the
nunnery
his
insolent
letters
threatening
to
publish
the
secret
the
way
he
had
behaved
about
darya
pavlovna
and
so
on
and
so
on
the
captain
heaved
gesticulated
began
to
reply
but
every
time
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
stopped
him
peremptorily
and
listen
he
observed
at
last
you
keep
writing
about
family
disgrace
what
disgrace
is
it
to
you
that
your
sister
is
the
lawful
wife
of
a
stavrogin
but
marriage
in
secret
nikolay
vsyevolodovitcha
fatal
secret
i
receive
money
from
you
and
im
suddenly
asked
the
question
whats
that
money
for
my
hands
are
tied
i
cannot
answer
to
the
detriment
of
my
sister
to
the
detriment
of
the
family
honour
the
captain
raised
his
voice
he
liked
that
subject
and
reckoned
boldly
upon
it
alas
he
did
not
realise
what
a
blow
was
in
store
for
him
calmly
and
exactly
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
the
most
everyday
arrangement
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
informed
him
that
in
a
few
days
perhaps
even
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
he
intended
to
make
his
marriage
known
everywhere
to
the
police
as
well
as
to
local
society
and
so
the
question
of
family
honour
would
be
settled
once
for
all
and
with
it
the
question
of
subsidy
the
captains
eyes
were
ready
to
drop
out
of
his
head
he
positively
could
not
take
it
in
it
had
to
be
explained
to
him
but
she
is
crazy
i
shall
make
suitable
arrangements
but
how
about
your
mother
well
she
must
do
as
she
likes
but
will
you
take
your
wife
to
your
house
perhaps
so
but
that
is
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
you
and
no
concern
of
yours
no
concern
of
mine
cried
the
captain
what
about
me
then
well
certainly
you
wont
come
into
my
house
but
you
know
im
a
relation
one
does
ones
best
to
escape
from
such
relations
why
should
i
go
on
giving
you
money
then
judge
for
yourself
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
this
is
impossible
you
will
think
better
of
it
perhaps
you
dont
want
to
lay
hands
upon
what
will
people
think
what
will
the
world
say
much
i
care
for
your
world
i
married
your
sister
when
the
fancy
took
me
after
a
drunken
dinner
for
a
bet
and
now
ill
make
it
public
since
that
amuses
me
now
he
said
this
with
a
peculiar
irritability
so
that
lebyadkin
began
with
horror
to
believe
him
but
me
me
what
about
me
im
what
matters
most
perhaps
youre
joking
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
no
im
not
joking
as
you
will
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
but
i
dont
believe
you
then
ill
take
proceedings
youre
fearfully
stupid
captain
maybe
but
this
is
all
thats
left
me
said
the
captain
losing
his
head
completely
in
old
days
we
used
to
get
free
quarters
anyway
for
the
work
she
did
in
the
corners
but
what
will
happen
now
if
you
throw
me
over
altogether
but
you
want
to
go
to
petersburg
to
try
a
new
career
by
the
way
is
it
true
what
i
hear
that
you
mean
to
go
and
give
information
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
pardon
by
betraying
all
the
others
the
captain
stood
gaping
with
wideopen
eyes
and
made
no
answer
listen
captain
stavrogin
began
suddenly
with
great
earnestness
bending
down
to
the
table
until
then
he
had
been
talking
as
it
were
ambiguously
so
that
lebyadkin
who
had
wide
experience
in
playing
the
part
of
buffoon
was
up
to
the
last
moment
a
trifle
uncertain
whether
his
patron
were
really
angry
or
simply
putting
it
on
whether
he
really
had
the
wild
intention
of
making
his
marriage
public
or
whether
he
were
only
playing
now
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
stern
expression
was
so
convincing
that
a
shiver
ran
down
the
captains
back
listen
and
tell
the
truth
lebyadkin
have
you
betrayed
anything
yet
or
not
have
you
succeeded
in
doing
anything
really
have
you
sent
a
letter
to
somebody
in
your
foolishness
no
i
havent
and
i
havent
thought
of
doing
it
said
the
captain
looking
fixedly
at
him
thats
a
lie
that
you
havent
thought
of
doing
it
thats
what
youre
asking
to
go
to
petersburg
for
if
you
havent
written
have
you
blabbed
to
anybody
here
speak
the
truth
ive
heard
something
when
i
was
drunk
to
liputin
liputins
a
traitor
i
opened
my
heart
to
him
whispered
the
poor
captain
thats
all
very
well
but
theres
no
need
to
be
an
ass
if
you
had
an
idea
you
should
have
kept
it
to
yourself
sensible
people
hold
their
tongues
nowadays
they
dont
go
chattering
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
said
the
captain
quaking
youve
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
yourself
its
not
you
ive
yes
you
wouldnt
have
ventured
to
kill
the
goose
that
laid
your
golden
eggs
judge
for
yourself
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
judge
for
yourself
and
in
despair
with
tears
the
captain
began
hurriedly
relating
the
story
of
his
life
for
the
last
four
years
it
was
the
most
stupid
story
of
a
fool
drawn
into
matters
that
did
not
concern
him
and
in
his
drunkenness
and
debauchery
unable
till
the
last
minute
to
grasp
their
importance
he
said
that
before
he
left
petersburg
he
had
been
drawn
in
at
first
simply
through
friendship
like
a
regular
student
although
he
wasnt
a
student
and
knowing
nothing
about
it
without
being
guilty
of
anything
he
had
scattered
various
papers
on
staircases
left
them
by
dozens
at
doors
on
bellhandles
had
thrust
them
in
as
though
they
were
newspapers
taken
them
to
the
theatre
put
them
in
peoples
hats
and
slipped
them
into
pockets
afterwards
he
had
taken
money
from
them
for
what
means
had
i
he
had
distributed
all
sorts
of
rubbish
through
the
districts
of
two
provinces
oh
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
he
exclaimed
what
revolted
me
most
was
that
this
was
utterly
opposed
to
civic
and
still
more
to
patriotic
laws
they
suddenly
printed
that
men
were
to
go
out
with
pitchforks
and
to
remember
that
those
who
went
out
poor
in
the
morning
might
go
home
rich
at
night
only
think
of
it
it
made
me
shudder
and
yet
i
distributed
it
or
suddenly
five
or
six
lines
addressed
to
the
whole
of
russia
apropos
of
nothing
make
haste
and
lock
up
the
churches
abolish
god
do
away
with
marriage
destroy
the
right
of
inheritance
take
up
your
knives
thats
all
and
god
knows
what
it
means
i
tell
you
i
almost
got
caught
with
this
fiveline
leaflet
the
officers
in
the
regiment
gave
me
a
thrashing
but
bless
them
for
it
let
me
go
and
last
year
i
was
almost
caught
when
i
passed
off
french
counterfeit
notes
for
fifty
roubles
on
korovayev
but
thank
god
korovayev
fell
into
the
pond
when
he
was
drunk
and
was
drowned
in
the
nick
of
time
and
they
didnt
succeed
in
tracking
me
here
at
virginskys
i
proclaimed
the
freedom
of
the
communistic
life
in
june
i
was
distributing
manifestoes
again
in
x
district
they
say
they
will
make
me
do
it
again
pyotr
stepanovitch
suddenly
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
must
obey
hes
been
threatening
me
a
long
time
how
he
treated
me
that
sunday
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
i
am
a
slave
i
am
a
worm
but
not
a
god
which
is
where
i
differ
from
derzhavin
but
ive
no
income
no
income

the
reference
is
to
a
poem
of
derzhavins
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
heard
it
all
with
curiosity
a
great
deal
of
that
i
had
heard
nothing
of
he
said
of
course
anything
may
have
happened
to
you
listen
he
said
after
a
minutes
thought
if
you
like
you
can
tell
them
you
know
whom
that
liputin
was
lying
and
that
you
were
only
pretending
to
give
information
to
frighten
me
supposing
that
i
too
was
compromised
and
that
you
might
get
more
money
out
of
me
that
way
do
you
understand
dear
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
is
it
possible
that
theres
such
a
danger
hanging
over
me
ive
been
longing
for
you
to
come
to
ask
you
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
laughed
they
certainly
wouldnt
let
you
go
to
petersburg
even
if
i
were
to
give
you
money
for
the
journey
but
its
time
for
me
to
see
marya
timofyevna
and
he
got
up
from
his
chair
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
but
how
about
marya
timofyevna
why
as
i
told
you
can
it
be
true
you
still
dont
believe
it
will
you
really
cast
me
off
like
an
old
wornout
shoe
ill
see
laughed
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
come
let
me
go
wouldnt
you
like
me
to
stand
on
the
steps
for
fear
i
might
by
chance
overhear
something
for
the
rooms
are
small
thats
as
well
stand
on
the
steps
take
my
umbrella
your
umbrella
am
i
worth
it
said
the
captain
oversweetly
anyone
is
worthy
of
an
umbrella
at
one
stroke
you
define
the
minimum
of
human
rights
but
he
was
by
now
muttering
mechanically
he
was
too
much
crushed
by
what
he
had
learned
and
was
completely
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
and
yet
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
out
on
to
the
steps
and
had
put
up
the
umbrella
there
his
shallow
and
cunning
brain
caught
again
the
everpresent
comforting
idea
that
he
was
being
cheated
and
deceived
and
if
so
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
be
afraid
if
theyre
lying
and
deceiving
me
whats
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
the
thought
that
gnawed
at
his
mind
the
public
announcement
of
the
marriage
seemed
to
him
absurd
its
true
that
with
such
a
wonderworker
anything
may
come
to
pass
he
lives
to
do
harm
but
what
if
hes
afraid
himself
since
the
insult
of
sunday
and
afraid
as
hes
never
been
before
and
so
hes
in
a
hurry
to
declare
that
hell
announce
it
himself
from
fear
that
i
should
announce
it
eh
dont
blunder
lebyadkin
and
why
does
he
come
on
the
sly
at
night
if
he
means
to
make
it
public
himself
and
if
hes
afraid
it
means
that
hes
afraid
now
at
this
moment
for
these
few
days
eh
dont
make
a
mistake
lebyadkin
he
scares
me
with
pyotr
stepanovitch
oy
im
frightened
im
frightened
yes
this
is
whats
so
frightening
and
what
induced
me
to
blab
to
liputin
goodness
knows
what
these
devils
are
up
to
i
never
can
make
head
or
tail
of
it
now
they
are
all
astir
again
as
they
were
five
years
ago
to
whom
could
i
give
information
indeed
havent
i
written
to
anyone
in
my
foolishness
hm
so
then
i
might
write
as
though
through
foolishness
isnt
he
giving
me
a
hint
youre
going
to
petersburg
on
purpose
the
sly
rogue
ive
scarcely
dreamed
of
it
and
he
guesses
my
dreams
as
though
he
were
putting
me
up
to
going
himself
its
one
or
the
other
of
two
games
hes
up
to
either
hes
afraid
because
hes
been
up
to
some
pranks
himself
or
hes
not
afraid
for
himself
but
is
simply
egging
me
on
to
give
them
all
away
ach
its
terrible
lebyadkin
ach
you
must
not
make
a
blunder
he
was
so
absorbed
in
thought
that
he
forgot
to
listen
it
was
not
easy
to
hear
either
the
door
was
a
solid
one
and
they
were
talking
in
a
very
low
voice
nothing
reached
the
captain
but
indistinct
sounds
he
positively
spat
in
disgust
and
went
out
again
lost
in
thought
to
whistle
on
the
steps
iii
marya
timofyevnas
room
was
twice
as
large
as
the
one
occupied
by
the
captain
and
furnished
in
the
same
rough
style
but
the
table
in
front
of
the
sofa
was
covered
with
a
gaycoloured
tablecloth
and
on
it
a
lamp
was
burning
there
was
a
handsome
carpet
on
the
floor
the
bed
was
screened
off
by
a
green
curtain
which
ran
the
length
of
the
room
and
besides
the
sofa
there
stood
by
the
table
a
large
soft
easy
chair
in
which
marya
timofyevna
never
sat
however
in
the
corner
there
was
an
ikon
as
there
had
been
in
her
old
room
and
a
little
lamp
was
burning
before
it
and
on
the
table
were
all
her
indispensable
properties
the
pack
of
cards
the
little
lookingglass
the
songbook
even
a
milk
loaf
besides
these
there
were
two
books
with
coloured
picturesone
extracts
from
a
popular
book
of
travels
published
for
juvenile
reading
the
other
a
collection
of
very
light
edifying
tales
for
the
most
part
about
the
days
of
chivalry
intended
for
christmas
presents
or
school
reading
she
had
too
an
album
of
photographs
of
various
sorts
marya
timofyevna
was
of
course
expecting
the
visitor
as
the
captain
had
announced
but
when
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
in
she
was
asleep
half
reclining
on
the
sofa
propped
on
a
woolwork
cushion
her
visitor
closed
the
door
after
him
noiselessly
and
standing
still
scrutinised
the
sleeping
figure
the
captain
had
been
romancing
when
he
told
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
she
had
been
dressing
herself
up
she
was
wearing
the
same
dark
dress
as
on
sunday
at
varvara
petrovnas
her
hair
was
done
up
in
the
same
little
close
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
her
long
thin
neck
was
exposed
in
the
same
way
the
black
shawl
varvara
petrovna
had
given
her
lay
carefully
folded
on
the
sofa
she
was
coarsely
rouged
and
powdered
as
before
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
did
not
stand
there
more
than
a
minute
she
suddenly
waked
up
as
though
she
were
conscious
of
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
she
opened
her
eyes
and
quickly
drew
herself
up
but
something
strange
must
have
happened
to
her
visitor
he
remained
standing
at
the
same
place
by
the
door
with
a
fixed
and
searching
glance
he
looked
mutely
and
persistently
into
her
face
perhaps
that
look
was
too
grim
perhaps
there
was
an
expression
of
aversion
in
it
even
a
malignant
enjoyment
of
her
frightif
it
were
not
a
fancy
left
by
her
dreams
but
suddenly
after
almost
a
moment
of
expectation
the
poor
womans
face
wore
a
look
of
absolute
terror
it
twitched
convulsively
she
lifted
her
trembling
hands
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
exactly
like
a
frightened
child
in
another
moment
she
would
have
screamed
but
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
pulled
himself
together
his
face
changed
in
one
instant
and
he
went
up
to
the
table
with
the
most
cordial
and
amiable
smile
im
sorry
marya
timofyevna
i
frightened
you
coming
in
suddenly
when
you
were
asleep
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
the
sound
of
his
caressing
words
produced
their
effect
her
fear
vanished
although
she
still
looked
at
him
with
dismay
evidently
trying
to
understand
something
she
held
out
her
hands
timorously
also
at
last
a
shy
smile
rose
to
her
lips
how
do
you
do
prince
she
whispered
looking
at
him
strangely
you
must
have
had
a
bad
dream
he
went
on
with
a
still
more
friendly
and
cordial
smile
but
how
do
you
know
that
i
was
dreaming
about
that
and
again
she
began
trembling
and
started
back
putting
up
her
hand
as
though
to
protect
herself
on
the
point
of
crying
again
calm
yourself
thats
enough
what
are
you
afraid
of
surely
you
know
me
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
trying
to
soothe
her
but
it
was
long
before
he
could
succeed
she
gazed
at
him
dumbly
with
the
same
look
of
agonising
perplexity
with
a
painful
idea
in
her
poor
brain
and
she
still
seemed
to
be
trying
to
reach
some
conclusion
at
one
moment
she
dropped
her
eyes
then
suddenly
scrutinised
him
in
a
rapid
comprehensive
glance
at
last
though
not
reassured
she
seemed
to
come
to
a
conclusion
sit
down
beside
me
please
that
i
may
look
at
you
thoroughly
later
on
she
brought
out
with
more
firmness
evidently
with
a
new
object
but
dont
be
uneasy
i
wont
look
at
you
now
ill
look
down
dont
you
look
at
me
either
till
i
ask
you
to
sit
down
she
added
with
positive
impatience
a
new
sensation
was
obviously
growing
stronger
and
stronger
in
her
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
sat
down
and
waited
rather
a
long
silence
followed
hm
it
all
seems
so
strange
to
me
she
suddenly
muttered
almost
disdainfully
of
course
i
was
depressed
by
bad
dreams
but
why
have
i
dreamt
of
you
looking
like
that
come
lets
have
done
with
dreams
he
said
impatiently
turning
to
her
in
spite
of
her
prohibition
and
perhaps
the
same
expression
gleamed
for
a
moment
in
his
eyes
again
he
saw
that
she
several
times
wanted
very
much
in
fact
to
look
at
him
again
but
that
she
obstinately
controlled
herself
and
kept
her
eyes
cast
down
listen
prince
she
raised
her
voice
suddenly
listen
prince
why
do
you
turn
away
why
dont
you
look
at
me
whats
the
object
of
this
farce
he
cried
losing
patience
but
she
seemed
not
to
hear
him
listen
prince
she
repeated
for
the
third
time
in
a
resolute
voice
with
a
disagreeable
fussy
expression
when
you
told
me
in
the
carriage
that
our
marriage
was
going
to
be
made
public
i
was
alarmed
at
there
being
an
end
to
the
mystery
now
i
dont
know
ive
been
thinking
it
all
over
and
i
see
clearly
that
im
not
fit
for
it
at
all
i
know
how
to
dress
and
i
could
receive
guests
perhaps
theres
nothing
much
in
asking
people
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
especially
when
there
are
footmen
but
what
will
people
say
though
i
saw
a
great
deal
that
sunday
morning
in
that
house
that
pretty
young
lady
looked
at
me
all
the
time
especially
after
you
came
in
it
was
you
came
in
wasnt
it
her
mothers
simply
an
absurd
worldly
old
woman
my
lebyadkin
distinguished
himself
too
i
kept
looking
at
the
ceiling
to
keep
from
laughing
the
ceiling
there
is
finely
painted
his
mother
ought
to
be
an
abbess
im
afraid
of
her
though
she
did
give
me
a
black
shawl
of
course
they
must
all
have
come
to
strange
conclusions
about
me
i
wasnt
vexed
but
i
sat
there
thinking
what
relation
am
i
to
them
of
course
from
a
countess
one
doesnt
expect
any
but
spiritual
qualities
for
the
domestic
ones
shes
got
plenty
of
footmen
and
also
a
little
worldly
coquetry
so
as
to
be
able
to
entertain
foreign
travellers
but
yet
that
sunday
they
did
look
upon
me
as
hopeless
only
dashas
an
angel
im
awfully
afraid
they
may
wound
him
by
some
careless
allusion
to
me
dont
be
afraid
and
dont
be
uneasy
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
making
a
wry
face
however
that
doesnt
matter
to
me
if
he
is
a
little
ashamed
of
me
for
there
will
always
be
more
pity
than
shame
though
it
differs
with
people
of
course
he
knows
to
be
sure
that
i
ought
rather
to
pity
them
than
they
me
you
seem
to
be
very
much
offended
with
them
marya
timofyevna
i
oh
no
she
smiled
with
simplehearted
mirth
not
at
all
i
looked
at
you
all
then
you
were
all
angry
you
were
all
quarrelling
they
meet
together
and
they
dont
know
how
to
laugh
from
their
hearts
so
much
wealth
and
so
little
gaiety
it
all
disgusts
me
though
i
feel
for
no
one
now
except
myself
ive
heard
that
youve
had
a
hard
life
with
your
brother
without
me
who
told
you
that
its
nonsense
its
much
worse
now
now
my
dreams
are
not
good
and
my
dreams
are
bad
because
youve
come
what
have
you
come
for
id
like
to
know
tell
me
please
wouldnt
you
like
to
go
back
into
the
nunnery
i
knew
theyd
suggest
the
nunnery
again
your
nunnery
is
a
fine
marvel
for
me
and
why
should
i
go
to
it
what
should
i
go
for
now
im
all
alone
in
the
world
now
its
too
late
for
me
to
begin
a
third
life
you
seem
very
angry
about
something
surely
youre
not
afraid
that
ive
left
off
loving
you
im
not
troubling
about
you
at
all
im
afraid
that
i
may
leave
off
loving
somebody
she
laughed
contemptuously
i
must
have
done
him
some
great
wrong
she
added
suddenly
as
it
were
to
herself
only
i
dont
know
what
ive
done
wrong
thats
always
what
troubles
me
always
always
for
the
last
five
years
ive
been
afraid
day
and
night
that
ive
done
him
some
wrong
ive
prayed
and
prayed
and
always
thought
of
the
great
wrong
id
done
him
and
now
it
turns
out
it
was
true
whats
turned
out
im
only
afraid
whether
theres
something
on
his
side
she
went
on
not
answering
his
question
not
hearing
it
in
fact
and
then
again
he
couldnt
get
on
with
such
horrid
people
the
countess
would
have
liked
to
eat
me
though
she
did
make
me
sit
in
the
carriage
beside
her
theyre
all
in
the
plot
surely
hes
not
betrayed
me
her
chin
and
lips
were
twitching
tell
me
have
you
read
about
grishka
otrepyev
how
he
was
cursed
in
seven
cathedrals
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
did
not
speak
but
ill
turn
round
now
and
look
at
you
she
seemed
to
decide
suddenly
you
turn
to
me
too
and
look
at
me
but
more
attentively
i
want
to
make
sure
for
the
last
time
ive
been
looking
at
you
for
a
long
time
hm
said
marya
timofyevna
looking
at
him
intently
youve
grown
much
fatter
she
wanted
to
say
something
more
but
suddenly
for
the
third
time
the
same
terror
instantly
distorted
her
face
and
again
she
drew
back
putting
her
hand
up
before
her
whats
the
matter
with
you
cried
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
almost
enraged
but
her
panic
lasted
only
one
instant
her
face
worked
with
a
sort
of
strange
smile
suspicious
and
unpleasant
i
beg
you
prince
get
up
and
come
in
she
brought
out
suddenly
in
a
firm
emphatic
voice

in
where

nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
ground
his
teeth
and
muttered
something
to
himself
enough
he
said
striking
the
table
with
his
open
hand

corners

and
curses

you
she
listened
with
extreme
curiosity
and
for
a
long
time
she
was
silent
thinking
it
all
seems
incredible
to
me
she
said
at
last
ironically
and
disdainfully
i
might
live
for
forty
years
in
those
mountains
she
laughed
what
of
it
lets
live
forty
years
then
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
scowling
hm
i
wont
come
for
anything
not
even
with
me
and
what
are
you
that
i
should
go
with
you
im
to
sit
on
a
mountain
beside
him
for
forty
years
on
enda
pretty
story
and
upon
my
word
how
longsuffering
people
have
become
nowadays
no
it
cannot
be
that
a
falcon
has
become
an
owl
my
prince
is
not
like
that
she
said
raising
her
head
proudly
and
triumphantly
light
seemed
to
dawn
upon
him
what
makes
you
call
me
a
prince
and
for
whom
do
you
take
me
he
asked
quickly
why
arent
you
the
prince
i
never
have
been
one
so
yourself
yourself
you
tell
me
straight
to
my
face
that
youre
not
the
prince
i
tell
you
i
never
have
been
good
lord
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
i
was
ready
to
expect
anything
from
his
enemies
but
such
insolence
never
is
he
alive
she
shrieked
in
a
frenzy
turning
upon
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
have
you
killed
him
confess
whom
do
you
take
me
for
he
cried
jumping
up
from
his
chair
with
a
distorted
face
but
it
was
not
easy
now
to
frighten
her
she
was
triumphant
who
can
tell
who
you
are
and
where
youve
sprung
from
only
my
heart
my
heart
had
misgivings
all
these
five
years
of
all
the
intrigues
and
ive
been
sitting
here
wondering
what
blind
owl
was
making
up
to
me
no
my
dear
youre
a
poor
actor
worse
than
lebyadkin
even
give
my
humble
greetings
to
the
countess
and
tell
her
to
send
someone
better
than
you
has
she
hired
you
tell
me
have
they
given
you
a
place
in
her
kitchen
out
of
charity
i
see
through
your
deception
i
understand
you
all
every
one
of
you
he
seized
her
firmly
above
the
elbow
she
laughed
in
his
face
youre
like
him
very
like
perhaps
youre
a
relationyoure
a
sly
lot
only

bright
falcon
and
a
prince
and
youre
an
owl
and
a
shopman
mine
will
bow
down
to

and
shatushka
hes
my
dear
my
darling
slapped
you
on
the
cheeks
my
lebyadkin
told
me
and
what
were
you
afraid
of
then
when
you
came
in
who
had
frightened
you
then
when
i
saw
your
mean
face
after
id
fallen
down
and
you
picked
me
upit
was
like
a
worm
crawling
into
my
heart
its
not
he
i
thought
not
he
my
falcon
would
never
have
been
ashamed
of
me
before
a
fashionable
young
lady
oh
heavens
that
alone
kept
me
happy
for
those
five
years
that
my
falcon
was
living
somewhere
beyond
the
mountains
soaring
gazing
at
the
sun
tell
me
you
impostor
have
you
got
much
by
it
did
you
need
a
big
bribe
to
consent
i
wouldnt
have
given
you
a
farthing
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ugh
idiot
snarled
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
still
holding
her
tight
by
the
arm
go
away
impostor
she
shouted
peremptorily
im
the
wife
of
my
prince
im
not
afraid
of
your
knife
knife
yes
knife
youve
a
knife
in
your
pocket
you
thought
i
was
asleep
but
i
saw
it
when
you
came
in
just
now
you
took
out
your
knife
what
are
you
saying
unhappy
creature
what
dreams
you
have
he
exclaimed
pushing
her
away
from
him
with
all
his
might
so
that
her
head
and
shoulders
fell
painfully
against
the
sofa
he
was
rushing
away
but
she
at
once
flew
to
overtake
him
limping
and
hopping
and
though
lebyadkin
panicstricken
held
her
back
with
all
his
might
she
succeeded
in
shouting
after
him
into
the
darkness
shrieking
and
laughing
a
curse
on
you
grishka
otrepyev
iv
a
knife
a
knife
he
repeated
with
uncontrollable
anger
striding
along
through
the
mud
and
puddles
without
picking
his
way
it
is
true
that
at
moments
he
had
a
terrible
desire
to
laugh
aloud
frantically
but
for
some
reason
he
controlled
himself
and
restrained
his
laughter
he
recovered
himself
only
on
the
bridge
on
the
spot
where
fedka
had
met
him
that
evening
he
found
the
man
lying
in
wait
for
him
again
seeing
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
he
took
off
his
cap
grinned
gaily
and
began
babbling
briskly
and
merrily
about
something
at
first
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
walked
on
without
stopping
and
for
some
time
did
not
even
listen
to
the
tramp
who
was
pestering
him
again
he
was
suddenly
struck
by
the
thought
that
he
had
entirely
forgotten
him
and
had
forgotten
him
at
the
very
moment
when
he
himself
was
repeating
a
knife
a
knife
he
seized
the
tramp
by
the
collar
and
gave
vent
to
his
pentup
rage
by
flinging
him
violently
against
the
bridge
for
one
instant
the
man
thought
of
fighting
but
almost
at
once
realising
that
compared
with
his
adversary
who
had
fallen
upon
him
unawares
he
was
no
better
than
a
wisp
of
straw
he
subsided
and
was
silent
without
offering
any
resistance
crouching
on
the
ground
with
his
elbows
crooked
behind
his
back
the
wily
tramp
calmly
waited
for
what
would
happen
next
apparently
quite
incredulous
of
danger
he
was
right
in
his
reckoning
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
already
with
his
left
hand
taken
off
his
thick
scarf
to
tie
his
prisoners
arms
but
suddenly
for
some
reason
he
abandoned
him
and
shoved
him
away
the
man
instantly
sprang
on
to
his
feet
turned
round
and
a
short
broad
bootknife
suddenly
gleamed
in
his
hand
away
with
that
knife
put
it
away
at
once
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
commanded
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
the
knife
vanished
as
instantaneously
as
it
had
appeared
without
speaking
again
or
turning
round
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
on
his
way
but
the
persistent
vagabond
did
not
leave
him
even
now
though
now
it
is
true
he
did
not
chatter
and
even
respectfully
kept
his
distance
a
full
step
behind
they
crossed
the
bridge
like
this
and
came
out
on
to
the
river
bank
turning
this
time
to
the
left
again
into
a
long
deserted
back
street
which
led
to
the
centre
of
the
town
by
a
shorter
way
than
going
through
bogoyavlensky
street
is
it
true
as
they
say
that
you
robbed
a
church
in
the
district
the
other
day
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
asked
suddenly
i
went
in
to
say
my
prayers
in
the
first
place
the
tramp
answered
sedately
and
respectfully
as
though
nothing
had
happened
more
than
sedately
in
fact
almost
with
dignity
there
was
no
trace
of
his
former
friendly
familiarity
all
that
was
to
be
seen
was
a
serious
businesslike
man
who
had
indeed
been
gratuitously
insulted
but
who
was
capable
of
overlooking
an
insult
but
when
the
lord
led
me
there
he
went
on
ech
i
thought
what
a
heavenly
abundance
it
was
all
owing
to
my
helpless
state
as
in
our
way
of
life
theres
no
doing
without
assistance
and
now
god
be
my
witness
sir
it
was
my
own
loss
the
lord
punished
me
for
my
sins
and
what
with
the
censer
and
the
deacons
halter
i
only
got
twelve
roubles
altogether
the
chin
setting
of
st
nikolay
of
pure
silver
went
for
next
to
nothing
they
said
it
was
plated
you
killed
the
watchman
that
is
i
cleared
the
place
out
together
with
that
watchman
but
afterwards
next
morning
by
the
river
we
fell
to
quarrelling
which
should
carry
the
sack
i
sinned
i
did
lighten
his
load
for
him
well
you
can
rob
and
murder
again
thats
the
very
advice
pyotr
stepanovitch
gives
me
in
the
very
same
words
for
hes
uncommonly
mean
and
hardhearted
about
helping
a
fellowcreature
and
whats
more
he
hasnt
a
haporth
of
belief
in
the
heavenly
creator
who
made
us
out
of
earthly
clay
but
he
says
its
all
the
work
of
nature
even
to
the
last
beast
he
doesnt
understand
either
that
with
our
way
of
life
its
impossible
for
us
to
get
along
without
friendly
assistance
if
you
begin
to
talk
to
him
he
looks
like
a
sheep
at
the
water
it
makes
one
wonder
would
you
believe
at
captain
lebyadkins
out
yonder
whom
your
honours
just
been
visiting
when
he
was
living
at
filipovs
before
you
came
the
door
stood
open
all
night
long
hed
be
drunk
and
sleeping
like
the
dead
and
his
money
dropping
out
of
his
pockets
all
over
the
floor
ive
chanced
to
see
it
with
my
own
eyes
for
in
our
way
of
life
its
impossible
to
live
without
assistance
how
do
you
mean
with
your
own
eyes
did
you
go
in
at
night
then
maybe
i
did
go
in
but
no
one
knows
of
it
why
didnt
you
kill
him
reckoning
it
out
i
steadied
myself
for
once
having
learned
for
sure
that
i
can
always
get
one
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
why
should
i
go
so
far
when
i
can
get
fifteen
hundred
roubles
if
i
only
bide
my
time
for
captain
lebyadkin
ive
heard
him
with
my
own
ears
had
great
hopes
of
you
when
he
was
drunk
and
there
isnt
a
tavern
herenot
the
lowest
pothousewhere
he
hasnt
talked
about
it
when
he
was
in
that
state
so
that
hearing
it
from
many
lips
i
began
too
to
rest
all
my
hopes
on
your
excellency
i
speak
to
you
sir
as
to
my
father
or
my
own
brother
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
will
never
learn
that
from
me
and
not
a
soul
in
the
world
so
wont
your
excellency
spare
me
three
roubles
in
your
kindness
you
might
set
my
mind
at
rest
so
that
i
might
know
the
real
truth
for
we
cant
get
on
without
assistance
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
laughed
aloud
and
taking
out
his
purse
in
which
he
had
as
much
as
fifty
roubles
in
small
notes
threw
him
one
note
out
of
the
bundle
then
a
second
a
third
a
fourth
fedka
flew
to
catch
them
in
the
air
the
notes
dropped
into
the
mud
and
he
snatched
them
up
crying
ech
ech
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
finished
by
flinging
the
whole
bundle
at
him
and
still
laughing
went
on
down
the
street
this
time
alone
the
tramp
remained
crawling
on
his
knees
in
the
mud
looking
for
the
notes
which
were
blown
about
by
the
wind
and
soaking
in
the
puddles
and
for
an
hour
after
his
spasmodic
cries
of
ech

were
still
to
be
heard
in

darkness
chapter
iii
the
duel
i
the
next
day
at
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
duel
took
place
as
arranged
things
were
hastened
forward
by
gaganovs
obstinate
desire
to
fight
at
all
costs
he
did
not
understand
his
adversarys
conduct
and
was
in
a
fury
for
a
whole
month
he
had
been
insulting
him
with
impunity
and
had
so
far
been
unable
to
make
him
lose
patience
what
he
wanted
was
a
challenge
on
the
part
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
as
he
had
not
himself
any
direct
pretext
for
challenging
him
his
secret
motive
for
it
that
is
his
almost
morbid
hatred
of
stavrogin
for
the
insult
to
his
family
four
years
before
he
was
for
some
reason
ashamed
to
confess
and
indeed
he
regarded
this
himself
as
an
impossible
pretext
for
a
challenge
especially
in
view
of
the
humble
apology
offered
by
nikolay
stavrogin
twice
already
he
privately
made
up
his
mind
that
stavrogin
was
a
shameless
coward
and
could
not
understand
how
he
could
have
accepted
shatovs
blow
so
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
to
send
him
the
extraordinarily
rude
letter
that
had
finally
roused
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
himself
to
propose
a
meeting
having
dispatched
this
letter
the
day
before
he
awaited
a
challenge
with
feverish
impatience
and
while
morbidly
reckoning
the
chances
at
one
moment
with
hope
and
at
the
next
with
despair
he
got
ready
for
any
emergency
by
securing
a
second
to
wit
mavriky
nikolaevitch
drozdov
who
was
a
friend
of
his
an
old
schoolfellow
a
man
for
whom
he
had
a
great
respect
so
when
kirillov
came
next
morning
at
nine
oclock
with
his
message
he
found
things
in
readiness
all
the
apologies
and
unheardof
condescension
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
were
at
once
at
the
first
word
rejected
with
extraordinary
exasperation
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
had
only
been
made
acquainted
with
the
position
of
affairs
the
evening
before
opened
his
mouth
with
surprise
at
such
incredible
concessions
and
would
have
urged
a
reconciliation
but
seeing
that
gaganov
guessing
his
intention
was
almost
trembling
in
his
chair
refrained
and
said
nothing
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
promise
given
to
his
old
schoolfellow
he
would
have
retired
immediately
he
only
remained
in
the
hope
of
being
some
help
on
the
scene
of
action
kirillov
repeated
the
challenge
all
the
conditions
of
the
encounter
made
by
stavrogin
were
accepted
on
the
spot
without
the
faintest
objection
only
one
addition
was
made
and
that
a
ferocious
one
if
the
first
shots
had
no
decisive
effect
they
were
to
fire
again
and
if
the
second
encounter
were
inconclusive
it
was
to
be
followed
by
a
third
kirillov
frowned
objected
to
the
third
encounter
but
gaining
nothing
by
his
efforts
agreed
on
the
condition
however
that
three
should
be
the
limit
and
that
a
fourth
encounter
was
out
of
the
question
this
was
conceded
accordingly
at
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
meeting
took
place
at
brykov
that
is
in
a
little
copse
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
lying
between
skvoreshniki
and
the
shpigulin
factory
the
rain
of
the
previous
night
was
over
but
it
was
damp
grey
and
windy
low
ragged
dingy
clouds
moved
rapidly
across
the
cold
sky
the
treetops
roared
with
a
deep
droning
sound
and
creaked
on
their
roots
it
was
a
melancholy
morning
mavriky
nikolaevitch
and
gaganov
arrived
on
the
spot
in
a
smart
charbanc
with
a
pair
of
horses
driven
by
the
latter
they
were
accompanied
by
a
groom
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
kirillov
arrived
almost
at
the
same
instant
they
were
not
driving
they
were
on
horseback
and
were
also
followed
by
a
mounted
servant
kirillov
who
had
never
mounted
a
horse
before
sat
up
boldly
erect
in
the
saddle
grasping
in
his
right
hand
the
heavy
box
of
pistols
which
he
would
not
entrust
to
the
servant
in
his
inexperience
he
was
continually
with
his
left
hand
tugging
at
the
reins
which
made
the
horse
toss
his
head
and
show
an
inclination
to
rear
this
however
seemed
to
cause
his
rider
no
uneasiness
gaganov
who
was
morbidly
suspicious
and
always
ready
to
be
deeply
offended
considered
their
coming
on
horseback
as
a
fresh
insult
to
himself
inasmuch
as
it
showed
that
his
opponents
were
too
confident
of
success
since
they
had
not
even
thought
it
necessary
to
have
a
carriage
in
case
of
being
wounded
and
disabled
he
got
out
of
his
charbanc
yellow
with
anger
and
felt
that
his
hands
were
trembling
as
he
told
mavriky
nikolaevitch
he
made
no
response
at
all
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
bow
and
turned
away
the
seconds
cast
lots
the
lot
fell
on
kirillovs
pistols
they
measured
out
the
barrier
and
placed
the
combatants
the
servants
with
the
carriage
and
horses
were
moved
back
three
hundred
paces
the
weapons
were
loaded
and
handed
to
the
combatants
im
sorry
that
i
have
to
tell
my
story
more
quickly
and
have
no
time
for
descriptions
but
i
cant
refrain
from
some
comments
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
melancholy
and
preoccupied
kirillov
on
the
other
hand
was
perfectly
calm
and
unconcerned
very
exact
over
the
details
of
the
duties
he
had
undertaken
but
without
the
slightest
fussiness
or
even
curiosity
as
to
the
issue
of
the
fateful
contest
that
was
so
near
at
hand
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
paler
than
usual
he
was
rather
lightly
dressed
in
an
overcoat
and
a
white
beaver
hat
he
seemed
very
tired
he
frowned
from
time
to
time
and
seemed
to
feel
it
superfluous
to
conceal
his
illhumour
but
gaganov
was
at
this
moment
more
worthy
of
mention
than
anyone
so
that
it
is
quite
impossible
not
to
say
a
few
words
about
him
in
particular
ii
i
have
hitherto
not
had
occasion
to
describe
his
appearance
he
was
a
tall
man
of
thirtythree
and
well
fed
as
the
common
folk
express
it
almost
fat
with
lank
flaxen
hair
and
with
features
which
might
be
called
handsome
he
had
retired
from
the
service
with
the
rank
of
colonel
and
if
he
had
served
till
he
reached
the
rank
of
general
he
would
have
been
even
more
impressive
in
that
position
and
would
very
likely
have
become
an
excellent
fighting
general
i
must
add
as
characteristic
of
the
man
that
the
chief
cause
of
his
leaving
the
army
was
the
thought
of
the
family
disgrace
which
had
haunted
him
so
painfully
since
the
insult
paid
to
his
father
by
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
four
years
before
at
the
club
he
conscientiously
considered
it
dishonourable
to
remain
in
the
service
and
was
inwardly
persuaded
that
he
was
contaminating
the
regiment
and
his
companions
although
they
knew
nothing
of
the
incident
its
true
that
he
had
once
before
been
disposed
to
leave
the
army
long
before
the
insult
to
his
father
and
on
quite
other
grounds
but
he
had
hesitated
strange
as
it
is
to
write
the
original
design
or
rather
desire
to
leave
the
army
was
due
to
the
proclamation
of
the
19th
of
february
of
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
gaganov
who
was
one
of
the
richest
landowners
in
the
province
and
who
had
not
lost
very
much
by
the
emancipation
and
was
moreover
quite
capable
of
understanding
the
humanity
of
the
reform
and
its
economic
advantages
suddenly
felt
himself
personally
insulted
by
the
proclamation
it
was
something
unconscious
a
feeling
but
was
all
the
stronger
for
being
unrecognised
he
could
not
bring
himself
however
to
take
any
decisive
step
till
his
fathers
death
but
he
began
to
be
well
known
for
his
gentlemanly
ideas
to
many
persons
of
high
position
in
petersburg
with
whom
he
strenuously
kept
up
connections
he
was
secretive
and
selfcontained
another
characteristic
he
belonged
to
that
strange
section
of
the
nobility
still
surviving
in
russia
who
set
an
extreme
value
on
their
pure
and
ancient
lineage
and
take
it
too
seriously
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
endure
russian
history
and
indeed
looked
upon
russian
customs
in
general
as
more
or
less
piggish
even
in
his
childhood
in
the
special
military
school
for
the
sons
of
particularly
wealthy
and
distinguished
families
in
which
he
had
the
privilege
of
being
educated
from
first
to
last
certain
poetic
notions
were
deeply
rooted
in
his
mind
he
loved
castles
chivalry
all
the
theatrical
part
of
it
he
was
ready
to
cry
with
shame
that
in
the
days
of
the
moscow
tsars
the
sovereign
had
the
right
to
inflict
corporal
punishment
on
the
russian
boyars
and
blushed
at
the
contrast
this
stiff
and
extremely
severe
man
who
had
a
remarkable
knowledge
of
military
science
and
performed
his
duties
admirably
was
at
heart
a
dreamer
it
was
said
that
he
could
speak
at
meetings
and
had
the
gift
of
language
but
at
no
time
during
the
thirtythree
years
of
his
life
had
he
spoken
even
in
the
distinguished
circles
in
petersburg
in
which
he
had
moved
of
late
he
behaved
with
extraordinary
haughtiness
his
meeting
in
petersburg
with
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
who
had
just
returned
from
abroad
almost
sent
him
out
of
his
mind
at
the
present
moment
standing
at
the
barrier
he
was
terribly
uneasy
he
kept
imagining
that
the
duel
would
somehow
not
come
off
the
least
delay
threw
him
into
a
tremor
there
was
an
expression
of
anguish
in
his
face
when
kirillov
instead
of
giving
the
signal
for
them
to
fire
began
suddenly
speaking
only
for
form
indeed
as
he
himself
explained
aloud
simply
as
a
formality
now
that
you
have
the
pistols
in
your
hands
and
i
must
give
the
signal
i
ask
you
for
the
last
time
will
you
not
be
reconciled
its
the
duty
of
a
second
as
though
to
spite
him
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
had
till
then
kept
silence
although
he
had
been
reproaching
himself
all
day
for
his
compliance
and
acquiescence
suddenly
caught
up
kirillovs
thought
and
began
to
speak
i
entirely
agree
with
mr
kirillovs
words
this
idea
that
reconciliation
is
impossible
at
the
barrier
is
a
prejudice
only
suitable
for
frenchmen
besides
with
your
leave
i
dont
understand
what
the
offence
is
ive
been
wanting
to
say
so
for
a
long
time
because
every
apology
is
offered
isnt
it
he
flushed
all
over
he
had
rarely
spoken
so
much
and
with
such
excitement
i
repeat
again
my
offer
to
make
every
possible
apology
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
interposed
hurriedly
this
is
impossible
shouted
gaganov
furiously
addressing
mavriky
nikolaevitch
and
stamping
with
rage
explain
to
this
man
he
pointed
with
his
pistol
at
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
if
youre
my
second
and
not
my
enemy
mavriky
nikolaevitch
that
such
overtures
only
aggravate
the
insult
he
feels
it
impossible
to
be
insulted
by
me
he
feels
it
no
disgrace
to
walk
away
from
me
at
the
barrier
what
does
he
take
me
for
after
that
do
you
think
and
you
you
my
second
too
youre
simply
irritating
me
that
i
may
miss
he
stamped
again
there
were
flecks
of
foam
on
his
lips
negotiations
are
over
i
beg
you
to
listen
to
the
signal
kirillov
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
one
two
three
at
the
word
three
the
combatants
took
aim
at
one
another
gaganov
at
once
raised
his
pistol
and
at
the
fifth
or
sixth
step
he
fired
for
a
second
he
stood
still
and
making
sure
that
he
had
missed
advanced
to
the
barrier
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
advanced
too
raising
his
pistol
but
somehow
holding
it
very
high
and
fired
almost
without
taking
aim
then
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
bound
it
round
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
only
then
they
saw
that
gaganov
had
not
missed
him
completely
but
the
bullet
had
only
grazed
the
fleshy
part
of
his
finger
without
touching
the
bone
it
was
only
a
slight
scratch
kirillov
at
once
announced
that
the
duel
would
go
on
unless
the
combatants
were
satisfied
i
declare
said
gaganov
hoarsely
his
throat
felt
parched
again
addressing
mavriky
nikolaevitch
that
this
man
again
he
pointed
in
stavrogins
direction
fired
in
the
air
on
purpose
intentionally
this
is
an
insult
again
he
wants
to
make
the
duel
impossible
i
have
the
right
to
fire
as
i
like
so
long
as
i
keep
the
rules
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
asserted
resolutely
no
he
hasnt
explain
it
to
him
explain
it
cried
gaganov
im
in
complete
agreement
with
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
proclaimed
kirillov
why
does
he
spare
me
gaganov
raged
not
hearing
him
i
despise
his
mercy
i
spit
on
it
i
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
did
not
intend
to
insult
you
cried
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
impatiently
i
shot
high
because
i
dont
want
to
kill
anyone
else
either
you
or
anyone
else
its
nothing
to
do
with
you
personally
its
true
that
i
dont
consider
myself
insulted
and
im
sorry
that
angers
you
but
i
dont
allow
any
one
to
interfere
with
my
rights
if
hes
so
afraid
of
bloodshed
ask
him
why
he
challenged
me
yelled
gaganov
still
addressing
mavriky
nikolaevitch
how
could
he
help
challenging
you
said
kirillov
intervening
you
wouldnt
listen
to
anything
how
was
one
to
get
rid
of
you
ill
only
mention
one
thing
observed
mavriky
nikolaevitch
pondering
the
matter
with
painful
effort
if
a
combatant
declares
beforehand
that
he
will
fire
in
the
air
the
duel
certainly
cannot
go
on
for
obvious
and
delicate
reasons
i
havent
declared
that
ill
fire
in
the
air
every
time
cried
stavrogin
losing
all
patience
you
dont
know
whats
in
my
mind
or
how
i
intend
to
fire
again
im
not
restricting
the
duel
at
all
in
that
case
the
encounter
can
go
on
said
mavriky
nikolaevitch
to
gaganov
gentlemen
take
your
places
kirillov
commanded
again
they
advanced
again
gaganov
missed
and
stavrogin
fired
into
the
air
there
might
have
been
a
dispute
as
to
his
firing
into
the
air
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
might
have
flatly
declared
that
hed
fired
properly
if
he
had
not
admitted
that
he
had
missed
intentionally
he
did
not
aim
straight
at
the
sky
or
at
the
trees
but
seemed
to
aim
at
his
adversary
though
as
he
pointed
the
pistol
the
bullet
flew
a
yard
above
his
hat
the
second
time
the
shot
was
even
lower
even
less
like
an
intentional
miss
nothing
would
have
convinced
gaganov
now
again
he
muttered
grinding
his
teeth
no
matter
ive
been
challenged
and
ill
make
use
of
my
rights
ill
fire
a
third
time
whatever
happens
you
have
full
right
to
do
so
kirillov
rapped
out
mavriky
nikolaevitch
said
nothing
the
opponents
were
placed
a
third
time
the
signal
was
given
this
time
gaganov
went
right
up
to
the
barrier
and
began
from
there
taking
aim
at
a
distance
of
twelve
paces
his
hand
was
trembling
too
much
to
take
good
aim
stavrogin
stood
with
his
pistol
lowered
and
awaited
his
shot
without
moving
too
long
youve
been
aiming
too
long
kirillov
shouted
impetuously
fire
fire
but
the
shot
rang
out
and
this
time
stavrogins
white
beaver
hat
flew
off
the
aim
had
been
fairly
correct
the
crown
of
the
hat
was
pierced
very
low
down
a
quarter
of
an
inch
lower
and
all
would
have
been
over
kirillov
picked
up
the
hat
and
handed
it
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
fire
dont
detain
your
adversary
cried
mavriky
nikolaevitch
in
extreme
agitation
seeing
that
stavrogin
seemed
to
have
forgotten
to
fire
and
was
examining
the
hat
with
kirillov
stavrogin
started
looked
at
gaganov
turned
round
and
this
time
without
the
slightest
regard
for
punctilio
fired
to
one
side
into
the
copse
the
duel
was
over
gaganov
stood
as
though
overwhelmed
mavriky
nikolaevitch
went
up
and
began
saying
something
to
him
but
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
kirillov
took
off
his
hat
as
he
went
away
and
nodded
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
but
stavrogin
forgot
his
former
politeness
when
he
had
shot
into
the
copse
he
did
not
even
turn
towards
the
barrier
he
handed
his
pistol
to
kirillov
and
hastened
towards
the
horses
his
face
looked
angry
he
did
not
speak
kirillov
too
was
silent
they
got
on
their
horses
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
iii
why
dont
you
speak
he
called
impatiently
to
kirillov
when
they
were
not
far
from
home
what
do
you
want
replied
the
latter
almost
slipping
off
his
horse
which
was
rearing
stavrogin
restrained
himself
i
didnt
mean
to
insult
that
fool
and
ive
insulted
him
again
he
said
quietly
yes
youve
insulted
him
again
kirillov
jerked
out
and
besides
hes
not
a
fool
ive
done
all
i
can
anyway
no
what
ought
i
to
have
done
not
have
challenged
him
accept
another
blow
in
the
face
yes
accept
another
i
cant
understand
anything
now
said
stavrogin
wrathfully
why
does
every
one
expect
of
me
something
not
expected
from
anyone
else
why
am
i
to
put
up
with
what
no
one
else
puts
up
with
and
undertake
burdens
no
one
else
can
bear
i
thought
you
were
seeking
a
burden
yourself
i
seek
a
burden
yes
youve
seen
that
yes
is
it
so
noticeable
yes
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
stavrogin
had
a
very
preoccupied
face
he
was
almost
impressed
i
didnt
aim
because
i
didnt
want
to
kill
anyone
there
was
nothing
more
in
it
i
assure
you
he
said
hurriedly
and
with
agitation
as
though
justifying
himself
you
ought
not
to
have
offended
him
what
ought
i
to
have
done
then
you
ought
to
have
killed
him
are
you
sorry
i
didnt
kill
him
im
not
sorry
for
anything
i
thought
you
really
meant
to
kill
him
you
dont
know
what
youre
seeking
i
seek
a
burden
laughed
stavrogin
if
you
didnt
want
blood
yourself
why
did
you
give
him
a
chance
to
kill
you
if
i
hadnt
challenged
him
hed
have
killed
me
simply
without
a
duel
thats
not
your
affair
perhaps
he
wouldnt
have
killed
you
only
have
beaten
me
thats
not
your
business
bear
your
burden
or
else
theres
no
merit
hang
your
merit
i
dont
seek
anyones
approbation
i
thought
you
were
seeking
it
kirillov
commented
with
terrible
unconcern
they
rode
into
the
courtyard
of
the
house
do
you
care
to
come
in
said
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
no
im
going
home
goodbye
he
got
off
the
horse
and
took
his
box
of
pistols
under
his
arm
anyway
youre
not
angry
with
me
said
stavrogin
holding
out
his
hand
to
him
not
in
the
least
said
kirillov
turning
round
to
shake
hands
with
him
if
my
burdens
light
its
because
its
from
nature
perhaps
your
burdens
heavier
because
thats
your
nature
theres
no
need
to
be
much
ashamed
only
a
little
i
know
im
a
worthless
character
and
i
dont
pretend
to
be
a
strong
one
youd
better
not
youre
not
a

and

tea
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
went
into
the
house
greatly
perturbed
iv
he
learned
at
once
from
alexey
yegorytch
that
varvara
petrovna
had
been
very
glad
to
hear
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
gone
out
for
a
ridethe
first
time
he
had
left
the
house
after
eight
days
illness
she
had
ordered
the
carriage
and
had
driven
out
alone
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
according
to
the
habit
of
the
past
as
she
had
forgotten
for
the
last
eight
days
what
it
meant
to
breathe
fresh
air
alone
or
with
darya
pavlovna
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
interrupted
the
old
man
with
a
rapid
question
and
he
scowled
when
he
heard
that
darya
pavlovna
had
declined
to
go
abroad
on
account
of
indisposition
and
was
in
her
rooms
listen
old
man
he
said
as
though
suddenly
making
up
his
mind
keep
watch
over
her
all
today
and
if
you
notice
her
coming
to
me
stop
her
at
once
and
tell
her
that
i
cant
see
her
for
a
few
days
at
least
that
i
ask
her
not
to
come
myself
ill
let
her
know
myself
when
the
time
comes
do
you
hear
ill
tell
her
sir
said
alexey
yegorytch
with
distress
in
his
voice
dropping
his
eyes
not
till
you
see
clearly
shes
meaning
to
come
and
see
me
of
herself
though
dont
be
afraid
sir
there
shall
be
no
mistake
your
interviews
have
all
passed
through
me
hitherto
youve
always
turned
to
me
for
help
i
know
not
till
she
comes
of
herself
anyway
bring
me
some
tea
if
you
can
at
once
the
old
man
had
hardly
gone
out
when
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
door
reopened
and
darya
pavlovna
appeared
in
the
doorway
her
eyes
were
tranquil
though
her
face
was
pale
where
have
you
come
from
exclaimed
stavrogin
i
was
standing
there
and
waiting
for
him
to
go
out
to
come
in
to
you
i
heard
the
order
you
gave
him
and
when
he
came
out
just
now
i
hid
round
the
corner
on
the
right
and
he
didnt
notice
me
ive
long
meant
to
break
off
with
you
dasha
for
a
while
for
the
present
i
couldnt
see
you
last
night
in
spite
of
your
note
i
meant
to
write
to
you
myself
but
i
dont
know
how
to
write
he
added
with
vexation
almost
as
though
with
disgust
i
thought
myself
that
we
must
break
it
off
varvara
petrovna
is
too
suspicious
of
our
relations
well
let
her
be
she
mustnt
be
worried
so
now
we
part
till
the
end
comes
you
still
insist
on
expecting
the
end
yes
im
sure
of
it
but
nothing
in
the
world
ever
has
an
end
this
will
have
an
end
then
call
me
ill
come
now
goodbye
and
what
sort
of
end
will
it
be
smiled
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
youre
not
wounded
and
have
not
shed
blood
she
asked
not
answering
his
question
it
was
stupid
i
didnt
kill
anyone
dont
be
uneasy
however
youll
hear
all
about
it
today
from
every
one
im
not
quite
well
im
going
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
wont
be
today
she
added
irresolutely
it
wont
be
today
and
it
wont
be
tomorrow
i
cant
say
about
the
day
after
tomorrow
perhaps
we
shall
all
be
dead
and
so
much
the
better
leave
me
alone
leave
me
alone
do
you
wont
ruin
that
other
mad
girl
i
wont
ruin
either
of
the
mad
creatures
it
seems
to
be
the
sane
im
ruining
im
so
vile
and
loathsome
dasha
that
i
might
really
send
for
you
at
the
latter
end
as
you
say
and
in
spite
of
your
sanity
youll
come
why
will
you
be
your
own
ruin
i
know
that
at
the
end
i
shall
be
the
only
one
left
you
and
im
waiting
for
that
and
what
if
i
dont
send
for
you
after
all
but
run
away
from
you
that
cant
be
you
will
send
for
me
theres
a
great
deal
of
contempt
for
me
in
that
you
know
that
theres
not
only
contempt
then
there
is
contempt
anyway
i
used
the
wrong
word
god
is
my
witness
its
my
greatest
wish
that
you
may
never
have
need
of
me
one
phrase
is
as
good
as
another
i
should
also
have
wished
not
to
have
ruined
you
you
can
never
anyhow
be
my
ruin
and
you
know
that
yourself
better
than
anyone
darya
pavlovna
said
rapidly
and
resolutely
if
i
dont
come
to
you
i
shall
be
a
sister
of
mercy
a
nurse
shall
wait
upon
the
sick
or
go
selling
the
gospel
ive
made
up
my
mind
to
that
i
cannot
be
anyones
wife
i
cant
live
in
a
house
like
this
either
thats
not
what
i
want
you
know
all
that
no
i
never
could
tell
what
you
want
it
seems
to
me
that
youre
interested
in
me
as
some
veteran
nurses
get
specially
interested
in
some
particular
invalid
in
comparison
with
the
others
or
still
more
like
some
pious
old
women
who
frequent
funerals
and
find
one
corpse
more
attractive
than
another
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
strangely
are
you
very
ill
she
asked
sympathetically
looking
at
him
in
a
peculiar
way
good
heavens
and
this
man
wants
to
do
without
me
listen
dasha
now
im
always
seeing
phantoms
one
devil
offered
me
yesterday
on
the
bridge
to
murder
lebyadkin
and
marya
timofyevna
to
settle
the
marriage
difficulty
and
to
cover
up
all
traces
he
asked
me
to
give
him
three
roubles
on
account
but
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
whole
operation
wouldnt
cost
less
than
fifteen
hundred
wasnt
he
a
calculating
devil
a
regular
shopkeeper
ha
ha
but
youre
fully
convinced
that
it
was
an
hallucination
oh
no
not
a
bit
an
hallucination
it
was
simply
fedka
the
convict
the
robber
who
escaped
from
prison
but
thats
not
the
point
what
do
you
suppose
i
did
i
gave
him
all
i
had
everything
in
my
purse
and
now
hes
sure
ive
given
him
that
on
account
you
met
him
at
night
and
he
made
such
a
suggestion
surely
you
must
see
that
youre
being
caught
in
their
nets
on
every
side
well
let
them
be
but
youve
got
some
question
at
the
tip
of
your
tongue
you
know
i
see
it
by
your
eyes
he
added
with
a
resentful
and
irritable
smile
dasha
was
frightened
ive
no
question
at
all
and
no
doubt
whatever
youd
better
be
quiet
she
cried
in
dismay
as
though
waving
off
his
question
then
youre
convinced
that
i
wont
go
to
fedkas
little
shop
oh
god
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
why
do
you
torture
me
like
this
oh
forgive
me
my
stupid
joke
i
must
be
picking
up
bad
manners
from
them
do
you
know
ever
since
last
night
i
feel
awfully
inclined
to
laugh
to
go
on
laughing
continually
forever
so
long
its
as
though
i
must
explode
with
laughter
its
like
an
illness
oh
my
mothers
coming
in
i
always
know
by
the
rumble
when
her
carriage
has
stopped
at
the
entrance
dasha
seized
his
hand
god
save
you
from
your
demon
and
call
me
call
me
quickly
oh
a
fine
demon
its
simply
a
little
nasty
scrofulous
imp
with
a
cold
in
his
head
one
of
the
unsuccessful
ones
but
you
have
something
you
dont
dare
to
say
again
dasha
she
looked
at
him
with
pain
and
reproach
and
turned
towards
the
door
listen
he
called
after
her
with
a
malignant
and
distorted
smile
if
yes
if
in
one
word
if
you
understand
even
if
i
did
go
to
that
little
shop
and
if
i
called
you
after
thatwould
you
come
then
she
went
out
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
and
neither
turning
nor
answering
she
will
come
even
after
the
shop
he
whispered
thinking
a
moment
and
an
expression
of
scornful
disdain
came
into
his
face
a
nurse
hm
but
perhaps
thats
what
i
want
chapter
iv
all
in
expectation
i
the
impression
made
on
the
whole
neighbourhood
by
the
story
of
the
duel
which
was
rapidly
noised
abroad
was
particularly
remarkable
from
the
unanimity
with
which
every
one
hastened
to
take
up
the
cudgels
for
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
many
of
his
former
enemies
declared
themselves
his
friends
the
chief
reason
for
this
change
of
front
in
public
opinion
was
chiefly
due
to
one
person
who
had
hitherto
not
expressed
her
opinion
but
who
now
very
distinctly
uttered
a
few
words
which
at
once
gave
the
event
a
significance
exceedingly
interesting
to
the
vast
majority
this
was
how
it
happened
on
the
day
after
the
duel
all
the
town
was
assembled
at
the
marshal
of
nobilitys
in
honour
of
his
wifes
nameday
yulia
mihailovna
was
present
or
rather
presided
accompanied
by
lizaveta
nikolaevna
radiant
with
beauty
and
peculiar
gaiety
which
struck
many
of
our
ladies
at
once
as
particularly
suspicious
at
this
time
and
i
may
mention
by
the
way
her
engagement
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
by
now
an
established
fact
to
a
playful
question
from
a
retired
general
of
much
consequence
of
whom
we
shall
have
more
to
say
later
lizaveta
nikolaevna
frankly
replied
that
evening
that
she
was
engaged
and
only
imagine
not
one
of
our
ladies
would
believe
in
her
engagement
they
all
persisted
in
assuming
a
romance
of
some
sort
some
fatal
family
secret
something
that
had
happened
in
switzerland
and
for
some
reason
imagined
that
yulia
mihailovna
must
have
had
some
hand
in
it
it
was
difficult
to
understand
why
these
rumours
or
rather
fancies
persisted
so
obstinately
and
why
yulia
mihailovna
was
so
positively
connected
with
it
as
soon
as
she
came
in
all
turned
to
her
with
strange
looks
brimful
of
expectation
it
must
be
observed
that
owing
to
the
freshness
of
the
event
and
certain
circumstances
accompanying
it
at
the
party
people
talked
of
it
with
some
circumspection
in
undertones
besides
nothing
yet
was
known
of
the
line
taken
by
the
authorities
as
far
as
was
known
neither
of
the
combatants
had
been
troubled
by
the
police
every
one
knew
for
instance
that
gaganov
had
set
off
home
early
in
the
morning
to
duhovo
without
being
hindered
meanwhile
of
course
all
were
eager
for
someone
to
be
the
first
to
speak
of
it
aloud
and
so
to
open
the
door
to
the
general
impatience
they
rested
their
hopes
on
the
general
abovementioned
and
they
were
not
disappointed
this
general
a
landowner
though
not
a
wealthy
one
was
one
of
the
most
imposing
members
of
our
club
and
a
man
of
an
absolutely
unique
turn
of
mind
he
flirted
in
the
oldfashioned
way
with
the
young
ladies
and
was
particularly
fond
in
large
assemblies
of
speaking
aloud
with
all
the
weightiness
of
a
general
on
subjects
to
which
others
were
alluding
in
discreet
whispers
this
was
so
to
say
his
special
rle
in
local
society
he
drawled
too
and
spoke
with
peculiar
suavity
probably
having
picked
up
the
habit
from
russians
travelling
abroad
or
from
those
wealthy
landowners
of
former
days
who
had
suffered
most
from
the
emancipation
stepan
trofimovitch
had
observed
that
the
more
completely
a
landowner
was
ruined
the
more
suavely
he
lisped
and
drawled
his
words
he
did
as
a
fact
lisp
and
drawl
himself
but
was
not
aware
of
it
in
himself
the
general
spoke
like
a
person
of
authority
he
was
besides
a
distant
relation
of
gaganovs
though
he
was
on
bad
terms
with
him
and
even
engaged
in
litigation
with
him
he
had
moreover
in
the
past
fought
two
duels
himself
and
had
even
been
degraded
to
the
ranks
and
sent
to
the
caucasus
on
account
of
one
of
them
some
mention
was
made
of
varvara
petrovnas
having
driven
out
that
day
and
the
day
before
after
being
kept
indoors
by
illness
though
the
allusion
was
not
to
her
but
to
the
marvellous
matching
of
her
four
grey
horses
of
the
stavrogins
own
breeding
the
general
suddenly
observed
that
he
had
met
young
stavrogin
that
day
on
horseback
every
one
was
instantly
silent
the
general
munched
his
lips
and
suddenly
proclaimed
twisting
in
his
fingers
his
presentation
gold
snuffbox
im
sorry
i
wasnt
here
some
years
ago
i
mean
when
i
was
at
carlsbad
hm
im
very
much
interested
in
that
young
man
about
whom
i
heard
so
many
rumours
at
that
time
hm
and
i
say
is
it
true
that
hes
mad
some
one
told
me
so
then
suddenly
im
told
that
he
has
been
insulted
by
some
student
here
in
the
presence
of
his
cousins
and
he
slipped
under
the
table
to
get
away
from
him
and
yesterday
i
heard
from
stepan
vysotsky
that
stavrogin
had
been
fighting
with
gaganov
and
simply
with
the
gallant
object
of
offering
himself
as
a
target
to
an
infuriated
man
just
to
get
rid
of
him
hm
quite
in
the
style
of
the
guards
of
the
twenties
is
there
any
house
where
he
visits
here
the
general
paused
as
though
expecting
an
answer
a
way
had
been
opened
for
the
public
impatience
to
express
itself
what
could
be
simpler
cried
yulia
mihailovna
raising
her
voice
irritated
that
all
present
had
turned
their
eyes
upon
her
as
though
at
a
word
of
command
can
one
wonder
that
stavrogin
fought
gaganov
and
took
no
notice
of
the
student
he
couldnt
challenge
a
man
who
used
to
be
his
serf
a
noteworthy
saying
a
clear
and
simple
notion
yet
it
had
entered
nobodys
head
till
that
moment
it
was
a
saying
that
had
extraordinary
consequences
all
scandal
and
gossip
all
the
petty
tittletattle
was
thrown
into
the
background
another
significance
had
been
detected
a
new
character
was
revealed
whom
all
had
misjudged
a
character
almost
ideally
severe
in
his
standards
mortally
insulted
by
a
student
that
is
an
educated
man
no
longer
a
serf
he
despised
the
affront
because
his
assailant
had
once
been
his
serf
society
had
gossiped
and
slandered
him
shallowminded
people
had
looked
with
contempt
on
a
man
who
had
been
struck
in
the
face
he
had
despised
a
public
opinion
which
had
not
risen
to
the
level
of
the
highest
standards
though
it
discussed
them
and
meantime
you
and
i
ivan
alexandrovitch
sit
and
discuss
the
correct
standards
one
old
club
member
observed
to
another
with
a
warm
and
generous
glow
of
selfreproach
yes
pyotr
mihailovitch
yes
the
other
chimed
in
with
zest
talk
of
the
younger
generation
its
not
a
question
of
the
younger
generation
observed
a
third
putting
in
his
spoke
its
nothing
to
do
with
the
younger
generation
hes
a
star
not
one
of
the
younger
generation
thats
the
way
to
look
at
it
and
its
just
that
sort
we
need
theyre
rare
people
the
chief
point
in
all
this
was
that
the
new
man
besides
showing
himself
an
unmistakable
nobleman
was
the
wealthiest
landowner
in
the
province
and
was
therefore
bound
to
be
a
leading
man
who
could
be
of
assistance
ive
already
alluded
in
passing
to
the
attitude
of
the
landowners
of
our
province
people
were
enthusiastic
he
didnt
merely
refrain
from
challenging
the
student
he
put
his
hands
behind
him
note
that
particularly
your
excellency
somebody
pointed
out
and
he
didnt
haul
him
up
before
the
new
lawcourts
either
added
another
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
for
a
personal
insult
to
a
nobleman
hed
have
got
fifteen
roubles
damages
he
he
he
no
ill
tell
you
a
secret
about
the
new
courts
cried
a
third
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
if
anyones
caught
robbing
or
swindling
and
convicted
hed
better
run
home
while
theres
yet
time
and
murder
his
mother
hell
be
acquitted
of
everything
at
once
and
ladies
will
wave
their
batiste
handkerchiefs
from
the
platform
its
the
absolute
truth
its
the
truth
its
the
truth
the
inevitable
anecdotes
followed
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
friendly
relations
with
count
k
were
recalled
count
ks
stern
and
independent
attitude
to
recent
reforms
was
well
known
as
well
as
his
remarkable
public
activity
though
that
had
somewhat
fallen
off
of
late
and
now
suddenly
every
one
was
positive
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
betrothed
to
one
of
the
counts
daughters
though
nothing
had
given
grounds
for
such
a
supposition
and
as
for
some
wonderful
adventures
in
switzerland
with
lizaveta
nikolaevna
even
the
ladies
quite
dropped
all
reference
to
it
i
must
mention
by
the
way
that
the
drozdovs
had
by
this
time
succeeded
in
paying
all
the
visits
they
had
omitted
at
first
every
one
now
confidently
considered
lizaveta
nikolaevna
a
most
ordinary
girl
who
paraded
her
delicate
nerves
her
fainting
on
the
day
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
arrival
was
explained
now
as
due
to
her
terror
at
the
students
outrageous
behaviour
they
even
increased
the
prosaicness
of
that
to
which
before
they
had
striven
to
give
such
a
fantastic
colour
as
for
a
lame
woman
who
had
been
talked
of
she
was
forgotten
completely
they
were
ashamed
to
remember
her
and
if
there
had
been
a
hundred
lame
girlsweve
all
been
young
once
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
respectfulness
to
his
mother
was
enlarged
upon
various
virtues
were
discovered
in
him
people
talked
with
approbation
of
the
learning
he
had
acquired
in
the
four
years
he
had
spent
in
german
universities
gaganovs
conduct
was
declared
utterly
tactless
not
knowing
friend
from
foe
yulia
mihailovnas
keen
insight
was
unhesitatingly
admitted
so
by
the
time
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
made
his
appearance
among
them
he
was
received
by
every
one
with
nave
solemnity
in
all
eyes
fastened
upon
him
could
be
read
eager
anticipation
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
at
once
wrapped
himself
in
the
most
austere
silence
which
of
course
gratified
every
one
much
more
than
if
he
had
talked
till
doomsday
in
a
word
he
was
a
success
he
was
the
fashion
if
once
one
has
figured
in
provincial
society
theres
no
retreating
into
the
background
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
began
to
fulfil
all
his
social
duties
in
the
province
punctiliously
as
before
he
was
not
found
cheerful
company
a
man
who
has
seen
suffering
a
man
not
like
other
people
he
has
something
to
be
melancholy
about
even
the
pride
and
disdainful
aloofness
for
which
he
had
been
so
detested
four
years
before
was
now
liked
and
respected
varvara
petrovna
was
triumphant
i
dont
know
whether
she
grieved
much
over
the
shattering
of
her
dreams
concerning
lizaveta
nikolaevna
family
pride
of
course
helped
her
to
get
over
it
one
thing
was
strange
varvara
petrovna
was
suddenly
convinced
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
really
had
made
his
choice
at
count
ks
and
what
was
strangest
of
all
she
was
led
to
believe
it
by
rumours
which
reached
her
on
no
better
authority
than
other
people
she
was
afraid
to
ask
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
a
direct
question
two
or
three
times
however
she
could
not
refrain
from
slyly
and
goodhumouredly
reproaching
him
for
not
being
open
with
her
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
smiled
and
remained
silent
the
silence
was
taken
as
a
sign
of
assent
and
yet
all
the
time
she
never
forgot
the
cripple
the
thought
of
her
lay
like
a
stone
on
her
heart
a
nightmare
she
was
tortured
by
strange
misgivings
and
surmises
and
all
this
at
the
same
time
as
she
dreamed
of
count
ks
daughters
but
of
this
we
shall
speak
later
varvara
petrovna
began
again
of
course
to
be
treated
with
extreme
deference
and
respect
in
society
but
she
took
little
advantage
of
it
and
went
out
rarely
she
did
however
pay
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
the
governors
wife
of
course
no
one
had
been
more
charmed
and
delighted
by
yulia
mihailovnas
words
spoken
at
the
marshals
soire
than
she
they
lifted
a
load
of
care
off
her
heart
and
had
at
once
relieved
much
of
the
distress
she
had
been
suffering
since
that
luckless
sunday
i
misunderstood
that
woman
she
declared
and
with
her
characteristic
impulsiveness
she
frankly
told
yulia
mihailovna
that
she
had
come
to
thank
her
yulia
mihailovna
was
flattered
but
she
behaved
with
dignity
she
was
beginning
about
this
time
to
be
very
conscious
of
her
own
importance
too
much
so
in
fact
she
announced
for
example
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
she
had
never
heard
of
stepan
trofimovitch
as
a
leading
man
or
a
savant
i
know
young
verhovensky
of
course
and
make
much
of
him
hes
imprudent
but
then
hes
young
hes
thoroughly
wellinformed
though
hes
not
an
outofdate
oldfashioned
critic
anyway
varvara
petrovna
hastened
to
observe
that
stepan
trofimovitch
had
never
been
a
critic
but
had
on
the
contrary
spent
all
his
life
in
her
house
he
was
renowned
through
circumstances
of
his
early
career
only
too
well
known
to
the
whole
world
and
of
late
for
his
researches
in
spanish
history
now
he
intended
to
write
also
on
the
position
of
modern
german
universities
and
she
believed
something
about
the
dresden
madonna
too
in
short
varvara
petrovna
refused
to
surrender
stepan
trofimovitch
to
the
tender
mercies
of
yulia
mihailovna
the
dresden
madonna
you
mean
the
sistine
madonna
chre
varvara
petrovna
i
spent
two
hours
sitting
before
that
picture
and
came
away
utterly
disillusioned
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
was
in
complete
amazement
karmazinov
too
says
its
hard
to
understand
it
they
all
see
nothing
in
it
now
russians
and
english
alike
all
its
fame
is
just
the
talk
of
the
last
generation
fashions
are
changed
then
what
i
think
is
that
one
mustnt
despise
our
younger
generation
either
they
cry
out
that
theyre
communists
but
what
i
say
is
that
we
must
appreciate
them
and
mustnt
be
hard
on
them
i
read
everything
nowthe
papers
communism
the
natural
sciencesi
get
everything
because
after
all
one
must
know
where
ones
living
and
with
whom
one
has
to
do
one
mustnt
spend
ones
whole
life
on
the
heights
of
ones
own
fancy
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
and
adopted
it
as
a
principle
that
one
must
be
kind
to
the
young
people
and
so
keep
them
from
the
brink
believe
me
varvara
petrovna
that
none
but
we
who
make
up
good
society
can
by
our
kindness
and
good
influence
keep
them
from
the
abyss
towards
which
they
are
brought
by
the
intolerance
of
all
these
old
men
i
am
glad
though
to
learn
from
you
about
stepan
trofimovitch
you
suggest
an
idea
to
me
he
may
be
useful
at
our
literary
matine
you
know
im
arranging
for
a
whole
day
of
festivities
a
subscription
entertainment
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
governesses
of
our
province
they
are
scattered
about
russia
in
our
district
alone
we
can
reckon
up
six
of
them
besides
that
there
are
two
girls
in
the
telegraph
office
two
are
being
trained
in
the
academy
the
rest
would
like
to
be
but
have
not
the
means
the
russian
womans
fate
is
a
terrible
one
varvara
petrovna
its
out
of
that
theyre
making
the
university
question
now
and
theres
even
been
a
meeting
of
the
imperial
council
about
it
in
this
strange
russia
of
ours
one
can
do
anything
one
likes
and
that
again
is
why
its
only
by
the
kindness
and
the
direct
warm
sympathy
of
all
the
better
classes
that
we
can
direct
this
great
common
cause
in
the
true
path
oh
heavens
have
we
many
noble
personalities
among
us
there
are
some
of
course
but
they
are
scattered
far
and
wide
let
us
unite
and
we
shall
be
stronger
in
one
word
i
shall
first
have
a
literary
matine
then
a
light
luncheon
then
an
interval
and
in
the
evening
a
ball
we
meant
to
begin
the
evening
by
living
pictures
but
it
would
involve
a
great
deal
of
expense
and
so
to
please
the
public
there
will
be
one
or
two
quadrilles
in
masks
and
fancy
dresses
representing
wellknown
literary
schools
this
humorous
idea
was
suggested
by
karmazinov
he
has
been
a
great
help
to
me
do
you
know
hes
going
to
read
us
the
last
thing
hes
written
which
no
one
has
seen
yet
he
is
laying
down
the
pen
and
will
write
no
more
this
last
essay
is
his

amusing

even
subtler

fact

think
stepan
trofimovitch

quite
short
and
not
so
very
learned

one

run
round
to
you
and
tell
you
the
programme

varvara
petrovna
returned
home
completely
fascinated
she
was
ready
to
stand
up
for
yulia
mihailovna
through
thick
and
thin
and
for
some
reason
was
already
quite
put
out
with
stepan
trofimovitch
while
he
poor
man
sat
at
home
all
unconscious
im
in
love
with
her
i
cant
understand
how
i
could
be
so
mistaken
in
that
woman
she
said
to
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
who
dropped
in
that
evening
but
you
must
make
peace
with
the
old
man
all
the
same
pyotr
stepanovitch
submitted
hes
in
despair
youve
quite
sent
him
to
coventry
yesterday
he
met
your
carriage
and
bowed
and
you
turned
away
well
trot
him
out
you
know
im
reckoning
on
him
for
something
and
he
may
still
be
useful
oh
hell
read
something
i
dont
mean
only
that
and
i
was
meaning
to
drop
in
on
him
today
so
shall
i
tell
him
if
you
like
i
dont
know
though
how
youll
arrange
it
she
said
irresolutely
i
was
meaning
to
have
a
talk
with
him
myself
and
wanted
to
fix
the
time
and
place
she
frowned
oh
its
not
worth
while
fixing
a
time
ill
simply
give
him
the
message
very
well
do
add
that
i
certainly
will
fix
a
time
to
see
him
though
be
sure
to
say
that
too
pyotr
stepanovitch
ran
off
grinning
he
was
in
fact
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
particularly
spiteful
all
this
time
and
ventured
upon
extremely
impatient
sallies
with
almost
every
one
strange
to
say
every
one
somehow
forgave
him
it
was
generally
accepted
that
he
was
not
to
be
looked
at
from
the
ordinary
standpoint
i
may
remark
that
he
took
up
an
extremely
resentful
attitude
about
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
duel
it
took
him
unawares
he
turned
positively
green
when
he
was
told
of
it
perhaps
his
vanity
was
wounded
he
only
heard
of
it
next
day
when
every
one
knew
of
it
you
had
no
right
to
fight
you
know
he
whispered
to
stavrogin
five
days
later
when
he
chanced
to
meet
him
at
the
club
it
was
remarkable
that
they
had
not
once
met
during
those
five
days
though
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
dropped
in
at
varvara
petrovnas
almost
every
day
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
at
him
in
silence
with
an
absentminded
air
as
though
not
understanding
what
was
the
matter
and
he
went
on
without
stopping
he
was
crossing
the
big
hall
of
the
club
on
his
way
to
the
refreshment
room
youve
been
to
see
shatov
too
you
mean
to
make
it
known
about
marya
timofyevna
pyotr
stepanovitch
muttered
running
after
him
and
as
though
not
thinking
of
what
he
was
doing
he
clutched
at
his
shoulder
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
shook
his
hand
off
and
turned
round
quickly
to
him
with
a
menacing
scowl
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
prolonged
smile
it
all
lasted
only
one
moment
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
walked
on
ii
he
went
to
the
old
man
straight
from
varvara
petrovnas
and
he
was
in
such
haste
simply
from
spite
that
he
might
revenge
himself
for
an
insult
of
which
i
had
no
idea
at
that
time
the
fact
is
that
at
their
last
interview
on
the
thursday
of
the
previous
week
stepan
trofimovitch
though
the
dispute
was
one
of
his
own
beginning
had
ended
by
turning
pyotr
stepanovitch
out
with
his
stick
he
concealed
the
incident
from
me
at
the
time
but
now
as
soon
as
pyotr
stepanovitch
ran
in
with
his
everlasting
grin
which
was
so
navely
condescending
and
his
unpleasantly
inquisitive
eyes
peering
into
every
corner
stepan
trofimovitch
at
once
made
a
signal
aside
to
me
not
to
leave
the
room
this
was
how
their
real
relations
came
to
be
exposed
before
me
for
on
this
occasion
i
heard
their
whole
conversation
stepan
trofimovitch
was
sitting
stretched
out
on
a
lounge
he
had
grown
thin
and
sallow
since
that
thursday
pyotr
stepanovitch
seated
himself
beside
him
with
a
most
familiar
air
unceremoniously
tucking
his
legs
up
under
him
and
taking
up
more
room
on
the
lounge
than
deference
to
his
father
should
have
allowed
stepan
trofimovitch
moved
aside
in
silence
and
with
dignity
on
the
table
lay
an
open
book
it
was
the
novel
whats
to
be
done
alas
i
must
confess
one
strange
weakness
in
my
friend
the
fantasy
that
he
ought
to
come
forth
from
his
solitude
and
fight
a
last
battle
was
getting
more
and
more
hold
upon
his
deluded
imagination
i
guessed
that
he
had
got
the
novel
and
was
studying
it
solely
in
order
that
when
the
inevitable
conflict
with
the
shriekers
came
about
he
might
know
their
methods
and
arguments
beforehand
from
their
very
catechism
and
in
that
way
be
prepared
to
confute
them
all
triumphantly
before
her
eyes
oh
how
that
book
tortured
him
he
sometimes
flung
it
aside
in
despair
and
leaping
up
paced
about
the
room
almost
in
a
frenzy
i
agree
that
the
authors
fundamental
idea
is
a
true
one
he
said
to
me
feverishly
but
that
only
makes
it
more
awful
its
just
our
idea
exactly
ours
we
first
sowed
the
seed
nurtured
it
prepared
the
way
and
indeed
what
could
they
say
new
after
us
but
heavens
how
its
all
expressed
distorted
mutilated
he
exclaimed
tapping
the
book
with
his
fingers
were
these
the
conclusions
we
were
striving
for
who
can
understand
the
original
idea
in
this
improving
your
mind
sniggered
pyotr
stepanovitch
taking
the
book
from
the
table
and
reading
the
title
its
high
time
ill
bring
you
better
if
you
like
stepan
trofimovitch
again
preserved
a
dignified
silence
i
was
sitting
on
a
sofa
in
the
corner
pyotr
stepanovitch
quickly
explained
the
reason
of
his
coming
of
course
stepan
trofimovitch
was
absolutely
staggered
and
he
listened
in
alarm
which
was
mixed
with
extreme
indignation
and
that
yulia
mihailovna
counts
on
my
coming
to
read
for
her
well
theyre
by
no
means
in
such
need
of
you
on
the
contrary
its
by
way
of
an
attention
to
you
so
as
to
make
up
to
varvara
petrovna
but
of
course
you
wont
dare
to
refuse
and
i
expect
you
want
to
yourself
he
added
with
a
grin
you
old
fogies
are
all
so
devilishly
ambitious
but
i
say
though
you
must
look
out
that
its
not
too
boring
what
have
you
got
spanish
history
or
what
is
it
youd
better
let
me
look
at
it
three
days
beforehand
or
else
youll
put
us
to
sleep
perhaps
the
hurried
and
too
barefaced
coarseness
of
these
thrusts
was
obviously
premeditated
he
affected
to
behave
as
though
it
were
impossible
to
talk
to
stepan
trofimovitch
in
different
and
more
delicate
language
stepan
trofimovitch
resolutely
persisted
in
ignoring
his
insults
but
what
his
son
told
him
made
a
more
and
more
overwhelming
impression
upon
him
and
she
she
herself
sent
me
this
message
through
you
he
asked
turning
pale
well
you
see
she
means
to
fix
a
time
and
place
for
a
mutual
explanation
the
relics
of
your
sentimentalising
youve
been
coquetting
with
her
for
twenty
years
and
have
trained
her
to
the
most
ridiculous
habits
but
dont
trouble
yourself
its
quite
different
now
she
keeps
saying
herself
that
shes
only
beginning
now
to
have
her
eyes
opened
i
told
her
in
so
many
words
that
all
this
friendship
of
yours
is
nothing
but
a
mutual
pouring
forth
of
sloppiness
she
told
me
lots
my
boy
foo
what
a
flunkeys
place
youve
been
filling
all
this
time
i
positively
blushed
for
you
i
filling
a
flunkeys
place
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
unable
to
restrain
himself
worse
youve
been
a
parasite
that
is
a
voluntary
flunkey
too
lazy
to
work
while
youve
an
appetite
for
money
she
too
understands
all
that
now
its
awful
the
things
shes
been
telling
me
about
you
anyway
i
did
laugh
my
boy
over
your
letters
to
her
shameful
and
disgusting
but
youre
all
so
depraved
so
depraved
theres
always
something
depraving
in
charityyoure
a
good
example
of
it
she
showed
you
my
letters
all
though
of
course
one
couldnt
read
them
all
foo
what
a
lot
of
paper
youve
covered
i
believe
there
are
more
than
two
thousand
letters
there
and
do
you
know
old
chap
i
believe
there
was
one
moment
when
shed
have
been
ready
to
marry
you
you
let
slip
your
chance
in
the
silliest
way
of
course
im
speaking
from
your
point
of
view
though
anyway
it
would
have
been
better
than
now
when
youve
almost
been
married
to
cover
another
mans
sins
like
a
buffoon
for
a
jest
for
money
for
money
she
she
says
it
was
for
money
stepan
trofimovitch
wailed
in
anguish
what
else
then
but
of
course
i
stood
up
for
you
thats
your
only
line
of
defence
you
know
she
sees
for
herself
that
you
needed
money
like
every
one
else
and
that
from
that
point
of
view
maybe
you
were
right
i
proved
to
her
as
clear
as
twice
two
makes
four
that
it
was
a
mutual
bargain
she
was
a
capitalist
and
you
were
a
sentimental
buffoon
in
her
service
shes
not
angry
about
the
money
though
you
have
milked
her
like
a
goat
shes
only
in
a
rage
at
having
believed
in
you
for
twenty
years
at
your
having
so
taken
her
in
over
these
noble
sentiments
and
made
her
tell
lies
for
so
long
she
never
will
admit
that
she
told
lies
of
herself
but
youll
catch
it
the
more
for
that
i
cant
make
out
how
it
was
you
didnt
see
that
youd
have
to
have
a
day
of
reckoning
for
after
all
you
had
some
sense
i
advised
her
yesterday
to
put
you
in
an
almshouse
a
genteel
one
dont
disturb
yourself
therell
be
nothing
humiliating
i
believe
thats
what
shell
do
do
you
remember
your
last
letter
to
me
three
weeks
ago
can
you
have
shown
her
that
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
leaping
up
in
horror
rather
first
thing
the
one
in
which
you
told
me
she
was
exploiting
you
envious
of
your
talent
oh
yes
and
that
about
other
mens
sins
you
have
got
a
conceit
though
my
boy
how
i
did
laugh
as
a
rule
your
letters
are
very
tedious
you
write
a
horrible
style
i
often
dont
read
them
at
all
and
ive
one
lying
about
to
this
day
unopened
ill
send
it
to
you
tomorrow
but
that
one
that
last
letter
of
yours
was
the
tiptop
of
perfection
how
i
did
laugh
oh
how
i
laughed
monster
monster
wailed
stepan
trofimovitch
foo
damn
it
all
theres
no
talking
to
you
i
say
youre
getting
huffy
again
as
you
were
last
thursday
stepan
trofimovitch
drew
himself
up
menacingly
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
in
such
language
what
language
its
simple
and
clear
tell
me
you
monster
are
you
my
son
or
not
you
know
that
best
to
be
sure
all
fathers
are
disposed
to
be
blind
in
such
cases
silence
silence
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
shaking
all
over
you
see
youre
screaming
and
swearing
at
me
as
you
did
last
thursday
you
tried
to
lift
your
stick
against
me
but
you
know
i
found
that
document
i
was
rummaging
all
the
evening
in
my
trunk
from
curiosity
its
true
theres
nothing
definite
you
can
take
that
comfort
its
only
a
letter
of
my
mothers
to
that
pole
but
to
judge
from
her
character
another
word
and
ill
box
your
ears
what
a
set
of
people
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
suddenly
addressing
himself
to
me
you
see
this
is
how
weve
been
ever
since
last
thursday
im
glad
youre
here
this
time
anyway
and
can
judge
between
us
to
begin
with
a
fact
he
reproaches
me
for
speaking
like
this
of
my
mother
but
didnt
he
egg
me
on
to
it
in
petersburg
before
i
left
the
high
school
didnt
he
wake
me
twice
in
the
night
to
embrace
me
and
cry
like
a
woman
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
talked
to
me
about
at
night
why
the
same
modest
anecdotes
about
my
mother
it
was
from
him
i
first
heard
them
oh
i
meant
that
in
a
higher
sense
oh
you
didnt
understand
me
you
understood
nothing
nothing
but
anyway
it
was
meaner
in
you
than
in
me
meaner
acknowledge
that
you
see
its
nothing
to
me
if
you
like
im
speaking
from
your
point
of
view
dont
worry
about
my
point
of
view
i
dont
blame
my
mother
if
its
you
then
its
you
if
its
a
pole
then
its
a
pole
its
all
the
same
to
me
im
not
to
blame
because
you
and
she
managed
so
stupidly
in
berlin
as
though
you
could
have
managed
things
better
arent
you
an
absurd
set
after
that
and
does
it
matter
to
you
whether
im
your
son
or
not
listen
he
went
on
turning
to
me
again
hes
never
spent
a
penny
on
me
all
his
life
till
i
was
sixteen
he
didnt
know
me
at
all
afterwards
he
robbed
me
here
and
now
he
cries
out
that
his
heart
has
been
aching
over
me
all
his
life
and
carries
on
before
me
like
an
actor
im
not
varvara
petrovna
mind
you
he
got
up
and
took
his
hat
i
curse
you
henceforth
stepan
trofimovitch
as
pale
as
death
stretched
out
his
hand
above
him
ach
what
folly
a
man
will
descend
to
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
actually
surprised
well
goodbye
old
fellow
i
shall
never
come
and
see
you
again
send
me
the
article
beforehand
dont
forget
and
try
and
let
it
be
free
from
nonsense
facts
facts
facts
and
above
all
let
it
be
short
goodbye
iii
outside
influences
too
had
come
into
play
in
the
matter
however
pyotr
stepanovitch
certainly
had
some
designs
on
his
parent
in
my
opinion
he
calculated
upon
reducing
the
old
man
to
despair
and
so
to
driving
him
to
some
open
scandal
of
a
certain
sort
this
was
to
serve
some
remote
and
quite
other
object
of
his
own
of
which
i
shall
speak
hereafter
all
sorts
of
plans
and
calculations
of
this
kind
were
swarming
in
masses
in
his
mind
at
that
time
and
almost
all
of
course
of
a
fantastic
character
he
had
designs
on
another
victim
besides
stepan
trofimovitch
in
fact
as
appeared
afterwards
his
victims
were
not
few
in
number
but
this
one
he
reckoned
upon
particularly
and
it
was
mr
von
lembke
himself
andrey
antonovitch
von
lembke
belonged
to
that
race
so
favoured
by
nature
which
is
reckoned
by
hundreds
of
thousands
at
the
russian
census
and
is
perhaps
unconscious
that
it
forms
throughout
its
whole
mass
a
strictly
organised
union
and
this
union
of
course
is
not
planned
and
premeditated
but
exists
spontaneously
in
the
whole
race
without
words
or
agreements
as
a
moral
obligation
consisting
in
mutual
support
given
by
all
members
of
the
race
to
one
another
at
all
times
and
places
and
under
all
circumstances
andrey
antonovitch
had
the
honour
of
being
educated
in
one
of
those
more
exalted
russian
educational
institutions
which
are
filled
with
the
youth
from
families
well
provided
with
wealth
or
connections
almost
immediately
on
finishing
their
studies
the
pupils
were
appointed
to
rather
important
posts
in
one
of
the
government
departments
andrey
antonovitch
had
one
uncle
a
colonel
of
engineers
and
another
a
baker
but
he
managed
to
get
into
this
aristocratic
school
and
met
many
of
his
fellowcountrymen
in
a
similar
position
he
was
a
goodhumoured
companion
was
rather
stupid
at
his
studies
but
always
popular
and
when
many
of
his
companions
in
the
upper
formschiefly
russianshad
already
learnt
to
discuss
the
loftiest
modern
questions
and
looked
as
though
they
were
only
waiting
to
leave
school
to
settle
the
affairs
of
the
universe
andrey
antonovitch
was
still
absorbed
in
the
most
innocent
schoolboy
interests
he
amused
them
all
it
is
true
by
his
pranks
which
were
of
a
very
simple
character
at
the
most
a
little
coarse
but
he
made
it
his
object
to
be
funny
at
one
time
he
would
blow
his
nose
in
a
wonderful
way
when
the
professor
addressed
a
question
to
him
thereby
making
his
schoolfellows
and
the
professor
laugh
another
time
in
the
dormitory
he
would
act
some
indecent
living
picture
to
the
general
applause
or
he
would
play
the
overture
to
fra
diavolo
with
his
nose
rather
skilfully
he
was
distinguished
too
by
intentional
untidiness
thinking
this
for
some
reason
witty
in
his
very
last
year
at
school
he
began
writing
russian
poetry
of
his
native
language
he
had
only
an
ungrammatical
knowledge
like
many
of
his
race
in
russia
this
turn
for
versifying
drew
him
to
a
gloomy
and
depressed
schoolfellow
the
son
of
a
poor
russian
general
who
was
considered
in
the
school
to
be
a
great
future
light
in
literature
the
latter
patronised
him
but
it
happened
that
three
years
after
leaving
school
this
melancholy
schoolfellow
who
had
flung
up
his
official
career
for
the
sake
of
russian
literature
and
was
consequently
going
about
in
torn
boots
with
his
teeth
chattering
with
cold
wearing
a
light
summer
overcoat
in
the
late
autumn
met
one
day
on
the
anitchin
bridge
his
former
protg
lembka
as
he
always
used
to
be
called
at
school
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
not
at
first
recognise
him
and
stood
still
in
surprise
before
him
stood
an
irreproachably
dressed
young
man
with
wonderfully
wellkept
whiskers
of
a
reddish
hue
with
pincenez
with
patentleather
boots
and
the
freshest
of
gloves
in
a
full
overcoat
from
sharmers
and
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
lembke
was
cordial
to
his
old
schoolfellow
gave
him
his
address
and
begged
him
to
come
and
see
him
some
evening
it
appeared
too
that
he
was
by
now
not
lembka
but
von
lembke
the
schoolfellow
came
to
see
him
however
simply
from
malice
perhaps
on
the
staircase
which
was
covered
with
red
felt
and
was
rather
ugly
and
by
no
means
smart
he
was
met
and
questioned
by
the
houseporter
a
bell
rang
loudly
upstairs
but
instead
of
the
wealth
which
the
visitor
expected
he
found
lembke
in
a
very
little
sideroom
which
had
a
dark
and
dilapidated
appearance
partitioned
into
two
by
a
large
dark
green
curtain
and
furnished
with
very
old
though
comfortable
furniture
with
dark
green
blinds
on
high
narrow
windows
von
lembke
lodged
in
the
house
of
a
very
distant
relation
a
general
who
was
his
patron
he
met
his
visitor
cordially
was
serious
and
exquisitely
polite
they
talked
of
literature
too
but
kept
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
a
manservant
in
a
white
tie
brought
them
some
weak
tea
and
little
dry
round
biscuits
the
schoolfellow
from
spite
asked
for
some
seltzer
water
it
was
given
him
but
after
some
delays
and
lembke
was
somewhat
embarrassed
at
having
to
summon
the
footman
a
second
time
and
give
him
orders
but
of
himself
he
asked
his
visitor
whether
he
would
like
some
supper
and
was
obviously
relieved
when
he
refused
and
went
away
in
short
lembke
was
making
his
career
and
was
living
in
dependence
on
his
fellowcountryman
the
influential
general
he
was
at
that
time
sighing
for
the
generals
fifth
daughter
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
feeling
was
reciprocated
but
amalia
was
none
the
less
married
in
due
time
to
an
elderly
factoryowner
a
german
and
an
old
comrade
of
the
generals
andrey
antonovitch
did
not
shed
many
tears
but
made
a
paper
theatre
the
curtain
drew
up
the
actors
came
in
and
gesticulated
with
their
arms
there
were
spectators
in
the
boxes
the
orchestra
moved
their
bows
across
their
fiddles
by
machinery
the
conductor
waved
his
baton
and
in
the
stalls
officers
and
dandies
clapped
their
hands
it
was
all
made
of
cardboard
it
was
all
thought
out
and
executed
by
lembke
himself
he
spent
six
months
over
this
theatre
the
general
arranged
a
friendly
party
on
purpose
the
theatre
was
exhibited
all
the
generals
five
daughters
including
the
newly
married
amalia
with
her
factoryowner
numerous
fraus
and
frauleins
with
their
men
folk
attentively
examined
and
admired
the
theatre
after
which
they
danced
lembke
was
much
gratified
and
was
quickly
consoled
the
years
passed
by
and
his
career
was
secured
he
always
obtained
good
posts
and
always
under
chiefs
of
his
own
race
and
he
worked
his
way
up
at
last
to
a
very
fine
position
for
a
man
of
his
age
he
had
for
a
long
time
been
wishing
to
marry
and
looking
about
him
carefully
without
the
knowledge
of
his
superiors
he
had
sent
a
novel
to
the
editor
of
a
magazine
but
it
had
not
been
accepted
on
the
other
hand
he
cut
out
a
complete
toy
railway
and
again
his
creation
was
most
successful
passengers
came
on
to
the
platform
with
bags
and
portmanteaux
with
dogs
and
children
and
got
into
the
carriages
the
guards
and
porters
moved
away
the
bell
was
rung
the
signal
was
given
and
the
train
started
off
he
was
a
whole
year
busy
over
this
clever
contrivance
but
he
had
to
get
married
all
the
same
the
circle
of
his
acquaintance
was
fairly
wide
chiefly
in
the
world
of
his
compatriots
but
his
duties
brought
him
into
russian
spheres
also
of
course
finally
when
he
was
in
his
thirtyninth
year
he
came
in
for
a
legacy
his
uncle
the
baker
died
and
left
him
thirteen
thousand
roubles
in
his
will
the
one
thing
needful
was
a
suitable
post
in
spite
of
the
rather
elevated
style
of
his
surroundings
in
the
service
mr
von
lembke
was
a
very
modest
man
he
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
some
independent
little
government
post
with
the
right
to
as
much
government
timber
as
he
liked
or
something
snug
of
that
sort
and
he
would
have
been
content
all
his
life
long
but
now
instead
of
the
minna
or
ernestine
he
had
expected
yulia
mihailovna
suddenly
appeared
on
the
scene
his
career
was
instantly
raised
to
a
more
elevated
plane
the
modest
and
precise
man
felt
that
he
too
was
capable
of
ambition
yulia
mihailovna
had
a
fortune
of
two
hundred
serfs
to
reckon
in
the
old
style
and
she
had
besides
powerful
friends
on
the
other
hand
lembke
was
handsome
and
she
was
already
over
forty
it
is
remarkable
that
he
fell
genuinely
in
love
with
her
by
degrees
as
he
became
more
used
to
being
betrothed
to
her
on
the
morning
of
his
wedding
day
he
sent
her
a
poem
she
liked
all
this
very
much
even
the
poem
its
no
joke
to
be
forty
he
was
very
quickly
raised
to
a
certain
grade
and
received
a
certain
order
of
distinction
and
then
was
appointed
governor
of
our
province
before
coming
to
us
yulia
mihailovna
worked
hard
at
moulding
her
husband
in
her
opinion
he
was
not
without
abilities
he
knew
how
to
make
an
entrance
and
to
appear
to
advantage
he
understood
how
to
listen
and
be
silent
with
profundity
had
acquired
a
quite
distinguished
deportment
could
make
a
speech
indeed
had
even
some
odds
and
ends
of
thought
and
had
caught
the
necessary
gloss
of
modern
liberalism
what
worried
her
however
was
that
he
was
not
very
open
to
new
ideas
and
after
the
long
everlasting
plodding
for
a
career
was
unmistakably
beginning
to
feel
the
need
of
repose
she
tried
to
infect
him
with
her
own
ambition
and
he
suddenly
began
making
a
toy
church
the
pastor
came
out
to
preach
the
sermon
the
congregation
listened
with
their
hands
before
them
one
lady
was
drying
her
tears
with
her
handkerchief
one
old
gentleman
was
blowing
his
nose
finally
the
organ
pealed
forth
it
had
been
ordered
from
switzerland
and
made
expressly
in
spite
of
all
expense
yulia
mihailovna
in
positive
alarm
carried
off
the
whole
structure
as
soon
as
she
knew
about
it
and
locked
it
up
in
a
box
in
her
own
room
to
make
up
for
it
she
allowed
him
to
write
a
novel
on
condition
of
its
being
kept
secret
from
that
time
she
began
to
reckon
only
upon
herself
unhappily
there
was
a
good
deal
of
shallowness
and
lack
of
judgment
in
her
attitude
destiny
had
kept
her
too
long
an
old
maid
now
one
idea
after
another
fluttered
through
her
ambitious
and
rather
overexcited
brain
she
cherished
designs
she
positively
desired
to
rule
the
province
dreamed
of
becoming
at
once
the
centre
of
a
circle
adopted
political
sympathies
von
lembke
was
actually
a
little
alarmed
though
with
his
official
tact
he
quickly
divined
that
he
had
no
need
at
all
to
be
uneasy
about
the
government
of
the
province
itself
the
first
two
or
three
months
passed
indeed
very
satisfactorily
but
now
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
turned
up
and
something
queer
began
to
happen
the
fact
was
that
young
verhovensky
from
the
first
step
had
displayed
a
flagrant
lack
of
respect
for
andrey
antonovitch
and
had
assumed
a
strange
right
to
dictate
to
him
while
yulia
mihailovna
who
had
always
till
then
been
so
jealous
of
her
husbands
dignity
absolutely
refused
to
notice
it
or
at
any
rate
attached
no
consequence
to
it
the
young
man
became
a
favourite
ate
drank
and
almost
slept
in
the
house
von
lembke
tried
to
defend
himself
called
him
young
man
before
other
people
and
slapped
him
patronisingly
on
the
shoulder
but
made
no
impression
pyotr
stepanovitch
always
seemed
to
be
laughing
in
his
face
even
when
he
appeared
on
the
surface
to
be
talking
seriously
to
him
and
he
would
say
the
most
startling
things
to
him
before
company
returning
home
one
day
he
found
the
young
man
had
installed
himself
in
his
study
and
was
asleep
on
the
sofa
there
uninvited
he
explained
that
he
had
come
in
and
finding
no
one
at
home
had
had
a
good
sleep
von
lembke
was
offended
and
again
complained
to
his
wife
laughing
at
his
irritability
she
observed
tartly
that
he
evidently
did
not
know
how
to
keep
up
his
own
dignity
and
that
with
her
anyway
the
boy
had
never
permitted
himself
any
undue
familiarity
he
was
nave
and
fresh
indeed
though
not
regardful
of
the
conventions
of
society
von
lembke
sulked
this
time
she
made
peace
between
them
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
apologise
but
got
out
of
it
with
a
coarse
jest
which
might
at
another
time
have
been
taken
for
a
fresh
offence
but
was
accepted
on
this
occasion
as
a
token
of
repentance
the
weak
spot
in
andrey
antonovitchs
position
was
that
he
had
blundered
in
the
first
instance
by
divulging
the
secret
of
his
novel
to
him
imagining
him
to
be
an
ardent
young
man
of
poetic
feeling
and
having
long
dreamed
of
securing
a
listener
he
had
during
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
on
one
occasion
read
aloud
two
chapters
to
him
the
young
man
had
listened
without
disguising
his
boredom
had
rudely
yawned
had
vouchsafed
no
word
of
praise
but
on
leaving
had
asked
for
the
manuscript
that
he
might
form
an
opinion
of
it
at
his
leisure
and
andrey
antonovitch
had
given
it
him
he
had
not
returned
the
manuscript
since
though
he
dropped
in
every
day
and
had
turned
off
all
inquiries
with
a
laugh
afterwards
he
declared
that
he
had
lost
it
in
the
street
at
the
time
yulia
mihailovna
was
terribly
angry
with
her
husband
when
she
heard
of
it
perhaps
you
told
him
about
the
church
too
she
burst
out
almost
in
dismay
von
lembke
unmistakably
began
to
brood
and
brooding
was
bad
for
him
and
had
been
forbidden
by
the
doctors
apart
from
the
fact
that
there
were
signs
of
trouble
in
the
province
of
which
we
will
speak
later
he
had
private
reasons
for
brooding
his
heart
was
wounded
not
merely
his
official
dignity
when
andrey
antonovitch
had
entered
upon
married
life
he
had
never
conceived
the
possibility
of
conjugal
strife
or
dissension
in
the
future
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
dreams
he
had
cherished
all
his
life
of
his
minna
or
ernestine
he
felt
that
he
was
unequal
to
enduring
domestic
storms
yulia
mihailovna
had
an
open
explanation
with
him
at
last
you
cant
be
angry
at
this
she
said
if
only
because
youve
still
as
much
sense
as
he
has
and
are
immeasurably
higher
in
the
social
scale
the
boy
still
preserves
many
traces
of
his
old
freethinking
habits
i
believe
its
simply
mischief
but
one
can
do
nothing
suddenly
in
a
hurry
you
must
do
things
by
degrees
we
must
make
much
of
our
young
people
i
treat
them
with
affection
and
hold
them
back
from
the
brink
but
he
says
such
dreadful
things
von
lembke
objected
i
cant
behave
tolerantly
when
he
maintains
in
my
presence
and
before
other
people
that
the
government
purposely
drenches
the
people
with
vodka
in
order
to
brutalise
them
and
so
keep
them
from
revolution
fancy
my
position
when
im
forced
to
listen
to
that
before
every
one
as
he
said
this
von
lembke
recalled
a
conversation
he
had
recently
had
with
pyotr
stepanovitch
with
the
innocent
object
of
displaying
his
liberal
tendencies
he
had
shown
him
his
own
private
collection
of
every
possible
kind
of
manifesto
russian
and
foreign
which
he
had
carefully
collected
since
the
year
1859
not
simply
from
a
love
of
collecting
but
from
a
laudable
interest
in
them
pyotr
stepanovitch
seeing
his
object
expressed
the
opinion
that
there
was
more
sense
in
one
line
of
some
manifestoes
than
in
a
whole
government
department
not
even
excluding
yours
maybe
lembke
winced
but
this
is
premature
among
us
premature
he
pronounced
almost
imploringly
pointing
to
the
manifestoes
no
its
not
premature
you
see
youre
afraid
so
its
not
premature
but
here
for
instance
is
an
incitement
to
destroy
churches
and
why
not
youre
a
sensible
man
and
of
course
you
dont
believe
in
it
yourself
but
you
know
perfectly
well
that
you
need
religion
to
brutalise
the
people
truth
is
honester
than
falsehood
i
agree
i
agree
i
quite
agree
with
you
but
it
is
premature
premature
in
this
country
said
von
lembke
frowning
and
how
can
you
be
an
official
of
the
government
after
that
when
you
agree
to
demolishing
churches
and
marching
on
petersburg
armed
with
staves
and
make
it
all
simply
a
question
of
date
lembke
was
greatly
put
out
at
being
so
crudely
caught
its
not
so
not
so
at
all
he
cried
carried
away
and
more
and
more
mortified
in
his
amourpropre
youre
young
and
know
nothing
of
our
aims
and
thats
why
youre
mistaken
you
see
my
dear
pyotr
stepanovitch
you
call
us
officials
of
the
government
dont
you
independent
officials
dont
you
but
let
me
ask
you
how
are
we
acting
ours
is
the
responsibility
but
in
the
long
run
we
serve
the
cause
of
progress
just
as
you
do
we
only
hold
together
what
you
are
unsettling
and
what
but
for
us
would
go
to
pieces
in
all
directions
we
are
not
your
enemies
not
a
bit
of
it
we
say
to
you
go
forward
progress
you
may
even
unsettle
things
that
is
things
that
are
antiquated
and
in
need
of
reform
but
we
will
keep
you
when
need
be
within
necessary
limits
and
so
save
you
from
yourselves
for
without
us
you
would
set
russia
tottering
robbing
her
of
all
external
decency
while
our
task
is
to
preserve
external
decency
understand
that
we
are
mutually
essential
to
one
another
in
england
the
whigs
and
tories
are
in
the
same
way
mutually
essential
to
one
another
well
youre
whigs
and
were
tories
thats
how
i
look
at
it
andrey
antonovitch
rose
to
positive
eloquence
he
had
been
fond
of
talking
in
a
liberal
and
intellectual
style
even
in
petersburg
and
the
great
thing
here
was
that
there
was
no
one
to
play
the
spy
on
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
silent
and
maintained
an
unusually
grave
air
this
excited
the
orator
more
than
ever
do
you
know
that
i
the
person
responsible
for
the
province
he
went
on
walking
about
the
study
do
you
know
i
have
so
many
duties
i
cant
perform
one
of
them
and
on
the
other
hand
i
can
say
just
as
truly
that
theres
nothing
for
me
to
do
here
the
whole
secret
of
it
is
that
everything
depends
upon
the
views
of
the
government
suppose
the
government
were
ever
to
found
a
republic
from
policy
or
to
pacify
public
excitement
and
at
the
same
time
to
increase
the
power
of
the
governors
then
we
governors
would
swallow
up
the
republic
and
not
the
republic
only
anything
you
like
well
swallow
up
i
at
least
feel
that
i
am
ready
in
one
word
if
the
government
dictates
to
me
by
telegram
activit
dvorante
ill
supply
activit
dvorante
ive
told
them
here
straight
in
their
faces
dear
sirs
to
maintain
the
equilibrium
and
to
develop
all
the
provincial
institutions
one
thing
is
essential
the
increase
of
the
power
of
the
governor
you
see
its
necessary
that
all
these
institutions
the
zemstvos
the
lawcourts
should
have
a
twofold
existence
that
is
on
the
one
hand
its
necessary
they
should
exist
i
agree
that
it
is
necessary
on
the
other
hand
its
necessary
that
they
shouldnt
its
all
according
to
the
views
of
the
government
if
the
mood
takes
them
so
that
institutions
seem
suddenly
necessary
i
shall
have
them
at
once
in
readiness
the
necessity
passes
and
no
one
will
find
them
under
my
rule
thats
what
i
understand
by
activit
dvorante
and
you
cant
have
it
without
an
increase
of
the
governors
power
were
talking
ttette
you
know
ive
already
laid
before
the
government
in
petersburg
the
necessity
of
a
special
sentinel
before
the
governors
house
im
awaiting
an
answer
you
ought
to
have
two
pyotr
stepanovitch
commented
why
two
said
von
lembke
stopping
short
before
him
ones
not
enough
to
create
respect
for
you
you
certainly
ought
to
have
two
andrey
antonovitch
made
a
wry
face
you
theres
no
limit
to
the
liberties
you
take
pyotr
stepanovitch
you
take
advantage
of
my
goodnature
you
say
cutting
things
and
play
the
part
of
a
bourru
bienfaisant
well
thats
as
you
please
muttered
pyotr
stepanovitch
anyway
you
pave
the
way
for
us
and
prepare
for
our
success
now
who
are
we
and
what
success
said
von
lembke
staring
at
him
in
surprise
but
he
got
no
answer
yulia
mihailovna
receiving
a
report
of
the
conversation
was
greatly
displeased
but
i
cant
exercise
my
official
authority
upon
your
favourite
andrey
antonovitch
protested
in
selfdefence
especially
when
were
ttette
i
may
say
too
much
in
the
goodness
of
my
heart
from
too
much
goodness
of
heart
i
didnt
know
youd
got
a
collection
of
manifestoes
be
so
good
as
to
show
them
to
me
but
he
asked
to
have
them
for
one
day
and
youve
let
him
have
them
again
cried
yulia
mihailovna
getting
angry
how
tactless
ill
send
someone
to
him
at
once
to
get
them
he
wont
give
them
up
ill
insist
on
it
cried
von
lembke
boiling
over
and
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
whos
he
that
we
should
be
so
afraid
of
him
and
who
am
i
that
i
shouldnt
dare
to
do
any
thing
sit
down
and
calm
yourself
said
yulia
mihailovna
checking
him
i
will
answer
your
first
question
he
came
to
me
with
the
highest
recommendations
hes
talented
and
sometimes
says
extremely
clever
things
karmazinov
tells
me
that
he
has
connections

his

while
theyre
being

the

they
may

of

its
an
idea
said
von

vaguely
defending
himself
but
but
here
ive
heard
that
manifestoes
of
some
sort
have
been
found
in
x
district
but
there
was
a
rumour
of
that
in
the
summermanifestoes
false

and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
they
havent
found
one
of
them
so
far
who
told
you
i
heard
it
from
von
blum
ah
dont
talk
to
me
of
your
blum
dont
ever
dare
mention
him
again
yulia
mihailovna
flew
into
a
rage
and
for
a
moment
could
not
speak
von
blum
was
a
clerk
in
the
governors
office
whom
she
particularly
hated
of
that
later
please
dont
worry
yourself
about
verhovensky
she
said
in
conclusion
if
he
had
taken
part
in
any
mischief
he
wouldnt
talk
as
he
does
to
you
and
every
one
else
here
talkers
are
not
dangerous
and
i
will
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
anything
were
to
happen
i
should
be
the
first
to
hear
of
it
through
him
hes
quite
fanatically
devoted
to
me
i
will
observe
anticipating
events
that
had
it
not
been
for
yulia
mihailovnas
obstinacy
and
selfconceit
probably
nothing
of
all
the
mischief
these
wretched
people
succeeded
in
bringing
about
amongst
us
would
have
happened
she
was

for
a
great
deal

v
on
the
eve
of
the
fete
i
the
date
of
the
fte
which
yulia
mihailovna
was
getting
up
for
the
benefit
of
the
governesses
of
our
province
had
been
several
times
fixed
and
put
off
she
had
invariably
bustling
round
her
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
a
little
clerk
lyamshin
who
used
at
one
time
to
visit
stepan
trofimovitch
and
had
suddenly
found
favour
in
the
governors
house
for
the
way
he
played
the
piano
and
now
was
of
use
running
errands
liputin
was
there
a
good
deal
too
and
yulia
mihailovna
destined
him
to
be
the
editor
of
a
new
independent
provincial
paper
there
were
also
several
ladies
married
and
single
and
lastly
even
karmazinov
who
though
he
could
not
be
said
to
bustle
announced
aloud
with
a
complacent
air
that
he
would
agreeably
astonish
every
one
when
the
literary
quadrille
began
an
extraordinary
multitude
of
donors
and
subscribers
had
turned
up
all
the
select
society
of
the
town
but
even
the
unselect
were
admitted
if
only
they
produced
the
cash
yulia
mihailovna
observed
that
sometimes
it
was
a
positive
duty
to
allow
the
mixing
of
classes
for
otherwise
who
is
to
enlighten
them
a
private
drawingroom
committee
was
formed
at
which
it
was
decided
that
the
fte
was
to
be
of
a
democratic
character
the
enormous
list
of
subscriptions
tempted
them
to
lavish
expenditure
they
wanted
to
do
something
on
a
marvellous
scalethats
why
it
was
put
off
they
were
still
undecided
where
the
ball
was
to
take
place
whether
in
the
immense
house
belonging
to
the
marshals
wife
which
she
was
willing
to
give
up
to
them
for
the
day
or
at
varvara
petrovnas
mansion
at
skvoreshniki
it
was
rather
a
distance
to
skvoreshniki
but
many
of
the
committee
were
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
freer
there
varvara
petrovna
would
dearly
have
liked
it
to
have
been
in
her
house
its
difficult
to
understand
why
this
proud
woman
seemed
almost
making
up
to
yulia
mihailovna
probably
what
pleased
her
was
that
the
latter
in
her
turn
seemed
almost
fawning
upon
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
and
was
more
gracious
to
him
than
to
anyone
i
repeat
again
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
always
in
continual
whispers
strengthening
in
the
governors
household
an
idea
he
had
insinuated
there
already
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
a
man
who
had
very
mysterious
connections
with
very
mysterious
circles
and
that
he
had
certainly
come
here
with
some
commission
from
them
people
here
seemed
in
a
strange
state
of
mind
at
the
time
among
the
ladies
especially
a
sort
of
frivolity
was
conspicuous
and
it
could
not
be
said
to
be
a
gradual
growth
certain
very
freeandeasy
notions
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
there
was
a
sort
of
dissipated
gaiety
and
levity
and
i
cant
say
it
was
always
quite
pleasant
a
lax
way
of
thinking
was
the
fashion
afterwards
when
it
was
all
over
people
blamed
yulia
mihailovna
her
circle
her
attitude
but
it
can
hardly
have
been
altogether
due
to
yulia
mihailovna
on
the
contrary
at
first
many
people
vied
with
one
another
in
praising
the
new
governors
wife
for
her
success
in
bringing
local
society
together
and
for
making
things
more
lively
several
scandalous
incidents
took
place
for
which
yulia
mihailovna
was
in
no
way
responsible
but
at
the
time
people
were
amused
and
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
there
was
no
one
to
check
them
a
rather
large
group
of
people
it
is
true
held
themselves
aloof
and
had
views
of
their
own
on
the
course
of
events
but
even
these
made
no
complaint
at
the
time
they
smiled
in
fact
i
remember
that
a
fairly
large
circle
came
into
existence
as
it
were
spontaneously
the
centre
of
which
perhaps
was
really
to
be
found
in
yulia
mihailovnas
drawingroom
in
this
intimate
circle
which
surrounded
her
among
the
younger
members
of
it
of
course
it
was
considered
admissible
to
play
all
sorts
of
pranks
sometimes
rather
freeandeasy
ones
and
in
fact
such
conduct
became
a
principle
among
them
in
this
circle
there
were
even
some
very
charming
ladies
the
young
people
arranged
picnics
and
even
parties
and
sometimes
went
about
the
town
in
a
regular
cavalcade
in
carriages
and
on
horseback
they
sought
out
adventures
even
got
them
up
themselves
simply
for
the
sake
of
having
an
amusing
story
to
tell
they
treated
our
town
as
though
it
were
a
sort
of
glupov
people
called
them
the
jeerers
or
sneerers
because
they
did
not
stick
at
anything
it
happened
for
instance
that
the
wife
of
a
local
lieutenant
a
little
brunette
very
young
though
she
looked
worn
out
from
her
husbands
illtreatment
at
an
evening
party
thoughtlessly
sat
down
to
play
whist
for
high
stakes
in
the
fervent
hope
of
winning
enough
to
buy
herself
a
mantle
and
instead
of
winning
lost
fifteen
roubles
being
afraid
of
her
husband
and
having
no
means
of
paying
she
plucked
up
the
courage
of
former
days
and
ventured
on
the
sly
to
ask
for
a
loan
on
the
spot
at
the
party
from
the
son
of
our
mayor
a
very
nasty
youth
precociously
vicious
the
latter
not
only
refused
it
but
went
laughing
aloud
to
tell
her
husband
the
lieutenant
who
certainly
was
poor
with
nothing
but
his
salary
took
his
wife
home
and
avenged
himself
upon
her
to
his
hearts
content
in
spite
of
her
shrieks
wails
and
entreaties
on
her
knees
for
forgiveness
this
revolting
story
excited
nothing
but
mirth
all
over
the
town
and
though
the
poor
wife
did
not
belong
to
yulia
mihailovnas
circle
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
cavalcade
an
eccentric
and
adventurous
character
who
happened
to
know
her
drove
round
and
simply
carried
her
off
to
her
own
house
here
she
was
at
once
taken
up
by
our
madcaps
made
much
of
loaded
with
presents
and
kept
for
four
days
without
being
sent
back
to
her
husband
she
stayed
at
the
adventurous
ladys
all
day
long
drove
about
with
her
and
all
the
sportive
company
in
expeditions
about
the
town
and
took
part
in
dances
and
merrymaking
they
kept
egging
her
on
to
haul
her
husband
before
the
court
and
to
make
a
scandal
they
declared
that
they
would
all
support
her
and
would
come
and
bear
witness
the
husband
kept
quiet
not
daring
to
oppose
them
the
poor
thing
realised
at
last
that
she
had
got
into
a
hopeless
position
and
more
dead
than
alive
with
fright
on
the
fourth
day
she
ran
off
in
the
dusk
from
her
protectors
to
her
lieutenant
its
not
definitely
known
what
took
place
between
husband
and
wife
but
two
shutters
of
the
lowpitched
little
house
in
which
the
lieutenant
lodged
were
not
opened
for
a
fortnight
yulia
mihailovna
was
angry
with
the
mischiefmakers
when
she
heard
about
it
all
and
was
greatly
displeased
with
the
conduct
of
the
adventurous
lady
though
the
latter
had
presented
the
lieutenants
wife
to
her
on
the
day
she
carried
her
off
however
this
was
soon
forgotten
another
time
a
petty
clerk
a
respectable
head
of
a
family
married
his
daughter
a
beautiful
girl
of
seventeen
known
to
every
one
in
the
town
to
another
petty
clerk
a
young
man
who
came
from
a
different
district
but
suddenly
it
was
learned
that
the
young
husband
had
treated
the
beauty
very
roughly
on
the
wedding
night
chastising
her
for
what
he
regarded
as
a
stain
on
his
honour
lyamshin
who
was
almost
a
witness
of
the
affair
because
he
got
drunk
at
the
wedding
and
so
stayed
the
night
as
soon
as
day
dawned
ran
round
with
the
diverting
intelligence
instantly
a
party
of
a
dozen
was
made
up
all
of
them
on
horseback
some
on
hired
cossack
horses
pyotr
stepanovitch
for
instance
and
liputin
who
in
spite
of
his
grey
hairs
took
part
in
almost
every
scandalous
adventure
of
our
reckless
youngsters
when
the
young
couple
appeared
in
the
street
in
a
droshky
with
a
pair
of
horses
to
make
the
calls
which
are
obligatory
in
our
town
on
the
day
after
a
wedding
in
spite
of
anything
that
may
happen
the
whole
cavalcade
with
merry
laughter
surrounded
the
droshky
and
followed
them
about
the
town
all
the
morning
they
did
not
its
true
go
into
the
house
but
waited
for
them
outside
on
horseback
they
refrained
from
marked
insult
to
the
bride
or
bridegroom
but
still
they
caused
a
scandal
the
whole
town
began
talking
of
it
every
one
laughed
of
course
but
at
this
von
lembke
was
angry
and
again
had
a
lively
scene
with
yulia
mihailovna
she
too
was
extremely
angry
and
formed
the
intention
of
turning
the
scapegraces
out
of
her
house
but
next
day
she
forgave
them
all
after
persuasions
from
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
some
words
from
karmazinov
who
considered
the
affair
rather
amusing
its
in
harmony
with
the
traditions
of
the
place
he
said
anyway
its
characteristic
and
bold
and
look
every
ones
laughing
youre
the
only
person
indignant
but
there
were
pranks
of
a
certain
character
that
were
absolutely
past
endurance
a
respectable
woman
of
the
artisan
class
who
went
about
selling
gospels
came
into
the
town
people
talked
about
her
because
some
interesting
references
to
these
gospel
women
had
just
appeared
in
the
petersburg
papers
again
the
same
buffoon
lyamshin
with
the
help
of
a
divinity
student
who
was
taking
a
holiday
while
waiting
for
a
post
in
the
school
succeeded
on
the
pretence
of
buying
books
from
the
gospel
woman
in
thrusting
into
her
bag
a
whole
bundle
of
indecent
and
obscene
photographs
from
abroad
sacrificed
expressly
for
the
purpose
as
we
learned
afterwards
by
a
highly
respectable
old
gentleman
i
will
omit
his
name
with
an
order
on
his
breast
who
to
use
his
own
words
loved
a
healthy
laugh
and
a
merry
jest
when
the
poor
woman
went
to
take
out
the
holy
books
in
the
bazaar
the
photographs
were
scattered
about
the
place
there
were
roars
of
laughter
and
murmurs
of
indignation
a
crowd
collected
began
abusing
her
and
would
have
come
to
blows
if
the
police
had
not
arrived
in
the
nick
of
time
the
gospel
woman
was
taken
to
the
lockup
and
only
in
the
evening
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
had
learned
with
indignation
the
secret
details
of
this
loathsome
affair
she
was
released
and
escorted
out
of
the
town
at
this
point
yulia
mihailovna
would
certainly
have
forbidden
lyamshin
her
house
but
that
very
evening
the
whole
circle
brought
him
to
her
with
the
intelligence
that
he
had
just
composed
a
new
piece
for
the
piano
and
persuaded
her
at
least
to
hear
it
the
piece
turned
out
to
be
really
amusing
and
bore
the
comic
title
of
the
francoprussian
war
it
began
with
the
menacing
strains
of
the
marseillaise
quun
sang
impur
abreuve
nos
sillons
there
is
heard
the
pompous
challenge
the
intoxication
of
future
victories
but
suddenly
mingling
with
the
masterly
variations
on
the
national
hymn
somewhere
from
some
corner
quite
close
on
one
side
come
the
vulgar
strains
of
mein
lieber
augustin
the
marseillaise
goes
on
unconscious
of
them
the
marseillaise
is
at
the
climax
of
its
intoxication
with
its
own
grandeur
but
augustin
gains
strength
augustin
grows
more
and
more
insolent
and
suddenly
the
melody
of
augustin
begins
to
blend
with
the
melody
of
the
marseillaise
the
latter
begins
as
it
were
to
get
angry
becoming
aware
of
augustin
at
last
she
tries
to
fling
him
off
to
brush
him
aside
like
a
tiresome
insignificant
fly
but
mein
lieber
augustin
holds
his
ground
firmly
he
is
cheerful
and
selfconfident
he
is
gleeful
and
impudent
and
the
marseillaise
seems
suddenly
to
become
terribly
stupid
she
can
no
longer
conceal
her
anger
and
mortification
it
is
a
wail
of
indignation
tears
and
curses
with
hands
outstretched
to
providence
pas
un
pouce
de
notre
terrain
pas
une
de
nos
forteresses
but
she
is
forced
to
sing
in
time
with
mein
lieber
augustin
her
melody
passes
in
a
sort
of
foolish
way
into
augustin
she
yields
and
dies
away
and
only
by
snatches
there
is
heard
again
quun
sang
impur
but
at
once
it
passes
very
offensively
into
the
vulgar
waltz
she
submits
altogether
it
is
jules
favre
sobbing
on
bismarcks
bosom
and
surrendering
every
thing
but
at
this
point
augustin
too
grows
fierce
hoarse
sounds
are
heard
there
is
a
suggestion
of
countless
gallons
of
beer
of
a
frenzy
of
selfglorification
demands
for
millions
for
fine
cigars
champagne
and
hostages
augustin
passes
into
a
wild
yell
the
francoprussian
war
is
over
our
circle
applauded
yulia
mihailovna
smiled
and
said
now
how
is
one
to
turn
him
out
peace
was
made
the
rascal
really
had
talent
stepan
trofimovitch
assured
me
on
one
occasion
that
the
very
highest
artistic
talents
may
exist
in
the
most
abominable
blackguards
and
that
the
one
thing
does
not
interfere
with
the
other
there
was
a
rumour
afterwards
that
lyamshin
had
stolen
this
burlesque
from
a
talented
and
modest
young
man
of
his
acquaintance
whose
name
remained
unknown
but
this
is
beside
the
mark
this
worthless
fellow
who
had
hung
about
stepan
trofimovitch
for
years
who
used
at
his
evening
parties
when
invited
to
mimic
jews
of
various
types
a
deaf
peasant
woman
making
her
confession
or
the
birth
of
a
child
now
at
yulia
mihailovnas
caricatured
stepan
trofimovitch
himself
in
a
killing
way
under
the
title
of
a
liberal
of
the
forties
everybody
shook
with
laughter
so
that
in
the
end
it
was
quite
impossible
to
turn
him
out
he
had
become
too
necessary
a
person
besides
he
fawned
upon
pyotr
stepanovitch
in
a
slavish
way
and
he
in
his
turn
had
obtained
by
this
time
a
strange
and
unaccountable
influence
over
yulia
mihailovna
i
wouldnt
have
talked
about
this
scoundrel
and
indeed
he
would
not
be
worth
dwelling
upon
but
there
was
another
revolting
story
so
people
declare
in
which
he
had
a
hand
and
this
story
i
cannot
omit
from
my
record
one
morning
the
news
of
a
hideous
and
revolting
sacrilege
was
all
over
the
town
at
the
entrance
to
our
immense
marketplace
there
stands
the
ancient
church
of
our
ladys
nativity
which
was
a
remarkable
antiquity
in
our
ancient
town
at
the
gates
of
the
precincts
there
is
a
large
ikon
of
the
mother
of
god
fixed
behind
a
grating
in
the
wall
and
behold
one
night
the
ikon
had
been
robbed
the
glass
of
the
case
was
broken
the
grating
was
smashed
and
several
stones
and
pearls
i
dont
know
whether
they
were
very
precious
ones
had
been
removed
from
the
crown
and
the
setting
but
what
was
worse
besides
the
theft
a
senseless
scoffing
sacrilege
had
been
perpetrated
behind
the
broken
glass
of
the
ikon
they
found
in
the
morning
so
it
was
said
a
live
mouse
now
four
months
since
it
has
been
established
beyond
doubt
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
the
convict
fedka
but
for
some
reason
it
is
added
that
lyamshin
took
part
in
it
at
the
time
no
one
spoke
of
lyamshin
or
had
any
suspicion
of
him
but
now
every
one
says
it
was
he
who
put
the
mouse
there
i
remember
all
our
responsible
officials
were
rather
staggered
a
crowd
thronged
round
the
scene
of
the
crime
from
early
morning
there
was
a
crowd
continually
before
it
not
a
very
huge
one
but
always
about
a
hundred
people
some
coming
and
some
going
as
they
approached
they
crossed
themselves
and
bowed
down
to
the
ikon
they
began
to
give
offerings
and
a
church
dish
made
its
appearance
and
with
the
dish
a
monk
but
it
was
only
about
three
oclock
in
the
afternoon
it
occurred
to
the
authorities
that
it
was
possible
to
prohibit
the
crowds
standing
about
and
to
command
them
when
they
had
prayed
bowed
down
and
left
their
offerings
to
pass
on
upon
von
lembke
this
unfortunate
incident
made
the
gloomiest
impression
as
i
was
told
yulia
mihailovna
said
afterwards
it
was
from
this
illomened
morning
that
she
first
noticed
in
her
husband
that
strange
depression
which
persisted
in
him
until
he
left
our
province
on
account
of
illness
two
months
ago
and
i
believe
haunts
him
still
in
switzerland
where
he
has
gone
for
a
rest
after
his
brief
career
amongst
us
i
remember
at
one
oclock
in
the
afternoon
i
crossed
the
marketplace
the
crowd
was
silent
and
their
faces
solemn
and
gloomy
a
merchant
fat
and
sallow
drove
up
got
out
of
his
carriage
made
a
bow
to
the
ground
kissed
the
ikon
offered
a
rouble
sighing
got
back
into
his
carriage
and
drove
off
another
carriage
drove
up
with
two
ladies
accompanied
by
two
of
our
scapegraces
the
young
people
one
of
whom
was
not
quite
young
got
out
of
their
carriage
too
and
squeezed
their
way
up
to
the
ikon
pushing
people
aside
rather
carelessly
neither
of
the
young
men
took
off
his
hat
and
one
of
them
put
a
pincenez
on
his
nose
in
the
crowd
there
was
a
murmur
vague
but
unfriendly
the
dandy
with
the
pincenez
took
out
of
his
purse
which
was
stuffed
full
of
banknotes
a
copper
farthing
and
flung
it
into
the
dish
both
laughed
and
talking
loudly
went
back
to
their
carriage
at
that
moment
lizaveta
nikolaevna
galloped
up
escorted
by
mavriky
nikolaevitch
she
jumped
off
her
horse
flung
the
reins
to
her
companion
who
at
her
bidding
remained
on
his
horse
and
approached
the
ikon
at
the
very
moment
when
the
farthing
had
been
flung
down
a
flush
of
indignation
suffused
her
cheeks
she
took
off
her
round
hat
and
her
gloves
fell
straight
on
her
knees
before
the
ikon
on
the
muddy
pavement
and
reverently
bowed
down
three
times
to
the
earth
then
she
took
out
her
purse
but
as
it
appeared
she
had
only
a
few
small
coins
in
it
she
instantly
took
off
her
diamond
earrings
and
put
them
in
the
dish
may
i
may
i
for
the
adornment
of
the
setting
she
asked
the
monk
it
is
permitted
replied
the
latter
every
gift
is
good
the
crowd
was
silent
expressing
neither
dissent
nor
approval
liza
got
on
her
horse
again
in
her
muddy
ridinghabit
and
galloped
away
ii
two
days
after
the
incident
i
have
described
i
met
her
in
a
numerous
company
who
were
driving
out
on
some
expedition
in
three
coaches
surrounded
by
others
on
horseback
she
beckoned
to
me
stopped
her
carriage
and
pressingly
urged
me
to
join
their
party
a
place
was
found
for
me
in
the
carriage
and
she
laughingly
introduced
me
to
her
companions
gorgeously
attired
ladies
and
explained
to
me
that
they
were
all
going
on
a
very
interesting
expedition
she
was
laughing
and
seemed
somewhat
excessively
happy
just
lately
she
had
been
very
lively
even
playful
in
fact
the
expedition
was
certainly
an
eccentric
one
they
were
all
going
to
a
house
the
other
side
of
the
river
to
the
merchant
sevastyanovs
in
the
lodge
of
this
merchants
house
our
saint
and
prophet
semyon
yakovlevitch
who
was
famous
not
only
amongst
us
but
in
the
surrounding
provinces
and
even
in
petersburg
and
moscow
had
been
living
for
the
last
ten
years
in
retirement
ease
and
comfort
every
one
went
to
see
him
especially
visitors
to
the
neighbourhood
extracting
from
him
some
crazy
utterance
bowing
down
to
him
and
leaving
an
offering
these
offerings
were
sometimes
considerable
and
if
semyon
yakovlevitch
did
not
himself
assign
them
to
some
other
purpose
were
piously
sent
to
some
church
or
more
often
to
the
monastery
of
our
lady
a
monk
from
the
monastery
was
always
in
waiting
upon
semyon
yakovlevitch
with
this
object
all
were
in
expectation
of
great
amusement
no
one
of
the
party
had
seen
semyon
yakovlevitch
before
except
lyamshin
who
declared
that
the
saint
had
given
orders
that
he
should
be
driven
out
with
a
broom
and
had
with
his
own
hand
flung
two
big
baked
potatoes
after
him
among
the
party
i
noticed
pyotr
stepanovitch
again
riding
a
hired
cossack
horse
on
which
he
sat
extremely
badly
and
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
also
on
horseback
the
latter
did
not
always
hold
aloof
from
social
diversions
and
on
such
occasions
always
wore
an
air
of
gaiety
although
as
always
he
spoke
little
and
seldom
when
our
party
had
crossed
the
bridge
and
reached
the
hotel
of
the
town
someone
suddenly
announced
that
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
hotel
they
had
just
found
a
traveller
who
had
shot
himself
and
were
expecting
the
police
at
once
the
suggestion
was
made
that
they
should
go
and
look
at
the
suicide
the
idea
met
with
approval
our
ladies
had
never
seen
a
suicide
i
remember
one
of
them
said
aloud
on
the
occasion
everythings
so
boring
one
cant
be
squeamish
over
ones
amusements
as
long
as
theyre
interesting
only
a
few
of
them
remained
outside
the
others
went
in
a
body
into
the
dirty
corridor
and
amongst
the
others
i
saw
to
my
amazement
lizaveta
nikolaevna
the
door
of
the
room
was
open
and
they
did
not
of
course
dare
to
prevent
our
going
in
to
look
at
the
suicide
he
was
quite
a
young
lad
not
more
than
nineteen
he
must
have
been
very
goodlooking
with
thick
fair
hair
with
a
regular
oval
face
and
a
fine
pure
forehead
the
body
was
already
stiff
and
his
white
young
face
looked
like
marble
on
the
table
lay
a
note
in
his
handwriting
to
the
effect
that
no
one
was
to
blame
for
his
death
that
he
had
killed
himself
because
he
had
squandered
four
hundred
roubles
the
word
squandered
was
used
in
the
letter
in
the
four
lines
of
his
letter
there
were
three
mistakes
in
spelling
a
stout
country
gentleman
evidently
a
neighbour
who
had
been
staying
in
the
hotel
on
some
business
of
his
own
was
particularly
distressed
about
it
from
his
words
it
appeared
that
the
boy
had
been
sent
by
his
family
that
is
a
widowed
mother
sisters
and
aunts
from
the
country
to
the
town
in
order
that
under
the
supervision
of
a
female
relation
in
the
town
he
might
purchase
and
take
home
with
him
various
articles
for
the
trousseau
of
his
eldest
sister
who
was
going
to
be
married
the
family
had
with
sighs
of
apprehension
entrusted
him
with
the
four
hundred
roubles
the
savings
of
ten
years
and
had
sent
him
on
his
way
with
exhortations
prayers
and
signs
of
the
cross
the
boy
had
till
then
been
wellbehaved
and
trustworthy
arriving
three
days
before
at
the
town
he
had
not
gone
to
his
relations
had
put
up
at
the
hotel
and
gone
straight
to
the
club
in
the
hope
of
finding
in
some
back
room
a
travelling
banker
or
at
least
some
game
of
cards
for
money
but
that
evening
there
was
no
banker
there
or
gambling
going
on
going
back
to
the
hotel
about
midnight
he
asked
for
champagne
havana
cigars
and
ordered
a
supper
of
six
or
seven
dishes
but
the
champagne
made
him
drunk
and
the
cigar
made
him
sick
so
that
he
did
not
touch
the
food
when
it
was
brought
to
him
and
went
to
bed
almost
unconscious
waking
next
morning
as
fresh
as
an
apple
he
went
at
once
to
the
gipsies
camp
which
was
in
a
suburb
beyond
the
river
and
of
which
he
had
heard
the
day
before
at
the
club
he
did
not
reappear
at
the
hotel
for
two
days
at
last
at
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
previous
day
he
had
returned
drunk
had
at
once
gone
to
bed
and
had
slept
till
ten
oclock
in
the
evening
on
waking
up
he
had
asked
for
a
cutlet
a
bottle
of
chateau
dyquem
and
some
grapes
paper
and
ink
and
his
bill
no
one
noticed
anything
special
about
him
he
was
quiet
gentle
and
friendly
he
must
have
shot
himself
at
about
midnight
though
it
was
strange
that
no
one
had
heard
the
shot
and
they
only
raised
the
alarm
at
midday
when
after
knocking
in
vain
they
had
broken
in
the
door
the
bottle
of
chateau
dyquem
was
half
empty
there
was
half
a
plateful
of
grapes
left
too
the
shot
had
been
fired
from
a
little
threechambered
revolver
straight
into
the
heart
very
little
blood
had
flowed
the
revolver
had
dropped
from
his
hand
on
to
the
carpet
the
boy
himself
was
half
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
there
was
no
trace
of
the
anguish
of
death
in
the
face
the
expression
was
serene
almost
happy
as
though
there
were
no
cares
in
his
life
all
our
party
stared
at
him
with
greedy
curiosity
in
every
misfortune
of
ones
neighbour
there
is
always
something
cheering
for
an
onlookerwhoever
he
may
be
our
ladies
gazed
in
silence
their
companions
distinguished
themselves
by
their
wit
and
their
superb
equanimity
one
observed
that
his
was
the
best
way
out
of
it
and
that
the
boy
could
not
have
hit
upon
anything
more
sensible
another
observed
that
he
had
had
a
good
time
if
only
for
a
moment
a
third
suddenly
blurted
out
the
inquiry
why
people
had
begun
hanging
and
shooting
themselves
among
us
of
late
as
though
they
had
suddenly
lost
their
roots
as
though
the
ground
were
giving
way
under
every
ones
feet
people
looked
coldly
at
this
raisonneur
then
lyamshin
who
prided
himself
on
playing
the
fool
took
a
bunch
of
grapes
from
the
plate
another
laughing
followed
his
example
and
a
third
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
chateau
dyquem
but
the
head
of
police
arriving
checked
him
and
even
ordered
that
the
room
should
be
cleared
as
every
one
had
seen
all
they
wanted
they
went
out
without
disputing
though
lyamshin
began
pestering
the
police
captain
about
something
the
general
merrymaking
laughter
and
playful
talk
were
twice
as
lively
on
the
latter
half
of
the
way
we
arrived
at
semyon
yakovlevitchs
just
at
one
oclock
the
gate
of
the
rather
large
house
stood
unfastened
and
the
approach
to
the
lodge
was
open
we
learnt
at
once
that
semyon
yakovlevitch
was
dining
but
was
receiving
guests
the
whole
crowd
of
us
went
in
the
room
in
which
the
saint
dined
and
received
visitors
had
three
windows
and
was
fairly
large
it
was
divided
into
two
equal
parts
by
a
wooden
latticework
partition
which
ran
from
wall
to
wall
and
was
three
or
four
feet
high
ordinary
visitors
remained
on
the
outside
of
this
partition
but
lucky
ones
were
by
the
saints
invitation
admitted
through
the
partition
doors
into
his
half
of
the
room
and
if
so
disposed
he
made
them
sit
down
on
the
sofa
or
on
his
old
leather
chairs
he
himself
invariably
sat
in
an
oldfashioned
shabby
voltaire
armchair
he
was
a
rather
big
bloatedlooking
yellowfaced
man
of
five
and
fifty
with
a
bald
head
and
scanty
flaxen
hair
he
wore
no
beard
his
right
cheek
was
swollen
and
his
mouth
seemed
somehow
twisted
awry
he
had
a
large
wart
on
the
left
side
of
his
nose
narrow
eyes
and
a
calm
stolid
sleepy
expression
he
was
dressed
in
european
style
in
a
black
coat
but
had
no
waistcoat
or
tie
a
rather
coarse
but
white
shirt
peeped
out
below
his
coat
there
was
something
the
matter
with
his
feet
i
believe
and
he
kept
them
in
slippers
ive
heard
that
he
had
at
one
time
been
a
clerk
and
received
a
rank
in
the
service
he
had
just
finished
some
fish
soup
and
was
beginning
his
second
dish
of
potatoes
in
their
skins
eaten
with
salt
he
never
ate
anything
else
but
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
tea
of
which
he
was
very
fond
three
servants
provided
by
the
merchant
were
running
to
and
fro
about
him
one
of
them
was
in
a
swallowtail
the
second
looked
like
a
workman
and
the
third
like
a
verger
there
was
also
a
very
lively
boy
of
sixteen
besides
the
servants
there
was
present
holding
a
jug
a
reverend
greyheaded
monk
who
was
a
little
too
fat
on
one
of
the
tables
a
huge
samovar
was
boiling
and
a
tray
with
almost
two
dozen
glasses
was
standing
near
it
on
another
table
opposite
offerings
had
been
placed
some
loaves
and
also
some
pounds
of
sugar
two
pounds
of
tea
a
pair
of
embroidered
slippers
a
foulard
handkerchief
a
length
of
cloth
a
piece
of
linen
and
so
on
money
offerings
almost
all
went
into
the
monks
jug
the
room
was
full
of
people
at
least
a
dozen
visitors
of
whom
two
were
sitting
with
semyon
yakovlevitch
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
one
was
a
greyheaded
old
pilgrim
of
the
peasant
class
and
the
other
a
little
driedup
monk
who
sat
demurely
with
his
eyes
cast
down
the
other
visitors
were
all
standing
on
the
near
side
of
the
partition
and
were
mostly
too
of
the
peasant
class
except
one
elderly
and
povertystricken
lady
one
landowner
and
a
stout
merchant
who
had
come
from
the
district
town
a
man
with
a
big
beard
dressed
in
the
russian
style
though
he
was
known
to
be
worth
a
hundred
thousand
all
were
waiting
for
their
chance
not
daring
to
speak
of
themselves
four
were
on
their
knees
but
the
one
who
attracted
most
attention
was
the
landowner
a
stout
man
of
fortyfive
kneeling
right
at
the
partition
more
conspicuous
than
any
one
waiting
reverently
for
a
propitious
word
or
look
from
semyon
yakovlevitch
he
had
been
there
for
about
an
hour
already
but
the
saint
still
did
not
notice
him
our
ladies
crowded
right
up
to
the
partition
whispering
gaily
and
laughingly
together
they
pushed
aside
or
got
in
front
of
all
the
other
visitors
even
those
on
their
knees
except
the
landowner
who
remained
obstinately
in
his
prominent
position
even
holding
on
to
the
partition
merry
and
greedily
inquisitive
eyes
were
turned
upon
semyon
yakovlevitch
as
well
as
lorgnettes
pincenez
and
even
operaglasses
lyamshin
at
any
rate
looked
through
an
operaglass
semyon
yakovlevitch
calmly
and
lazily
scanned
all
with
his
little
eyes
milovzors
milovzors
he
deigned
to
pronounce
in
a
hoarse
bass
and
slightly
staccato
all
our
party
laughed
whats
the
meaning
of
milovzors
but
semyon
yakovlevitch
relapsed
into
silence
and
finished
his
potatoes
presently
he
wiped
his
lips
with
his
napkin
and
they
handed
him
tea
as
a
rule
he
did
not
take
tea
alone
but
poured
out
some
for
his
visitors
but
by
no
means
for
all
usually
pointing
himself
to
those
he
wished
to
honour
and
his
choice
always
surprised
people
by
its
unexpectedness
passing
by
the
wealthy
and
the
highplaced
he
sometimes
pitched
upon
a
peasant
or
some
decrepit
old
woman
another
time
he
would
pass
over
the
beggars
to
honour
some
fat
wealthy
merchant
tea
was
served
differently
too
to
different
people
sugar
was
put
into
some
of
the
glasses
and
handed
separately
with
others
while
some
got
it
without
any
sugar
at
all
this
time
the
favoured
one
was
the
monk
sitting
by
him
who
had
sugar
put
in
and
the
old
pilgrim
to
whom
it
was
given
without
any
sugar
the
fat
monk
with
the
jug
from
the
monastery
for
some
reason
had
none
handed
to
him
at
all
though
up
till
then
he
had
had
his
glass
every
day
semyon
yakovlevitch
do
say
something
to
me
ive
been
longing
to
make
your
acquaintance
for
ever
so
long
carolled
the
gorgeously
dressed
lady
from
our
carriage
screwing
up
her
eyes
and
smiling
she
was
the
lady
who
had
observed
that
one
must
not
be
squeamish
about
ones
amusements
so
long
as
they
were
interesting
semyon
yakovlevitch
did
not
even
look
at
her
the
kneeling
landowner
uttered
a
deep
sonorous
sigh
like
the
sound
of
a
big
pair
of
bellows
with
sugar
in
it
said
semyon
yakovlevitch
suddenly
pointing
to
the
wealthy
merchant
the
latter
moved
forward
and
stood
beside
the
kneeling
gentleman
some
more
sugar
for
him
ordered
semyon
yakovlevitch
after
the
glass
had
already
been
poured
out
they
put
some
more
in
more
more
for
him
more
was
put
in
a
third
time
and
again
a
fourth
the
merchant
began
submissively
drinking
his
syrup
heavens
whispered
the
people
crossing
themselves
the
kneeling
gentleman
again
heaved
a
deep
sonorous
sigh
father
semyon
yakovlevitch
the
voice
of
the
poor
lady
rang
out
all
at
once
plaintively
though
so
sharply
that
it
was
startling
our
party
had
shoved
her
back
to
the
wall
a
whole
hour

yakovlevitch
pointed
to
a
sugarloaf
the
boy
skipped
up
seized
the
sugarloaf
and
dragged
it
to
the
widow

and

fourth
the
widow
was
surrounded
with
sugar
on
all
sides
the
monk
from
the
monastery

sort
of
a
prophecy

someone
in

crowd

semyon
yakovlevitch
persisted
there
was
a
whole
sugarloaf
still
on
the
table
but
the
saint
ordered
a
pound
to
be
given
and
they
gave
her
a
pound

this
emblem
to
mean
the
stout
monk
from
the
monastery
who
had
had
no
tea
given
to
him
said
softly
but
selfcomplacently
taking
upon
himself
the
rle
of
interpreter
in
an
access
of
wounded
vanity
what
are
you
saying
father
cried
the
widow
suddenly
infuriated
why
they
dragged
me
into
the
fire
with
a
rope
round
me
when
the
verhishins
house
was
burnt
and
they
locked
up
a
dead
cat
in
my
chest
they
are
ready
to
do
any
villainy
away
with
her
away
with
her
semyon
yakovlevitch
said
suddenly
waving
his
hands
the
verger
and
the
boy
dashed
through
the
partition
the
verger
took
the
widow
by
the
arm
and
without
resisting
she
trailed
to
the
door
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
loaves
of
sugar
that
had
been
bestowed
on
her
which
the
boy
dragged
after
her
one
to
be
taken
away
take
it
away
semyon
yakovlevitch
commanded
to
the
servant
like
a
workman
who
remained
with
him
the
latter
rushed
after
the
retreating
woman
and
the
three
servants
returned
somewhat
later
bringing
back
one
loaf
of
sugar
which
had
been
presented
to
the
widow
and
now
taken
away
from
her
she
carried
off
three
however
semyon
yakovlevitch
said
a
voice
at
the
door
i
dreamt
of
a
bird
a
jackdaw
it
flew
out
of
the
water
and
flew
into
the
fire
what
does
the
dream
mean
frost
semyon
yakovlevitch
pronounced
semyon
yakovlevitch
why
dont
you
answer
me
all
this
time
ive
been
interested
in
you
ever
so
long
the
lady
of
our
party
began
again
ask
him
said
semyon
yakovlevitch
not
heeding
her
but
pointing
to
the
kneeling
gentleman
the
monk
from
the
monastery
to
whom
the
order
was
given
moved
sedately
to
the
kneeling
figure
how
have
you
sinned
and
was
not
some
command
laid
upon
you
not
to
fight
not
to
give
the
rein
to
my
hands
answered
the
kneeling
gentleman
hoarsely
have
you
obeyed
asked
the
monk
i
cannot
obey
my
own
strength
gets
the
better
of
me
away
with
him
away
with
him
with
a
broom
with
a
broom
cried
semyon
yakovlevitch
waving
his
hands
the
gentleman
rushed
out
of
the
room
without
waiting
for
this
penalty
hes
left
a
gold
piece
where
he
knelt
observed
the
monk
picking
up
a
halfimperial
for
him
said
the
saint
pointing
to
the
rich
merchant
the
latter
dared
not
refuse
it
and
took
it
gold
to
gold
the
monk
from
the
monastery
could
not
refrain
from
saying
and
give
him
some
with
sugar
in
it
said
the
saint
pointing
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
the
servant
poured
out
the
tea
and
took
it
by
mistake
to
the
dandy
with
the
pincenez
the
long
one
the
long
one
semyon
yakovlevitch
corrected
him
mavriky
nikolaevitch
took
the
glass
made
a
military
halfbow
and
began
drinking
it
i
dont
know
why
but
all
our
party
burst
into
peals
of
laughter
mavriky
nikolaevitch
cried
liza
addressing
him
suddenly
that
kneeling
gentleman
has
gone
away
you
kneel
down
in
his
place
mavriky
nikolaevitch
looked
at
her
in
amazement
i
beg
you
to
youll
do
me
the
greatest
favour
listen
mavriky
nikolaevitch
she
went
on
speaking
in
an
emphatic
obstinate
excited
and
rapid
voice
you
must
kneel
down
i
must
see
you
kneel
down
if
you
wont
dont
come
near
me
i
insist
i
insist
i
dont
know
what
she
meant
by
it
but
she
insisted
upon
it
relentlessly
as
though
she
were
in
a
fit
mavriky
nikolaevitch
as
we
shall
see
later
set
down
these
capricious
impulses
which
had
been
particularly
frequent
of
late
to
outbreaks
of
blind
hatred
for
him
not
due
to
spite
for
on
the
contrary
she
esteemed
him
loved
him
and
respected
him
and
he
knew
that
himselfbut
from
a
peculiar
unconscious
hatred
which
at
times
she
could
not
control
in
silence
he
gave
his
cup
to
an
old
woman
standing
behind
him
opened
the
door
of
the
partition
and
without
being
invited
stepped
into
semyon
yakovlevitchs
private
apartment
and
knelt
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
sight
of
all
i
imagine
that
he
was
deeply
shocked
in
his
candid
and
delicate
heart
by
lizas
coarse
and
mocking
freak
before
the
whole
company
perhaps
he
imagined
that
she
would
feel
ashamed
of
herself
seeing
his
humiliation
on
which
she
had
so
insisted
of
course
no
one
but
he
would
have
dreamt
of
bringing
a
woman
to
reason
by
so
nave
and
risky
a
proceeding
he
remained
kneeling
with
his
imperturbable
gravitylong
tall
awkward
and
ridiculous
but
our
party
did
not
laugh
the
unexpectedness
of
the
action
produced
a
painful
shock
every
one
looked
at
liza
anoint
anoint
muttered
semyon
yakovlevitch
liza
suddenly
turned
white
cried
out
and
rushed
through
the
partition
then
a
rapid
and
hysterical
scene
followed
she
began
pulling
mavriky
nikolaevitch
up
with
all
her
might
tugging
at
his
elbows
with
both
hands
get
up
get
up
she
screamed
as
though
she
were
crazy
get
up
at
once
at
once
how
dare
you
mavriky
nikolaevitch
got
up
from
his
knees
she
clutched
his
arms
above
the
elbow
and
looked
intently
into
his
face
there
was
terror
in
her
expression
milovzors
milovzors
semyon
yakovlevitch
repeated
again
she
dragged
mavriky
nikolaevitch
back
to
the
other
part
of
the
room
at
last
there
was
some
commotion
in
all
our
company
the
lady
from
our
carriage
probably
intending
to
relieve
the
situation
loudly
and
shrilly
asked
the
saint
for
the
third
time
with
an
affected
smile
well
semyon
yakovlevitch
wont
you
utter
some
saying
for
me
ive
been
reckoning
so
much
on
you
out
with
the

out
with
the

said
semyon
yakovlevitch
suddenly
addressing
her
with
an
extremely
indecent
word
the
words
were
uttered
savagely
and
with
horrifying
distinctness
our
ladies
shrieked
and
rushed
headlong
away
while
the
gentlemen
escorting
them
burst
into
homeric
laughter
so
ended
our
visit
to
semyon
yakovlevitch
at
this
point
however
there
took
place
i
am
told
an
extremely
enigmatic
incident
and
i
must
own
it
was
chiefly
on
account
of
it
that
i
have
described
this
expedition
so
minutely
i
am
told
that
when
all
flocked
out
liza
supported
by
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
jostled
against
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
in
the
crush
in
the
doorway
i
must
mention
that
since
that
sunday
morning
when
she
fainted
they
had
not
approached
each
other
nor
exchanged
a
word
though
they
had
met
more
than
once
i
saw
them
brought
together
in
the
doorway
i
fancied
they
both
stood
still
for
an
instant
and
looked
as
it
were
strangely
at
one
another
but
i
may
not
have
seen
rightly
in
the
crowd
it
is
asserted
on
the
contrary
and
quite
seriously
that
liza
glancing
at
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
quickly
raised
her
hand
to
the
level
of
his
face
and
would
certainly
have
struck
him
if
he
had
not
drawn
back
in
time
perhaps
she
was
displeased
with
the
expression
of
his
face
or
the
way
he
smiled
particularly
just
after
such
an
episode
with
mavriky
nikolaevitch
i
must
admit
i
saw
nothing
myself
but
all
the
others
declared
they
had
though
they
certainly
could
not
all
have
seen
it
in
such
a
crush
though
perhaps
some
may
have
but
i
did
not
believe
it
at
the
time
i
remember
however
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
rather
pale
all
the
way
home
iii
almost
at
the
same
time
and
certainly
on
the
same
day
the
interview
at
last
took
place
between
stepan
trofimovitch
and
varvara
petrovna
she
had
long
had
this
meeting
in
her
mind
and
had
sent
word
about
it
to
her
former
friend
but
for
some
reason
she
had
kept
putting
it
off
till
then
it
took
place
at
skvoreshniki
varvara
petrovna
arrived
at
her
country
house
all
in
a
bustle
it
had
been
definitely
decided
the
evening
before
that
the
fte
was
to
take
place
at
the
marshals
but
varvara
petrovnas
rapid
brain
at
once
grasped
that
no
one
could
prevent
her
from
afterwards
giving
her
own
special
entertainment
at
skvoreshniki
and
again
assembling
the
whole
town
then
every
one
could
see
for
themselves
whose
house
was
best
and
in
which
more
taste
was
displayed
in
receiving
guests
and
giving
a
ball
altogether
she
was
hardly
to
be
recognised
she
seemed
completely
transformed
and
instead
of
the
unapproachable
noble
lady
stepan
trofimovitchs
expression
seemed
changed
into
the
most
commonplace
whimsical
society
woman
but
perhaps
this
may
only
have
been
on
the
surface
when
she
reached
the
empty
house
she
had
gone
through
all
the
rooms
accompanied
by
her
faithful
old
butler
alexey
yegorytch
and
by
fomushka
a
man
who
had
seen
much
of
life
and
was
a
specialist
in
decoration
they
began
to
consult
and
deliberate
what
furniture
was
to
be
brought
from
the
town
house
what
things
what
pictures
where
they
were
to
be
put
how
the
conservatories
and
flowers
could
be
put
to
the
best
use
where
to
put
new
curtains
where
to
have
the
refreshment
rooms
whether
one
or
two
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
behold
in
the
midst
of
this
exciting
bustle
she
suddenly
took
it
into
her
head
to
send
for
stepan
trofimovitch
the
latter
had
long
before
received
notice
of
this
interview
and
was
prepared
for
it
and
he
had
every
day
been
expecting
just
such
a
sudden
summons
as
he
got
into
the
carriage
he
crossed
himself
his
fate
was
being
decided
he
found
his
friend
in
the
big
drawingroom
on
the
little
sofa
in
the
recess
before
a
little
marble
table
with
a
pencil
and
paper
in
her
hands
fomushka
with
a
yard
measure
was
measuring
the
height
of
the
galleries
and
the
windows
while
varvara
petrovna
herself
was
writing
down
the
numbers
and
making
notes
on
the
margin
she
nodded
in
stepan
trofimovitchs
direction
without
breaking
off
from
what
she
was
doing
and
when
the
latter
muttered
some
sort
of
greeting
she
hurriedly
gave
him
her
hand
and
without
looking
at
him
motioned
him
to
a
seat
beside
her
i
sat
waiting
for
five
minutes
mastering
my
heart
he
told
me
afterwards
i
saw
before
me
not
the
woman
whom
i
had
known
for
twenty
years
an
absolute
conviction
that
all
was
over
gave
me
a
strength
which
astounded
even
her
i
swear
that
she
was
surprised
at
my
stoicism
in
that
last
hour
varvara
petrovna
suddenly
put
down
her
pencil
on
the
table
and
turned
quickly
to
stepan
trofimovitch
stepan
trofimovitch
we
have
to
talk
of
business
im
sure
you
have
prepared
all
your
fervent
words
and
various
phrases
but
wed
better
go
straight
to
the
point
hadnt
we
she
had
been
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
show
the
tone
she
meant
to
take
and
what
might
not
come
next
wait
be
quiet
let
me
speak
afterwards
you
shall
though
really
i
dont
know
what
you
can
answer
me
she
said
in
a
rapid
patter
the
twelve
hundred
roubles
of
your
pension
i
consider
a
sacred
obligation
to
pay
you
as
long
as
you
live
though
why
a
sacred
obligation
simply
a
contract
that
would
be
a
great
deal
more
real
wouldnt
it
if
you
like
well
write
it
out
special
arrangements
have
been
made
in
case
of
my
death
but
you
are
receiving
from
me
at
present
lodging
servants
and
your
maintenance
in
addition
reckoning
that
in
money
it
would
amount
to
fifteen
hundred
roubles
wouldnt
it
i
will
add
another
three
hundred
roubles
making
three
thousand
roubles
in
all
will
that
be
enough
a
year
for
you
i
think
thats
not
too
little
in
any
extreme
emergency
i
would
add
something
more
and
so
take
your
money
send
me
back
my
servants
and
live
by
yourself
where
you
like
in
petersburg
in
moscow
abroad
or
here
only
not
with
me
do
you
hear
only
lately
those
lips
dictated
to
me
as
imperatively
and
as
suddenly
very
different
demands
said
stepan
trofimovitch
slowly
and
with
sorrowful
distinctness
i
submitted
and
danced
the
cossack
dance

you
are
horribly
longwinded
you
didnt
dance
but
came
to
see
me
in
a
new
tie
new
linen
gloves
scented
and
pomatumed
i
assure
you
that
you
were
very
anxious
to
get
married
yourself
it
was
written
on
your
face
and
i
assure
you
a
most
unseemly
expression
it
was
if
i
did
not
mention
it
to
you
at
the
time
it
was
simply
out
of
delicacy
but
you
wished
it
you
wanted
to
be
married
in
spite
of
the
abominable
things
you
wrote
about
me
and
your
betrothed
now
its
very
different
and
what
has
the
cosaque
du
don
to
do
with
it
and
what
tomb
do
you
mean
i
dont
understand
the
comparison
on
the
contrary
you
have
only
to
live
live
as
long
as
you
can
i
shall
be
delighted
in
an
almshouse
in
an
almshouse
people
dont
go
into
almshouses
with
three
thousand
roubles

year
ah
i
remember
she
laughed
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
joke
about
an
almshouse
once
bah
there
certainly
is
a
special
almshouse
which
is
worth
considering
its
for
persons
who
are
highly
respectable
there
are
colonels
there
and
theres
positively
one
general
who
wants
to
get
into
it
if
you
went
into
it
with
all
your
money
you
would
find
peace
comfort
servants
to
wait
on
you
there
you
could
occupy
yourself
with
study
and
could
always
make
up
a
party
for
cards

varvara
petrovna
winced
but
if
so
thats
all
youve
been
informed
that
we
shall
live
henceforward
entirely
apart
and
thats
all
he
said
all
thats
left
of
twenty
years
our
last
farewell
youre
awfully
fond
of
these
exclamations
stepan
trofimovitch
its
not
at
all
the
fashion
nowadays
people
talk
roughly
but
simply
you
keep
harping
on
our
twenty
years
twenty
years
of
mutual
vanity
and
nothing
more
every
letter
youve
written
me
was
written
not
for
me
but
for
posterity
youre
a
stylist
and
not
a
friend
and
friendship
is
only
a
splendid
word
in
realitya
mutual
exchange
of
sloppiness
good
heavens
how
many
sayings
not
your
own
lessons
learned
by
heart
theyve
already
put
their
uniform
on
you
too
you
too
are
rejoicing
you
too
are
basking
in
the
sunshine
chre
chre
for
what
a
mess
of
pottage
you
have
sold
them
your
freedom
im
not
a
parrot
to
repeat
other
peoples
phrases
cried
varvara
petrovna
boiling
over
you
may
be
sure
i
have
stored
up
many
sayings
of
my
own
what
have
you
been
doing
for
me
all
these
twenty
years
you
refused
me
even
the
books
i
ordered
for
you
though
except
for
the
binder
they
would
have
remained
uncut
what
did
you
give
me
to
read
when
i
asked
you
during
those
first
years
to
be
my
guide
always
kapfig
and
nothing
but
kapfig
you
were
jealous
of
my
culture
even
and
took
measures
and
all
the
while
every
ones
laughing
at
you
i
must
confess
i
always
considered
you
only
as
a
critic
you
are
a
literary
critic
and
nothing
more
when
on
the
way
to
petersburg
i
told
you
that
i
meant
to
found
a
journal
and
to
devote
my
whole
life
to
it
you
looked
at
me
ironically
at
once
and
suddenly
became
horribly
supercilious
that
was
not
that
not
that
we
were
afraid
then
of
persecution
it
was
just
that
and
you
couldnt
have
been
afraid
of
persecution
in
petersburg
at
that
time
do
you
remember
that
in
february
too
when
the
news
of
the
emancipation
came
you
ran
to
me
in
a
panic
and
demanded
that
i
should
at
once
give
you
a
written
statement
that
the
proposed
magazine
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
that
the
young
people
had
been
coming
to
see
me
and
not
you
that
you
were
only
a
tutor
who
lived
in
the
house
only
because
he
had
not
yet
received
his
salary
isnt
that
so
do
remember
that
you
have
distinguished
yourself
all
your
life
stepan
trofimovitch
that
was
only
a
moment
of
weakness
a
moment
when
we
were
alone
he
exclaimed
mournfully
but
is
it
possible
is
it
possible
to
break
off
everything
for
the
sake
of
such
petty
impressions
can
it
be
that
nothing
more
has
been
left
between
us
after
those
long
years
you
are
horribly
calculating
you
keep
trying
to
leave
me
in
your
debt
when
you
came
back
from
abroad
you
looked
down
upon
me
and
wouldnt
let
me
utter
a
word
but
when
i
came
back
myself
and
talked
to
you
afterwards
of
my
impressions
of
the
madonna
you
wouldnt
hear
me
you
began
smiling
condescendingly
into
your
cravat
as
though
i
were
incapable
of
the
same
feelings
as
you
it
was
not
so
it
was
probably
not
so
jai
oubli
no
it
was
so
she
answered
and
whats
more
youve
nothing
to
pride
yourself
on
thats
all
nonsense
and
one
of
your
fancies
now
theres
no
one
absolutely
no
one
in
ecstasies
over
the
madonna
no
one
wastes
time
over
it
except
old
men
who
are
hopelessly
out
of
date
thats
established
established
is
it
its
of
no
use
whatever
this
jugs
of
use
because
one
can
pour
water
into
it
this
pencils
of
use
because
you
can
write
anything
with
it
but
that
womans
face
is
inferior
to
any
face
in
nature
try
drawing
an
apple
and
put
a
real
apple
beside
it
which
would
you
take
you
wouldnt
make
a
mistake
im
sure
this
is
what
all
our
theories
amount
to
now
that
the
first
light
of
free
investigation
has
dawned
upon
them
indeed
indeed
you
laugh
ironically
and
what
used
you
to
say
to
me
about
charity
yet
the
enjoyment
derived
from
charity
is
a
haughty
and
immoral
enjoyment
the
rich
mans
enjoyment
in
his
wealth
his
power
and
in
the
comparison
of
his
importance
with
the
poor
charity
corrupts
giver
and
taker
alike
and
whats
more
does
not
attain
its
object
as
it
only
increases
poverty
fathers
who
dont
want
to
work
crowd
round
the
charitable
like
gamblers
round
the
gamblingtable
hoping
for
gain
while
the
pitiful
farthings
that
are
flung
them
are
a
hundred
times
too
little
have
you
given
away
much
in
your
life
less
than
a
rouble
if
you
try
and
think
try
to
remember
when
last
you
gave
away
anything
itll
be
two
years
ago
maybe
four
you
make
an
outcry
and
only
hinder
things
charity
ought
to
be
forbidden
by
law
even
in
the
present
state
of
society
in
the
new
regime
there
will
be
no
poor
at
all
oh
what
an
eruption
of
borrowed
phrases
so
its
come
to
the
new
regime
already
unhappy
woman
god
help
you
yes
it
has
stepan
trofimovitch
you
carefully
concealed
all
these
new
ideas
from
me
though
every
ones
familiar
with
them
nowadays
and
you
did
it
simply
out
of
jealousy
so
as
to
have
power
over
me
so
that
now
even
that
yulia
is
a
hundred
miles
ahead
of
me
but
now
my
eyes
have
been
opened
i
have
defended
you
stepan
trofimovitch
all
i
could
but
there
is
no
one
who
does
not
blame
you
enough
said
he
getting
up
from
his
seat
enough
and
what
can
i
wish
you
now
unless
its
repentance
sit
still
a
minute
stepan
trofimovitch
i
have
another
question
to
ask
you
youve
been
told
of
the
invitation
to
read
at
the
literary
matine
it
was
arranged
through
me
tell
me
what
youre
going
to
read
why
about
that
very
queen
of
queens
that
ideal
of
humanity
the
sistine
madonna
who
to
your
thinking
is
inferior
to
a
glass
or
a
pencil
so
youre
not
taking
something
historical
said
varvara
petrovna
in
mournful
surprise
but
they
wont
listen
to
you
youve
got
that
madonna
on
your
brain
you
seem
bent
on
putting
every
one
to
sleep
let
me
assure
you
stepan
trofimovitch
i
am
speaking
entirely
in
your
own
interest
it
would
be
a
different
matter
if
you
would
take
some
short
but
interesting
story
of
medival
court
life
from
spanish
history
or
better
still
some
anecdote
and
pad
it
out
with
other
anecdotes
and
witty
phrases
of
your
own
there
were
magnificent
courts
then
ladies
you
know
poisonings
karmazinov
says
it
would
be
strange
if
you
couldnt
read
something
interesting
from
spanish
history
karmazinovthat
fool
who
has
written
himself
outlooking
for
a
subject
for
me
karmazinov
that
almost
imperial
intellect
you
are
too
free
in
your
language
stepan
trofimovitch
your
karmazinov
is
a
spiteful
old
woman
whose
day
is
over
chre
chre
how
long
have
you
been
so
enslaved
by
them
oh
god
i
cant
endure
him
even
now
for
the
airs
he
gives
himself
but
i
do
justice
to
his
intellect
i
repeat
i
have
done
my
best
to
defend
you
as
far
as
i
could
and
why
do
you
insist
on
being
absurd
and
tedious
on
the
contrary
come
on
to
the
platform
with
a
dignified
smile
as
the
representative
of
the
last
generation
and
tell
them
two
or
three
anecdotes
in
your
witty
way
as
only
you
can
tell
things
sometimes
though
you
may
be
an
old
man
now
though
you
may
belong
to
a
past
age
though
you
may
have
dropped
behind
them
in
fact
yet
youll
recognise
it
yourself
with
a
smile
in
your
preface
and
all
will
see
that
youre
an
amiable
goodnatured
witty
relic
in
brief
a
man
of
the
old
savour
and
so
far
advanced
as
to
be
capable
of
appreciating
at
their
value
all
the
absurdities
of
certain
ideas
which
you
have
hitherto
followed
come
as
a
favour
to
me
i
beg
you
chre
enough
dont
ask
me
i
cant
i
shall
speak
of
the
madonna
but
i
shall
raise
a
storm
that
will
either
crush
them
all
or
shatter
me
alone
it
will
certainly
be
you
alone
stepan
trofimovitch
such
is
my
fate
i
will
speak
of
the
contemptible
slave
of
the
stinking
depraved
flunkey
who
will
first
climb
a
ladder
with
scissors
in
his
hands
and
slash
to
pieces
the
divine
image
of
the
great
ideal
in
the
name
of
equality
envy
and
digestion
let
my
curse
thunder
out
upon
them
and
thenthen
the
madhouse
perhaps
but
in
any
case
whether
i
shall
be
left
vanquished
or
victorious
that
very
evening
i
shall
take
my
bag
my
beggars
bag
i
shall
leave
all
my
goods
and
chattels
all
your
presents
all
your
pensions
and
promises
of
future
benefits
and
go
forth
on
foot
to
end
my
life
a
tutor
in
a
merchants
family
or
to
die
somewhere
of
hunger
in
a
ditch
i
have
said
it
alea
jacta
est
he
got
up
again
ive
been
convinced
for
years
said
varvara
petrovna
getting
up
with
flashing
eyes
that
your
only
object
in
life
is
to
put
me
and
my
house
to
shame
by
your
calumnies
what
do
you
mean
by
being
a
tutor
in
a
merchants
family
or
dying
in
a
ditch
its
spite
calumny
and
nothing
more
you
have
always
despised
me
but
i
will
end
like
a
knight
faithful
to
my
lady
your
good
opinion
has
always
been
dearer
to
me
than
anything
from
this
moment
i
will
take
nothing
but
will
worship
you
disinterestedly
how
stupid
that
is
you
have
never
respected
me
i
may
have
had
a
mass
of
weaknesses
yes
i
have
sponged
on
you
i
speak
the
language
of
nihilism
but
sponging
has
never
been
the
guiding
motive
of
my
action
it
has
happened
so
of
itself
i
dont
know
how
i
always
imagined
there
was
something
higher
than
meat
and
drink
between
us
andive
never
never
been
a
scoundrel
and
so
to
take
the
open
road
to
set
things
right
i
set
off
late
late
autumn
out
of
doors
the
mist
lies
over
the
fields
the
hoarfrost
of
old
age
covers
the
road
before
me
and
the
wind
howls
about
the
approaching
grave
but
so
forward
forward
on
my
new
way
filled
with
purest
love
and

pyotr

is
busy
i
the
date
of
the
fte
was
definitely
fixed
and
von
lembke
became
more
and
more
depressed
he
was
full
of
strange
and
sinister
forebodings
and
this
made
yulia
mihailovna
seriously
uneasy
indeed
things
were
not
altogether
satisfactory
our
mild
governor
had
left
the
affairs
of
the
province
a
little
out
of
gear
at
the
moment
we
were
threatened
with
cholera
serious
outbreaks
of
cattle
plague
had
appeared
in
several
places
fires
were
prevalent
that
summer
in
towns
and
villages
whilst
among
the
peasantry
foolish
rumours
of
incendiarism
grew
stronger
and
stronger
cases
of
robbery
were
twice
as
numerous
as
usual
but
all
this
of
course
would
have
been
perfectly
ordinary
had
there
been
no
other
and
more
weighty
reasons
to
disturb
the
equanimity
of
andrey
antonovitch
who
had
till
then
been
in
good
spirits
what
struck
yulia
mihailovna
most
of
all
was
that
he
became
more
silent
and
strange
to
say
more
secretive
every
day
yet
it
was
hard
to
imagine
what
he
had
to
hide
it
is
true
that
he
rarely
opposed
her
and
as
a
rule
followed
her
lead
without
question
at
her
instigation
for
instance
two
or
three
regulations
of
a
risky
and
hardly
legal
character
were
introduced
with
the
object
of
strengthening
the
authority
of
the
governor
there
were
several
ominous
instances
of
transgressions
being
condoned
with
the
same
end
in
view
persons
who
deserved
to
be
sent
to
prison
and
siberia
were
solely
because
she
insisted
recommended
for
promotion
certain
complaints
and
inquiries
were
deliberately
and
systematically
ignored
all
this
came
out
later
on
not
only
did
lembke
sign
everything
but
he
did
not
even
go
into
the
question
of
the
share
taken
by
his
wife
in
the
execution
of
his
duties
on
the
other
hand
he
began
at
times
to
be
restive
about
the
most
trifling
matters
to
the
surprise
of
yulia
mihailovna
no
doubt
he
felt
the
need
to
make
up
for
the
days
of
suppression
by
brief
moments
of
mutiny
unluckily
yulia
mihailovna
was
unable
for
all
her
insight
to
understand
this
honourable
punctiliousness
in
an
honourable
character
alas
she
had
no
thought
to
spare
for
that
and
that
was
the
source
of
many
misunderstandings
there
are
some
things
of
which
it
is
not
suitable
for
me
to
write
and
indeed
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
do
so
it
is
not
my
business
to
discuss
the
blunders
of
administration
either
and
i
prefer
to
leave
out
this
administrative
aspect
of
the
subject
altogether
in
the
chronicle
i
have
begun
ive
set
before
myself
a
different
task
moreover
a
great
deal
will
be
brought
to
light
by
the
commission
of
inquiry
which
has
just
been
appointed
for
our
province
its
only
a
matter
of
waiting
a
little
certain
explanations
however
cannot
be
omitted
but
to
return
to
yulia
mihailovna
the
poor
lady
i
feel
very
sorry
for
her
might
have
attained
all
that
attracted
and
allured
her
renown
and
so
on
without
any
such
violent
and
eccentric
actions
as
she
resolved
upon
at
the
very
first
step
but
either
from
an
exaggerated
passion
for
the
romantic
or
from
the
frequently
blighted
hopes
of
her
youth
she
felt
suddenly
at
the
change
of
her
fortunes
that
she
had
become
one
of
the
specially
elect
almost
gods
anointed
over
whom
there
gleamed
a
burning
tongue
of
fire
and
this
tongue
of
flame
was
the
root
of
the
mischief
for
after
all
it
is
not
like
a
chignon
which
will
fit
any
womans
head
but
there
is
nothing
of
which
it
is
more
difficult
to
convince
a
woman
than
of
this
on
the
contrary
anyone
who
cares
to
encourage
the
delusion
in
her
will
always
be
sure
to
meet
with
success
and
people
vied
with
one
another
in
encouraging
the
delusion
in
yulia
mihailovna
the
poor
woman
became
at
once
the
sport
of
conflicting
influences
while
fully
persuaded
of
her
own
originality
many
clever
people
feathered
their
nests
and
took
advantage
of
her
simplicity
during
the
brief
period
of
her
rule
in
the
province
and
what
a
jumble
there
was
under
this
assumption
of
independence
she
was
fascinated
at
the
same
time
by
the
aristocratic
element
and
the
system
of
big
landed
properties
and
the
increase
of
the
governors
power
and
the
democratic
element
and
the
new
reforms
and
discipline
and
freethinking
and
stray
socialistic
notions
and
the
correct
tone
of
the
aristocratic
salon
and
the
freeandeasy
almost
pothouse
manners
of
the
young
people
that
surrounded
her
she
dreamed
of
giving
happiness
and
reconciling
the
irreconcilable
or
rather
of
uniting
all
and
everything
in
the
adoration
of
her
own
person
she
had
favourites
too
she
was
particularly
fond
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
who
had
recourse
at
times
to
the
grossest
flattery
in
dealing
with
her
but
she
was
attracted
by
him
for
another
reason
an
amazing
one
and
most
characteristic
of
the
poor
lady
she
was
always
hoping
that
he
would
reveal
to
her
a
regular
conspiracy
against
the
government
difficult
as
it
is
to
imagine
such
a
thing
it
really
was
the
case
she
fancied
for
some
reason
that
there
must
be
a
nihilist
plot
concealed
in
the
province
by
his
silence
at
one
time
and
his
hints
at
another
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
much
to
strengthen
this
strange
idea
in
her
she
imagined
that
he
was
in
communication
with
every
revolutionary
element
in
russia
but
at
the
same
time
passionately
devoted
to
her
to
discover
the
plot
to
receive
the
gratitude
of
the
government
to
enter
on
a
brilliant
career
to
influence
the
young
by
kindness
and
to
restrain
them
from
extremesall
these
dreams
existed
side
by
side
in
her
fantastic
brain
she
had
saved
pyotr
stepanovitch
she
had
conquered
him
of
this
she
was
for
some
reason
firmly
convinced
she
would
save
others
none
none
of
them
should
perish
she
should
save
them
all
she
would
pick
them
out
she
would
send
in
the
right
report
of
them
she
would
act
in
the
interests
of
the
loftiest
justice
and
perhaps
posterity
and
russian
liberalism
would
bless
her
name
yet
the
conspiracy
would
be
discovered
every
advantage
at
once
still
it
was
essential
that
andrey
antonovitch
should
be
in
rather
better
spirits
before
the
festival
he
must
be
cheered
up
and
reassured
for
this
purpose
she
sent
pyotr
stepanovitch
to
him
in
the
hope
that
he
would
relieve
his
depression
by
some
means
of
consolation
best
known
to
himself
perhaps
by
giving
him
some
information
so
to
speak
first
hand
she
put
implicit
faith
in
his
dexterity
it
was
some
time
since
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
been
in
mr
von
lembkes
study
he
popped
in
on
him
just
when
the
sufferer
was
in
a
most
stubborn
mood
ii
a
combination
of
circumstances
had
arisen
which
mr
von
lembke
was
quite
unable
to
deal
with
in
the
very
district
where
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
been
having
a
festive
time
a
sublieutenant
had
been
called
up
to
be
censured
by
his
immediate
superior
and
the
reproof
was
given
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
company
the
sublieutenant
was
a
young
man
fresh
from
petersburg
always
silent
and
morose
of
dignified
appearance
though
small
stout
and
rosycheeked
he
resented
the
reprimand
and
suddenly
with
a
startling
shriek
that
astonished
the
whole
company
he
charged
at
his
superior
officer
with
his
head
bent
down
like
a
wild
beasts
struck
him
and
bit
him
on
the
shoulder
with
all
his
might
they
had
difficulty
in
getting
him
off
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
anyway
it
became
known
that
of
late
he
had
been
observed
performing
incredibly
strange
actions
he
had
for
instance
flung
two
ikons
belonging
to
his
landlady
out
of
his
lodgings
and
smashed
up
one
of
them
with
an
axe
in
his
own
room
he
had
on
three
stands
resembling
lecterns
laid
out
the
works
of
vogt
moleschott
and
buchner
and
before
each
lectern
he
used
to
burn
a
church
waxcandle
from
the
number
of
books
found
in
his
rooms
it
could
be
gathered
that
he
was
a
wellread
man
if
he
had
had
fifty
thousand
francs
he
would
perhaps
have
sailed
to
the
island
of
marquisas
like
the
cadet
to
whom
herzen
alludes
with
such
sprightly
humour
in
one
of
his
writings
when
he
was
seized
whole
bundles
of
the
most
desperate
manifestoes
were
found
in
his
pockets
and
his
lodgings
manifestoes
are
a
trivial
matter
too
and
to
my
thinking
not
worth
troubling
about
we
have
seen
plenty
of
them
besides
they
were
not
new
manifestoes
they
were
it
was
said
later
just
the
same
as
had
been
circulated
in
the
x
province
and
liputin
who
had
travelled
in
that
district
and
the
neighbouring
province
six
weeks
previously
declared
that
he
had
seen
exactly
the
same
leaflets
there
then
but
what
struck
andrey
antonovitch
most
was
that
the
overseer
of
shpigulins
factory
had
brought
the
police
just
at
the
same
time
two
or
three
packets
of
exactly
the
same
leaflets
as
had
been
found
on
the
lieutenant
the
bundles
which
had
been
dropped
in
the
factory
in
the
night
had
not
been
opened
and
none
of
the
factoryhands
had
had
time
to
read
one
of
them
the
incident
was
a
trivial
one
but
it
set
andrey
antonovitch
pondering
deeply
the
position
presented
itself
to
him
in
an
unpleasantly
complicated
light
in
this
factory
the
famous
shpigulin
scandal
was
just
then
brewing
which
made
so
much
talk
among
us
and
got
into
the
petersburg
and
moscow
papers
with
all
sorts
of
variations
three
weeks
previously
one
of
the
hands
had
fallen
ill
and
died
of
asiatic
cholera
then
several
others
were
stricken
down
the
whole
town
was
in
a
panic
for
the
cholera
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
had
reached
the
neighbouring
province
i
may
observe
that
satisfactory
sanitary
measures
had
been
so
far
as
possible
taken
to
meet
the
unexpected
guest
but
the
factory
belonging
to
the
shpigulins
who
were
millionaires
and
wellconnected
people
had
somehow
been
overlooked
and
there
was
a
sudden
outcry
from
every
one
that
this
factory
was
the
hotbed
of
infection
that
the
factory
itself
and
especially
the
quarters
inhabited
by
the
workpeople
were
so
inveterately
filthy
that
even
if
cholera
had
not
been
in
the
neighbourhood
there
might
well
have
been
an
outbreak
there
steps
were
immediately
taken
of
course
and
andrey
antonovitch
vigorously
insisted
on
their
being
carried
out
without
delay
within
three
weeks
the
factory
was
cleansed
but
the
shpigulins
for
some
unknown
reason
closed
it
one
of
the
shpigulin
brothers
always
lived
in
petersburg
and
the
other
went
away
to
moscow
when
the
order
was
given
for
cleansing
the
factory
the
overseer
proceeded
to
pay
off
the
workpeople
and
as
it
appeared
cheated
them
shamelessly
the
hands
began
to
complain
among
themselves
asking
to
be
paid
fairly
and
foolishly
went
to
the
police
though
without
much
disturbance
for
they
were
not
so
very
much
excited
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
the
manifestoes
were
brought
to
andrey
antonovitch
by
the
overseer
pyotr
stepanovitch
popped
into
the
study
unannounced
like
an
intimate
friend
and
one
of
the
family
besides
he
had
a
message
from
yulia
mihailovna

frowned
grimly
and
stood
still
at
the
table
without
welcoming
him
till
that
moment
he
had
been
pacing
up
and
down
the
study
and
had
been
discussing
something
ttette
with
his
clerk
blum
a
very
clumsy
and
surly
german
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
from
petersburg
in
spite
of
the
violent
opposition
of
yulia
mihailovna
on
pyotr
stepanovitchs
entrance
the
clerk
had
moved
to
the
door
but
had
not
gone
out
pyotr
stepanovitch
even
fancied
that
he
exchanged
significant
glances
with
his
chief
aha
ive
caught
you
at
last
you
secretive
monarch
of
the
town
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
out
laughing
and
laid
his
hand
over
the
manifesto
on
the
table
this
increases
your
collection
eh
andrey
antonovitch
flushed
crimson
his
face
seemed
to
twitch
leave
off
leave
off
at
once
he
cried
trembling
with
rage
and
dont
you
dare
sir
whats
the
matter
with
you
you
seem
to
be
angry
allow
me
to
inform
you
sir
that
ive
no
intention
of
putting
up
with
your
sans
faon
henceforward
and
i
beg
you
to
remember
why
damn
it
all
he
is
in
earnest
hold
your
tongue
hold
your
tonguevon
lembke
stamped
on
the
carpetand
dont
dare
god
knows
what
it
might
have
come
to
alas
there
was
one
circumstance
involved
in
the
matter
of
which
neither
pyotr
stepanovitch
nor
even
yulia
mihailovna
herself
had
any
idea
the
luckless
andrey
antonovitch
had
been
so
greatly
upset
during
the
last
few
days
that
he
had
begun
to
be
secretly
jealous
of
his
wife
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
in
solitude
especially
at
night
he
spent
some
very
disagreeable
moments
well
i
imagined
that
if
a
man
reads
you
his
novel
two
days
running
till
after
midnight
and
wants
to
hear
your
opinion
of
it
he
has
of
his
own
act
discarded
official
relations
anyway
yulia
mihailovna
treats
me
as
a
friend
theres
no
making
you
out
pyotr
stepanovitch
brought
out
with
a
certain
dignity
indeed
here
is
your
novel
by
the
way
he
laid
on
the
table
a
large
heavy
manuscript
rolled
up
in
blue
paper
lembke
turned
red
and
looked
embarrassed
where
did
you
find
it
he
asked
discreetly
with
a
rush
of
joy
which
he
was
unable
to
suppress
though
he
did
his
utmost
to
conceal
it
only
fancy
done
up
like
this
it
rolled
under
the
chest
of
drawers
i
must
have
thrown
it
down
carelessly
on
the
chest
when
i
went
out
it
was
only
found
the
day
before
yesterday
when
the
floor
was
scrubbed
you
did
set
me
a
task
though
lembke
dropped
his
eyes
sternly
i
havent
slept
for
the
last
two
nights
thanks
to
you
it
was
found
the
day
before
yesterday
but
i
kept
it
and
have
been
reading
it
ever
since
ive
no
time
in
the
day
so
ive
read
it
at
night
well
i
dont
like
it
its
not
my
way
of
looking
at
things
but
thats
no
matter
ive
never
set
up
for
being
a
critic
but
i
couldnt
tear
myself
away
from
it
my
dear
man
though
i
didnt
like
it
the
fourth
and
fifth
chapters
are
they
really
are
damn
it
all
they
are
beyond
words
and
what
a
lot
of
humour
youve
packed
into
it
it
made
me
laugh
how
you
can
make
fun
of
things
sans
que
cela
paraisse
as
for
the
ninth
and
tenth
chapters
its
all
about
love
thats
not
my
line
but
its
effective
though
i
was
nearly
blubbering
over
egrenevs
letter
though
youve
shown
him
up
so
cleverly
you
know
its
touching
though
at
the
same
time
you
want
to
show
the
false
side
of
him
as
it
were
dont
you
have
i
guessed
right
but
i
could
simply
beat
you
for
the
ending
for
what
are
you
setting
up
why
the
same
old
idol
of
domestic
happiness
begetting
children
and
making
money
they
were
married
and
lived
happy
ever
afterwardscome
its
too
much
you
will
enchant
your
readers
for
even
i
couldnt
put
the
book
down
but
that
makes
it
all
the
worse
the
reading
public
is
as
stupid
as
ever
but
its
the
duty
of
sensible
people
to
wake
them
up
while
you
but
thats
enough
goodbye
dont
be
cross
another
time
i
came
in
to
you
because
i
had
a
couple
of
words
to
say
to
you
but
you
are
so
unaccountable
andrey
antonovitch
meantime
took
his
novel
and
locked
it
up
in
an
oak
bookcase
seizing
the
opportunity
to
wink
to
blum
to
disappear
the
latter
withdrew
with
a
long
mournful
face
i
am
not
unaccountable
i
am
simply
nothing
but
annoyances
he
muttered
frowning
but
without
anger
and
sitting
down
to
the
table
sit
down
and
say
what
you
have
to
say
its
a
long
time
since
ive
seen
you
pyotr
stepanovitch
only
dont
burst
upon
me
in
the
future
with
such
manners
sometimes
when
one
has
business
its
my
manners
are
always
the
same
i
know
and
i
believe
that
you
mean
nothing
by
it
but
sometimes
one
is
worried
sit
down
pyotr
stepanovitch
immediately
lolled
back
on
the
sofa
and
drew
his
legs
under
him
iii
what
sort
of
worries
surely
not
these
trifles
he
nodded
towards
the
manifesto
i
can
bring
you
as
many
of
them
as
you
like
i
made
their
acquaintance
in
x
province
you
mean
at
the
time
you
were
staying
there
of
course
it
was
not
in
my
absence
i
remember
there
was
a
hatchet
printed
at
the
top
of
it
allow
me
he
took
up
the
manifesto
yes
theres
the
hatchet
here
too
thats
it
the
very
same
yes
heres
a
hatchet
you
see
a
hatchet
well
is
it
the
hatchet
that
scares
you
no
its
not
and
i
am
not
scared
but
this
business
it
is
a
business
there
are
circumstances
what
sort
that
its
come
from
the
factory
he
he
but
do
you
know
at
that
factory
the
workpeople
will
soon
be
writing
manifestoes
for
themselves
what
do
you
mean
von
lembke
stared
at
him
severely
what
i
say
youve
only
to
look
at
them
you
are
too
soft
andrey
antonovitch
you
write
novels
but
this
has
to
be
handled
in
the
good
old
way
what
do
you
mean
by
the
good
old
way
what
do
you
mean
by
advising
me
the
factory
has
been
cleaned
i
gave
the
order
and
theyve
cleaned
it
and
the
workmen
are
in
rebellion
they
ought
to
be
flogged
every
one
of
them
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
in
rebellion
thats
nonsense
i
gave
the
order
and
theyve
cleaned
it
ech
you
are
soft
andrey
antonovitch
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
so
soft
as
you
think
and
in
the
second
place
von
lembke
was
piqued
again
he
had
exerted
himself
to
keep
up
the
conversation
with
the
young
man
from
curiosity
wondering
if
he
would
tell
him
anything
new
ha
ha
an
old
acquaintance
again
pyotr
stepanovitch
interrupted
pouncing
on
another
document
that
lay
under
a
paperweight
something
like
a
manifesto
obviously
printed
abroad
and
in
verse
oh
come
i
know
this
one
by
heart
a
noble
personality
let
me
have
a
look
at
ityes
a
noble
personality
it
is
i
made
acquaintance
with
that
personality
abroad
where
did
you
unearth
it
you
say
youve
seen
it
abroad
von
lembke
said
eagerly
i
should
think
so
four
months
ago
or
may
be
five
you
seem
to
have
seen
a
great
deal
abroad
von
lembke
looked
at
him
subtly
pyotr
stepanovitch
not
heeding
him
unfolded
the
document
and
read
the
poem
aloud
a
noble
personality
he
was
not
of
rank
exalted
he
was
not
of
noble
birth
he
was
bred
among
the
people
in
the
breast
of
mother
earth
but
the
malice
of
the
nobles
and
the
tsars
revengeful
wrath
drove
him
forth
to
grief
and
torture
on
the
martyrs
chosen
path
he
set
out
to
teach
the
people
freedom
love
equality
to
exhort
them
to
resistance
but
to
flee
the
penalty
of
the
prison
whip
and
gallows
to
a
foreign
land
he
went
while
the
people
waited
hoping
from
smolensk
to
far
tashkent
waited
eager
for
his
coming
to
rebel
against
their
fate
to
arise
and
crush
the
tsardom
and
the
nobles
vicious
hate
to
share
all
the
wealth
in
common
and
the
antiquated
thrall
of
the
church
the
home
and
marriage
to
abolish
once
for
all
you
got
it
from
that
officer
i
suppose
eh
asked
pyotr
stepanovitch
why
do
you
know
that
officer
then
too
i
should
think
so
i
had
a
gay
time
with
him
there
for
two
days
he
was
bound
to
go
out
of
his
mind
perhaps
he
did
not
go
out
of
his
mind
you
think
he
didnt
because
he
began
to
bite
but
excuse
me
if
you
saw
those
verses
abroad
and
then
it
appears
at
that
officers
what
puzzling
is
it
you
are
putting
me
through
an
examination
andrey
antonovitch
i
see
you
see
he
began
suddenly
with
extraordinary
dignity
as
to
what
i
saw
abroad
i
have
already
given
explanations
and
my
explanations
were
found
satisfactory
otherwise
i
should
not
have
been
gratifying
this
town
with
my
presence
i
consider
that
the
question
as
regards
me
has
been
settled
and
i
am
not
obliged
to
give
any
further
account
of
myself
not
because
i
am
an
informer
but
because
i
could
not
help
acting
as
i
did
the
people
who
wrote
to
yulia
mihailovna
about
me
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
and
they
said
i
was
an
honest
man
but
thats
neither
here
nor
there
ive
come
to
see
you
about
a
serious
matter
and
its
as
well
youve
sent
your
chimneysweep
away
its
a
matter
of
importance
to
me
andrey
antonovitch
i
shall
have
a
very
great
favour
to
ask
of
you
a
favour
hm
by
all
means
i
am
waiting
and
i
confess
with
curiosity
and
i
must
add
pyotr
stepanovitch
that
you
surprise
me
not
a
little
von
lembke
was
in
some
agitation
pyotr
stepanovitch
crossed
his
legs
in
petersburg
he
began
i
talked
freely
of
most
things
but
there
were
thingsthis
for
instance
he
tapped
the
noble
personality
with
his
finger
about
which
i
held
my
tonguein
the
first
place
because
it
wasnt
worth
talking
about
and
secondly
because
i
only
answered
questions
i
dont
care
to
put
myself
forward
in
such
matters
in
that
i
see
the
distinction
between
a
rogue
and
an
honest
man
forced
by
circumstances
well
in
short
well
dismiss
that
but
now
now
that
these
fools
now
that
this
has
come
to
the
surface
and
is
in
your
hands
and
i
see
that
youll
find
out
all
about
itfor
you
are
a
man
with
eyes
and
one
cant
tell
beforehand
what
youll
doand
these
fools
are
still
going
on
i
i
well
the
fact
is
ive
come
to
ask
you
to
save
one
man
a
fool
too
most
likely
mad
for
the
sake
of
his
youth
his
misfortunes
in
the
name
of
your
humanity
you
cant
be
so
humane
only
in
the
novels
you
manufacture
he
said
breaking
off
with
coarse
sarcasm
and
impatience
in
fact
he
was
seen
to
be
a
straightforward
man
awkward
and
impolitic
from
excess
of
humane
feeling
and
perhaps
from
excessive
sensitivenessabove
all
a
man
of
limited
intelligence
as
von
lembke
saw
at
once
with
extraordinary
subtlety
he
had
indeed
long
suspected
it
especially
when
during
the
previous
week
he
had
sitting
alone
in
his
study
at
night
secretly
cursed
him
with
all
his
heart
for
the
inexplicable
way
in
which
he
had
gained
yulia
mihailovnas
good
graces
for
whom
are
you
interceding
and
what
does
all
this
mean
he
inquired
majestically
trying
to
conceal
his
curiosity
it
its
damn
it
its
not
my
fault
that
i
trust
you
is
it
my
fault
that
i
look
upon
you
as
a
most
honourable
and
above
all
a
sensible
man
capable
that
is
of
understanding
damn
the
poor
fellow
evidently
could
not
master
his
emotion
you
must
understand
at
last
he
went
on
you
must
understand
that
in
pronouncing
his

betraying

am
i
not
i
am
am
i
not
but
how
am
i
to
guess
if
you
dont
make
up
your
mind
to
speak
out
thats
just
it
you
always
cut
the
ground
from
under
ones
feet
with
your
logic
damn
it
well
here
goes
this
noble
personality
this
student
is
shatov
thats
all
shatov
how
do
you
mean
its
shatov
shatov
is
the
student
who
is
mentioned
in
this
he
lives
here
he
was
once
a
serf
the
man
who
gave
that
slap
i
know
i
know
lembke
screwed
up
his
eyes
but
excuse
me
what
is
he
accused
of
precisely
and
above
all
what
is
your
petition
i
beg
you
to
save
him
do
you
understand
i
used
to
know
him
eight
years
ago
i
might
almost
say
i
was
his
friend
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
completely
carried
away
but
i
am
not
bound
to
give
you
an
account
of
my
past
life
he
added
with
a
gesture
of
dismissal
all
this
is
of
no
consequence
its
the
case
of
three
men
and
a
half
and
with
those
that
are
abroad
you
cant
make
up
a
dozen
but
what
i
am
building
upon
is
your
humanity
and
your
intelligence
you
will
understand
and
you
will
put
the
matter
in
its
true
light
as
the
foolish
dream
of
a
man
driven
crazy
by
misfortunes
by
continued
misfortunes
and
not
as
some
impossible
political
plot
or
god
knows
what
he
was
almost
gasping
for
breath
hm
i
see
that
he
is
responsible
for
the
manifestoes
with
the
axe
lembke
concluded
almost
majestically
excuse
me
though
if
he
were
the
only
person
concerned
how
could
he
have
distributed
it
both
here
and
in
other
districts
and
in
the
x
province
and
above
all
where
did
he
get
them
but
i
tell
you
that
at
the
utmost
there
are
not
more
than
five
people
in
ita
dozen
perhaps
how
can
i
tell
you
dont
know
how
should
i
knowdamn
it
all
why
you
knew
that
shatov
was
one
of
the
conspirators
ech
pyotr
stepanovitch
waved
his
hand
as
though
to
keep
off
the
overwhelming
penetration
of
the
inquirer
well
listen
ill
tell
you
the
whole
truth
of
the
manifestoes
i
know
nothingthat
is
absolutely
nothing
damn
it
all
dont
you
know
what
nothing
means
that
sublieutenant
to
be
sure
and
somebody
else
and
someone
else
here
and
shatov
perhaps
and
someone
else
toowell
thats
the
lot
of
them
a
wretched
lot
but
ive
come
to
intercede
for
shatov
he
must
be
saved
for
this
poem
is
his
his
own
composition
and
it
was
through
him
it
was
published
abroad
that
i
know
for
a
fact
but
of
the
manifestoes
i
really
know
nothing
if
the
poem
is
his
work
no
doubt
the
manifestoes
are
too
but
what
data
have
you
for
suspecting
mr
shatov
pyotr
stepanovitch
with
the
air
of
a
man
driven
out
of
all
patience
pulled
a
pocketbook
out
of
his
pocket
and
took
a
note
out
of
it
here
are
the
facts
he
cried
flinging
it
on
the
table
lembke
unfolded
it
it
turned
out
to
be
a
note
written
six
months
before
from
here
to
some
address
abroad
it
was
a
brief
note
only
two
lines
i
cant
print
a
noble
personality
here
and
in
fact
i
can
do
nothing
print
it
abroad
iv
shatov
lembke
looked
intently
at
pyotr
stepanovitch
varvara
petrovna
had
been
right
in
saying
that
he
had
at
times
the
expression
of
a
sheep
you
see
its
like
this
pyotr
stepanovitch
burst
out
he
wrote
this
poem
here
six
months
ago
but
he
couldnt
get
it
printed
here
in
a
secret
printing
press
and
so
he
asks
to
have
it
printed
abroad
that
seems
clear
yes
thats
clear
but
to
whom
did
he
write
thats
not
clear
yet
lembke
observed
with
the
most
subtle
irony
why
kirillov
of
course
the
letter
was
written
to
kirillov
abroad
surely
you
knew
that
whats
so
annoying
is
that
perhaps
you
are
only
putting
it
on
before
me
and
most
likely
you
knew
all
about
this
poem
and
everything
long
ago
how
did
it
come
to
be
on
your
table
it
found
its
way
there
somehow
why
are
you
torturing
me
if
so
he
feverishly
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
i
know
something
perhaps
lembke
parried
dexterously
but
who
is
this
kirillov
an
engineer
who
has
lately
come
to
the
town
he
was
stavrogins
second
a
maniac
a
madman
your
sublieutenant
may
really
only
be
suffering
from
temporary
delirium
but
kirillov
is
a
thoroughgoing
madmanthoroughgoing
that
i
guarantee
ah
andrey
antonovitch
if
the
government
only
knew
what
sort
of
people
these
conspirators
all
are
they
wouldnt
have
the
heart
to
lay
a
finger
on
them
every
single
one
of
them
ought
to
be
in
an
asylum
i
had
a
good
look
at
them
in
switzerland
and
at
the
congresses
from
which
they
direct
the
movement
here
why
who
directs
it
three
men
and
a
half
it
makes
one
sick
to
think
of
them
and
what
sort
of
movement
is
there
here
manifestoes
and
what
recruits
have
they
made
sublieutenants
in
brain
fever
and
two
or
three
students
you
are
a
sensible
man
answer
this
question
why
dont
people
of
consequence
join
their
ranks
why
are
they
all
students
and
halfbaked
boys
of
twentytwo
and
not
many
of
those
i
dare
say
there
are
thousands
of
bloodhounds
on
their
track
but
have
they
tracked
out
many
of
them
seven
i
tell
you
it
makes
one
sick
lembke
listened
with
attention
but
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
you
dont
feed
nightingales
on
fairytales
excuse
me
though
you
asserted
that
the
letter
was
sent
abroad
but
theres
no
address
on
it
how
do
you
come
to
know
that
it
was
addressed
to
mr
kirillov
and
abroad
too
and
and
that
it
really
was
written
by
mr
shatov
why
fetch
some
specimen
of
shatovs
writing
and
compare
it
you
must
have
some
signature
of
his
in
your
office
as
for
its
being
addressed
to
kirillov
it
was
kirillov
himself
showed
it
me
at
the
time
then
you
were
yourself
of
course
i
was
myself
they
showed
me
lots
of
things
out
there
and
as
for
this
poem
they
say
it
was
written
by
herzen
to
shatov
when
he
was
still
wandering
abroad
in
memory
of
their
meeting
so
they
say
by
way
of
praise
and
recommendationdamn
it
all
and
shatov
circulates
it
among
the
young
people
as
much
as
to
say
this
was
herzens
opinion
of
me
ha
ha
cried
lembke
feeling
he
had
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
at
last
thats
just
what
i
was
wondering
one
can
understand
the
manifesto
but
whats
the
object
of
the
poem
of
course
youd
see
it
goodness
knows
why
ive
been
babbling
to
you
listen
spare
shatov
for
me
and
the
rest
may
go
to
the
devileven
kirillov
who
is
in
hiding
now
shut
up
in
filipovs
house
where
shatov
lodges
too
they
dont
like
me
because
ive
turned
round
but
promise
me
shatov
and
ill
dish
them
all
up
for
you
i
shall
be
of
use
andrey
antonovitch
i
reckon
nine
or
ten
men
make
up
the
whole
wretched
lot
i
am
keeping
an
eye
on
them
myself
on
my
own
account
we
know
of
three
already
shatov
kirillov
and
that
sublieutenant
the
others
i
am
only
watching
carefully
though
i
am
pretty
sharpsighted
too
its
the
same
over
again
as
it
was
in
the
x
province
two
students
a
schoolboy
two
noblemen
of
twenty
a
teacher
and
a
halfpay
major
of
sixty
crazy
with
drink
have
been
caught
with
manifestoes
that
was
allyou
can
take
my
word
for
it
that
was
all
it
was
quite
a
surprise
that
that
was
all
but
i
must
have
six
days
i
have
reckoned
it
outsix
days
not
less
if
you
want
to
arrive
at
any
result
dont
disturb
them
for
six
days
and
i
can
kill
all
the
birds
with
one
stone
for
you
but
if
you
flutter
them
before
the
birds
will
fly
away
but
spare
me
shatov
i
speak
for
shatov
the
best
plan
would
be
to
fetch
him
here
secretly
in
a
friendly
way
to
your
study
and
question
him
without
disguising
the
facts
i
have
no
doubt
hell
throw
himself
at
your
feet
and
burst
into
tears
he
is
a
highly
strung
and
unfortunate
fellow
his
wife
is
carrying
on
with
stavrogin
be
kind
to
him
and
he
will
tell
you
everything
but
i
must
have
six
days
and
above
all
above
all
not
a
word
to
yulia
mihailovna
its
a
secret
may
it
be
a
secret
what
cried
lembke
opening
wide
his
eyes
do
you
mean
to
say
you
said
nothing
of
this
to
yulia
mihailovna
to
her
heaven
forbid
ech
andrey
antonovitch
you
see
i
value
her
friendship
and
i
have
the
highest
respect
for
her
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
i
couldnt
make
such
a
blunder
i
dont
contradict
her
for
as
you
know
yourself
its
dangerous
to
contradict
her
i
may
have
dropped
a
word
to
her
for
i
know
she
likes
that
but
to
suppose
that
i
mentioned
names
to
her
as
i
have
to
you
or
anything
of
that
sort
my
good
sir
why
am
i
appealing
to
you
because
you
are
a
man
anyway
a
serious
person
with
oldfashioned
firmness
and
experience
in
the
service
youve
seen
life
you
must
know
by
heart
every
detail
of
such
affairs
i
expect
from
what
youve
seen
in
petersburg
but
if
i
were
to
mention
those
two
names
for
instance
to
her
shed
stir
up
such
a
hubbub
you
know
she
would
like
to
astonish
petersburg
no
shes
too
hotheaded
she
really
is
yes
she
has
something
of
that
fougue
andrey
antonovitch
muttered
with
some
satisfaction
though
at
the
same
time
he
resented
this
unmannerly
fellows
daring
to
express
himself
rather
freely
about
yulia
mihailovna
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
probably
imagined
that
he
had
not
gone
far
enough
and
that
he
must
exert
himself
further
to
flatter
lembke
and
make
a
complete
conquest
of
him
fougue
is
just
it
he
assented
she
may
be
a
woman
of
genius
a
literary
woman
but
she
would
scare
our
sparrows
she
wouldnt
be
able
to
keep
quiet
for
six
hours
let
alone
six
days
ech
andrey
antonovitch
dont
attempt
to
tie
a
woman
down
for
six
days
you
do
admit
that
i
have
some
experiencein
this
sort
of
thing
i
mean
i
know
something
about
it
and
you
know
that
i
may
very
well
know
something
about
it
i
am
not
asking
for
six
days
for
fun
but
with
an
object
i
have
heard
lembke
hesitated
to
utter
his
thought
i
have
heard
that
on
your
return
from
abroad
you
made
some
expression
as
it
were
of
repentance
in
the
proper
quarter
well
thats
as
it
may
be
and
of
course
i
dont
want
to
go
into
it
but
it
has
seemed
to
me
all
along
that
youve
talked
in
quite
a
different
styleabout
the
christian
faith
for
instance
about
social
institutions
about
the
government
even
ive
said
lots
of
things
no
doubt
i
am
saying
them
still
but
such
ideas
mustnt
be
applied
as
those
fools
do
it
thats
the
point
whats
the
good
of
biting
his
superiors
shoulder
you
agreed
with
me
yourself
only
you
said
it
was
premature
i
didnt
mean
that
when
i
agreed
and
said
it
was
premature
you
weigh
every
word
you
utter
though
he
he
you
are
a
careful
man
pyotr
stepanovitch
observed
gaily
all
of
a
sudden
listen
old
friend
i
had
to
get
to
know
you
thats
why
i
talked
in
my
own
style
you
are
not
the
only
one
i
get
to
know
like
that
maybe
i
needed
to
find
out
your
character
whats
my
character
to
you
how
can
i
tell
what
it
may
be
to
me
he
laughed
again
you
see
my
dear
and
highly
respected
andrey
antonovitch
you
are
cunning
but
its
not
come
to
that
yet
and
it
certainly
never
will
come
to
it
you
understand
perhaps
you
do
understand
though
i
did
make
an
explanation
in
the
proper
quarter
when
i
came
back
from
abroad
and
i
really
dont
know
why
a
man
of
certain
convictions
should
not
be
able
to
work
for
the
advancement
of
his
sincere
convictions
but
nobody
there
has
yet
instructed
me
to
investigate
your
character
and
ive
not
undertaken
any
such
job
from
them
consider
i
need
not
have
given
those
two
names
to
you
i
might
have
gone
straight
there
that
is
where
i
made
my
first
explanations
and
if
id
been
acting
with
a
view
to
financial
profit
or
my
own
interest
in
any
way
it
would
have
been
a
bad
speculation
on
my
part
for
now
theyll
be
grateful
to
you
and
not
to
me
at
headquarters
ive
done
it
solely
for
shatovs
sake
pyotr
stepanovitch
added
generously
for
shatovs
sake
because
of
our
old
friendship
but
when
you
take
up
your
pen
to
write
to
headquarters
you
may
put
in
a
word
for
me
if
you
like
ill
make
no
objection
he
he
adieu
though
ive
stayed
too
long
and
there
was
no
need
to
gossip
so
much
he
added
with
some
amiability
and
he
got
up
from
the
sofa
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
glad
that
the
position
has
been
defined
so
to
speak
von
lembke
too
got
up
and
he
too
looked
pleasant
obviously
affected
by
the
last
words
i
accept
your
services
and
acknowledge
my
obligation
and
you
may
be
sure
that
anything
i
can
do
by
way
of
reporting
your
zeal
six
daysthe
great
thing
is
to
put
it
off
for
six
days
and
that
you
shouldnt
stir
for
those
six
days
thats
what
i
want
so
be
it
of
course
i
dont
tie
your
hands
and
shouldnt
venture
to
you
are
bound
to
keep
watch
only
dont
flutter
the
nest
too
soon
i
rely
on
your
sense
and
experience
for
that
but
i
should
think
youve
plenty
of
bloodhounds
and
trackers
of
your
own
in
reserve
ha
ha
pyotr
stepanovitch
blurted
out
with
the
gaiety
and
irresponsibility
of
youth
not
quite
so
lembke
parried
amiably
young
people
are
apt
to
suppose
that
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
background
but
by
the
way
allow
me
one
little
word
if
this
kirillov
was
stavrogins
second
then
mr
stavrogin
too
what
about
stavrogin
i
mean
if
they
are
such
friends
oh
no
no
no
there
you
are
quite
out
of
it
though
you
are
cunning
you
really
surprise
me
i
thought
that
you
had
some
information
about
it
hm
stavroginits
quite
the
opposite
quite
avis
au
lecteur
do
you
mean
it
and
can
it
be
so
lembke
articulated
mistrustfully
yulia
mihailovna
told
me
that
from
what
she
heard
from
petersburg
he
is
a
man
acting
on
some
sort
of
instructions
so
to
speak
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
know
nothing
absolutely
nothing
adieu
avis
au
lecteur
abruptly
and
obviously
pyotr
stepanovitch
declined
to
discuss
it
he
hurried
to
the
door
stay
pyotr
stepanovitch
stay
cried
lembke
one
other
tiny
matter
and
i
wont
detain
you
he
drew
an
envelope
out
of
a
table
drawer
here
is
a
little
specimen
of
the
same
kind
of
thing
and
i
let
you
see
it
to
show
how
completely
i
trust
you
here
and
tell
me
your
opinion
in
the
envelope
was
a
letter
a
strange
anonymous
letter
addressed
to
lembke
and
only
received
by
him
the
day
before
with
intense
vexation
pyotr
stepanovitch
read
as
follows
your
excellencyfor
such
you
are
by
rank
herewith
i
make
known
that
there
is
an
attempt
to
be
made
on
the
life
of
personages
of
generals
rank
and
on
the
fatherland
for
its
working
up
straight
for
that
i
myself
have
been
disseminating
unceasingly
for
a
number
of
years
theres
infidelity
too
theres
a
rebellion
being
got
up
and
there
are
some
thousands
of
manifestoes
and
for
every
one
of
them
there
will
be
a
hundred
running
with
their
tongues
out
unless
theyve
been
taken
away
beforehand
by
the
police
for
theyve
been
promised
a
mighty
lot
of
benefits
and
the
simple
people
are
foolish
and
theres
vodka
too
the
people
will
attack
one
after
another
taking
them
to
be
guilty
and
fearing
both
sides
i
repent
of
what
i
had
no
share
in
my
circumstances
being
what
they
are
if
you
want
information
to
save
the
fatherland
and
also
the
church
and
the
ikons
i
am
the
only
one
that
can
do
it
but
only
on
condition
that
i
get
a
pardon
from
the
secret
police
by
telegram
at
once
me
alone
but
the
rest
may
answer
for
it
put
a
candle
every
evening
at
seven
oclock
in
the
porters
window
for
a
signal
seeing
it
i
shall
believe
and
come
to
kiss
the
merciful
hand
from
petersburg
but
on
condition
theres
a
pension
for
me
for
else
how
am
i
to
live
you
wont
regret
it
for
it
will
mean
a
star
for
you
you
must
go
secretly
or
theyll
wring
your
neck
your
excellencys
desperate
servant
falls
at
your
feet
repentant
freethinker
incognito
von
lembke
explained
that
the
letter
had
made
its
appearance
in
the
porters
room
when
it
was
left
empty
the
day
before
so
what
do
you
think
pyotr
stepanovitch
asked
almost
rudely
i
think
its
an
anonymous
skit
by
way
of
a
hoax
most
likely
it
is
theres
no
taking
you
in
what
makes
me
think
that
is
that
its
so
stupid
have
you
received
such
documents
here
before
once
or
twice
anonymous
letters
oh
of
course
they
wouldnt
be
signed
in
a
different
style
in
different
handwritings
yes
and
were
they
buffoonery
like
this
one
yes
and
you
know
very
disgusting
well
if
you
had
them
before
it
must
be
the
same
thing
now
especially
because
its
so
stupid
because
these
people
are
educated
and
wouldnt
write
so
stupidly
of
course
of
course
but
what
if
this
is
someone
who
really
wants
to
turn
informer
its
not
very
likely
pyotr
stepanovitch
rapped
out
dryly
what
does
he
mean
by
a
telegram
from
the
secret
police
and
a
pension
its
obviously
a
hoax
yes
yes
lembke
admitted
abashed
i
tell
you
what
you
leave
this
with
me
i
can
certainly
find
out
for
you
before
i
track
out
the
others
take
it
lembke
assented
though
with
some
hesitation
have
you
shown
it
to
anyone
is
it
likely
no
not
to
yulia
mihailovna
oh
heaven
forbid
and
for
gods
sake
dont
you
show
it
her
lembke
cried
in
alarm
shell
be
so
upset
and
will
be
dreadfully
angry
with
me
yes
youll
be
the
first
to
catch
it
shed
say
you
brought
it
on
yourself
if
people
write
like
that
to
you
i
know
what
womens
logic
is
well
goodbye
i
dare
say
i
shall
bring
you
the
writer
in
a
couple
of
days
or
so
above
all
our
compact
iv
though
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
perhaps
far
from
being
a
stupid
man
fedka
the
convict
had
said
of
him
truly
that
he
would
make
up
a
man
himself
and
go
on
living
with
him
too
he
came
away
from
lembke
fully
persuaded
that
for
the
next
six
days
anyway
he
had
put
his
mind
at
rest
and
this
interval
was
absolutely
necessary
for
his
own
purposes
but
it
was
a
false
idea
and
founded
entirely
on
the
fact
that
he
had
made
up
for
himself
once
for
all
an
andrey
antonovitch
who
was
a
perfect
simpleton
like
every
morbidly
suspicious
man
andrey
antonovitch
was
always
exceedingly
and
joyfully
trustful
the
moment
he
got
on
to
sure
ground
the
new
turn
of
affairs
struck
him
at
first
in
a
rather
favourable
light
in
spite
of
some
fresh
and
troublesome
complications
anyway
his
former
doubts
fell
to
the
ground
besides
he
had
been
so
tired
for
the
last
few
days
so
exhausted
and
helpless
that
his
soul
involuntarily
yearned
for
rest
but
alas
he
was
again
uneasy
the
long
time
he
had
spent
in
petersburg
had
left
ineradicable
traces
in
his
heart
the
official
and
even
the
secret
history
of
the
younger
generation
was
fairly
familiar
to
himhe
was
a
curious
man
and
used
to
collect
manifestoesbut
he
could
never
understand
a
word
of
it
now
he
felt
like
a
man
lost
in
a
forest
every
instinct
told
him
that
there
was
something
in
pyotr
stepanovitchs
words
utterly
incongruous
anomalous
and
grotesque
though
theres
no
telling
what
may
not
happen
with
this
younger
generation
and
the
devil
only
knows
whats
going
on
among
them
he
mused
lost
in
perplexity
and
at
this
moment
to
make
matters
worse
blum
poked
his
head
in
he
had
been
waiting
not
far
off
through
the
whole
of
pyotr
stepanovitchs
visit
this
blum
was
actually
a
distant
relation
of
andrey
antonovitch
though
the
relationship
had
always
been
carefully
and
timorously
concealed
i
must
apologise
to
the
reader
for
devoting
a
few
words
here
to
this
insignificant
person
blum
was
one
of
that
strange
class
of
unfortunate
germans
who
are
unfortunate
not
through
lack
of
ability
but
through
some
inexplicable
ill
luck
unfortunate
germans
are
not
a
myth
but
really
do
exist
even
in
russia
and
are
of
a
special
type
andrey
antonovitch
had
always
had
a
quite
touching
sympathy
for
him
and
wherever
he
could
as
he
rose
himself
in
the
service
had
promoted
him
to
subordinate
positions
under
him
but
blum
had
never
been
successful
either
the
post
was
abolished
after
he
had
been
appointed
to
it
or
a
new
chief
took
charge
of
the
department
once
he
was
almost
arrested
by
mistake
with
other
people
he
was
precise
but
he
was
gloomy
to
excess
and
to
his
own
detriment
he
was
tall
and
had
red
hair
he
stooped
and
was
depressed
and
even
sentimental
and
in
spite
of
his
being
humbled
by
his
life
he
was
obstinate
and
persistent
as
an
ox
though
always
at
the
wrong
moment
for
andrey
antonovitch
he
as
well
as
his
wife
and
numerous
family
had
cherished
for
many
years
a
reverent
devotion
except
andrey
antonovitch
no
one
had
ever
liked
him
yulia
mihailovna
would
have
discarded
him
from
the
first
but
could
not
overcome
her
husbands
obstinacy
it
was
the
cause
of
their
first
conjugal
quarrel
it
had
happened
soon
after
their
marriage
in
the
early
days
of
their
honeymoon
when
she
was
confronted
with
blum
who
together
with
the
humiliating
secret
of
his
relationship
had
been
until
then
carefully
concealed
from
her
andrey
antonovitch
besought
her
with
clasped
hands
told
her
pathetically
all
the
story
of
blum
and
their
friendship
from
childhood
but
yulia
mihailovna
considered
herself
disgraced
forever
and
even
had
recourse
to
fainting
von
lembke
would
not
budge
an
inch
and
declared
that
he
would
not
give
up
blum
or
part
from
him
for
anything
in
the
world
so
that
she
was
surprised
at
last
and
was
obliged
to
put
up
with
blum
it
was
settled
however
that
the
relationship
should
be
concealed
even
more
carefully
than
before
if
possible
and
that
even
blums
christian
name
and
patronymic
should
be
changed
because
he
too
was
for
some
reason
called
andrey
antonovitch
blum
knew
no
one
in
the
town
except
the
german
chemist
had
not
called
on
anyone
and
led
as
he
always
did
a
lonely
and
niggardly
existence
he
had
long
been
aware
of
andrey
antonovitchs
literary
peccadilloes
he
was
generally
summoned
to
listen
to
secret
ttette
readings
of
his
novel
he
would
sit
like
a
post
for
six
hours
at
a
stretch
perspiring
and
straining
his
utmost
to
keep
awake
and
smile
on
reaching
home
he
would
groan
with
his
longlegged
and
lanky
wife
over
their
benefactors
unhappy
weakness
for
russian
literature
andrey
antonovitch
looked
with
anguish
at
blum
i
beg
you
to
leave
me
alone
blum
he
began
with
agitated
haste
obviously
anxious
to
avoid
any
renewal
of
the
previous
conversation
which
had
been
interrupted
by
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
yet
this
may
be
arranged
in
the
most
delicate
way
and
with
no
publicity
you
have
full
power
blum
respectfully
but
obstinately
insisted
on
some
point
stooping
forward
and
coming
nearer
and
nearer
by
small
steps
to
andrey
antonovitch
blum
you
are
so
devoted
to
me
and
so
anxious
to
serve
me
that
i
am
always
in
a
panic
when
i
look
at
you
you
always
say
witty
things
and
sleep
in
peace
satisfied
with
what
youve
said
but
thats
how
you
damage
yourself
blum
i
have
just
convinced
myself
that
its
quite
a
mistake
quite
a
mistake
not
from
the
words
of
that
false
vicious
young
man
whom
you
suspect
yourself
he
has
won
you
by
his
flattering
praise
of
your
talent
for
literature
blum
you
understand
nothing
about
it
your
project
is
absurd
i
tell
you
we
shall
find
nothing
and
there
will
be
a
fearful
upset
and
laughter
too
and
then
yulia
mihailovna
we
shall
certainly
find
everything
we
are
looking
for
blum
advanced
firmly
towards
him
laying
his
right
hand
on
his
heart
we
will
make
a
search
suddenly
early
in
the
morning
carefully
showing
every
consideration
for
the
person
himself
and
strictly
observing
all
the
prescribed
forms
of
the
law
the
young
men
lyamshin
and
telyatnikov
assert
positively
that
we
shall
find
all
we
want
they
were
constant
visitors
there
nobody
is
favourably
disposed
to
mr
verhovensky
madame
stavrogin
has
openly
refused
him
her
graces
and
every
honest
man
if
only
there
is
such
a
one
in
this
coarse
town
is
persuaded
that
a
hotbed
of
infidelity
and
social
doctrines
has
always
been
concealed
there
he
keeps
all
the
forbidden
books
rylievs
reflections
all
herzens
works
i
have
an
approximate
catalogue
in
case
of
need
oh
heavens
every
one
has
these
books
how
simple
you
are
my
poor
blum
and
many
manifestoes
blum
went
on
without
heeding
the
observation
we
shall
end
by
certainly
coming
upon
traces
of
the
real
manifestoes
here
that
young
verhovensky
i
feel
very
suspicious
of
but
you
are
mixing
up
the
father
and
the
son
they
are
not
on
good
terms
the
son
openly
laughs
at
his
father
thats
only
a
mask
blum
youve
sworn
to
torment
me
think
he
is
a
conspicuous
figure
here
after
all
hes
been
a
professor
he
is
a
wellknown
man
hell
make
such
an
uproar
and
there
will
be
such
gibes
all
over
the
town
and
we
shall
make
a
mess
of
it
all
and
only
think
how
yulia
mihailovna
will
take
it
blum
pressed
forward
and
did
not
listen
he
was
only
a
lecturer
only
a
lecturer
and
of
a
low
rank
when
he
retired
he
smote
himself
on
the
chest
he
has
no
marks
of
distinction
he
was
discharged
from
the
service
on
suspicion
of
plots
against
the
government
he
has
been
under
secret
supervision
and
undoubtedly
still
is
so
and
in
view
of
the
disorders
that
have
come
to
light
now
you
are
undoubtedly
bound
in
duty
you
are
losing
your
chance
of
distinction
by
letting
slip
the
real
criminal
yulia
mihailovna
get
away
blum
von
lembke
cried
suddenly
hearing
the
voice
of
his
spouse
in
the
next
room
blum
started
but
did
not
give
in
allow
me
allow
me
he
persisted
pressing
both
hands
still
more
tightly
on
his
chest
get
away
hissed
andrey
antonovitch
do
what
you
like
afterwards
oh
my
god
the
curtain
was
raised
and
yulia
mihailovna
made
her
appearance
she
stood
still
majestically
at
the
sight
of
blum
casting
a
haughty
and
offended
glance
at
him
as
though
the
very
presence
of
this
man
was
an
affront
to
her
blum
respectfully
made
her
a
deep
bow
without
speaking
and
doubled
up
with
veneration
moved
towards
the
door
on
tiptoe
with
his
arms
held
a
little
away
from
him
either
because
he
really
took
andrey
antonovitchs
last
hysterical
outbreak
as
a
direct
permission
to
act
as
he
was
asking
or
whether
he
strained
a
point
in
this
case
for
the
direct
advantage
of
his
benefactor
because
he
was
too
confident
that
success
would
crown
his
efforts
anyway
as
we
shall
see
later
on
this
conversation
of
the
governor
with
his
subordinate
led
to
a
very
surprising
event
which
amused
many
people
became
public
property
moved
yulia
mihailovna
to
fierce
anger
utterly
disconcerting
andrey
antonovitch
and
reducing
him
at
the
crucial
moment
to
a
state
of
deplorable
indecision
v
it
was
a
busy
day
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
from
von
lembke
he
hastened
to
bogoyavlensky
street
but
as
he
went
along
bykovy
street
past
the
house
where
karmazinov
was
staying
he
suddenly
stopped
grinned
and
went
into
the
house
the
servant
told
him
that
he
was
expected
which
interested
him
as
he
had
said
nothing
beforehand
of
his
coming
but
the
great
writer
really
had
been
expecting
him
not
only
that
day
but
the
day
before
and
the
day
before
that
three
days
before
he
had
handed
him
his
manuscript
merci
which
he
had
meant
to
read
at
the
literary
matine
at
yulia
mihailovnas
fte
he
had
done
this
out
of
amiability
fully
convinced
that
he
was
agreeably
flattering
the
young
mans
vanity
by
letting
him
read
the
great
work
beforehand
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
noticed
long
before
that
this
vainglorious
spoiled
gentleman
who
was
so
offensively
unapproachable
for
all
but
the
elect
this
writer
with
the
intellect
of
a
statesman
was
simply
trying
to
curry
favour
with
him
even
with
avidity
i
believe
the
young
man
guessed
at
last
that
karmazinov
considered
him
if
not
the
leader
of
the
whole
secret
revolutionary
movement
in
russia
at
least
one
of
those
most
deeply
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
the
russian
revolution
who
had
an
incontestable
influence
on
the
younger
generation
the
state
of
mind
of
the
cleverest
man
in
russia
interested
pyotr
stepanovitch
but
hitherto
he
had
for
certain
reasons
avoided
explaining
himself
the
great
writer
was
staying
in
the
house
belonging
to
his
sister
who
was
the
wife
of
a
kammerherr
and
had
an
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
both
she
and
her
husband
had
the
deepest
reverence
for
their
illustrious
relation
but
to
their
profound
regret
both
of
them
happened
to
be
in
moscow
at
the
time
of
his
visit
so
that
the
honour
of
receiving
him
fell
to
the
lot
of
an
old
lady
a
poor
relation
of
the
kammerherrs
who
had
for
years
lived
in
the
family
and
looked
after
the
housekeeping
all
the
household
had
moved
about
on
tiptoe
since
karmazinovs
arrival
the
old
lady
sent
news
to
moscow
almost
every
day
how
he
had
slept
what
he
had
deigned
to
eat
and
had
once
sent
a
telegram
to
announce
that
after
a
dinnerparty
at
the
mayors
he
was
obliged
to
take
a
spoonful
of
a
wellknown
medicine
she
rarely
plucked
up
courage
to
enter
his
room
though
he
behaved
courteously
to
her
but
dryly
and
only
talked
to
her
of
what
was
necessary
when
pyotr
stepanovitch
came
in
he
was
eating
his
morning
cutlet
with
half
a
glass
of
red
wine
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
been
to
see
him
before
and
always
found
him
eating
this
cutlet
which
he
finished
in
his
presence
without
ever
offering
him
anything
after
the
cutlet
a
little
cup
of
coffee
was
served
the
footman
who
brought
in
the
dishes
wore
a
swallowtail
coat
noiseless
boots
and
gloves
ha
ha
karmazinov
got
up
from
the
sofa
wiping
his
mouth
with
a
tablenapkin
and
came
forward
to
kiss
him
with
an
air
of
unmixed
delightafter
the
characteristic
fashion
of
russians
if
they
are
very
illustrious
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
knew
by
experience
that
though
karmazinov
made
a
show
of
kissing
him
he
really
only
proffered
his
cheek
and
so
this
time
he
did
the
same
the
cheeks
met
karmazinov
did
not
show
that
he
noticed
it
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
affably
offered
pyotr
stepanovitch
an
easy
chair
facing
him
in
which
the
latter
stretched
himself
at
once
you
dont
wouldnt
like
some
lunch
inquired
karmazinov
abandoning
his
usual
habit
but
with
an
air
of
course
which
would
prompt
a
polite
refusal
pyotr
stepanovitch
at
once
expressed
a
desire
for
lunch
a
shade
of
offended
surprise
darkened
the
face
of
his
host
but
only
for
an
instant
he
nervously
rang
for
the
servant
and
in
spite
of
all
his
breeding
raised
his
voice
scornfully
as
he
gave
orders
for
a
second
lunch
to
be
served
what
will
you
have
cutlet
or
coffee
he
asked
once
more
a
cutlet
and
coffee
and
tell
him
to
bring
some
more
wine
i
am
hungry
answered
pyotr
stepanovitch
calmly
scrutinising
his
hosts
attire
mr
karmazinov
was
wearing
a
sort
of
indoor
wadded
jacket
with
pearl
buttons
but
it
was
too
short
which
was
far
from
becoming
to
his
rather
comfortable
stomach
and
the
solid
curves
of
his
hips
but
tastes
differ
over
his
knees
he
had
a
checkered
woollen
plaid
reaching
to
the
floor
though
it
was
warm
in
the
room
are
you
unwell
commented
pyotr
stepanovitch
no
not
unwell
but
i
am
afraid
of
being
so
in
this
climate
answered
the
writer
in
his
squeaky
voice
though
he
uttered
each
word
with
a
soft
cadence
and
agreeable
gentlemanly
lisp
ive
been
expecting
you
since
yesterday
why
i
didnt
say
id
come
no
but
you
have
my
manuscript
have
you
read
it
manuscript
which
one
karmazinov
was
terribly
surprised
but
youve
brought
it
with
you
havent
you
he
was
so
disturbed
that
he
even
left
off
eating
and
looked
at
pyotr
stepanovitch
with
a
face
of
dismay
ah
that
bonjour
you
mean
merci
oh
all
right
id
quite
forgotten
it
and
hadnt
read

i
havent
had
time
i
really
dont
know
its
not
in
my
pockets
it
must
be
on
my
table
dont
be
uneasy
it
will
be
found
no
id
better
send
to
your
rooms
at
once
it
might
be
lost
besides
it
might
be
stolen
oh
whod
want
it
but
why
are
you
so
alarmed
why
yulia
mihailovna
told
me
you
always
have
several
copies
madeone
kept
at
a
notarys
abroad
another
in
petersburg
a
third
in
moscow
and
then
you
send
some
to
a
bank
i
believe
but
moscow
might
be
burnt
again
and
my
manuscript
with
it
no
id
better
send
at
once
stay
here
it
is
pyotr
stepanovitch
pulled
a
roll
of
notepaper
out
of
a
pocket
at
the
back
of
his
coat
its
a
little
crumpled
only
fancy
its
been
lying
there
with
my
pockethandkerchief
ever
since
i
took
it
from
you
i
forgot
it
karmazinov
greedily
snatched
the
manuscript
carefully
examined
it
counted
the
pages
and
laid
it
respectfully
beside
him
on
a
special
table
for
the
time
in
such
a
way
that
he
would
not
lose
sight
of
it
for
an
instant
you
dont
read
very
much
it
seems
he
hissed
unable
to
restrain
himself
no
not
very
much
and
nothing
in
the
way
of
russian
literature
in
the
way
of
russian
literature
let
me
see
i
have
read
something
on
the
way
or
away
or
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
something
of
the
sort
i
dont
remember
its
a
long
time
since
i
read
it
five
years
ago
ive
no
time
a
silence
followed
when
i
came
i
assured
every
one
that
you
were
a
very
intelligent
man
and
now
i
believe
every
one
here
is
wild
over
you
thank
you
pyotr
stepanovitch
answered
calmly
lunch
was
brought
in
pyotr
stepanovitch
pounced
on
the
cutlet
with
extraordinary
appetite
had
eaten
it
in
a
trice
tossed
off
the
wine
and
swallowed
his
coffee
this
boor
thought
karmazinov
looking
at
him
askance
as
he
munched
the
last
morsel
and
drained
the
last
dropsthis
boor
probably
understood
the
biting
taunt
in
my
words
and
no
doubt
he
has
read
the
manuscript
with
eagerness
he
is
simply
lying
with
some
object
but
possibly
he
is
not
lying
and
is
only
genuinely
stupid
i
like
a
genius
to
be
rather
stupid
maynt
he
be
a
sort
of
genius
among
them
devil
take
the
fellow
he
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
began
pacing
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
for
the
sake
of
exercise
as
he
always
did
after
lunch
leaving
here
soon
asked
pyotr
stepanovitch
from
his
easy
chair
lighting
a
cigarette
i
really
came
to
sell
an
estate
and
i
am
in
the
hands
of
my
bailiff
you
left
i
believe
because
they
expected
an
epidemic
out
there
after
the
war
nno
not
entirely
for
that
reason
mr
karmazinov
went
on
uttering
his
phrases
with
an
affable
intonation
and
each
time
he
turned
round
in
pacing
the
corner
there
was
a
faint
but
jaunty
quiver
of
his
right
leg
i
certainly
intend
to
live
as
long
as
i
can
he
laughed
not
without
venom
there
is
something
in
our
russian
nobility
that
makes
them
wear
out
very
quickly
from
every
point
of
view
but
i
wish
to
wear
out
as
late
as
possible
and
now
i
am
going
abroad
for
good
there
the
climate
is
better
the
houses
are
of
stone
and
everything
stronger
europe
will
last
my
time
i
think
what
do
you
think
how
can
i
tell
hm
if
the
babylon
out
there
really
does
fall
and
great
will
be
the
fall
thereof
about
which
i
quite
agree
with
you
yet
i
think
it
will
last
my
time
theres
nothing
to
fall
here
in
russia
comparatively
speaking
there
wont
be
stones
to
fall
everything
will
crumble
into
dirt
holy
russia
has
less
power
of
resistance
than
anything
in
the
world
the
russian
peasantry
is
still
held
together
somehow
by
the
russian
god
but
according
to
the
latest
accounts
the
russian
god
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
and
scarcely
survived
the
emancipation
it
certainly
gave
him
a
severe
shock
and
now
what
with
railways
what
with
you
ive
no
faith
in
the
russian
god
and
how
about
the
european
one
i
dont
believe
in
any
ive
been
slandered
to
the
youth
of
russia
ive
always
sympathised
with
every
movement
among
them
i
was
shown
the
manifestoes
here
every
one
looks
at
them
with
perplexity
because
they
are
frightened
at
the
way
things
are
put
in
them
but
every
one
is
convinced
of
their
power
even
if
they
dont
admit
it
to
themselves
everybody
has
been
rolling
downhill
and
every
one
has
known
for
ages
that
they
have
nothing
to
clutch
at
i
am
persuaded
of
the
success
of
this
mysterious
propaganda
if
only
because
russia
is
now
preeminently
the
place
in
all
the
world
where
anything
you
like
may
happen
without
any
opposition
i
understand
only
too
well
why
wealthy
russians
all
flock
abroad
and
more
and
more
so
every
year
its
simply
instinct
if
the
ship
is
sinking
the
rats
are
the
first
to
leave
it
holy
russia
is
a
country
of
wood
of
poverty
and
of
danger
the
country
of
ambitious
beggars
in
its
upper
classes
while
the
immense
majority
live
in
poky
little
huts
she
will
be
glad
of
any
way
of
escape
you
have
only
to
present
it
to
her
its
only
the
government
that
still
means
to
resist
but
it
brandishes
its
cudgel
in
the
dark
and
hits
its
own
men
everything
here
is
doomed
and
awaiting
the
end
russia
as
she
is
has
no
future
i
have
become
a
german
and
i
am
proud
of
it
but
you
began
about
the
manifestoes
tell
me
everything
how
do
you
look
at
them
every
one
is
afraid
of
them
so
they
must
be
influential
they
openly
unmask
what
is
false
and
prove
that
there
is
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
among
us
and
nothing
to
lean
upon
they
speak
aloud
while
all
is
silent
what
is
most
effective
about
them
in
spite
of
their
style
is
the
incredible
boldness
with
which
they
look
the
truth
straight
in
the
face
to
look
facts
straight
in
the
face
is
only
possible
to
russians
of
this
generation
no
in
europe
they
are
not
yet
so
bold
it
is
a
realm
of
stone
there
there
is
still
something
to
lean
upon
so
far
as
i
see
and
am
able
to
judge
the
whole
essence
of
the
russian
revolutionary
idea
lies
in
the
negation
of
honour
i
like
its
being
so
boldly
and
fearlessly
expressed
no
in
europe
they
wouldnt
understand
it
yet
but
thats
just
what
we
shall
clutch
at
for
a
russian
a
sense
of
honour
is
only
a
superfluous
burden
and
it
always
has
been
a
burden
through
all
his
history
the
open
right
to
dishonour
will
attract
him
more
than
anything
i
belong
to
the
older
generation
and
i
must
confess
still
cling
to
honour
but
only
from
habit
it
is
only
that
i
prefer
the
old
forms
granted
its
from
timidity
you
see
one
must
live
somehow
whats
left
of
ones
life
he
suddenly
stopped
i
am
talking
he
thought
while
he
holds
his
tongue
and
watches
me
he
has
come
to
make
me
ask
him
a
direct
question
and
i
shall
ask
him
yulia
mihailovna
asked
me
by
some
stratagem
to
find
out
from
you
what
the
surprise
is
that
you
are
preparing
for
the
ball
tomorrow
pyotr
stepanovitch
asked
suddenly
yes
there
really
will
be
a
surprise
and
i
certainly
shall
astonish
said
karmazinov
with
increased
dignity
but
i
wont
tell
you
what
the
secret
is
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
not
insist
there
is
a
young
man
here
called
shatov
observed
the
great
writer
would
you
believe
it
i
havent
seen
him
a
very
nice
person
what
about
him
oh
nothing
he
talks
about
something
isnt
he
the
person
who
gave
stavrogin
that
slap
in
the
face
yes
and
whats
your
opinion
of
stavrogin
i
dont
know
he
is
such
a
flirt
karmazinov
detested
stavrogin
because
it
was
the
latters
habit
not
to
take
any
notice
of
him
that
flirt
he
said
chuckling
if
what
is
advocated
in
your
manifestoes
ever
comes
to
pass
will
be
the
first
to
be
hanged
perhaps
before
pyotr
stepanovitch
said
suddenly
quite
right
too
karmazinov
assented
not
laughing
and
with
pronounced
gravity
you
have
said
so
once
before
and
do
you
know
i
repeated
it
to
him
what
you
surely
didnt
repeat
it
karmazinov
laughed
again
he
said
that
if
he
were
to
be
hanged
it
would
be
enough
for
you
to
be
flogged
not
simply
as
a
complement
but
to
hurt
as
they
flog
the
peasants
pyotr
stepanovitch
took
his
hat
and
got
up
from
his
seat
karmazinov
held
out
both
hands
to
him
at
parting
and
what
if
all
that
you
are
plotting
for
is
destined
to
come
to
pass
he
piped
suddenly
in
a
honeyed
voice
with
a
peculiar
intonation
still
holding
his
hands
in
his
how
soon
could
it
come
about
how
could
i
tell
pyotr
stepanovitch
answered
rather
roughly
they
looked
intently
into
each
others
eyes
at
a
guess
approximately
karmazinov
piped
still
more
sweetly
youll
have
time
to
sell
your
estate
and
time
to
clear
out
too
pyotr
stepanovitch
muttered
still
more
roughly
they
looked
at
one
another
even
more
intently
there
was
a
minute
of
silence
it
will
begin
early
next
may
and
will
be
over
by
october
pyotr
stepanovitch
said
suddenly
i
thank
you
sincerely
karmazinov
pronounced
in
a
voice
saturated
with
feeling
pressing
his
hands
you
will
have
time
to
get
out
of
the
ship
you
rat
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
thinking
as
he
went
out
into
the
street
well
if
that
imperial
intellect
inquires
so
confidently
of
the
day
and
the
hour
and
thanks
me
so
respectfully
for
the
information
i
have
given
we
mustnt
doubt
of
ourselves
he
grinned
hm
but
he
really
isnt
stupid
and
he
is
simply
a
rat
escaping
men
like
that
dont
tell
tales
he
ran
to
filipovs
house
in
bogoyavlensky
street
vi
pyotr
stepanovitch
went
first
to
kirillovs
he
found
him
as
usual
alone
and
at
the
moment
practising
gymnastics
that
is
standing
with
his
legs
apart
brandishing
his
arms
above
his
head
in
a
peculiar
way
on
the
floor
lay
a
ball
the
tea
stood
cold
on
the
table
not
cleared
since
breakfast
pyotr
stepanovitch
stood
for
a
minute
on
the
threshold
you
are
very
anxious
about
your
health
it
seems
he
said
in
a
loud
and
cheerful
tone
going
into
the
room
what
a
jolly
ball
though
foo
how
it
bounces
is
that
for
gymnastics
too
kirillov
put
on
his
coat
yes
thats
for
the
good
of
my
health
too
he
muttered
dryly
sit
down
im
only
here
for
a
minute
still
ill
sit
down
health
is
all
very
well
but
ive
come
to
remind
you
of
our
agreement
the
appointed
time
is
approaching
in
a
certain
sense
he
concluded
awkwardly
what
agreement
how
can
you
ask
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
startled
and
even
dismayed
its
not
an
agreement
and
not
an
obligation
i
have
not
bound
myself
in
any
way
its
a
mistake
on
your
part
i
say
whats
this
youre
doing
pyotr
stepanovitch
jumped
up
what
i
choose
what
do
you
choose
the
same
as
before
how
am
i
to
understand
that
does
that
mean
that
you
are
in
the
same
mind
yes
only
theres
no
agreement
and
never
has
been
and
i
have
not
bound
myself
in
any
way
i
could
do
as
i
like
and
i
can
still
do
as
i
like
kirillov
explained
himself
curtly
and
contemptuously
i
agree
i
agree
be
as
free
as
you
like
if
you
dont
change
your
mind
pyotr
stepanovitch
sat
down
again
with
a
satisfied
air
you
are
angry
over
a
word
youve
become
very
irritable
of
late
thats
why
ive
avoided
coming
to
see
you
i
was
quite
sure
though
you
would
be
loyal
i
dislike
you
very
much
but
you
can
be
perfectly
surethough
i
dont
regard
it
as
loyalty
and
disloyalty
but
do
you
know
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
startled
again
we
must
talk
things
over
thoroughly
again
so
as
not
to
get
in
a
muddle
the
business
needs
accuracy
and
you
keep
giving
me
such
shocks
will
you
let
me
speak
speak
snapped
kirillov
looking
away
you
made
up
your
mind
long
ago
to
take
your
life
i
mean
you
had
the
idea
in
your
mind
is
that
the
right
expression
is
there
any
mistake
about
that
i
have
the
same
idea
still
excellent
take
note
that
no
one
has
forced
it
on
you
rather
not
what
nonsense
you
talk
i
dare
say
i
express
it
very
stupidly
of
course
it
would
be
very
stupid
to
force
anybody
to
it
ill
go
on
you
were
a
member
of
the
society
before
its
organisation
was
changed
and
confessed
it
to
one
of
the
members
i
didnt
confess
it
i
simply
said
so
quite
so
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
confess
such
a
thing
what
a
confession
you
simply
said
so
excellent
no
its
not
excellent
for
you
are
being
tedious
i
am
not
obliged
to
give
you
any
account
of
myself
and
you
cant
understand
my
ideas
i
want
to
put
an
end
to
my
life
because
thats
my
idea
because
i
dont
want
to
be
afraid
of
death
because
because
theres
no
need
for
you
to
know
what
do
you
want
would
you
like
tea
its
cold
let
me
get
you
another
glass
pyotr
stepanovitch
actually
had
taken
up
the
teapot
and
was
looking
for
an
empty
glass
kirillov
went
to
the
cupboard
and
brought
a
clean
glass
ive
just
had
lunch
at
karmazinovs
observed
his
visitor
then
i
listened
to
him
talking
and
perspired
and
got
into
a
sweat
again
running
here
i
am
fearfully
thirsty
drink
cold
tea
is
good
kirillov
sat
down
on
his
chair
again
and
again
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
farthest
corner
the
idea
had
arisen
in
the
society
he
went
on
in
the
same
voice
that
i
might
be
of
use
if
i
killed
myself
and
that
when
you
get
up
some
bit
of
mischief
here
and
they
are
looking
for
the
guilty
i
might
suddenly
shoot
myself
and
leave
a
letter
saying
i
did
it
all
so
that
you
might
escape
suspicion
for
another
year
for
a
few
days
anyway
one
day
is
precious
good
so
for
that
reason
they
asked
me
if
i
would
to
wait
i
said
id
wait
till
the
society
fixed
the
day
because
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
yes
but
remember
that
you
bound
yourself
not
to
make
up
your
last
letter
without
me
and
that
in
russia
you
would
be
at
my
well
at
my
disposition
that
is
for
that
purpose
only
i
need
hardly
say
in
everything
else
of
course
you
are
free
pyotr
stepanovitch
added
almost
amiably
i
didnt
bind
myself
i
agreed
because
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
good
good
i
have
no
intention
of
wounding
your
vanity
but
its
not
a
question
of
vanity
but
remember
that
a
hundred
and
twenty
thalers
were
collected
for
your
journey
so
youve
taken
money
not
at
all
kirillov
fired
up
the
money
was
not
on
that
condition
one
doesnt
take
money
for
that
people
sometimes
do
thats
a
lie
i
sent
a
letter
from
petersburg
and
in
petersburg
i
paid
you
a
hundred
and
twenty
thalers
i
put
it
in
your
hand
and
it
has
been
sent
off
there
unless
youve
kept
it
for
yourself
all
right
all
right
i
dont
dispute
anything
it
has
been
sent
off
all
that
matters
is
that
you
are
still
in
the
same
mind
exactly
the
same
when
you
come
and
tell
me
its
time
ill
carry
it
all
out
will
it
be
very
soon
not
very
many
days
but
remember
well
make
up
the
letter
together
the
same
night
the
same
day
if
you
like
you
say
i
must
take
the
responsibility
for
the
manifestoes
on
myself
and
something
else
too
i
am
not
going
to
make
myself
out
responsible
for
everything
what
wont
you
be
responsible
for
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
again
what
i
dont
choose
thats
enough
i
dont
want
to
talk
about
it
any
more
pyotr
stepanovitch
controlled
himself
and
changed
the
subject
to
speak
of
something
else
he
began
will
you
be
with
us
this
evening
its
virginskys
nameday
thats
the
pretext
for
our
meeting
i
dont
want
to
do
me
a
favour
do
come
you
must
we
must
impress
them
by
our
number
and
our
looks
you
have
a
face
well
in
one
word
you
have
a
fateful
face
you
think
so
laughed
kirillov
very
well
ill
come
but
not
for
the
sake
of
my
face
what
time
is
it
oh
quite
early
halfpast
six
and
you
know
you
can
go
in
sit
down
and
not
speak
to
any
one
however
many
there
may
be
there
only
i
say
dont
forget
to
bring
pencil
and
paper
with
you
whats
that
for
why
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
and
its
my
special
request
youll
only
have
to
sit
still
speaking
to
no
one
listen
and
sometimes
seem
to
make
a
note
you
can
draw
something
if
you
like
what
nonsense
what
for
why
since
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
you
keep
saying
that
its
just
the
same
to
you
no
what
for
why
because
that
member
of
the
society
the
inspector
has
stopped
at
moscow
and
i
told
some
of
them
here
that
possibly
the
inspector
may
turn
up
tonight
and
theyll
think
that
you
are
the
inspector
and
as
youve
been
here
three
weeks
already
theyll
be
still
more
surprised

a
member
of
the
society
yourself
tell
them
i
am
the
inspector
ill
sit
still
and
hold
my
tongue
but
i
wont
have
the
pencil
and
paper
but
why
i
dont
want
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
really
angry
he

positively
green
but

controlled
himself

up
and
took

i
may

the
back
pocket
of
his
coat
but
ill
give
you

against
stavrogin
kirillov
muttered
after
his
guest
as
he
saw
him
out
the
latter
looked
at
him
in
amazement
but
did
not
answer
kirillovs
last
words
perplexed
pyotr
stepanovitch
extremely
he
had
not
time
yet
to
discover
their
meaning
but
even
while
he
was
on
the
stairs
of
shatovs
lodging
he
tried
to
remove
all
trace
of
annoyance
and
to
assume
an
amiable
expression
shatov
was
at
home
and
rather
unwell
he
was
lying
on
his
bed
though
dressed
what
bad
luck
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
out
in
the
doorway
are
you
really
ill
the
amiable
expression
of
his
face
suddenly
vanished
there
was
a
gleam
of
spite
in
his
eyes
not
at
all
shatov
jumped
up
nervously
i
am
not
ill
at
all
a
little
headache
he
was
disconcerted
the
sudden
appearance
of
such
a
visitor
positively
alarmed
him
you
mustnt
be
ill
for
the
job
ive
come
about
pyotr
stepanovitch
began
quickly
and
as
it
were
peremptorily
allow
me
to
sit
down
he
sat
down
and
you
sit
down
again
on
your
bedstead
thats
right
there
will
be
a
party
of
our
fellows
at
virginskys
tonight
on
the
pretext
of
his
birthday
it
will
have
no
political
character
howeverweve
seen
to
that
i
am
coming
with
nikolay
stavrogin
i
would
not
of
course
have
dragged
you
there
knowing
your
way
of
thinking
at
present
simply
to
save
your
being
worried
not
because
we
think
you
would
betray
us
but
as
things
have
turned
out
you
will
have
to
go
youll
meet
there
the
very
people
with
whom
we
shall
finally
settle
how
you
are
to
leave
the
society
and
to
whom
you
are
to
hand
over
what
is
in
your
keeping
well
do
it
without
being
noticed
ill
take
you
aside
into
a
corner
therell
be
a
lot
of
people
and
theres
no
need
for
every
one
to
know
i
must
confess
ive
had
to
keep
my
tongue
wagging
on
your
behalf
but
now
i
believe
theyve
agreed
on
condition
you
hand
over
the
printing
press
and
all
the
papers
of
course
then
you
can
go
where
you
please
shatov
listened
frowning
and
resentful
the
nervous
alarm
of
a
moment
before
had
entirely
left
him
i
dont
acknowledge
any
sort
of
obligation
to
give
an
account
to
the
devil
knows
whom
he
declared
definitely
no
one
has
the
authority
to
set
me
free
not
quite
so
a
great
deal
has
been
entrusted
to
you
you
hadnt
the
right
to
break
off
simply
besides
you
made
no
clear
statement
about
it
so
that
you
put
them
in
an
ambiguous
position
i
stated
my
position
clearly
by
letter
as
soon
as
i
arrived
here
no
it
wasnt
clear
pyotr
stepanovitch
retorted
calmly
i
sent
you
a
noble
personality
to
be
printed
here
and
meaning
the
copies
to
be
kept
here
till
they
were
wanted
and
the
two
manifestoes
as
well
you
returned
them
with
an
ambiguous
letter
which
explained
nothing
i
refused
definitely
to
print
them
well
not
definitely
you
wrote
that
you
couldnt
but
you
didnt
explain
for
what
reason
i
cant
doesnt
mean
i
dont
want
to
it
might
be
supposed
that
you
were
simply
unable
through
circumstances
that
was
how
they
took
it
and
considered
that
you
still
meant
to
keep
up
your
connection
with
the
society
so
that
they
might
have
entrusted
something
to
you
again
and
so
have
compromised
themselves
they
say
here
that
you
simply
meant
to
deceive
them
so
that
you
might
betray
them
when
you
got
hold
of
something
important
i
have
defended
you
to
the
best
of
my
powers
and
have
shown
your
brief
note
as
evidence
in
your
favour
but
i
had
to
admit
on
rereading
those
two
lines
that
they
were
misleading
and
not
conclusive
you
kept
that
note
so
carefully
then
my
keeping
it
means
nothing
ive
got
it
still
well
i
dont
care
damn
it
shatov
cried
furiously
your
fools
may
consider
that
ive
betrayed
them
if
they
likewhat
is
it
to
me
i
should
like
to
see
what
you
can
do
to
me
your
name
would
be
noted
and
at
the
first
success
of
the
revolution
you
would
be
hanged
thats
when
you
get
the
upper
hand
and
dominate
russia
you
neednt
laugh
i
tell
you
again
i
stood
up
for
you
anyway
i
advise
you
to
turn
up
today
why
waste
words
through
false
pride
isnt
it
better
to
part
friends
in
any
case
youll
have
to
give
up
the
printing
press
and
the
old
type
and
papersthats
what
we
must
talk
about
ill
come
shatov
muttered
looking
down
thoughtfully
pyotr
stepanovitch
glanced
askance
at
him
from
his
place
will
stavrogin
be
there
shatov
asked
suddenly
raising
his
head
he
is
certain
to
be
ha
ha
again
they
were
silent
for
a
minute
shatov
grinned
disdainfully
and
irritably
and
that
contemptible
noble
personality
of
yours
that
i
wouldnt
print
here
has
it
been
printed
he
asked
yes
to
make
the
schoolboys
believe
that
herzen
himself
had
written
it
in
your
album
yes
herzen
himself
again
they
were
silent
for
three
minutes
at
last
shatov
got
up
from
the
bed
go
out
of
my
room
i
dont
care
to
sit
with
you
im
going
pyotr
stepanovitch
brought
out
with
positive
alacrity
getting
up
at
once
only
one
word
kirillov
is
quite
alone
in
the
lodge
now
isnt
he
without
a
servant
quite
alone
get
along
i
cant
stand
being
in
the
same
room
with
you
well
you
are
a
pleasant
customer
now
pyotr
stepanovitch
reflected
gaily
as
he
went
out
into
the
street
and
you
will
be
pleasant
this
evening
too
and
that
just
suits
me
nothing
better
could
be
wished
nothing
better
could
be
wished
the
russian
god
himself
seems
helping
me
vii
he
had
probably
been
very
busy
that
day
on
all
sorts
of
errands
and
probably
with
success
which
was
reflected
in
the
selfsatisfied
expression
of
his
face
when
at
six
oclock
that
evening
he
turned
up
at
stavrogins
but
he
was
not
at
once
admitted
stavrogin
had
just
locked
himself
in
the
study
with
mavriky
nikolaevitch
this
news
instantly
made
pyotr
stepanovitch
anxious
he
seated
himself
close
to
the
study
door
to
wait
for
the
visitor
to
go
away
he
could
hear
conversation
but
could
not
catch
the
words
the
visit
did
not
last
long
soon
he
heard
a
noise
the
sound
of
an
extremely
loud
and
abrupt
voice
then
the
door
opened
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
came
out
with
a
very
pale
face
he
did
not
notice
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
quickly
passed
by
pyotr
stepanovitch
instantly
ran
into
the
study
i
cannot
omit
a
detailed
account
of
the
very
brief
interview
that
had
taken
place
between
the
two
rivalsan
interview
which
might
well
have
seemed
impossible
under
the
circumstances
but
which
had
yet
taken
place
this
is
how
it
had
come
about
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
been
enjoying
an
afterdinner
nap
on
the
couch
in
his
study
when
alexey
yegorytch
had
announced
the
unexpected
visitor
hearing
the
name
he
had
positively
leapt
up
unwilling
to
believe
it
but
soon
a
smile
gleamed
on
his
lipsa
smile
of
haughty
triumph
and
at
the
same
time
of
a
blank
incredulous
wonder
the
visitor
mavriky
nikolaevitch
seemed
struck
by
the
expression
of
that
smile
as
he
came
in
anyway
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
as
though
uncertain
whether
to
come
further
in
or
to
turn
back
stavrogin
succeeded
at
once
in
transforming
the
expression
of
his
face
and
with
an
air
of
grave
surprise
took
a
step
towards
him
the
visitor
did
not
take
his
outstretched
hand
but
awkwardly
moved
a
chair
and
not
uttering
a
word
sat
down
without
waiting
for
his
host
to
do
so
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
sat
down
on
the
sofa
facing
him
obliquely
and
looking
at
mavriky
nikolaevitch
waited
in
silence
if
you
can
marry
lizaveta
nikolaevna
mavriky
nikolaevitch
brought
out
suddenly
at
last
and
what
was
most
curious
it
was
impossible
to
tell
from
his
tone
whether
it
was
an
entreaty
a
recommendation
a
surrender
or
a
command
stavrogin
still
remained
silent
but
the
visitor
had
evidently
said
all
he
had
come
to
say
and
gazed
at
him
persistently
waiting
for
an
answer
if
i
am
not
mistaken
but
its
quite
certain
lizaveta
nikolaevna
is
already
betrothed
to
you
stavrogin
said
at
last
promised
and
betrothed
mavriky
nikolaevitch
assented
firmly
and
clearly
you
have
quarrelled
excuse
me
mavriky
nikolaevitch
no
she
loves
and
respects
me
those
are
her
words
her
words
are
more
precious
than
anything
of
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
let
me
tell
you
if
she
were
standing
in
the
church
at
her
wedding
and
you
were
to
call
her
shed
give
up
me
and
every
one
and
go
to
you
from
the
wedding
yes
and
after
the
wedding
arent
you
making
a
mistake
no
under
her
persistent
sincere
and
intense
hatred
for
you
love
is
flashing
out
at
every
moment
and
madness
the
sincerest
infinite
love
and
madness
on
the
contrary
behind
the
love
she
feels
for
me
which
is
sincere
too
every
moment
there
are
flashes
of
hatred
the
most
intense
hatred
i
could
never
have
fancied
all
these
transitions
before
but
i
wonder
though
how
could
you
come
here
and
dispose
of
the
hand
of
lizaveta
nikolaevna
have
you
the
right
to
do
so
has
she
authorised
you
mavriky
nikolaevitch
frowned
and
for
a
minute
he
looked
down
thats
all
words
on
your
part
he
brought
out
suddenly
words
of
revenge
and
triumph
i
am
sure
you
can
read
between
the
lines
and
is
this
the
time
for
petty
vanity
havent
you
satisfaction
enough
must
i
really
dot
my
is
and
go
into
it
all
very
well
i
will
dot
my
is
if
you
are
so
anxious
for
my
humiliation
i
have
no
right
its
impossible
for
me
to
be
authorised
lizaveta
nikolaevna
knows
nothing
about
it
and
her
betrothed
has
finally
lost
his
senses
and
is
only
fit
for
a
madhouse
and
to
crown
everything
has
come
to
tell
you
so
himself
you
are
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
can
make
her
happy
and
i
am
the
one
to
make
her
unhappy
you
are
trying
to
get
her
you
are
pursuing
her
buti
dont
know
whyyou
wont
marry
her
if
its
because
of
a
lovers
quarrel
abroad
and
i
must
be
sacrificed
to
end
it
sacrifice
me
she
is
too
unhappy
and
i
cant
endure
it
my
words
are
not
a
sanction
not
a
prescription
and
so
its
no
slur
on
your
pride
if
you
care
to
take
my
place
at
the
altar
you
can
do
it
without
any
sanction
from
me
and
there
is
no
ground
for
me
to
come
to
you
with
a
mad
proposal
especially
as
our
marriage
is
utterly
impossible
after
the
step
i
am
taking
now
i
cannot
lead
her
to
the
altar
feeling
myself
an
abject
wretch
what
i
am
doing
here
and
my
handing
her
over
to
you
perhaps
her
bitterest
foe
is
to
my
mind
something
so
abject
that
i
shall
never
get
over
it
will
you
shoot
yourself
on
our
wedding
day
no
much
later
why
stain
her
bridal
dress
with
my
blood
perhaps
i
shall
not
shoot
myself
at
all
either
now
or
later
i
suppose
you
want
to
comfort
me
by
saying
that
you
what
would
the
blood
of
one
more
mean
to
you
he
turned
pale
and
his
eyes
gleamed
a
minute
of
silence
followed
excuse
me
for
the
questions
ive
asked
you
stavrogin
began
again
some
of
them
i
had
no
business
to
ask
you
but
one
of
them
i
think
i
have
every
right
to
put
to
you
tell
me
what
facts
have
led
you
to
form
a
conclusion
as
to
my
feelings
for
lizaveta
nikolaevna
i
mean
to
a
conviction
of
a
degree
of
feeling
on
my
part
as
would
justify
your
coming
here
and
risking
such
a
proposal
what
mavriky
nikolaevitch
positively
started
havent
you
been
trying
to
win
her
arent
you
trying
to
win
her
and
dont
you
want
to
win
her
generally
speaking
i
cant
speak
of
my
feeling
for
this
woman
or
that
to
a
third
person
or
to
anyone
except
the
woman
herself
you
must
excuse
it
its
a
constitutional
peculiarity
but
to
make
up
for
it
ill
tell
you
the
truth
about
everything
else
i
am
married
and
its
impossible
for
me
either
to
marry
or
to
try
to
win
anyone
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
so
astounded
that
he
started
back
in
his
chair
and
for
some
time
stared
fixedly
into
stavrogins
face
only
fancy
i
never
thought
of
that
he
muttered
you
said
then
that
morning
that
you
were
not
married
and
so
i
believed
you
were
not
married
he
turned
terribly
pale
suddenly
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
with
all
his
might
if
after
that
confession
you
dont
leave
lizaveta
nikolaevna
alone
if
you
make
her
unhappy
ill
kill
you
with
my
stick
like
a
dog
in
a
ditch
he
jumped
up
and
walked
quickly
out
of
the
room
pyotr
stepanovitch
running
in
found
his
host
in
a
most
unexpected
frame
of
mind
ah
thats
you
stavrogin
laughed
loudly
his
laughter
seemed
to
be
provoked
simply
by
the
appearance
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
as
he
ran
in
with
such
impulsive
curiosity
were
you
listening
at
the
door
wait
a
bit
what
have
you
come
about
i
promised
you
something
didnt
i
ah
bah
i
remember
to
meet
our
fellows
let
us
go
i
am
delighted
you
couldnt
have
thought
of
anything
more
appropriate
he
snatched
up
his
hat
and
they
both
went
at
once
out
of
the
house
are
you
laughing
beforehand
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
our
fellows
chirped
gaily
pyotr
stepanovitch
dodging
round
him
with
obsequious
alacrity
at
one
moment
trying
to
walk
beside
his
companion
on
the
narrow
brick
pavement
and
at
the
next
running
right
into
the
mud
of
the
road
for
stavrogin
walked
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
without
observing
that
he
left
no
room
for
anyone
else
i
am
not
laughing
at
all
he
answered
loudly
and
gaily
on
the
contrary
i
am
sure
that
you
have
the
most
serious
set
of
people
there
surly
dullards
as
you
once
deigned
to
express
it
nothing
is
more
amusing
sometimes
than
a
surly
dullard
ah
you
mean
mavriky
nikolaevitch
i
am
convinced
he
came
to
give
up
his
betrothed
to
you
eh
i
egged
him
on
to
do
it
indirectly
would
you
believe
it
and
if
he
doesnt
give
her
up
well
take
her
anyway
wont
weeh
pyotr
stepanovitch
knew
no
doubt
that
he
was
running
some
risk
in
venturing
on
such
sallies
but
when
he
was
excited
he
preferred
to
risk
anything
rather
than
to
remain
in
uncertainty
stavrogin
only
laughed
you
still
reckon
youll
help
me
he
asked
if
you
call
me
but
you
know
theres
one
way
and
the
best
one
do
i
know
your
way
oh
no
thats
a
secret
for
the
time
only
remember
a
secret
has
its
price
i
know
what
it
costs
stavrogin
muttered
to
himself
but
he
restrained
himself
and
was
silent
what
it
costs
what
did
you
say
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
startled
i
said
damn
you
and
your
secret
youd
better
be
telling
me
who
will
be
there
i
know
that
we
are
going
to
a
nameday
party
but
who
will
be
there
oh
all
sorts
even
kirillov
all
members
of
circles
hang
it
all
you
are
in
a
hurry
theres
not
one
circle
formed
yet
how
did
you
manage
to
distribute
so
many
manifestoes
then
where
we
are
going
only
four
are
members
of
the
circle
the
others
on
probation
are
spying
on
one
another
with
jealous
eagerness
and
bring
reports
to
me
they
are
a
trustworthy
set
its
all
material
which
we
must
organise
and
then
we
must
clear
out
but
you
wrote
the
rules
yourself
theres
no
need
to
explain
are
things
going
badly
then
is
there
a
hitch
going
couldnt
be
better
it
will
amuse
you
the
first
thing
which
has
a
tremendous
effect
is
giving
them
titles
nothing
has
more
influence
than
a
title
i
invent
ranks
and
duties
on
purpose
i
have
secretaries
secret
spies
treasurers
presidents
registrars
their
assistantsthey
like
it
awfully
its
taken
capitally
then
the
next
force
is
sentimentalism
of
course
you
know
amongst
us
socialism
spreads
principally
through
sentimentalism
but
the
trouble
is
these
lieutenants
who
bite
sometimes
you
put
your
foot
in
it
then
come
the
outandout
rogues
well
they
are
a
good
sort
if
you
like
and
sometimes
very
useful
but
they
waste
a
lot
of
ones
time
they
want
incessant
looking
after
and
the
most
important
force
of
allthe
cement
that
holds
everything
togetheris
their
being
ashamed
of
having
an
opinion
of
their
own
that
is
a
force
and
whose
work
is
it
whose
precious
achievement
is
it
that
not
one
idea
of
their
own
is
left
in
their
heads
they
think
originality
a
disgrace
if
so
why
do
you
take
so
much
trouble
why
if
people
lie
simply
gaping
at
every
one
how
can
you
resist
annexing
them
can
you
seriously
refuse
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
success
yes
you
have
the
faith
but
one
wants
will
its
just
with
people
like
this
that
success
is
possible
i
tell
you
i
could
make
them
go
through
fire
one
has
only
to
din
it
into
them
that
they
are
not
advanced
enough
the
fools
reproach
me
that
i
have
taken
in
every
one
here
over
the
central
committee
and
the
innumerable
branches
you
once
blamed
me
for
it
yourself
but
wheres
the
deception
you
and
i
are
the
central
committee
and
there
will
be
as
many
branches
as
we
like
and
always
the
same
sort
of
rabble
raw
material
even
they
will
be
of
use
and
you
are
still
reckoning
on
me
you
are
the
chief
you
are
the
head
i
shall
only
be
a
subordinate
your
secretary
we
shall
take
to
our
barque
you
know
the
oars
are
of
maple
the
sails

at

you
my
version
there
you
reckon
on
your
fingers
the
forces
that
make
up
the
circles
all
that
business
of
titles
and
sentimentalism
is
a
very
good
cement
but
there
is
something
better
persuade
four
members
of
the
circle
to
do
for
a
fifth
on
the
pretence
that
he
is
a
traitor
and
youll
tie
them
all
together
with
the
blood
theyve
shed
as
though
it
were
a
knot
theyll
be
your
slaves
they
wont
dare
to
rebel
or
call
you
to
account
ha
ha
ha
but
you
you
shall
pay
for
those
words
pyotr
stepanovitch
thought
to
himself
and
this
very
evening
in
fact
you
go
too
far
this
or
something
like
this
must
have
been
pyotr
stepanovitchs
reflection
they
were
approaching
virginskys
house
youve
represented
me
no
doubt
as
a
member
from
abroad
an
inspector
in
connection
with
the
internationale
stavrogin
asked
suddenly
no
not
an
inspector
you
wont
be
an
inspector
but
you
are
one
of
the
original
members
from
abroad
who
knows
the
most
important
secretsthats
your
rle
you
are
going
to
speak
of
course
whats
put
that
idea
into
your
head
now
you
are
bound
to
speak
stavrogin
positively
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
street
in
surprise
not
far
from
a
street
lamp
pyotr
stepanovitch
faced
his
scrutiny
calmly
and
defiantly
stavrogin
cursed
and
went
on
and
are
you
going
to
speak
he
suddenly
asked
pyotr
stepanovitch
no
i
am
going
to
listen
to
you
damn
you
you
really
are
giving
me
an
idea
what
idea
pyotr
stepanovitch
asked
quickly
perhaps
i
will
speak
there
but
afterwards
i
will
give
you
a
hidingand
a
sound
one
too
you
know
by
the
way
i
told
karmazinov
this
morning
that
you
said
he
ought
to
be
thrashed
and
not
simply
as
a
form
but
to
hurt
as
they
flog
peasants
but
i
never
said
such
a
thing
ha
ha
no
matter
se
non

vero
well
thanks
i
am
truly
obliged
and
another
thing
do
you
know
karmazinov
says
that
the
essence
of
our
creed
is
the
negation
of
honour
and
that
by
the
open
advocacy
of
a
right
to
be
dishonourable
a
russian
can
be
won
over
more
easily
than
by
anything
an
excellent
saying
golden
words
cried
stavrogin
hes
hit
the
mark
there
the
right
to
dishonourwhy
theyd
all
flock
to
us
for
that
not
one
would
stay
behind
and
listen
verhovensky
you
are
not
one
of
the
higher
police

anyone
who
has
a
question
like
that
in
his
mind

but
we
are

chapter
vii
a
meeting
i
virginsky
lived
in
his
own
house
or
rather
his
wifes
in
muravyin
street
it
was
a
wooden
house
of
one
story
and
there
were
no
lodgers
in
it
on
the
pretext
of
virginskysnameday
party
about
fifteen
guests
were
assembled
but
the
entertainment
was
not
in
the
least
like
an
ordinary
provincial
nameday
party
from
the
very
beginning
of
their
married
life
the
husband
and
wife
had
agreed
once
for
all
that
it
was
utterly
stupid
to
invite
friends
to
celebrate
namedays
and
that
there
is
nothing
to
rejoice
about
in
fact
in
a
few
years
they
had
succeeded
in
completely
cutting
themselves
off
from
all
society
though
he
was
a
man
of
some
ability
and
by
no
means
very
poor
he
somehow
seemed
to
every
one
an
eccentric
fellow
who
was
fond
of
solitude
and
whats
more
stuck
up
in
conversation
madame
virginsky
was
a
midwife
by
professionand
by
that
very
fact
was
on
the
lowest
rung
of
the
social
ladder
lower
even
than
the
priests
wife
in
spite
of
her
husbands
rank
as
an
officer
but
she
was
conspicuously
lacking
in
the
humility
befitting
her
position
and
after
her
very
stupid
and
unpardonably
open
liaison
on
principle
with
captain
lebyadkin
a
notorious
rogue
even
the
most
indulgent
of
our
ladies
turned
away
from
her
with
marked
contempt
but
madame
virginsky
accepted
all
this
as
though
it
were
what
she
wanted
it
is
remarkable
that
those
very
ladies
applied
to
arina
prohorovna
that
is
madame
virginsky
when
they
were
in
an
interesting
condition
rather
than
to
any
one
of
the
other
three
accoucheuses
of
the
town
she
was
sent
for
even
by
country
families
living
in
the
neighbourhood
so
great
was
the
belief
in
her
knowledge
luck
and
skill
in
critical
cases
it
ended
in
her
practising
only
among
the
wealthiest
ladies
she
was
greedy
of
money
feeling
her
power
to
the
full
she
ended
by
not
putting
herself
out
for
anyone
possibly
on
purpose
indeed
in
her
practice
in
the
best
houses
she
used
to
scare
nervous
patients
by
the
most
incredible
and
nihilistic
disregard
of
good
manners
or
by
jeering
at
everything
holy
at
the
very
time
when
everything
holy
might
have
come
in
most
useful
our
town
doctor
rozanovhe
too
was
an
accoucheurasserted
most
positively
that
on
one
occasion
when
a
patient
in
labour
was
crying
out
and
calling
on
the
name
of
the
almighty
a
freethinking
sally
from
arina
prohorovna
fired
off
like
a
pistolshot
had
so
terrifying
an
effect
on
the
patient
that
it
greatly
accelerated
her
delivery
but
though
she
was
a
nihilist
madame
virginsky
did
not
when
occasion
arose
disdain
social
or
even
oldfashioned
superstitions
and
customs
if
they
could
be
of
any
advantage
to
herself
she
would
never
for
instance
have
stayed
away
from
a
babys
christening
and
always
put
on
a
green
silk
dress
with
a
train
and
adorned
her
chignon
with
curls
and
ringlets
for
such
events
though
at
other
times
she
positively
revelled
in
slovenliness
and
though
during
the
ceremony
she
always
maintained
the
most
insolent
air
so
that
she
put
the
clergy
to
confusion
yet
when
it
was
over
she
invariably
handed
champagne
to
the
guests
it
was
for
that
that
she
came
and
dressed
up
and
it
was
no
use
trying
to
take
the
glass
without
a
contribution
to
her
porridge
bowl
the
guests
who
assembled
that
evening
at
virginskys
mostly
men
had
a
casual
and
exceptional
air
there
was
no
supper
nor
cards
in
the
middle
of
the
large
drawingroom
which
was
papered
with
extremely
old
blue
paper
two
tables
had
been
put
together
and
covered
with
a
large
though
not
quite
clean
tablecloth
and
on
them
two
samovars
were
boiling
the
end
of
the
table
was
taken
up
by
a
huge
tray
with
twentyfive
glasses
on
it
and
a
basket
with
ordinary
french
bread
cut
into
a
number
of
slices
as
one
sees
it
in
genteel
boardingschools
for
boys
or
girls
the
tea
was
poured
out
by
a
maiden
lady
of
thirty
arina
prohorovnas
sister
a
silent
and
malevolent
creature
with
flaxen
hair
and
no
eyebrows
who
shared
her
sisters
progressive
ideas
and
was
an
object
of
terror
to
virginsky
himself
in
domestic
life
there
were
only
three
ladies
in
the
room
the
lady
of
the
house
her
eyebrowless
sister
and
virginskys
sister
a
girl
who
had
just
arrived
from
petersburg
arina
prohorovna
a
goodlooking
and
buxom
woman
of
sevenandtwenty
rather
dishevelled
in
an
everyday
greenish
woollen
dress
was
sitting
scanning
the
guests
with
her
bold
eyes
and
her
look
seemed
in
haste
to
say
you
see
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
anything
miss
virginsky
a
rosycheeked
student
and
a
nihilist
who
was
also
goodlooking
short
plump
and
round
as
a
little
ball
had
settled
herself
beside
arina
prohorovna
almost
in
her
travelling
clothes
she
held
a
roll
of
paper
in
her
hand
and
scrutinised
the
guests
with
impatient
and
roving
eyes
virginsky
himself
was
rather
unwell
that
evening
but
he
came
in
and
sat
in
an
easy
chair
by
the
teatable
all
the
guests
were
sitting
down
too
and
the
orderly
way
in
which
they
were
ranged
on
chairs
suggested
a
meeting
evidently
all
were
expecting
something
and
were
filling
up
the
interval
with
loud
but
irrelevant
conversation
when
stavrogin
and
verhovensky
appeared
there
was
a
sudden
hush
but
i
must
be
allowed
to
give
a
few
explanations
to
make
things
clear
i
believe
that
all
these
people
had
come
together
in
the
agreeable
expectation
of
hearing
something
particularly
interesting
and
had
notice
of
it
beforehand
they
were
the
flower
of
the
reddest
radicalism
of
our
ancient
town
and
had
been
carefully
picked
out
by
virginsky
for
this
meeting
i
may
remark
too
that
some
of
them
though
not
very
many
had
never
visited
him
before
of
course
most
of
the
guests
had
no
clear
idea
why
they
had
been
summoned
it
was
true
that
at
that
time
all
took
pyotr
stepanovitch
for
a
fully
authorised
emissary
from
abroad
this
idea
had
somehow
taken
root
among
them
at
once
and
naturally
flattered
them
and
yet
among
the
citizens
assembled
ostensibly
to
keep
a
nameday
there
were
some
who
had
been
approached
with
definite
proposals
pyotr
verhovensky
had
succeeded
in
getting
together
a
quintet
amongst
us
like
the
one
he
had
already
formed
in
moscow
and
as
appeared
later
in
our
province
among
the
officers
it
was
said
that
he
had
another
in
x
province
this
quintet
of
the
elect
were
sitting
now
at
the
general
table
and
very
skilfully
succeeded
in
giving
themselves
the
air
of
being
quite
ordinary
people
so
that
no
one
could
have
known
them
they
weresince
it
is
no
longer
a
secretfirst
liputin
then
virginsky
himself
then
shigalov
a
gentleman
with
long
ears
the
brother
of
madame
virginsky
lyamshin
and
lastly
a
strange
person
called
tolkatchenko
a
man
of
forty
who
was
famed
for
his
vast
knowledge
of
the
people
especially
of
thieves
and
robbers
he
used
to
frequent
the
taverns
on
purpose
though
not
only
with
the
object
of
studying
the
people
and
plumed
himself
on
his
shabby
clothes
tarred
boots
and
crafty
wink
and
a
flourish
of
peasant
phrases
lyamshin
had
once
or
twice
brought
him
to
stepan
trofimovitchs
gatherings
where
however
he
did
not
make
a
great
sensation
he
used
to
make
his
appearance
in
the
town
from
time
to
time
chiefly
when
he
was
out
of
a
job
he
was
employed
on
the
railway
every
one
of
these
fine
champions
had
formed
this
first
group
in
the
fervent
conviction
that
their
quintet
was
only
one
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
similar
groups
scattered
all
over
russia
and
that
they
all
depended
on
some
immense
central
but
secret
power
which
in
its
turn
was
intimately
connected
with
the
revolutionary
movement
all
over
europe
but
i
regret
to
say
that
even
at
that
time
there
was
beginning
to
be
dissension
among
them
though
they
had
ever
since
the
spring
been
expecting
pyotr
verhovensky
whose
coming
had
been
heralded
first
by
tolkatchenko
and
then
by
the
arrival
of
shigalov
though
they
had
expected
extraordinary
miracles
from
him
and
though
they
had
responded
to
his
first
summons
without
the
slightest
criticism
yet
they
had
no
sooner
formed
the
quintet
than
they
all
somehow
seemed
to
feel
insulted
and
i
really
believe
it
was
owing
to
the
promptitude
with
which
they
consented
to
join
they
had
joined
of
course
from
a
not
ignoble
feeling
of
shame
for
fear
people
might
say
afterwards
that
they
had
not
dared
to
join
still
they
felt
pyotr
verhovensky
ought
to
have
appreciated
their
heroism
and
have
rewarded
it
by
telling
them
some
really
important
bits
of
news
at
least
but
verhovensky
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
satisfy
their
legitimate
curiosity
and
told
them
nothing
but
what
was
necessary
he
treated
them
in
general
with
great
sternness
and
even
rather
casually
this
was
positively
irritating
and
comrade
shigalov
was
already
egging
the
others
on
to
insist
on
his
explaining
himself
though
of
course
not
at
virginskys
where
so
many
outsiders
were
present
i
have
an
idea
that
the
abovementioned
members
of
the
first
quintet
were
disposed
to
suspect
that
among
the
guests
of
virginskys
that
evening
some
were
members
of
other
groups
unknown
to
them
belonging
to
the
same
secret
organisation
and
founded
in
the
town
by
the
same
verhovensky
so
that
in
fact
all
present
were
suspecting
one
another
and
posed
in
various
ways
to
one
another
which
gave
the
whole
party
a
very
perplexing
and
even
romantic
air
yet
there
were
persons
present
who
were
beyond
all
suspicion
for
instance
a
major
in
the
service
a
near
relation
of
virginsky
a
perfectly
innocent
person
who
had
not
been
invited
but
had
come
of
himself
for
the
nameday
celebration
so
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
receive
him
but
virginsky
was
quite
unperturbed
as
the
major
was
incapable
of
betraying
them
for
in
spite
of
his
stupidity
he
had
all
his
life
been
fond
of
dropping
in
wherever
extreme
radicals
met
he
did
not
sympathise
with
their
ideas
himself
but
was
very
fond
of
listening
to
them
whats
more
he
had
even
been
compromised
indeed
it
had
happened
in
his
youth
that
whole
bundles
of
manifestoes
and
of
numbers
of
the
bell
had
passed
through
his
hands
and
although
he
had
been
afraid
even
to
open
them
yet
he
would
have
considered
it
absolutely
contemptible
to
refuse
to
distribute
themand
there
are
such
people
in
russia
even
to
this
day
the
rest
of
the
guests
were
either
types
of
honourable
amourpropre
crushed
and
embittered
or
types
of
the
generous
impulsiveness
of
ardent
youth
there
were
two
or
three
teachers
of
whom
one
a
lame
man
of
fortyfive
a
master
in
the
high
school
was
a
very
malicious
and
strikingly
vain
person
and
two
or
three
officers
of
the
latter
one
very
young
artillery
officer
who
had
only
just
come
from
a
military
training
school
a
silent
lad
who
had
not
yet
made
friends
with
anyone
turned
up
now
at
virginskys
with
a
pencil
in
his
hand
and
scarcely
taking
any
part
in
the
conversation
continually
made
notes
in
his
notebook
everybody
saw
this
but
every
one
pretended
not
to
there
was
too
an
idle
divinity
student
who
had
helped
lyamshin
to
put
indecent
photographs
into
the
gospelwomans
pack
he
was
a
solid
youth
with
a
freeandeasy
though
mistrustful
manner
with
an
unchangeably
satirical
smile
together
with
a
calm
air
of
triumphant
faith
in
his
own
perfection
there
was
also
present
i
dont
know
why
the
mayors
son
that
unpleasant
and
prematurely
exhausted
youth
to
whom
i
have
referred
already
in
telling
the
story
of
the
lieutenants
little
wife
he
was
silent
the
whole
evening
finally
there
was
a
very
enthusiastic
and
tousleheaded
schoolboy
of
eighteen
who
sat
with
the
gloomy
air
of
a
young
man
whose
dignity
has
been
wounded
evidently
distressed
by
his
eighteen
years
this
infant
was
already
the
head
of
an
independent
group
of
conspirators
which
had
been
formed
in
the
highest
class
of
the
gymnasium
as
it
came
out
afterwards
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
i
havent
mentioned
shatov
he
was
there
at
the
farthest
corner
of
the
table
his
chair
pushed
back
a
little
out
of
the
row
he
gazed
at
the
ground
was
gloomily
silent
refused
tea
and
bread
and
did
not
for
one
instant
let
his
cap
go
out
of
his
hand
as
though
to
show
that
he
was
not
a
visitor
but
had
come
on
business
and
when
he
liked
would
get
up
and
go
away
kirillov
was
not
far
from
him
he
too
was
very
silent
but
he
did
not
look
at
the
ground
on
the
contrary
he
scrutinised
intently
every
speaker
with
his
fixed
lustreless
eyes
and
listened
to
everything
without
the
slightest
emotion
or
surprise
some
of
the
visitors
who
had
never
seen
him
before
stole
thoughtful
glances
at
him
i
cant
say
whether
madame
virginsky
knew
anything
about
the
existence
of
the
quintet
i
imagine
she
knew
everything
and
from
her
husband
the
girlstudent
of
course
took
no
part
in
anything
but
she
had
an
anxiety
of
her
own
she
intended
to
stay
only
a
day
or
two
and
then
to
go
on
farther
and
farther
from
one
university
town
to
another
to
show
active
sympathy
with
the
sufferings
of
poor
students
and
to
rouse
them
to
protest
she
was
taking
with
her
some
hundreds
of
copies
of
a
lithographed
appeal
i
believe
of
her
own
composition
it
is
remarkable
that
the
schoolboy
conceived
an
almost
murderous
hatred
for
her
from
the
first
moment
though
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
she
felt
the
same
for
him
the
major
was
her
uncle
and
met
her
today
for
the
first
time
after
ten
years
when
stavrogin
and
verhovensky
came
in
her
cheeks
were
as
red
as
cranberries
she
had
just
quarrelled
with
her
uncle
over
his
views
on
the
woman
question
ii
with
conspicuous
nonchalance
verhovensky
lounged
in
the
chair
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
almost
without
greeting
anyone
his
expression
was
disdainful
and
even
haughty
stavrogin
bowed
politely
but
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
all
only
waiting
for
them
everybody
as
though
acting
on
instruction
appeared
scarcely
to
notice
them
the
lady
of
the
house
turned
severely
to
stavrogin
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
stavrogin
will
you
have
tea
please
he
answered
tea
for
stavrogin
she
commanded
her
sister
at
the
samovar
and
you
will
you
this
was
to
verhovensky
of
course
what
a
question
to
ask
a
visitor
and
give
me
cream
too
you
always
give
one
such
filthy
stuff
by
way
of
tea
and
with
a
nameday
party
in
the
house
what
you
believe
in
keeping
namedays
too
the
girlstudent
laughed
suddenly
we
were
just
talking
of
that
thats
stale
muttered
the
schoolboy
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
whats
stale
to
disregard
conventions
even
the
most
innocent
is
not
stale
on
the
contrary
to
the
disgrace
of
every
one
so
far
its
a
novelty
the
girlstudent
answered
instantly
darting
forward
on
her
chair
besides
there
are
no
innocent
conventions
she
added
with
intensity
i
only
meant
cried
the
schoolboy
with
tremendous
excitement
to
say
that
though
conventions
of
course
are
stale
and
must
be
eradicated
yet
about
namedays
everybody
knows
that
they
are
stupid
and
very
stale
to
waste
precious
time
upon
which
has
been
wasted
already
all
over
the
world
so
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
sharpen
ones
wits
on
something
more
useful
you
drag
it
out
so
one
cant
understand
what
you
mean
shouted
the
girl
i
think
that
every
one
has
a
right
to
express
an
opinion
as
well
as
every
one
else
and
if
i
want
to
express
my
opinion
like
anybody
else
no
one
is
attacking
your
right
to
give
an
opinion
the
lady
of
the
house
herself
cut
in
sharply
you
were
only
asked
not
to
ramble
because
no
one
can
make
out
what
you
mean
but
allow
me
to
remark
that
you
are
not
treating
me
with
respect
if
i
couldnt
fully
express
my
thought
its
not
from
want
of
thought
but
from
too
much
thought
the
schoolboy
muttered
almost
in
despair
losing
his
thread
completely
if
you
dont
know
how
to
talk
youd
better
keep
quiet
blurted
out
the
girl
the
schoolboy
positively
jumped
from
his
chair
i
only
wanted
to
state
he
shouted
crimson
with
shame
and
afraid
to
look
about
him
that
you
only
wanted
to
show
off
your
cleverness
because
mr
stavrogin
came
inso
there
thats
a
nasty
and
immoral
idea
and
shows
the
worthlessness
of
your
development
i
beg
you
not
to
address
me
again
the
girl
rattled
off
stavrogin
began
the
lady
of
the
house
theyve
been
discussing
the
rights
of
the
family
before
you
camethis
officer
hereshe
nodded
towards
her
relation
the
majorand
of
course
i
am
not
going
to
worry
you
with
such
stale
nonsense
which
has
been
dealt
with
long
ago
but
how
have
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
family
come
about
in
the
superstitious
form
in
which
they
exist
at
present
thats
the
question
whats
your
opinion
what
do
you
mean
by
come
about
stavrogin
asked
in
his
turn
we
know
for
instance
that
the
superstition
about
god
came
from
thunder
and
lightning
the
girlstudent
rushed
into
the
fray
again
staring
at
stavrogin
with
her
eyes
almost
jumping
out
of
her
head
its
well
known
that
primitive
man
scared
by
thunder
and
lightning
made
a
god
of
the
unseen
enemy
feeling
their
weakness
before
it
but
how
did
the
superstition
of
the
family
arise
how
did
the
family
itself
arise
thats
not
quite
the
same
thing
madame
virginsky
tried
to
check
her
i
think
the
answer
to
this
question
wouldnt
be
quite
discreet
answered
stavrogin
how
so
said
the
girlstudent
craning
forward
suddenly
but
there
was
an
audible
titter
in
the
group
of
teachers
which
was
at
once
caught
up
at
the
other
end
by
lyamshin
and
the
schoolboy
and
followed
by
a
hoarse
chuckle
from
the
major
you
ought
to
write
vaudevilles
madame
virginsky
observed
to
stavrogin
it
does
you
no
credit
i
dont
know
what
your
name
is
the
girl
rapped
out
with
positive
indignation
and
dont
you
be
too
forward
boomed
the
major
you
are
a
young
lady
and
you
ought
to
behave
modestly
and
you
keep
jumping
about
as
though
you
were
sitting
on
a
needle
kindly
hold
your
tongue
and
dont
address
me
familiarly
with
your
nasty
comparisons
ive
never
seen
you
before
and
i
dont
recognise
the
relationship
but
i
am
your
uncle
i
used
to
carry
you
about
when
you
were
a
baby
i
dont
care
what
babies
you
used
to
carry
about
i
didnt
ask
you
to
carry
me
it
must
have
been
a
pleasure
to
you
to
do
so
you
rude
officer
and
allow
me
to
observe
dont
dare
to
address
me
so
familiarly
unless
its
as
a
fellowcitizen
i
forbid
you
to
do
it
once
for
all
there
they
are
all
like
that
cried
the
major
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
and
addressing
stavrogin
who
was
sitting
opposite
but
allow
me
i
am
fond
of
liberalism
and
modern
ideas
and
i
am
fond
of
listening
to
clever
conversation
masculine
conversation
though
i
warn
you
but
to
listen
to
these
women
these
nightly
windmillsno
that
makes
me
ache
all
over
dont
wriggle
about
he
shouted
to
the
girl
who
was
leaping
up
from
her
chair
no
its
my
turn
to
speak
ive
been
insulted
you
cant
say
anything
yourself
and
only
hinder
other
people
talking
the
lady
of
the
house
grumbled
indignantly
no
i
will
have
my
say
said
the
major
hotly
addressing
stavrogin
i
reckon
on
you
mr
stavrogin
as
a
fresh
person
who
has
only
just
come
on
the
scene
though
i
havent
the
honour
of
knowing
you
without
men
theyll
perish
like
fliesthats
what
i
think
all
their
woman
question
is
only
lack
of
originality
i
assure
you
that
all
this
woman
question
has
been
invented
for
them
by
men
in
foolishness
and
to
their
own
hurt
i
only
thank
god
i
am
not
married
theres
not
the
slightest
variety
in
them
they
cant
even
invent
a
simple
pattern
they
have
to
get
men
to
invent
them
for
them
here
i
used
to
carry
her
in
my
arms
used
to
dance
the
mazurka
with
her
when
she
was
ten
years
old
today
shes
come
naturally
i
fly
to
embrace
her
and
at
the
second
word
she
tells
me
theres
no
god
she
might
have
waited
a
little
she
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
clever
people
dont
believe
i
dare
say
but
thats
from
their
cleverness
but
you
chicken
what
do
you
know
about
god
i
said
to
her
some
student
taught
you
and
if
hed
taught
you
to
light
the
lamp
before
the
ikons
you
would
have
lighted
it
you
keep
telling
lies
you
are
a
very
spiteful
person
i
proved
to
you
just
now
the
untenability
of
your
position
the
girl
answered
contemptuously
as
though
disdaining
further
explanations
with
such
a
man
i
told
you
just
now
that
weve
all
been
taught
in
the
catechism
if
you
honour
your
father
and
your
parents
you
will
live
long
and
have
wealth
thats
in
the
ten
commandments
if
god
thought
it
necessary
to
offer
rewards
for
love
your
god
must
be
immoral
thats
how
i
proved
it
to
you
it
wasnt
the
second
word
and
it
was
because
you
asserted
your
rights
its
not
my
fault
if
you
are
stupid
and
dont
understand
even
now
you
are
offended
and
you
are
spitefuland
thats
what
explains
all
your
generation
youre
a
goose
said
the
major
and
you
are
a
fool
you
can
call
me
names
excuse
me
kapiton
maximitch
you
told
me
yourself
you
dont
believe
in
god
liputin
piped
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
what
if
i
did
say
sothats
a
different
matter
i
believe
perhaps
only
not
altogether
even
if
i
dont
believe
altogether
still
i
dont
say
god
ought
to
be
shot
i
used
to
think
about
god
before
i
left
the
hussars
from
all
the
poems
you
would
think
that
hussars
do
nothing
but
carouse
and
drink
yes
i
did
drink
maybe
but
would
you
believe
it
i
used
to
jump
out
of
bed
at
night
and
stood
crossing
myself
before
the
images
with
nothing
but
my
socks
on
praying
to
god
to
give
me
faith
for
even
then
i
couldnt
be
at
peace
as
to
whether
there
was
a
god
or
not
it
used
to
fret
me
so
in
the
morning
of
course
one
would
amuse
oneself
and
ones
faith
would
seem
to
be
lost
again
and
in
fact
ive
noticed
that
faith
always
seems
to
be
less
in
the
daytime
havent
you
any
cards
asked
verhovensky
with
a
mighty
yawn
addressing
madame
virginsky
i
sympathise
with
your
question
i
sympathise
entirely
the
girlstudent
broke
in
hotly
flushed
with
indignation
at
the
majors
words
we
are
wasting
precious
time
listening
to
silly
talk
snapped
out
the
lady
of
the
house
and
she
looked
reprovingly
at
her
husband
the
girl
pulled
herself
together
i
wanted
to
make
a
statement
to
the
meeting
concerning
the
sufferings
of
the
students
and
their
protest
but
as
time
is
being
wasted
in
immoral
conversation
theres
no
such
thing
as
moral
or
immoral
the
schoolboy
brought
out
unable
to
restrain
himself
as
soon
as
the
girl
began
i
knew
that
mr
schoolboy
long
before
you
were
taught
it
and
i
maintain
he
answered
savagely
that
you
are
a
child
come
from
petersburg
to
enlighten
us
all
though
we
know
for
ourselves
the
commandment
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
which
you
could
not
repeat
correctly
and
the
fact
that
its
immoral
every
one
in
russia
knows
from
byelinsky
are
we
ever
to
have
an
end
of
this
madame
virginsky
said
resolutely
to
her
husband
as
the
hostess
she
blushed
for
the
ineptitude
of
the
conversation
especially
as
she
noticed
smiles
and
even
astonishment
among
the
guests
who
had
been
invited
for
the
first
time
gentlemen
said
virginsky
suddenly
lifting
up
his
voice
if
anyone
wishes
to
say
anything
more
nearly
connected
with
our
business
or
has
any
statement
to
make
i
call
upon
him
to
do
so
without
wasting
time
ill
venture
to
ask
one
question
said
the
lame
teacher
suavely
he
had
been
sitting
particularly
decorously
and
had
not
spoken
till
then
i
should
like
to
know
are
we
some
sort
of
meeting
or
are
we
simply
a
gathering
of
ordinary
mortals
paying
a
visit
i
ask
simply
for
the
sake
of
order
and
so
as
not
to
remain
in
ignorance
this
sly
question
made
an
impression
people
looked
at
each
other
every
one
expecting
someone
else
to
answer
and
suddenly
all
as
though
at
a
word
of
command
turned
their
eyes
to
verhovensky
and
stavrogin
i
suggest
our
voting
on
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
we
are
a
meeting
or
not
said
madame
virginsky
i
entirely
agree
with
the
suggestion
liputin
chimed
in
though
the
question
is
rather
vague
i
agree
too
and
so
do
i
cried
voices
i
too
think
it
would
make
our
proceedings
more
in
order
confirmed
virginsky
to
the
vote
then
said
his
wife
lyamshin
please
sit
down
to
the
piano
you
can
give
your
vote
from
there
when
the
voting
begins
again
cried
lyamshin
ive
strummed
enough
for
you
i
beg
you
most
particularly
sit
down
and
play
dont
you
care
to
do
anything
for
the
cause
but
i
assure
you
arina
prohorovna
nobody
is
eavesdropping
its
only
your
fancy
besides
the
windows
are
high
and
people
would
not
understand
if
they
did
hear
we
dont
understand
ourselves
someone
muttered
but
i
tell
you
one
must
always
be
on
ones
guard
i
mean
in
case
there
should
be
spies
she
explained
to
verhovensky
let
them
hear
from
the
street
that
we
have
music
and
a
nameday
party
hang
it
all
lyamshin
swore
and
sitting
down
to
the
piano
began
strumming
a
valse
banging
on
the
keys
almost
with
his
fists
at
random
i
propose
that
those
who
want
it
to
be
a
meeting
should
put
up
their
right
hands
madame
virginsky
proposed
some
put
them
up
others
did
not
some
held
them
up
and
then
put
them
down
again
and
then
held
them
up
again
foo
i
dont
understand
it
at
all
one
officer
shouted
i
dont
either
cried
the
other
oh
i
understand
cried
a
third
if
its
yes
you
hold
your
hand
up
but
what
does
yes
mean
means
a
meeting
no
it
means
not
a
meeting
i
voted
for
a
meeting
cried
the
schoolboy
to
madame
virginsky
then
why
didnt
you
hold
up
your
hand
i
was
looking
at
you
you
didnt
hold
up
yours
so
i
didnt
hold
up
mine
how
stupid
i
didnt
hold
up
my
hand
because
i
proposed
it
gentlemen
now
i
propose
the
contrary
those
who
want
a
meeting
sit
still
and
do
nothing
those
who
dont
hold
up
their
right
hands
those
who
dont
want
it
inquired
the
schoolboy
are
you
doing
it
on
purpose
cried
madame
virginsky
wrathfully
no
excuse
me
those
who
want
it
or
those
who
dont
want
it
for
one
must
know
that
definitely
cried
two
or
three
voices
those
who
dont
want
itthose
who
dont
want
it
yes
but
what
is
one
to
do
hold
up
ones
hand
or
not
hold
it
up
if
one
doesnt
want
it
cried
an
officer
ech
we
are
not
accustomed
to
constitutional
methods
yet
remarked
the
major
mr
lyamshin
excuse
me
but
you
are
thumping
so
that
no
one
can
hear
anything
observed
the
lame
teacher
but
upon
my
word
arina
prohorovna
nobody
is
listening
really
cried
lyamshin
jumping
up
i
wont
play
ive
come
to
you
as
a
visitor
not
as
a
drummer
gentlemen
virginsky
went
on
answer
verbally
are
we
a
meeting
or
not
we
are
we
are
was
heard
on
all
sides
if
so
theres
no
need
to
vote
thats
enough
are
you
satisfied
gentlemen
is
there
any
need
to
put
it
to
the
vote
no
needno

we
understand
perhaps
someone
doesnt
want
it
to
be
a
meeting
no
no
we
all
want
it
but
what
does
meeting
mean
cried
a
voice
no
one
answered
we
must
choose
a
chairman
people
cried
from
different
parts
of
the
room
our
host
of
course
our
host
gentlemen
if
so
virginsky
the
chosen
chairman
began
i
propose
my
original
motion
if
anyone
wants
to
say
anything
more
relevant
to
the
subject
or
has
some
statement
to
make
let
him
bring
it
forward
without
loss
of
time
there
was
a
general
silence
the
eyes
of
all
were
turned
again
on
verhovensky
and
stavrogin
verhovensky
have
you
no
statement
to
make
madame
virginsky
asked
him
directly
nothing
whatever
he
answered
yawning
and
stretching
on
his
chair
but
i
should
like
a
glass
of
brandy
stavrogin
dont
you
want
to
thank
you
i
dont
drink
i
mean
dont
you
want
to
speak

dont
you
want
brandy
to
speak
what
about
no
i
dont
want
to
theyll
bring
you
some
brandy
she
answered
verhovensky
the
girlstudent
got
up
she
had
darted
up
several
times
already
i
have
come
to
make
a
statement
about
the
sufferings
of
poor
students
and
the
means
of
rousing
them
to
protest
but
she
broke
off
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
a
rival
had
risen
and
all
eyes
turned
to
him
shigalov
the
man
with
the
long
ears
slowly
rose
from
his
seat
with
a
gloomy
and
sullen
air
and
mournfully
laid
on
the
table
a
thick
notebook
filled
with
extremely
small
handwriting
he
remained
standing
in
silence
many
people
looked
at
the
notebook
in
consternation
but
liputin
virginsky
and
the
lame
teacher
seemed
pleased
i
ask
leave
to
address
the
meeting
shigalov
pronounced
sullenly
but
resolutely
you
have
leave
virginsky
gave
his
sanction
the
orator
sat
down
was
silent
for
half
a
minute
and
pronounced
in
a
solemn
voice
gentlemen
heres
the
brandy
the
sister
who
had
been
pouring
out
tea
and
had
gone
to
fetch
brandy
rapped
out
contemptuously
and
disdainfully
putting
the
bottle
before
verhovensky
together
with
the
wineglass
which
she
brought
in
her
fingers
without
a
tray
or
a
plate
the
interrupted
orator
made
a
dignified
pause
never
mind
go
on
i
am
not
listening
cried
verhovensky
pouring
himself
out
a
glass
gentlemen
asking
your
attention
and
as
you
will
see
later
soliciting
your
aid
in
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
shigalov
began
again
i
must
make
some
prefatory
remarks
arina
prohorovna
havent
you
some
scissors
pyotr
stepanovitch
asked
suddenly
what
do
you
want
scissors
for
she
asked
with
wideopen
eyes
ive
forgotten
to
cut
my
nails
ive
been
meaning
to
for
the
last
three
days
he
observed
scrutinising
his
long
and
dirty
nails
with
unruffled
composure
arina
prohorovna
crimsoned
but
miss
virginsky
seemed
pleased
i
believe
i
saw
them
just
now
on
the
window
she
got
up
from
the
table
went
and
found
the
scissors
and
at
once
brought
them
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
not
even
look
at
her
took
the
scissors
and
set
to
work
with
them
arina
prohorovna
grasped
that
these
were
realistic
manners
and
was
ashamed
of
her
sensitiveness
people
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
the
lame
teacher
looked
vindictively
and
enviously
at
verhovensky
shigalov
went
on
dedicating
my
energies
to
the
study
of
the
social
organisation
which
is
in
the
future
to
replace
the
present
condition
of
things
ive
come
to
the
conviction
that
all
makers
of
social
systems
from
ancient
times
up
to
the
present
year
187
have
been
dreamers
tellers
of
fairytales
fools
who
contradicted
themselves
who
understood
nothing
of
natural
science
and
the
strange
animal
called
man
plato
rousseau
fourier
columns
of
aluminium
are
only
fit
for
sparrows
and
not
for
human
society
but
now
that
we
are
all
at
last
preparing
to
act
a
new
form
of
social
organisation
is
essential
in
order
to
avoid
further
uncertainty
i
propose
my
own
system
of
worldorganisation
here
it
is
he
tapped
the
notebook
i
wanted
to
expound
my
views
to
the
meeting
in
the
most
concise
form
possible
but
i
see
that
i
should
need
to
add
a
great
many
verbal
explanations
and
so
the
whole
exposition
would
occupy
at
least
ten
evenings
one
for
each
of
my
chapters
there
was
the
sound
of
laughter
i
must
add
besides
that
my
system
is
not
yet
complete
laughter
again
i
am
perplexed
by
my
own
data
and
my
conclusion
is
a
direct
contradiction
of
the
original
idea
with
which
i
start
starting
from
unlimited
freedom
i
arrive
at
unlimited
despotism
i
will
add
however
that
there
can
be
no
solution
of
the
social
problem
but
mine
the
laughter
grew
louder
and
louder
but
it
came
chiefly
from
the
younger
and
less
initiated
visitors
there
was
an
expression
of
some
annoyance
on
the
faces
of
madame
virginsky
liputin
and
the
lame
teacher
if
youve
been
unsuccessful
in
making
your
system
consistent
and
have
been
reduced
to
despair
yourself
what
could
we
do
with
it
one
officer
observed
warily
you
are
right
mr
officershigalov
turned
sharply
to
himespecially
in
using
the
word
despair
yes
i
am
reduced
to
despair
nevertheless
nothing
can
take
the
place
of
the
system
set
forth
in
my
book
and
there
is
no
other
way
out
of
it
no
one
can
invent
anything
else
and
so
i
hasten
without
loss
of
time
to
invite
the
whole
society
to
listen
for
ten
evenings
to
my
book
and
then
give
their
opinions
of
it
if
the
members
are
unwilling
to
listen
to
me
let
us
break
up
from
the
startthe
men
to
take
up
service
under
government
the
women
to
their
cooking
for
if
you
reject
my
solution
youll
find
no
other
none
whatever
if
they
let
the
opportunity
slip
it
will
simply
be
their
loss
for
they
will
be
bound
to
come
back
to
it
again
there
was
a
stir
in
the
company
is
he
mad
or
what
voices
asked
so
the
whole
point
lies
in
shigalovs
despair
lyamshin
commented
and
the
essential
question
is
whether
he
must
despair
or
not
shigalovs
being
on
the
brink
of
despair
is
a
personal
question
declared
the
schoolboy
i
propose
we
put
it
to
the
vote
how
far
shigalovs
despair
affects
the
common
cause
and
at
the
same
time
whether
its
worth
while
listening
to
him
or
not
an
officer
suggested
gaily
thats
not
right
the
lame
teacher
put
in
his
spoke
at
last
as
a
rule
he
spoke
with
a
rather
mocking
smile
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
whether
he
was
in
earnest
or
joking
thats
not
right
gentlemen
mr
shigalov
is
too
much
devoted
to
his
task
and
is
also
too
modest
i
know
his
book
he
suggests
as
a
final
solution
of
the
question
the
division
of
mankind
into
two
unequal
parts
onetenth
enjoys
absolute
liberty
and
unbounded
power
over
the
other
ninetenths
the
others
have
to
give
up
all
individuality
and
become
so
to
speak
a
herd
and
through
boundless
submission
will
by
a
series
of
regenerations
attain
primval
innocence
something
like
the
garden
of
eden
theyll
have
to
work
however
the
measures
proposed
by
the
author
for
depriving
ninetenths
of
mankind
of
their
freedom
and
transforming
them
into
a
herd
through
the
education
of
whole
generations
are
very
remarkable
founded
on
the
facts
of
nature
and
highly
logical
one
may
not
agree
with
some
of
the
deductions
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
doubt
the
intelligence
and
knowledge
of
the
author
its
a
pity
that
the
time
requiredten
eveningsis
impossible
to
arrange
for
or
we
might
hear
a
great
deal
thats
interesting
can
you
be
in
earnest
madame
virginsky
addressed
the
lame
gentleman
with
a
shade
of
positive
uneasiness
in
her
voice
when
that
man
doesnt
know
what
to
do
with
people
and
so
turns
ninetenths
of
them
into
slaves
ive
suspected
him
for
a
long
time
you
say
that
of
your
own
brother
asked
the
lame

are
you
laughing
at
me
and
besides
to
work
for
aristocrats
and
to
obey
them
as
though
they
were
gods
is
contemptible
observed
the
girlstudent
fiercely
what
i
propose
is
not
contemptible
its
paradise
an
earthly
paradise
and
there
can
be
no
other
on
earth

pronounced
authoritatively
for
my
part
said
lyamshin
if
i
didnt
know
what
to
do
with
ninetenths
of
mankind
id
take
them
and
blow
them
up
into
the
air
instead
of
putting
them
in
paradise
id
only
leave
a
handful
of
educated
people
who
would
live
happily
ever
afterwards
on
scientific
principles
no
one
but
a
buffoon
can
talk
like
that
cried
the
girl
flaring
up
he
is
a
buffoon
but
he
is
of
use
madame
virginsky
whispered
to
her
and
possibly
that
would
be
the
best
solution
of
the
problem
said
shigalov
turning
hotly
to
lyamshin
you
certainly
dont
know
what
a
profound
thing
youve
succeeded
in
saying
my
merry
friend
but
as
its
hardly
possible
to
carry
out
your
idea
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
an
earthly
paradise
since
thats
what
they
call
it
this
is
pretty
thorough
rot
broke
as
though
involuntarily
from
verhovensky
without
even
raising
his
eyes
however
he
went
on
cutting
his
nails
with
perfect
nonchalance
why
is
it
rot
the
lame
man
took
it
up
instantly
as
though
he
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
his
first
words
to
catch
at
them
why
is
it
rot
mr
shigalov
is
somewhat
fanatical
in
his
love
for
humanity
but
remember
that
fourier
still
more
cabet
and
even
proudhon
himself
advocated
a
number
of
the
most
despotic
and
even
fantastic
measures
mr
shigalov
is
perhaps
far
more
sober
in
his
suggestions
than
they
are
i
assure
you
that
when
one
reads
his
book
its
almost
impossible
not
to
agree
with
some
things
he
is
perhaps
less
far
from
realism
than
anyone
and
his
earthly
paradise
is
almost
the
real
oneif
it
ever
existedfor
the
loss
of
which
man

all
this

in

you
are

so
you
rush
to
ink

excuse
me
said
the
lame
man
wriggling
on
his
chair
though
we
are
provincials
and
of
course
objects
of
commiseration
on
that
ground
yet
we
know
that
so
far
nothing
has
happened
in
the
world
new
enough
to
be
worth
our
weeping
at
having
missed
it
it
is
suggested
to
us
in
various
pamphlets
made
abroad
and
secretly
distributed
that
we
should
unite
and
form
groups
with
the
sole
object
of
bringing
about
universal
destruction
its
urged
that
however
much
you
tinker
with
the
world
you
cant
make
a
good
job
of
it
but
that
by
cutting
off
a
hundred
million
heads
and
so
lightening
ones
burden
one
can
jump
over
the
ditch
more
safely
a
fine
idea
no
doubt
but
quite
as
impracticable
as
shigalovs
theories
which
you
referred
to
just
now
so
contemptuously
well
but
i
havent
come
here
for
discussion
verhovensky
let
drop
this
significant
phrase
and
as
though
quite
unaware
of
his
blunder
drew
the
candle
nearer
to
him
that
he
might
see
better
its
a
pity
a
great
pity
that
you
havent
come
for
discussion
and
its
a
great
pity
that
you
are
so
taken
up
just
now
with
your
toilet
whats
my
toilet
to
you
to
remove
a
hundred
million
heads
is
as
difficult
as
to
transform
the
world
by
propaganda
possibly
more
difficult
especially
in
russia
liputin
ventured
again
its
russia
they
rest
their
hopes
on
now
said
an
officer
weve
heard
they
are
resting
their
hopes
on
it
interposed
the
lame
man
we
know
that
a
mysterious
finger
is
pointing
to
our
delightful
country
as
the
land
most
fitted
to
accomplish
the
great
task
but
theres
this
by
the
gradual
solution
of
the
problem
by
propaganda
i
shall
gain
something
anywayi
shall
have
some
pleasant
talk
at
least
and
shall
even
get
some
recognition
from
government
for
my
services
to
the
cause
of
society
but
in
the
second
way
by
the
rapid
method
of
cutting
off
a
hundred
million
heads
what
benefit
shall
i
get
personally
if
you
began
advocating
that
your
tongue
might
be
cut
out
yours
certainly
would
be
observed
verhovensky
you
see
and
as
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
you
would
not
get
through
such
a
massacre
in
less
than
fifty
or
at
the
best
thirty
yearsfor
they
are
not
sheep
you
know
and
perhaps
they
would
not
let
themselves
be
slaughteredwouldnt
it
be
better
to
pack
ones
bundle
and
migrate
to
some
quiet
island
beyond
calm
seas
and
there
close
ones
eyes
tranquilly
believe
mehe
tapped
the
table
significantly
with
his
fingeryou
will
only
promote
emigration
by
such
propaganda
and
nothing
else
he
finished
evidently
triumphant
he
was
one
of
the
intellects
of
the
province
liputin
smiled
slyly
virginsky
listened
rather
dejectedly
the
others
followed
the
discussion
with
great
attention
especially
the
ladies
and
officers
they
all
realised
that
the
advocate
of
the
hundred
million
heads
theory
had
been
driven
into
a
corner
and
waited
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
that
was
a
good
saying
of
yours
though
verhovensky
mumbled
more
carelessly
than
ever
in
fact
with
an
air
of
positive
boredom
emigration
is
a
good
idea
but
all
the
same
if
in
spite
of
all
the
obvious
disadvantages
you
foresee
more
and
more
come
forward
every
day
ready
to
fight
for
the
common
cause
it
will
be
able
to
do
without
you
its
a
new
religion
my
good
friend
coming
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
one
thats
why
so
many
fighters
come
forward
and
its
a
big
movement
youd
better
emigrate
and
you
know
i
should
advise
dresden
not
the
calm
islands
to
begin
with
its
a
town
that
has
never
been
visited
by
an
epidemic
and
as
you
are
a
man
of
culture
no
doubt
you
are
afraid
of
death
another
thing
its
near
the
russian
frontier
so
you
can
more
easily
receive
your
income
from
your
beloved
fatherland
thirdly
it
contains
what
are
called
treasures
of
art
and
you
are
a
man
of
sthetic
tastes
formerly
a
teacher
of
literature
i
believe
and
finally
it
has
a
miniature
switzerland
of
its
ownto
provide
you
with
poetic
inspiration
for
no
doubt
you
write
verse
in
fact
its
a
treasure
in
a
nutshell
there
was
a
general
movement
especially
among
the
officers
in
another
instant
they
would
have
all
begun
talking
at
once
but
the
lame
man
rose
irritably
to
the
bait
no
perhaps
i
am
not
going
to
give
up
the
common
cause
you
must
understand
that
what
would
you
join
the
quintet
if
i
proposed
it
to
you
verhovensky
boomed
suddenly
and
he
laid
down
the
scissors
every
one
seemed
startled
the
mysterious
man
had
revealed
himself
too
freely
he
had
even
spoken
openly
of
the
quintet
every
one
feels
himself
to
be
an
honest
man
and
will
not
shirk
his
part
in
the
common
causethe
lame
man
tried
to
wriggle
out
of
itbut
no
this
is
not
a
question
which
allows
of
a
but
verhovensky
interrupted
harshly
and
peremptorily
i
tell
you
gentlemen
i
must
have
a
direct
answer
i
quite
understand
that
having
come
here
and
having
called
you
together
myself
i
am
bound
to
give
you
explanations
again
an
unexpected
revelation
but
i
can
give
you
none
till
i
know
what
is
your
attitude
to
the
subject
to
cut
the
matter
shortfor
we
cant
go
on
talking
for
another
thirty
years
as
people
have
done
for
the
last
thirtyi
ask
you
which
you
prefer
the
slow
way
which
consists
in
the
composition
of
socialistic
romances
and
the
academic
ordering
of
the
destinies
of
humanity
a
thousand
years
hence
while
despotism
will
swallow
the
savoury
morsels
which
would
almost
fly
into
your
mouths
of
themselves
if
youd
take
a
little
trouble
or
do
you
whatever
it
may
imply
prefer
a
quicker
way
which
will
at
last
untie
your
hands
and
will
let
humanity
make
its
own
social
organisation
in
freedom
and
in
action
not
on
paper
they
shout
a
hundred
million
heads
that
may
be
only
a
metaphor
but
why
be
afraid
of
it
if
with
the
slow
daydream
on
paper
despotism
in
the
course
of
some
hundred
years
will
devour
not
a
hundred
but
five
hundred
million
heads
take
note
too
that
an
incurable
invalid
will
not
be
cured
whatever
prescriptions
are
written
for
him
on
paper
on
the
contrary
if
there
is
delay
he
will
grow
so
corrupt
that
he
will
infect
us
too
and
contaminate
all
the
fresh
forces
which
one
might
still
reckon
upon
now
so
that
we
shall
all
at
last
come
to
grief
together
i
thoroughly
agree
that
its
extremely
agreeable
to
chatter
liberally
and
eloquently
but
action
is
a
little
trying
however
i
am
no
hand
at
talking
i
came
here
with
communications
and
so
i
beg
all
the
honourable
company
not
to
vote
but
simply
and
directly
to
state
which
you
prefer
walking
at
a
snails
pace
in
the
marsh
or
putting
on
full
steam
to
get
across
it
i
am
certainly
for
crossing
at
full
steam
cried
the
schoolboy
in
an
ecstasy
so
am
i
lyamshin
chimed
in
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
choice
muttered
an
officer
followed
by
another
then
by
someone
else
what
struck
them
all
most
was
that
verhovensky
had
come
with
communications
and
had
himself
just
promised
to
speak
gentlemen
i
see
that
almost
all
decide
for
the
policy
of
the
manifestoes
he
said
looking
round
at
the
company
all
all
cried
the
majority
of
voices
i
confess
i
am
rather
in
favour
of
a
more
humane
policy
said
the
major
but
as
all
are
on
the
other
side
i
go
with
all
the
rest
it
appears
then
that
even
you
are
not
opposed
to
it
said
verhovensky
addressing
the
lame
man
i
am
not
exactly
said
the
latter
turning
rather
red
but
if
i
do
agree
with
the
rest
now
its
simply
not
to
break
up
you
are
all
like
that
ready
to
argue
for
six
months
to
practise
your
liberal
eloquence
and
in
the
end
you
vote
the
same
as
the
rest
gentlemen
consider
though
is
it
true
that
you
are
all
ready
ready
for
what
the
question
was
vague
but
very
alluring
all
are
of
course
voices
were
heard
but
all
were
looking
at
one
another
but
afterwards
perhaps
you
will
resent
having
agreed
so
quickly
thats
almost
always
the
way
with
you
the
company
was
excited
in
various
ways
greatly
excited
the
lame
man
flew
at
him
allow
me
to
observe
however
that
answers
to
such
questions
are
conditional
even
if
we
have
given
our
decision
you
must
note
that
questions
put
in
such
a
strange
way
in
what
strange
way
in
a
way
such
questions
are
not
asked
teach
me
how
please
but
do
you
know
i
felt
sure
youd
be
the
first
to
take
offence
youve
extracted
from
us
an
answer
as
to
our
readiness
for
immediate
action
but
what
right
had
you
to
do
so
by
what
authority
do
you
ask
such
questions
you
should
have
thought
of
asking
that
question
sooner
why
did
you
answer
you
agree
and
then
you
go
back
on
it
but
to
my
mind
the
irresponsibility
of
your
principal
question
suggests
to
me
that
you
have
no
authority
no
right
and
only
asked
from
personal
curiosity
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
cried
verhovensky
apparently
beginning
to
be
much
alarmed
why
that
the
initiation
of
new
members
into
anything
you
like
is
done
anyway
ttette
and
not
in
the
company
of
twenty
people
one
doesnt
know
blurted
out
the
lame
man
he
had
said
all
that
was
in
his
mind
because
he
was
too
irritated
to
restrain
himself
verhovensky
turned
to
the
general
company
with
a
capitally
simulated
look
of
alarm
gentlemen
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
declare
that
all
this
is
folly
and
that
our
conversation
has
gone
too
far
i
have
so
far
initiated
no
one
and
no
one
has
the
right
to
say
of
me
that
i
initiate
members
we
were
simply
discussing
our
opinions
thats
so
isnt
it
but
whether
thats
so
or
not
you
alarm
me
very
much
he
turned
to
the
lame
man
again
i
had
no
idea
that
it
was
unsafe
here
to
speak
of
such
practically
innocent
matters
except
ttette
are
you
afraid
of
informers
can
there
possibly
be
an
informer
among
us
here
the
excitement
became
tremendous
all
began
talking
gentlemen
if
that
is
so
verhovensky
went
on
i
have
compromised
myself
more
than
anyone
and
so
i
will
ask
you
to
answer
one
question
if
you
care
to
of
course
you
are
all
perfectly
free
what
question
what
question
every
one
clamoured
a
question
that
will
make
it
clear
whether
we
are
to
remain
together
or
take
up
our
hats
and
go
our
several
ways
without
speaking
the
question
the
question
if
any
one
of
us
knew
of
a
proposed
political
murder
would
he
in
view
of
all
the
consequences
go
to
give
information
or
would
he
stay
at
home
and
await
events
opinions
may
differ
on
this
point
the
answer
to
the
question
will
tell
us
clearly
whether
we
are
to
separate
or
to
remain
together
and
for
far
longer
than
this
one
evening
let
me
appeal
to
you
first
he
turned
to
the
lame
man
why
to
me
first
because
you
began
it
all
be
so
good
as
not
to
prevaricate
it
wont
help
you
to
be
cunning
but
please
yourself
its
for
you
to
decide
excuse
me
but
such
a
question
is
positively
insulting
no
cant
you
be
more
exact
than
that
ive
never
been
an
agent
of
the
secret
police
replied
the
latter
wriggling
more
than
ever
be
so
good
as
to
be
more
definite
dont
keep
us
waiting
the
lame
man
was
so
furious
that
he
left
off
answering
without
a
word
he
glared
wrathfully
from
under
his
spectacles
at
his
tormentor
yes
or
no
would
you
inform
or
not
cried
verhovensky
of
course
i
wouldnt
the
lame
man
shouted
twice
as
loudly
and
no
one
would
of
course
not
cried
many
voices
allow
me
to
appeal
to
you
mr
major
would
you
inform
or
not
verhovensky
went
on
and
note
that
i
appeal
to
you
on
purpose
i
wont
inform
but
if
you
knew
that
someone
meant
to
rob
and
murder
someone
else
an
ordinary
mortal
then
you
would
inform
and
give
warning
yes
of
course
but
thats
a
private
affair
while
the
other
would
be
a
political
treachery
ive
never
been
an
agent
of
the
secret
police
and
no
one
here
has
voices
cried
again
its
an
unnecessary
question
every
one
will
make
the
same
answer
there
are
no
informers
here
what
is
that
gentleman
getting
up
for
cried
the
girlstudent
thats
shatov
what
are
you
getting
up
for
cried
the
lady
of
the
house
shatov
did
in
fact
stand
up
he
was
holding
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
looking
at
verhovensky
apparently
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
but
was
hesitating
his
face
was
pale
and
wrathful
but
he
controlled
himself
he
did
not
say
one
word
but
in
silence
walked
towards
the
door
shatov
this
wont
make
things
better
for
you
verhovensky
called
after
him
enigmatically
but
it
will
for
you
since
you
are
a
spy
and
a
scoundrel
shatov
shouted
to
him
from
the
door
and
he
went
out
shouts
and
exclamations
again
thats
what
comes
of
a
test
cried
a
voice
its
been
of
use
cried
another
hasnt
it
been
of
use
too
late
observed
a
third
who
invited
him
who
let
him
in
who
is
he
who
is
shatov
will
he
inform
or
wont
he
there
was
a
shower
of
questions
if
he
were
an
informer
he
would
have
kept
up
appearances
instead
of
cursing
it
all
and
going
away
observed
someone
see
stavrogin
is
getting
up
too
stavrogin
has
not
answered
the
question
either
cried
the
girlstudent
stavrogin
did
actually
stand
up
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
kirillov
rose
at
the
same
time
excuse
me
mr
stavrogin
madame
virginsky
addressed
him
sharply
we
all
answered
the
question
while
you
are
going
away
without
a
word
i
see
no
necessity
to
answer
the
question
which
interests
you
muttered
stavrogin
but
weve
compromised
ourselves
and
you
wont
shouted
several
voices
what
business
is
it
of
mine
if
you
have
compromised
yourselves
laughed
stavrogin
but
his
eyes
flashed
what
business
what
business
voices
exclaimed
many
people
got
up
from
their
chairs
allow
me
gentlemen
allow
me
cried
the
lame
man
mr
verhovensky
hasnt
answered
the
question
either
he
has
only
asked
it
the
remark
produced
a
striking
effect
all
looked
at
one
another
stavrogin
laughed
aloud
in
the
lame
mans
face
and
went
out
kirillov
followed
him
verhovensky
ran
after
them
into
the
passage
what
are
you
doing
he
faltered
seizing
stavrogins
hand
and
gripping
it
with
all
his
might
in
his
stavrogin
pulled
away
his
hand
without
a
word
be
at
kirillovs
directly
ill
come
its
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
see
you
it
isnt
necessary
for
me
stavrogin
cut
him
short
stavrogin
will
be
there
kirillov
said
finally
stavrogin
it
is
necessary
for
you
i
will
show
you
that
there
they
went
out
chapter
viii
ivan
the
tsarevitch
they
had
gone
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
about
to
rush
back
to
the
meeting
to
bring
order
into
chaos
but
probably
reflecting
that
it
wasnt
worth
bothering
about
left
everything
and
two
minutes
later
was
flying
after
the
other
two
on
the
way
he
remembered
a
short
cut
to
filipovs
house
he
rushed
along
it
up
to
his
knees
in
mud
and
did
in
fact
arrive
at
the
very
moment
when
stavrogin
and
kirillov
were
coming
in
at
the
gate
you
here
already
observed
kirillov
thats
good
come
in
how
is
it
you
told
us
you
lived
alone
asked
stavrogin
passing
a
boiling
samovar
in
the
passage
you
will
see
directly
who
it
is
i
live
with
muttered
kirillov
go
in
they
had
hardly
entered
when
verhovensky
at
once
took
out
of
his
pocket
the
anonymous
letter
he
had
taken
from
lembke
and
laid
it
before
stavrogin
they
all
then
sat
down
stavrogin
read
the
letter
in
silence
well
he
asked
that
scoundrel
will
do
as
he
writes
verhovensky
explained
so
as
he
is
under
your
control
tell
me
how
to
act
i
assure
you
he
may
go
to
lembke
tomorrow
well
let
him
go
let
him
go
and
when
we
can
prevent
him
too
you
are
mistaken
he
is
not
dependent
on
me
besides
i
dont
care
he
doesnt
threaten
me
in
any
way
he
only
threatens
you
you
too
i
dont
think
so
but
there
are
other
people
who
may
not
spare
you
surely
you
understand
that
listen
stavrogin
this
is
only
playing
with
words
surely
you
dont
grudge
the
money
why
would
it
cost
money
it
certainly
would
two
thousand
or
at
least
fifteen
hundred
give
it
to
me
tomorrow
or
even
today
and
tomorrow
evening
ill
send
him
to
petersburg
for
you
thats
just
what
he
wants
if
you
like
he
can
take
marya
timofyevna
note
that
there
was
something
distracted
about
him
he
spoke
as
it
were
without
caution
and
he
did
not
reflect
on
his
words
stavrogin
watched
him
wondering
ive
no
reason
to
send
marya
timofyevna
away
perhaps
you
dont
even
want
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
smiled
ironically
perhaps
i
dont
in
short
will
there
be
the
money
or
not
he
cried
with
angry
impatience
and
as
it
were
peremptorily
to
stavrogin
the
latter
scrutinised
him
gravely
there
wont
be
the
money
look
here
stavrogin
you
know
something
or
have
done
something
already
you
are
going
it
his
face
worked
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
and
he
suddenly
laughed
an
unprovoked
and
irrelevant
laugh
but
youve
had
money
from
your
father
for
the
estate
stavrogin
observed
calmly
maman
sent
you
six
or
eight
thousand
for
stepan
trofimovitch
so
you
can
pay
the
fifteen
hundred
out
of
your
own
money
i
dont
care
to
pay
for
other
people
ive
given
a
lot
as
it
is
it
annoys
me
he
smiled
himself
at
his
own
words
ah
you
are
beginning
to
joke
stavrogin
got
up
from
his
chair
verhovensky
instantly
jumped
up
too
and
mechanically
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
as
though
barring
the
way
to
him
stavrogin
had
already
made
a
motion
to
push
him
aside
and
go
out
when
he
stopped
short
i
wont
give
up
shatov
to
you
he
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
started
they
looked
at
one
another
i
told
you
this
evening
why
you
needed
shatovs
blood
said
stavrogin
with
flashing
eyes
its
the
cement
you
want
to
bind
your
groups
together
with
you
drove
shatov
away
cleverly
just
now
you
knew
very
well
that
he
wouldnt
promise
not
to
inform
and
he
would
have
thought
it
mean
to
lie
to
you
but
what
do
you
want
with
me
what
do
you
want
with
me
ever
since
we
met
abroad
you
wont
let
me
alone
the
explanation
youve
given
me
so
far
was
simply
raving
meanwhile
you
are
driving
at
my
giving
lebyadkin
fifteen
hundred
roubles
so
as
to
give
fedka
an
opportunity
to
murder
him
i
know
that
you
think
i
want
my
wife
murdered
too
you
think
to
tie
my
hands
by
this
crime
and
have
me
in
your
power
thats
it
isnt
it
what
good
will
that
be
to
you
what
the
devil
do
you
want
with
me
look
at
me
once
for
all
am
i
the
man
for
you
and
let
me
alone
has
fedka
been
to
you
himself
verhovensky
asked
breathlessly
yes
he
came
his
price
is
fifteen
hundred
too
but
here
hell
repeat
it
himself
there
he
stands
stavrogin
stretched
out
his
hand
pyotr
stepanovitch
turned
round
quickly
a
new
figure
fedka
wearing
a
sheepskin
coat
but
without
a
cap
as
though
he
were
at
home
stepped
out
of
the
darkness
in
the
doorway
he
stood
there
laughing
and
showing
his
even
white
teeth
his
black
eyes
with
yellow
whites
darted
cautiously
about
the
room
watching
the
gentlemen
there
was
something
he
did
not
understand
he
had
evidently
been
just
brought
in
by
kirillov
and
his
inquiring
eyes
turned
to
the
latter
he
stood
in
the
doorway
but
was
unwilling
to
come
into
the
room
i
suppose
you
got
him
ready
here
to
listen
to
our
bargaining
or
that
he
may
actually
see
the
money
in
our
hands
is
that
it
asked
stavrogin
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
walked
out
of
the
house
verhovensky
almost
frantic
overtook
him
at
the
gate
stop
not
another
step
he
cried
seizing
him
by
the
arm
stavrogin
tried
to
pull
away
his
arm
but
did
not
succeed
he
was
overcome
with
fury
seizing
verhovensky
by
the
hair
with
his
left
hand
he
flung
him
with
all
his
might
on
the
ground
and
went
out
at
the
gate
but
he
had
not
gone
thirty
paces
before
verhovensky
overtook
him
again
let
us
make
it
up
let
us
make
it
up
he
murmured
in
a
spasmodic
whisper
stavrogin
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
neither
answered
nor
turned
round
listen
i
will
bring
you
lizaveta
nikolaevna
tomorrow
shall
i
no
why
dont
you
answer
tell
me
what
you
want
ill
do
it
listen
ill
let
you
have
shatov
shall
i
then
its
true
that
you
meant
to
kill
him
cried
stavrogin
what
do
you
want
with
shatov
what
is
he
to
you
pyotr
stepanovitch
went
on
gasping
speaking
rapidly
he
was
in
a
frenzy
and
kept
running
forward
and
seizing
stavrogin
by
the
elbow
probably
unaware
of
what
he
was
doing
listen
ill
let
you
have
him
lets
make
it
up
your
price
is
a
very
great
one
but
lets
make
it
up
stavrogin
glanced
at
him
at
last
and
was
amazed
the
eyes
the
voice
were
not
the
same
as
always
or
as
they
had
been
in
the
room
just
now
what
he
saw
was
almost
another
face
the
intonation
of
the
voice
was
different
verhovensky
besought
implored
he
was
a
man
from
whom
what
was
most
precious
was
being
taken
or
had
been
taken
and
who
was
still
stunned
by
the
shock
but
whats
the
matter
with
you
cried
stavrogin
the
other
did
not
answer
but
ran
after
him
and
gazed
at
him
with
the
same
imploring
but
yet
inflexible
expression
lets
make
it
up
he
whispered
once
more
listen
like
fedka
i
have
a
knife
in
my
boot
but
ill
make
it
up
with
you
but
what
do
you
want
with
me
damn
you
stavrogin
cried
with
intense
anger
and
amazement
is
there
some
mystery
about
it
am
i
a
sort
of
talisman
for
you
listen
we
are
going
to
make
a
revolution
the
other
muttered
rapidly
and
almost
in
delirium
you
dont
believe
we
shall
make
a
revolution
we
are
going
to
make
such
an
upheaval
that
everything
will
be
uprooted
from
its
foundation
karmazinov
is
right
that
there
is
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
karmazinov
is
very
intelligent
another
ten
such
groups
in
different
parts
of
russiaand
i
am
safe
groups
of
fools
like
that
broke
reluctantly
from
stavrogin
oh
dont
be
so
clever
stavrogin
dont
be
so
clever
yourself
and
you
know
you
are
by
no
means
so
intelligent
that
you
need
wish
others
to
be
you
are
afraid
you
have
no
faith
you
are
frightened
at
our
doing
things
on
such
a
scale
and
why
are
they
fools
they
are
not
such
fools
no
one
has
a
mind
of
his
own
nowadays
there
are
terribly
few
original
minds
nowadays
virginsky
is
a
purehearted
man
ten
times
as
pure
as
you
or
i
but
never
mind
about
him
liputin
is
a
rogue
but
i
know
one
point
about
him
every
rogue
has
some
point
in
him
lyamshin
is
the
only
one
who
hasnt
but
he
is
in
my
hands
a
few
more
groups
and
i
should
have
money
and
passports
everywhere
so
much
at
least
suppose
it
were
only
that
and
safe
places
so
that
they
can
search
as
they
like
they
might
uproot
one
group
but
theyd
stick
at
the
next
well
set
things
in
a
ferment
surely
you
dont
think
that
we
two
are
not
enough
take
shigalov
and
let
me
alone
shigalov
is
a
man
of
genius
do
you
know
he
is
a
genius
like
fourier
but
bolder
than
fourier
stronger
ill
look
after
him
hes
discovered
equality
he
is
in
a
fever
he
is
raving
something
very
queer
has
happened
to
him
thought
stavrogin
looking
at
him
once
more
both
walked
on
without
stopping
hes
written
a
good
thing
in
that
manuscript
verhovensky
went
on
he
suggests
a
system
of
spying
every
member
of
the
society
spies
on
the
others
and
its
his
duty
to
inform
against
them
every
one
belongs
to
all
and
all
to
every
one
all
are
slaves
and
equal
in
their
slavery
in
extreme
cases
he
advocates
slander
and
murder
but
the
great
thing
about
it
is
equality
to
begin
with
the
level
of
education
science
and
talents
is
lowered
a
high
level
of
education
and
science
is
only
possible
for
great
intellects
and
they
are
not
wanted
the
great
intellects
have
always
seized
the
power
and
been
despots
great
intellects
cannot
help
being
despots
and
theyve
always
done
more
harm
than
good
they
will
be
banished
or
put
to
death
cicero
will
have
his
tongue
cut
out
copernicus
will
have
his
eyes
put
out
shakespeare
will
be
stonedthats
shigalovism
slaves
are
bound
to
be
equal
there
has
never
been
either
freedom
or
equality
without
despotism
but
in
the
herd
there
is
bound
to
be
equality
and
thats
shigalovism
ha
ha
ha
do
you
think
it
strange
i
am
for
shigalovism
stavrogin
tried
to
quicken
his
pace
and
to
reach
home
as
soon
as
possible
if
this
fellow
is
drunk
where
did
he
manage
to
get
drunk
crossed
his
mind
can
it
be
the
brandy
listen
stavrogin
to
level
the
mountains
is
a
fine
idea
not
an
absurd
one
i
am
for
shigalov
down
with
culture
weve
had
enough
science
without
science
we
have
material
enough
to
go
on
for
a
thousand
years
but
one
must
have
discipline
the
one
thing
wanting
in
the
world
is
discipline
the
thirst
for
culture
is
an
aristocratic
thirst
the
moment
you
have
family
ties
or
love
you
get
the
desire
for
property
we
will
destroy
that
desire
well
make
use
of
drunkenness
slander
spying
well
make
use
of
incredible
corruption
well
stifle
every
genius
in
its
infancy
well
reduce
all
to
a
common
denominator
complete
equality
weve
learned
a
trade
and
we
are
honest
men
we
need
nothing
more
that
was
an
answer
given
by
english
workingmen
recently
only
the
necessary
is
necessary
thats
the
motto
of
the
whole
world
henceforward
but
it
needs
a
shock
thats
for
us
the
directors
to
look
after
slaves
must
have
directors
absolute
submission
absolute
loss
of
individuality
but
once
in
thirty
years
shigalov
would
let
them
have
a
shock
and
they
would
all
suddenly
begin
eating
one
another
up
to
a
certain
point
simply
as
a
precaution
against
boredom
boredom
is
an
aristocratic
sensation
the
shigalovians
will
have
no
desires
desire
and
suffering
are
our
lot
but
shigalovism
is
for
the
slaves
you
exclude
yourself
stavrogin
broke
in
again
you
too
do
you
know
i
have
thought
of
giving
up
the
world
to
the
pope
let
him
come
forth
on
foot
and
barefoot
and
show
himself
to
the
rabble
saying
see
what
they
have
brought
me
to
and
they
will
all
rush
after
him
even
the
troops
the
pope
at
the
head
with
us
round
him
and
below
usshigalovism
all
thats
needed
is
that
the
internationale
should
come
to
an
agreement
with
the
pope
so
it
will
and
the
old
chap
will
agree
at
once
theres
nothing
else
he
can
do
remember
my
words
ha
ha
is
it
stupid
tell
me
is
it
stupid
or
not
thats
enough
stavrogin
muttered
with
vexation
enough
listen
ive
given
up
the
pope
damn
shigalovism
damn
the
pope
we
must
have
something
more
everyday
not
shigalovism
for
shigalovism
is
a
rare
specimen
of
the
jewellers
art
its
an
ideal
its
in
the
future
shigalov
is
an
artist
and
a
fool
like
every
philanthropist
we
need
coarse
work
and
shigalov
despises
coarse
work
listen
the
pope
shall
be
for
the
west
and
you
shall
be
for
us
you
shall
be
for
us
let
me
alone
you
drunken
fellow
muttered
stavrogin
and
he
quickened
his
pace
stavrogin
you
are
beautiful
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
almost
ecstatically
do
you
know
that
you
are
beautiful
whats
the
most
precious
thing
about
you
is
that
you
sometimes
dont
know
it
oh
ive
studied
you
i
often
watch
you
on
the
sly
theres
a
lot
of
simpleheartedness
and
navet
about
you
still
do
you
know
that
there
still
is
there
is
you
must
be
suffering
and
suffering
genuinely
from
that
simpleheartedness
i
love
beauty
i
am
a
nihilist
but
i
love
beauty
are
nihilists
incapable
of
loving
beauty
its
only
idols
they
dislike
but
i
love
an
idol
you
are
my
idol
you
injure
no
one
and
every
one
hates
you
you
treat
every
one
as
an
equal
and
yet
every
one
is
afraid
of
youthats
good
nobody
would
slap
you
on
the
shoulder
you
are
an
awful
aristocrat
an
aristocrat
is
irresistible
when
he
goes
in
for
democracy
to
sacrifice
life
your
own
or
anothers
is
nothing
to
you
you
are
just
the
man
thats
needed
its
just
such
a
man
as
you
that
i
need
i
know
no
one
but
you
you
are
the
leader
you
are
the
sun
and
i
am
your
worm
he
suddenly
kissed
his
hand
a
shiver
ran
down
stavrogins
spine
and
he
pulled
away
his
hand
in
dismay
they
stood
still
madman
whispered
stavrogin
perhaps
i
am
raving
perhaps
i
am
raving
pyotr
stepanovitch
assented
speaking
rapidly
but
ive
thought
of
the
first
step
shigalov
would
never
have
thought
of
it
there
are
lots
of
shigalovs
but
only
one
man
one
man
in
russia
has
hit

stavrogin
stood
still
and
looked
intently
into
his
wild
eyes
listen
first
of
all
well
make
an
upheaval
verhovensky
went
on
in
desperate
haste
continually
clutching
at
stavrogins
left
sleeve
ive
already
told
you
we
shall
penetrate
to
the
peasantry
do
you
know
that
we
are
tremendously
powerful
already
our
party
does
not
consist
only
of
those
who
commit
murder
and
arson
fire
off
pistols
in
the
traditional
fashion
or
bite
colonels
they
are
only
a
hindrance
i
dont
accept
anything
without
discipline
i
am
a
scoundrel
of
course
and
not
a
socialist
ha
ha
listen
ive
reckoned
them
all
up
a
teacher
who
laughs
with
children
at
their
god
and
at
their
cradle
is
on
our
side
the
lawyer
who
defends
an
educated
murderer
because
he
is
more
cultured
than
his
victims
and
could
not
help
murdering
them
to
get
money
is
one
of
us
the
schoolboys
who
murder
a
peasant
for
the
sake
of
sensation
are
ours
the
juries
who
acquit
every
criminal
are
ours
the
prosecutor
who
trembles
at
a
trial
for
fear
he
should
not
seem
advanced
enough
is
ours
ours
among
officials
and
literary
men
we
have
lots
lots
and
they
dont
know
it
themselves
on
the
other
hand
the
docility
of
schoolboys
and
fools
has
reached
an
extreme
pitch
the
schoolmasters
are
bitter
and
bilious
on
all
sides
we
see
vanity
puffed
up
out
of
all
proportion
brutal
monstrous
appetites
do
you
know
how
many
we
shall
catch
by
little
readymade
ideas
when
i
left
russia
littres
dictum
that
crime
is
insanity
was
all
the
rage
i
come
back
and
i
find
that
crime
is
no
longer
insanity
but
simply
common
sense
almost
a
duty
anyway
a
gallant
protest
how
can
we
expect
a
cultured
man
not
to
commit
a
murder
if
he
is
in
need
of
money
but
these
are
only
the
first
fruits
the
russian
god
has
already
been
vanquished
by
cheap
vodka
the
peasants
are
drunk
the
mothers
are
drunk
the
children
are
drunk
the
churches
are
empty
and
in
the
peasant
courts
one
hears
two
hundred
lashes
or
stand
us
a
bucket
of
vodka
oh
this
generation
has
only
to
grow
up
its
only
a
pity
we
cant
afford
to
wait
or
we
might
have
let
them
get
a
bit
more
tipsy
ah
what
a
pity
theres
no
proletariat
but
there
will
be
there
will
be
we
are
going
that
way
its
a
pity
too
that
weve
grown
greater
fools
muttered
stavrogin
moving
forward
as
before
listen
ive
seen
a
child
of
six
years
old
leading
home
his
drunken
mother
whilst
she
swore
at
him
with
foul
words
do
you
suppose
i
am
glad
of
that
when
its
in
our
hands
maybe
well
mend
things
if
need
be
well
drive
them
for
forty
years
into
the
wilderness
but
one
or
two
generations
of
vice
are
essential
now
monstrous
abject
vice
by
which
a
man
is
transformed
into
a
loathsome
cruel
egoistic
reptile
thats
what
we
need
and
whats
more
a
little
fresh
blood
that
we
may
get
accustomed
to
it
why
are
you
laughing
i
am
not
contradicting
myself
i
am
only
contradicting
the
philanthropists
and
shigalovism
not
myself
i
am
a
scoundrel
not
a
socialist
ha
ha
ha
im
only
sorry
theres
no
time
i
promised
karmazinov
to
begin
in
may
and
to
make
an
end
by
october
is
that
too
soon
ha
ha
do
you
know
what
stavrogin
though
the
russian
people
use
foul
language
theres
nothing
cynical
about
them
so
far
do
you
know
the
serfs
had
more
selfrespect
than
karmazinov
though
they
were
beaten
they
always
preserved
their
gods
which
is
more
than
karmazinovs
done
well
verhovensky
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
you
talk
and
i
listen
with
amazement
observed
stavrogin
so
you
are
really
not
a
socialist
then
but
some
sort
of
ambitious
politician
a
scoundrel
a
scoundrel
you
are
wondering
what
i
am
ill
tell
you
what
i
am
directly
thats
what
i
am
leading
up
to
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
i
kissed
your
hand
but
the
people
must
believe
that
we
know
what
we
are
after
while
the
other
side
do
nothing
but
brandish
their
cudgels
and
beat
their
own
followers
ah
if
we
only
had
more
time
thats
the
only
trouble
we
have
no
time
we
will
proclaim
destruction
why
is
it
why
is
it
that
idea
has
such
a
fascination
but
we
must
have
a
little
exercise
we
must
well
set
fires
going
well
set
legends
going
every
scurvy
group
will
be
of
use
out
of
those
very
groups
ill
pick
you
out
fellows
so
keen
theyll
not
shrink
from
shooting
and
be
grateful
for
the
honour
of
a
job
too
well
and
there
will
be
an
upheaval
theres
going
to
be
such
an
upset
as
the
world
has
never
seen
before
russia
will
be
overwhelmed
with
darkness
the
earth
will
weep
for
its
old
gods
well
then
we
shall
bring
forward
whom
whom
ivan
the
tsarevitch
whom
ivan
the
tsarevitch
you
you
stavrogin
thought
a
minute
a
pretender
he
asked
suddenly
looking
with
intense
surprise
at
his
frantic
companion
ah
so
thats
your
plan
at
last
we
shall
say
that
he
is
in
hiding
verhovensky
said
softly
in
a
sort
of
tender
whisper
as
though
he
really
were
drunk
indeed
do
you
know
the
magic
of
that
phrase
he
is
in
hiding
but
he
will
appear
he
will
appear
well
set
a
legend
going
better
than
the
skoptsis
he
exists
but
no
one
has
seen
him
oh
what
a
legend
one
can
set
going
and
the
great
thing
is
it
will
be
a
new
force
at
work
and
we
need
that
thats
what
they
are
crying
for
what
can
socialism
do
its
destroyed
the
old
forces
but
hasnt
brought
in
any
new
but
in
this
we
have
a
force
and
what
a
force
incredible
we
only
need
one
lever
to
lift
up
the
earth
everything
will
rise
up
then
have
you
been
seriously
reckoning
on
me
stavrogin
said
with
a
malicious
smile
why
do
you
laugh
and
so
spitefully
dont
frighten
me
i
am
like
a
little
child
now
i
can
be
frightened
to
death
by
one
smile
like
that
listen
ill
let
no
one
see
you
no
one
so
it
must
be
he
exists
but
no
one
has
seen
him
he
is
in
hiding
and
do
you
know
one
might
show
you
to
one
out
of
a
hundredthousand
for
instance
and
the
rumour
will
spread
over
all
the
land
weve
seen
him
weve
seen
him
ivan
filipovitch
the
god
of
sabaoth
has
been
seen
too
when
he
ascended
into
heaven
in
his
chariot
in
the
sight
of
men
they
saw
him
with
their
own
eyes
and
you
are
not
an
ivan
filipovitch
you
are
beautiful
and
proud
as
a
god
you
are
seeking
nothing
for
yourself
with
the
halo
of
a
victim
round
you
in
hiding
the
great
thing
is
the
legend
youll
conquer
them
youll
have
only
to
look
and
you
will
conquer
them
he
is
in
hiding
and
will
come
forth
bringing
a
new
truth
and
meanwhile
well
pass
two
or
three
judgments
as
wise
as
solomons
the
groups
you
know
the
quintetsweve
no
need
of
newspapers
if
out
of
ten
thousand
petitions
only
one
is
granted
all
would
come
with
petitions
in
every
parish
every
peasant
will
know
that
there
is
somewhere
a
hollow
tree
where
petitions
are
to
be
put
and
the
whole
land
will
resound
with
the
cry
a
new
just
law
is
to
come
and
the
sea
will
be
troubled
and
the
whole
gimcrack
show
will
fall
to
the
ground
and
then
we
shall
consider
how
to
build
up
an
edifice
of
stone
for
the
first
time
we
are
going
to
build
it

chapter
ix
a
raid
at
stepan
trofimovitchs
meanwhile
an
incident
had
occurred
which
astounded
me
and
shattered
stepan
trofimovitch
at
eight
oclock
in
the
morning
nastasya
ran
round
to
me
from
him
with
the
news
that
her
master
was
raided
at
first
i
could
not
make
out
what
she
meant
i
could
only
gather
that
the
raid
was
carried
out
by
officials
that
they
had
come
and
taken
his
papers
and
that
a
soldier
had
tied
them
up
in
a
bundle
and
wheeled
them
away
in
a
barrow
it
was
a
fantastic
story
i
hurried
at
once
to
stepan
trofimovitch
i
found
him
in
a
surprising
condition
upset
and
in
great
agitation
but
at
the
same
time
unmistakably
triumphant
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
samovar
was
boiling
and
there
was
a
glass
of
tea
poured
out
but
untouched
and
forgotten
stepan
trofimovitch
was
wandering
round
the
table
and
peeping
into
every
corner
of
the
room
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
he
was
wearing
his
usual
red
knitted
jacket
but
seeing
me
he
hurriedly
put
on
his
coat
and
waistcoata
thing
he
had
never
done
before
when
any
of
his
intimate
friends
found
him
in
his
jacket
he
took
me
warmly
by
the
hand
at
once
enfin
un
ami
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
cher
ive
sent
to
you
only
and
no
one
knows
anything
we
must
give
nastasya
orders
to
lock
the
doors
and
not
admit
anyone
except
of
course
them
vous
comprenez
he
looked
at
me
uneasily
as
though
expecting
a
reply
i
made
haste
of
course
to
question
him
and
from
his
disconnected
and
broken
sentences
full
of
unnecessary
parentheses
i
succeeded
in
learning
that
at
seven
oclock
that
morning
an
official
of
the
province
had
all
of
a
sudden
called
on
him

and
when
he
began
to
explain
his
visit
he
looked
as
though
i
enfin
il
avait
lair
de
croire
que
je
tomberai
sur
lui
immdiatement
et
que
je
commencerai
a
le

comme
pltre
tous
ces
gens
du
bas
tage
sont
comme
a
when
they
have
to
do
with
a
gentleman
i
need
hardly
say
i
understood
it
all
at
once
voil
vingt
ans
que
je
my
prpare
i
opened
all
the
drawers
and
handed
him
all
the
keys
i
gave
them
myself
i
gave
him
all
jtais
digne
et
calme
from
the
books
he
took
the
foreign
edition
of
herzen
the
bound
volume
of
the
bell
four
copies
of
my
poem
et
enfin
tout
a
then
he
took
my
letters
and
my
papers
et
quelquesunes
de
mes
bauches
historiques
critiques
et
politiques
all
that
they
carried
off
nastasya
says
that
a
soldier
wheeled
them
away
in
a
barrow
and
covered
them
with
an
apron
oui
cest
cela
with
an
apron
it
sounded
like
delirium
who
could
make
head
or
tail
of
it
i
pelted
him
with
questions
again
had
blum
come
alone
or
with
others
on
whose
authority
by
what
right
how
had
he
dared
how
did
he
explain
it
il
etait
seul
bien
seul
but
there
was
someone
else
dans
lantichambre
oui
je
men
souviens
et
puis
though
i
believe
there
was
someone
else
besides
and
there
was
a
guard
standing
in
the
entry
you
must
ask
nastasya
she
knows
all
about
it
better
than
i
do
jtais
surexcit
voyezvous
il
parlait
il
parlait
un
tas
de
chases
he
said
very
little
though
it
was
i
said
all
that
i
told
him
the
story
of
my
life
simply
from
that
point
of
view
of
course
jtais
surexcit
mais
digne
je
vous
assure
i
am
afraid
though
i
may
have
shed
tears
they
got
the
barrow
from
the
shop
next
door
oh
heavens
how
could
all
this
have
happened
but
for
mercys
sake
speak
more
exactly
stepan
trofimovitch
what
you
tell
me
sounds
like
a
dream
cher
i
feel
as
though
i
were
in
a
dream
myself
savezvous
il
a
prononc
le
nom
de
telyatnikof
and
i
believe
that
that
man
was
concealed
in
the
entry
yes
i
remember
he
suggested
calling
the
prosecutor
and
dmitri
dmitritch
i
believe
qui

enfin

but
i
got
the
better
of
them
and
what
do
i
care
for
dmitri
dmitritch
i
believe
i
begged
him
very
earnestly
to
keep
it
quiet
i
begged
him
particularly
most
particularly
i
am
afraid
i
demeaned
myself
in
fact
comment
croyezvous
enfin
il
a
consenti
yes
i
remember
he
suggested
that
himselfthat
it
would
be
better
to
keep
it
quiet
for
he
had
only
come
to
have
a
look
round
et
rien
de
plus
and
nothing
more
nothing
more
and
that
if
they
find
nothing
nothing
will
happen
so
that
we
ended
it
all
en
amis
je
suis
tout

fait
content
why
then
he
suggested
the
usual
course
of
proceedings
in
such
cases
and
regular
guarantees
and
you
rejected
them
yourself
i
cried
with
friendly
indignation
yes
its
better
without
the
guarantees
and
why
make
a
scandal
lets
keep
it
en
amis
so
long
as
we
can
you
know
in
our
town
if
they
get
to
know

i
beg
you
for
nothing
is
more
unbearable
when
a
man
is
in
trouble
than
for
a
hundred
friends
to
point
out
to
him
what
a
fool
he
has
made
of
himself
sit
down
though
and
have
some
tea
i
must
admit
i
am
awfully
tired
hadnt
i
better
lie
down
and
put
vinegar
on
my
head
what
do
you
think
certainly
i
cried
ice
even
you
are
very
much
upset
you
are
pale
and
your
hands
are
trembling
lie
down
rest
and
put
off
telling
me
ill
sit
by
you
and
wait
he
hesitated
but
i
insisted
on
his
lying
down
nastasya
brought
a
cup
of
vinegar
i
wetted
a
towel
and
laid
it
on
his
head
then
nastasya
stood
on
a
chair
and
began
lighting
a
lamp
before
the
ikon
in
the
corner
i
noticed
this
with
surprise
there
had
never
been
a
lamp
there
before
and
now
suddenly
it
had
made
its
appearance
i
arranged
for
that
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
away
muttered
stepan
trofimovitch
looking
at
me
slyly
quand
on
a
de
ces
chosesl
dans
sa
chambre
et
quon
vient
vous
arrter
it
makes
an
impression
and
they
are
sure
to
report
that
they
have
seen
it
when
she
had
done
the
lamp
nastasya
stood
in
the
doorway
leaned
her
cheek
in
her
right
hand
and
began
gazing
at
him
with
a
lachrymose
air
eloignezla
on
some
excuse
he
nodded
to
me
from
the
sofa
i
cant
endure
this
russian
sympathy
et
puis
a
membte
but
she
went
away
of
herself
i
noticed
that
he
kept
looking
towards
the
door
and
listening
for
sounds
in
the
passage
il
faut
tre
prt
voyezvous
he
said
looking
at
me
significantly
chaque
moment
they
may
come
and
take
one
and
phewa
man
disappears
heavens
wholl
come
who
will
take
you
voyezvous
mon
cher
i
asked
straight
out
when
he
was
going
away
what
would
they
do
to
me
now
youd
better
have
asked
them
where
youd
be
exiled
i
cried
out
in
the
same
indignation
thats
just
what
i
meant
when
i
asked
but
he
went
away
without
answering
voyezvous
as
for
linen
clothes
warm
things
especially
that
must
be
as
they
decide
if
they
tell
me
to
take
themall
right
or
they
might
send
me
in
a
soldiers
overcoat
but
i
thrust
thirtyfive
roubles
he
suddenly
dropped
his
voice
looking
towards
the
door
by
which
nastasya
had
gone
out
in
a
slit
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
here
feel
i
believe
they
wont
take
the
waistcoat
off
and
left
seven
roubles
in
my
purse
to
keep
up
appearances
as
though
that
were
all
i
have
you
see
its
in
small
change
and
the
coppers
are
on
the
table
so
they
wont
guess
that
ive
hidden
the
money
but
will
suppose
that
thats
all
for
god
knows
where
i
may
have
to
sleep
tonight
i
bowed
my
head
before
such
madness
it
was
obvious
that
a
man
could
not
be
arrested
and
searched
in
the
way
he
was
describing
and
he
must
have
mixed
things
up
its
true
it
all
happened
in
the
days
before
our
present
more
recent
regulations
it
is
true
too
that
according
to
his
own
account
they
had
offered
to
follow
the
more
regular
procedure
but
he
got
the
better
of
them
and
refused
of
course
not
long
ago
a
governor
might
in
extreme
cases
but
how
could
this
be
an
extreme
case
thats
what
baffled
me
no
doubt
they
had
a
telegram
from
petersburg
stepan
trofimovitch
said
suddenly
a
telegram
about
you
because
of
the
works
of
herzen
and
your
poem
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
what
is
there
in
that
to
arrest
you
for
i
was
positively
angry
he
made
a
grimace
and
was
evidently
mortifiednot
at
my
exclamation
but
at
the
idea
that
there
was
no
ground
for
arrest
who
can
tell
in
our
day
what
he
may
not
be
arrested
for
he
muttered
enigmatically
a
wild
and
nonsensical
idea
crossed
my
mind
stepan
trofimovitch
tell
me
as
a
friend
i
cried
as
a
real
friend
i
will
not
betray
you
do
you
belong
to
some
secret
society
or
not
and
on
this
to
my
amazement
he
was
not
quite
certain
whether
he
was
or
was
not
a
member
of
some
secret
society
that
depends
voyezvous
how
do
you
mean
it
depends
when
with
ones
whole
heart
one
is
an
adherent
of
progress
and
who
can
answer
it
you
may
suppose
you
dont
belong
and
suddenly
it
turns
out
that
you
do
belong
to
something
now
is
that
possible
its
a
case
of
yes
or
no
cela
date
de
ptersburg
when
she
and
i
were
meaning
to
found
a
magazine
there
thats
whats
at
the
root
of
it
she
gave
them
the
slip
then
and
they
forgot
us
but
now
theyve
remembered
cher
cher
dont
you
know
me
he
cried
hysterically
and
theyll
take
us
put
us
in
a
cart
and
march
us
off
to
siberia
forever
or
forget
us
in
prison
and
he
suddenly
broke
into
bitter
weeping
his
tears
positively
streamed
he
covered
his
face
with
his
red
silk
handkerchief
and
sobbed
sobbed
convulsively
for
five
minutes
it
wrung
my
heart
this
was
the
man
who
had
been
a
prophet
among
us
for
twenty
years
a
leader
a
patriarch
the
kukolnik
who
had
borne
himself
so
loftily
and
majestically
before
all
of
us
before
whom
we
bowed
down
with
genuine
reverence
feeling
proud
of
doing
soand
all
of
a
sudden
here
he
was
sobbing
sobbing
like
a
naughty
child
waiting
for
the
rod
which
the
teacher
is
fetching
for
him
i
felt
fearfully
sorry
for
him
he
believed
in
the
reality
of
that
cart
as
he
believed
that
i
was
sitting
by
his
side
and
he
expected
it
that
morning
at
once
that
very
minute
and
all
this
on
account
of
his
herzen
and
some
poem
such
complete
absolute
ignorance
of
everyday
reality
was
touching
and
somehow
repulsive
at
last
he
left
off
crying
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
began
walking
about
the
room
again
continuing
to
talk
to
me
though
he
looked
out
of
the
window
every
minute
and
listened
to
every
sound
in
the
passage
our
conversation
was
still
disconnected
all
my
assurances
and
attempts
to
console
him
rebounded
from
him
like
peas
from
a
wall
he
scarcely
listened
but
yet
what
he
needed
was
that
i
should
console
him
and
keep
on
talking
with
that
object
i
saw
that
he
could
not
do
without
me
now
and
would
not
let
me
go
for
anything
i
remained
and
we
spent
more
than
two
hours
together
in
conversation
he
recalled
that
blum
had
taken
with
him
two
manifestoes
he
had
found
manifestoes
i
said
foolishly
frightened
do
you
mean
to
say
you
oh
ten
were
left
here
he
answered
with
vexation
he
talked
to
me
at
one
moment
in
a
vexed
and
haughty
tone
and
at
the
next
with
dreadful
plaintiveness
and
humiliation
but
i
had
disposed
of
eight
already
and
blum
only
found
two
and
he
suddenly
flushed
with
indignation
vous
me
mettez
avec
ces
gensl
do
you
suppose
i
could
be
working
with
those
scoundrels
those
anonymous
libellers

oh
heavens
bah
havent
they
mixed
you
up
perhaps
but
its
nonsense
it
cant
be
so
i
observed

from
him
suddenly

moments

do
you

i
might

on
somebody
there
and
bite
him
like
that
lieutenant
he
looked
at
me
with
a
strange
expressionalarmed
and
at
the
same
time
anxious
to
alarm
me
he
certainly
was
getting
more
and
more
exasperated
with
somebody
and
about
something
as
time
went
on
and
the
policecart
did
not
appear
he
was
positively
wrathful
suddenly
nastasya
who
had
come
from
the
kitchen
into
the
passage
for
some
reason
upset
a
clotheshorse
there
stepan
trofimovitch
trembled
and
turned
numb
with
terror
as
he
sat
but
when
the
noise
was
explained
he
almost
shrieked
at
nastasya
and
stamping
drove
her
back
to
the
kitchen
a
minute
later
he
said
looking
at
me
in
despair
i
am
ruined
cherhe
sat
down
suddenly
beside
me
and
looked
piteously

saw
from
his
expression
that
he
wanted
at
last
to
tell
me
something
of
great
importance
which
he
had
till
now
refrained
from

afraid
of

he
whispered
mysteriously
what
disgrace
on
the
contrary

that

a
sudden
unexpectedly

whispered
with
profound
conviction
weve
talked
of

in

before

know

of

he
cried
shuddering
and
leaping
up
from
his
place
on
no
account
never
after
what
was
said
at
parting
at
skvoreshnikinever
his
eyes
flashed
we
went
on
sitting
together
another
hour
or
more
i
believe
expecting
something
all
the
timethe
idea
had
taken
such
hold
of
us
he
lay
down
again
even
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
for
twenty
minutes
without
uttering
a
word
so
that
i
thought
he
was
asleep
or
unconscious
suddenly
he
got
up
impulsively
pulled
the
towel
off
his
head
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
rushed
to
the
lookingglass
with
trembling
hands
tied
his
cravat
and
in
a
voice
of
thunder
called
to
nastasya
telling
her
to
give
him
his
overcoat
his
new
hat
and
his
stick
i
can
bear
no
more
he
said
in
a
breaking
voice
i
cant
i
cant
i
am
going
myself
where
i
cried
jumping
up
too

my

i
am

ive
neglected
them
criminally
but
now
ill

he
must
tell
me

he
received
a

he
dare
not
torture
me
if
so
let
him
arrest

let
him

he
stamped
and
vociferated
almost
with
shrieks
i
approve
of
what
you
say
i
said
speaking
as
calmly
as
possible
on
purpose
though
i
was
very
much
afraid
for
him
certainly
it
is
better
than
sitting
here
in
such
misery
but
i
cant
approve
of
your
state
of
mind
just
see
what
you
look
like
and
in

at

i
am
walking
straight
into

sacrifice
of
a
true

but
only

only
as
far
as

not
you
have
no
right
to

yourself
further
by
being

oh

i

that
i
am
at
this
moment

la
hauteur

tout
ce
que
il
y
a
de

sacr
i
may
perhaps
go
into
the
house
with
you
i
interrupted
him
i
had
a
message
from
their
stupid
committee
yesterday
through
vysotsky
that
they
reckon
on
me
and
invite
me
to
the
fte
tomorrow
as
one
of
the
stewards
or
whatever
it
is
one
of
the
six
young
men
whose
duty
it
is
to
look
after
the
trays
wait
on
the
ladies
take
the
guests
to
their
places
and
wear
a
rosette
of
crimson
and
white
ribbon
on
the
left
shoulder
i
meant
to
refuse
but
now
why
shouldnt
i
go
into
the
house
on
the
excuse
of
seeing
yulia
mihailovna
herself
about
it
so
we
will
go
in
together
he
listened
nodding
but
i
think
he
understood
nothing
we
stood
on
the
threshold
cherhe
stretched
out
his
arm
to
the
lamp
before
the
ikoncher
i
have
never
believed
in
this
but
so
be
it
so
be
it
he
crossed
himself
allons
well
thats
better
so
i
thought
as
i
went
out
on
to
the
steps
with
him
the
fresh
air
will
do
him
good
on
the
way
and
we
shall
calm
down
turn
back
and
go
home
to
bed
but
i
reckoned
without
my
host
on
the
way
an
adventure
occurred
which
agitated
stepan
trofimovitch
even
more
and
finally
determined
him
to
go
on
so
that
i
should
never
have
expected
of
our
friend
so
much
spirit
as
he
suddenly
displayed
that
morning
poor
friend
kindhearted
friend
chapter
x
filibusters
a
fatal
morning
i
the
adventure
that
befell
us
on
the
way
was
also
a
surprising
one
but
i
must
tell
the
story
in
due
order
an
hour
before
stepan
trofimovitch
and
i
came
out
into
the
street
a
crowd
of
people
the
hands
from
shpigulins
factory
seventy
or
more
in
number
had
been
marching
through
the
town
and
had
been
an
object
of
curiosity
to
many
spectators
they
walked
intentionally
in
good
order
and
almost
in
silence
afterwards
it
was
asserted
that
these
seventy
had
been
elected
out
of
the
whole
number
of
factory
hands
amounting
to
about
nine
hundred
to
go
to
the
governor
and
to
try
and
get
from
him
in
the
absence
of
their
employer
a
just
settlement
of
their
grievances
against
the
manager
who
in
closing
the
factory
and
dismissing
the
workmen
had
cheated
them
all
in
an
impudent
waya
fact
which
has
since
been
proved
conclusively
some
people
still
deny
that
there
was
any
election
of
delegates
maintaining
that
seventy
was
too
large
a
number
to
elect
and
that
the
crowd
simply
consisted
of
those
who
had
been
most
unfairly
treated
and
that
they
only
came
to
ask
for
help
in
their
own
case
so
that
the
general
mutiny
of
the
factory
workers
about
which
there
was
such
an
uproar
later
on
had
never
existed
at
all
others
fiercely
maintained
that
these
seventy
men
were
not
simple
strikers
but
revolutionists
that
is
not
merely
that
they
were
the
most
turbulent
but
that
they
must
have
been
worked
upon
by
seditious
manifestoes
the
fact
is
it
is
still
uncertain
whether
there
had
been
any
outside
influence
or
incitement
at
work
or
not
my
private
opinion
is
that
the
workmen
had
not
read
the
seditious
manifestoes
at
all
and
if
they
had
read
them
would
not
have
understood
one
word
for
one
reason
because
the
authors
of
such
literature
write
very
obscurely
in
spite
of
the
boldness
of
their
style
but
as
the
workmen
really
were
in
a
difficult
plight
and
the
police
to
whom
they
appealed
would
not
enter
into
their
grievances
what
could
be
more
natural
than
their
idea
of
going
in
a
body
to
the
general
himself
if
possible
with
the
petition
at
their
head
forming
up
in
an
orderly
way
before
his
door
and
as
soon
as
he
showed
himself
all
falling
on
their
knees
and
crying
out
to
him
as
to
providence
itself
to
my
mind
there
is
no
need
to
see
in
this
a
mutiny
or
even
a
deputation
for
its
a
traditional
historical
mode
of
action
the
russian
people
have
always
loved
to
parley
with
the
general
himself
for
the
mere
satisfaction
of
doing
so
regardless
of
how
the
conversation
may
end
and
so
i
am
quite
convinced
that
even
though
pyotr
stepanovitch
liputin
and
perhaps
some
othersperhaps
even
fedka
toohad
been
flitting
about
among
the
workpeople
talking
to
them
and
there
is
fairly
good
evidence
of
this
they
had
only
approached
two
three
five
at
the
most
trying
to
sound
them
and
nothing
had
come
of
their
conversation
as
for
the
mutiny
they
advocated
if
the
factoryworkers
did
understand
anything
of
their
propaganda
they
would
have
left
off
listening
to
it
at
once
as
to
something
stupid
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
fedka
was
a
different
matter
he
had
more
success
i
believe
than
pyotr
stepanovitch
two
workmen
are
now
known
for
a
fact
to
have
assisted
fedka
in
causing
the
fire
in
the
town
which
occurred
three
days
afterwards
and
a
month
later
three
men
who
had
worked
in
the
factory
were
arrested
for
robbery
and
arson
in
the
province
but
if
in
these
cases
fedka
did
lure
them
to
direct
and
immediate
action
he
could
only
have
succeeded
with
these
five
for
we
heard
of
nothing
of
the
sort
being
done
by
others
be
that
as
it
may
the
whole
crowd
of
workpeople
had
at
last
reached
the
open
space
in
front
of
the
governors
house
and
were
drawn
up
there
in
silence
and
good
order
then
gaping
openmouthed
at
the
front
door
they
waited
i
am
told
that
as
soon
as
they
halted
they
took
off
their
caps
that
is
a
good
halfhour
before
the
appearance
of
the
governor
who
as
illluck
would
have
it
was
not
at
home
at
the
moment
the
police
made
their
appearance
at
once
at
first
individual
policemen
and
then
as
large
a
contingent
of
them
as
could
be
gathered
together
they
began
of
course
by
being
menacing
ordering
them
to
break
up
but
the
workmen
remained
obstinately
like
a
flock
of
sheep
at
a
fence
and
replied
laconically
that
they
had
come
to
see
the
general
himself
it
was
evident
that
they
were
firmly
determined
the
unnatural
shouting
of
the
police
ceased
and
was
quickly
succeeded
by
deliberations
mysterious
whispered
instructions
and
stern
fussy
perplexity
which
wrinkled
the
brows
of
the
police
officers
the
head
of
the
police
preferred
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
governor
himself
it
was
not
true
that
he
galloped
to
the
spot
with
three
horses
at
full
speed
and
began
hitting
out
right
and
left
before
he
alighted
from
his
carriage
its
true
that
he
used
to
dash
about
and
was
fond
of
dashing
about
at
full
speed
in
a
carriage
with
a
yellow
back
and
while
his
tracehorses
who
were
so
trained
to
carry
their
heads
that
they
looked
positively
perverted
galloped
more
and
more
frantically
rousing
the
enthusiasm
of
all
the
shopkeepers
in
the
bazaar
he
would
rise
up
in
the
carriage
stand
erect
holding
on
by
a
strap
which
had
been
fixed
on
purpose
at
the
side
and
with
his
right
arm
extended
into
space
like
a
figure
on
a
monument
survey
the
town
majestically
but
in
the
present
case
he
did
not
use
his
fists
and
though
as
he
got
out
of
the
carriage
he
could
not
refrain
from
a
forcible
expression
this
was
simply
done
to
keep
up
his
popularity
there
is
a
still
more
absurd
story
that
soldiers
were
brought
up
with
bayonets
and
that
a
telegram
was
sent
for
artillery
and
cossacks
those
are
legends
which
are
not
believed
now
even
by
those
who
invented
them
its
an
absurd
story
too
that
barrels
of
water
were
brought
from
the
fire
brigade
and
that
people
were
drenched
with
water
from
them
the
simple
fact
is
that
ilya
ilyitch
shouted
in
his
heat
that
he
wouldnt
let
one
of
them
come
dry
out
of
the
water
probably
this
was
the
foundation
of
the
barrel
legend
which
got
into
the
columns
of
the
petersburg
and
moscow
newspapers
probably
the
most
accurate
version
was
that
at
first
all
the
available
police
formed
a
cordon
round
the
crowd
and
a
messenger
was
sent
for
lembke
a
police
superintendent
who
dashed
off
in
the
carriage
belonging
to
the
head
of
the
police
on
the
way
to
skvoreshniki
knowing
that
lembke
had
gone
there
in
his
carriage
half
an
hour
before
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
still
unable
to
answer
the
question
how
they
could
at
first
sight
from
the
first
moment
have
transformed
an
insignificant
that
is
to
say
an
ordinary
crowd
of
petitioners
even
though
there
were
several
of
them
into
a
rebellion
which
threatened
to
shake
the
foundations
of
the
state
why
did
lembke
himself
rush
at
that
idea
when
he
arrived
twenty
minutes
after
the
messenger
i
imagine
but
again
its
only
my
private
opinion
that
it
was
to
the
interest
of
ilya
ilyitch
who
was
a
crony
of
the
factory
managers
to
represent
the
crowd
in
this
light
to
lembke
in
order
to
prevent
him
from
going
into
the
case
and
lembke
himself
had
put
the
idea
into
his
head
in
the
course
of
the
last
two
days
he
had
had
two
unusual
and
mysterious
conversations
with
him
it
is
true
they
were
exceedingly
obscure
but
ilya
ilyitch
was
able
to
gather
from
them
that
the
governor
had
thoroughly
made
up
his
mind
that
there
were
political
manifestoes
and
that
shpigulins
factory
hands
were
being
incited
to
a
socialist
rising
and
that
he
was
so
persuaded
of
it
that
he
would
perhaps
have
regretted
it
if
the
story
had
turned
out
to
be
nonsense
he
wants
to
get
distinction
in
petersburg
our
wily
ilya
ilyitch
thought
to
himself
as
he
left
von
lembke
well
that
just
suits
me
but
i
am
convinced
that
poor
andrey
antonovitch
would
not
have
desired
a
rebellion
even
for
the
sake
of
distinguishing
himself
he
was
a
most
conscientious
official
who
had
lived
in
a
state
of
innocence
up
to
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
was
it
his
fault
that
instead
of
an
innocent
allowance
of
wood
from
the
government
and
an
equally
innocent
minnchen
a
princess
of
forty
summers
had
raised
him
to
her
level
i
know
almost
for
certain
that
the
unmistakable
symptoms
of
the
mental
condition
which
brought
poor
andrey
antonovitch
to
a
wellknown
establishment
in
switzerland
where
i
am
told
he
is
now
regaining
his
energies
were
first
apparent
on
that
fatal
morning
but
once
we
admit
that
unmistakable
signs
of
something
were
visible
that
morning
it
may
well
be
allowed
that
similar
symptoms
may
have
been
evident
the
day
before
though
not
so
clearly
i
happen
to
know
from
the
most
private
sources
well
you
may
assume
that
yulia
mihailovna
later
on
not
in
triumph
but
almost
in
remorsefor
a
woman
is
incapable
of
complete
remorserevealed
part
of
it
to
me
herself
that
andrey
antonovitch
had
gone
into
his
wifes
room
in
the
middle
of
the
previous
night
past
two
oclock
in
the
morning
had
waked
her
up
and
had
insisted
on
her
listening
to
his
ultimatum
he
demanded
it
so
insistently
that
she
was
obliged
to
get
up
from
her
bed
in
indignation
and
curlpapers
and
sitting
down
on
a
couch
she
had
to
listen
though
with
sarcastic
disdain
only
then
she
grasped
for
the
first
time
how
far
gone
her
andrey
antonovitch
was
and
was
secretly
horrified
she
ought
to
have
thought
what
she
was
about
and
have
been
softened
but
she
concealed
her
horror
and
was
more
obstinate
than
ever
like
every
wife
she
had
her
own
method
of
treating
andrey
antonovitch
which
she
had
tried
more
than
once
already
and
with
it
driven
him
to
frenzy
yulia
mihailovnas
method
was
that
of
contemptuous
silence
for
one
hour
two
a
whole
day
and
almost
for
three
days
and
nightssilence
whatever
happened
whatever
he
said
whatever
he
did
even
if
he
had
clambered
up
to
throw
himself
out
of
a
threestory
windowa
method
unendurable
for
a
sensitive
man
whether
yulia
mihailovna
meant
to
punish
her
husband
for
his
blunders
of
the
last
few
days
and
the
jealous
envy
he
as
the
chief
authority
in
the
town
felt
for
her
administrative
abilities
whether
she
was
indignant
at
his
criticism
of
her
behaviour
with
the
young
people
and
local
society
generally
and
lack
of
comprehension
of
her
subtle
and
farsighted
political
aims
or
was
angry
with
his
stupid
and
senseless
jealousy
of
pyotr
stepanovitchhowever
that
may
have
been
she
made
up
her
mind
not
to
be
softened
even
now
in
spite
of
its
being
three
oclock
at
night
and
though
andrey
antonovitch
was
in
a
state
of
emotion
such
as
she
had
never
seen
him
in
before
pacing
up
and
down
in
all
directions
over
the
rugs
of
her
boudoir
beside
himself
he
poured
out
everything
everything
quite
disconnectedly
its
true
but
everything
that
had
been
rankling
in
his
heart
forit
was
outrageous
he
began
by
saying
that
he
was
a
laughingstock
to
every
one
and
was
being
led
by
the
nose
curse
the
expression
he
squealed
at
once
catching
her
smile
let
it
stand
its
true
no
madam
the
time
has
come
let
me
tell
you
its
not
a
time
for
laughter
and
feminine
arts
now
we
are
not
in
the
boudoir
of
a
mincing
lady
but
like
two
abstract
creatures
in
a
balloon
who
have
met
to
speak
the
truth
he
was
no
doubt
confused
and
could
not
find
the
right
words
for
his
ideas
however
just
they
were
it
is
you
madam
you
who
have
destroyed
my
happy
past
i
took
up
this
post
simply
for
your
sake
for
the
sake
of
your
ambition
you
smile
sarcastically
dont
triumph
dont
be
in
a
hurry
let
me
tell
you
madam
let
me
tell
you
that
i
should
have
been
equal
to
this
position
and
not
only
this
position
but
a
dozen
positions
like
it
for
i
have
abilities
but
with
you
madam
with
youits
impossible
for
with
you
here
i
have
no
abilities
there
cannot
be
two
centres
and
you
have
created
twoone
of
mine
and
one
in
your
boudoirtwo
centres
of
power
madam
but
i
wont
allow
it
i
wont
allow
it
in
the
service
as
in
marriage
there
must
be
one
centre
two
are
impossible
how
have
you
repaid
me
he
went
on
our
marriage
has
been
nothing
but
your
proving
to
me
all
the
time
every
hour
that
i
am
a
nonentity
a
fool
and
even
a
rascal
and
i
have
been
all
the
time
every
hour
forced
in
a
degrading
way
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
not
a
nonentity
not
a
fool
at
all
and
that
i
impress
every
one
with
my
honourable
character
isnt
that
degrading
for
both
sides
at
this
point
he
began
rapidly
stamping
with
both
feet
on
the
carpet
so
that
yulia
mihailovna
was
obliged
to
get
up
with
stern
dignity
he
subsided
quickly
but
passed
to
being
pathetic
and
began
sobbing
yes
sobbing
beating
himself
on
the
breast
almost
for
five
minutes
getting
more
and
more
frantic
at
yulia
mihailovnas
profound
silence
at
last
he
made
a
fatal
blunder
and
let
slip
that
he
was
jealous
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
realising
that
he
had
made
an
utter
fool
of
himself
he
became
savagely
furious
and
shouted
that
he
would
not
allow
them
to
deny
god
and
that
he
would
send
her
salon
of
irresponsible
infidels
packing
that
the
governor
of
a
province
was
bound
to
believe
in
god
and
so
his
wife
was
too
that
he
wouldnt
put
up
with
these
young
men
that
you
madam
for
the
sake
of
your
own
dignity
ought
to
have
thought
of
your
husband
and
to
have
stood
up
for
his
intelligence
even
if
he
were
a
man
of
poor
abilities
and
im
by
no
means
a
man
of
poor
abilities
and
yet
its
your
doing
that
every
one
here
despises
me
it
was
you
put
them
all
up
to
it
he
shouted
that
he
would
annihilate
the
woman
question
that
he
would
eradicate
every
trace
of
it
that
tomorrow
he
would
forbid
and
break
up
their
silly
fte
for
the
benefit
of
the
governesses
damn
them
that
the
first
governess
he
came
across
tomorrow
morning
he
would
drive
out
of
the
province
with
a
cossack
ill
make
a
point
of
it
he
shrieked
do
you
know
he
screamed
do
you
know
that
your
rascals
are
inciting
men
at
the
factory
and
that
i
know
it
let
me
tell
you
i
know
the
names
of
four
of
these
rascals
and
that
i
am
going
out
of
my
mind
hopelessly
hopelessly
but
at
this
point
yulia
mihailovna
suddenly
broke
her
silence
and
sternly
announced
that
she
had
long
been
aware
of
these
criminal
designs
and
that
it
was
all
foolishness
and
that
he
had
taken
it
too
seriously
and
that
as
for
these
mischievous
fellows
she
knew
not
only
those
four
but
all
of
them
it
was
a
lie
but
that
she
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
going
out
of
her
mind
on
account
of
it
but
on
the
contrary
had
all
the
more
confidence
in
her
intelligence
and
hoped
to
bring
it
all
to
a
harmonious
conclusion
to
encourage
the
young
people
to
bring
them
to
reason
to
show
them
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
that
their
designs
were
known
and
then
to
point
out
to
them
new
aims
for
rational
and
more
noble
activity
oh
how
can
i
describe
the
effect
of
this
on
andrey
antonovitch
hearing
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
duped
him
again
and
had
made
a
fool
of
him
so
coarsely
that
he
had
told
her
much
more
than
he
had
told
him
and
sooner
than
him
and
that
perhaps
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
the
chief
instigator
of
all
these
criminal
designshe
flew
into
a
frenzy
senseless
but
malignant
woman
he
cried
snapping
his
bonds
at
one
blow
let
me
tell
you
i
shall
arrest
your
worthless
lover
at
once
i
shall
put
him
in
fetters
and
send
him
to
the
fortress
ori
shall
jump
out
of
a
window
before
your
eyes
this
minute
yulia
mihailovna
turning
green
with
anger
greeted
this
tirade
at
once
with
a
burst
of
prolonged
ringing
laughter
going
off
into
peals
such
as
one
hears
at
the
french
theatre
when
a
parisian
actress
imported
for
a
fee
of
a
hundred
thousand
to
play
a
coquette
laughs
in
her
husbands
face
for
daring
to
be
jealous
of
her
von
lembke
rushed
to
the
window
but
suddenly
stopped
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
folded
his
arms
across
his
chest
and
white
as
a
corpse
looked
with
a
sinister
gaze
at
the
laughing
lady
do
you
know
yulia
do
you
know
he
said
in
a
gasping
and
suppliant
voice
do
you
know
that
even
i
can
do
something
but
at
the
renewed
and
even
louder
laughter
that
followed
his
last
words
he
clenched
his
teeth
groaned
and
suddenly
rushed
not
towards
the
window
but
at
his
spouse
with
his
fist
raised
he
did
not
bring
it
downno
i
repeat
again
and
again
no
but
it
was
the
last
straw
he
ran
to
his
own
room
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
flung
himself
dressed
as
he
was
face
downwards
on
his
bed
wrapped
himself
convulsively
head
and
all
in
the
sheet
and
lay
so
for
two
hoursincapable
of
sleep
incapable
of
thought
with
a
load
on
his
heart
and
blank
immovable
despair
in
his
soul
now
and
then
he
shivered
all
over
with
an
agonising
feverish
tremor
disconnected
and
irrelevant
things
kept
coming
into
his
mind
at
one
minute
he
thought
of
the
old
clock
which
used
to
hang
on
his
wall
fifteen
years
ago
in
petersburg
and
had
lost
the
minutehand
at
another
of
the
cheerful
clerk
millebois
and
how
they
had
once
caught
a
sparrow
together
in
alexandrovsky
park
and
had
laughed
so
that
they
could
be
heard
all
over
the
park
remembering
that
one
of
them
was
already
a
college
assessor
i
imagine
that
about
seven
in
the
morning
he
must
have
fallen
asleep
without
being
aware
of
it
himself
and
must
have
slept
with
enjoyment
with
agreeable
dreams
waking
about
ten
oclock
he
jumped
wildly
out
of
bed
remembered
everything
at
once
and
slapped
himself
on
the
head
he
refused
his
breakfast
and
would
see
neither
blum
nor
the
chief
of
the
police
nor
the
clerk
who
came
to
remind
him
that
he
was
expected
to
preside
over
a
meeting
that
morning
he
would
listen
to
nothing
and
did
not
want
to
understand
he
ran
like
one
possessed
to
yulia
mihailovnas
part
of
the
house
there
sofya
antropovna
an
old
lady
of
good
family
who
had
lived
for
years
with
yulia
mihailovna
explained
to
him
that
his
wife
had
set
off
at
ten
oclock
that
morning
with
a
large
company
in
three
carriages
to
varvara
petrovna
stavrogins
to
skvoreshniki
to
look
over
the
place
with
a
view
to
the
second
fte
which
was
planned
for
a
fortnight
later
and
that
the
visit
today
had
been
arranged
with
varvara
petrovna
three
days
before
overwhelmed
with
this
news
andrey
antonovitch
returned
to
his
study
and
impulsively
ordered
the
horses
he
could
hardly
wait
for
them
to
be
got
ready
his
soul
was
hungering
for
yulia
mihailovnato
look
at
her
to
be
near
her
for
five
minutes
perhaps
she
would
glance
at
him
notice
him
would
smile
as
before
forgive
him
ooh
arent
the
horses
ready
mechanically
he
opened
a
thick
book
lying
on
the
table
he
sometimes
used
to
try
his
fortune
in
this
way
with
a
book
opening
it
at
random
and
reading
the
three
lines
at
the
top
of
the
righthand
page
what
turned
up
was
tout
est
pour
le
mieux
dans
le
meilleur
des
mondes
possiblesvoltaire
candide
he
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
contempt
and
ran
to
get
into
the
carriage
skvoreshniki
the
coachman
said
afterwards
that
his
master
urged
him
on
all
the
way
but
as
soon
as
they
were
getting
near
the
mansion
he
suddenly
told
him
to
turn
and
drive
back
to
the
town
bidding
him
drive
fast
please
drive
fast
before
they
reached
the
town
wall
master
told
me
to
stop
again
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
went
across
the
road
into
the
field
i
thought
he
felt
ill
but
he
stopped
and
began
looking
at
the
flowers
and
so
he
stood
for
a
time
it
was
strange
really
i
began
to
feel
quite
uneasy
this
was
the
coachmans
testimony
i
remember
the
weather
that
morning
it
was
a
cold
clear
but
windy
september
day
before
andrey
antonovitch
stretched
a
forbidding
landscape
of
bare
fields
from
which
the
crop
had
long
been
harvested
there
were
a
few
dying
yellow
flowers
pitiful
relics
blown
about
by
the
howling
wind
did
he
want
to
compare
himself
and
his
fate
with
those
wretched
flowers
battered
by
the
autumn
and
the
frost
i
dont
think
so
in
fact
i
feel
sure
it
was
not
so
and
that
he
realised
nothing
about
the
flowers
in
spite
of
the
evidence
of
the
coachman
and
of
the
police
superintendent
who
drove
up
at
that
moment
and
asserted
afterwards
that
he
found
the
governor
with
a
bunch
of
yellow
flowers
in
his
hand
this
police
superintendent
flibusterov
by
name
was
an
ardent
champion
of
authority
who
had
only
recently
come
to
our
town
but
had
already
distinguished
himself
and
become
famous
by
his
inordinate
zeal
by
a
certain
vehemence
in
the
execution
of
his
duties
and
his
inveterate
inebriety
jumping
out
of
the
carriage
and
not
the
least
disconcerted
at
the
sight
of
what
the
governor
was
doing
he
blurted
out
all
in
one
breath
with
a
frantic
expression
yet
with
an
air
of
conviction
that
theres
an
upset
in
the
town
eh
what
said
andrey
antonovitch
turning
to
him
with
a
stern
face
but
without
a
trace
of
surprise
or
any
recollection
of
his
carriage
and
his
coachman
as
though
he
had
been
in
his
own
study
policesuperintendent
flibusterov
your
excellency
theres
a
riot
in
the
town
filibusters
andrey
antonovitch
said
thoughtfully
just
so
your
excellency
the
shpigulin
men
are
making
a
riot
the
shpigulin
men
the
name
shpigulin
seemed
to
remind
him
of
something
he
started
and
put
his
finger
to
his
forehead
the
shpigulin
men
in
silence
and
still
plunged
in
thought
he
walked
without
haste
to
the
carriage
took
his
seat
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
town
the
policesuperintendent
followed
in
the
droshky
i
imagine
that
he
had
vague
impressions
of
many
interesting
things
of
all
sorts
on
the
way
but
i
doubt
whether
he
had
any
definite
idea
or
any
settled
intention
as
he
drove
into
the
open
space
in
front
of
his
house
but
no
sooner
did
he
see
the
resolute
and
orderly
ranks
of
the
rioters
the
cordon
of
police
the
helpless
and
perhaps
purposely
helpless
chief
of
police
and
the
general
expectation
of
which
he
was
the
object
than
all
the
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
with
a
pale
face
he
stepped
out
of
his
carriage
caps
off
he
said
breathlessly
and
hardly
audibly
on
your
knees
he
squealed
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
to
his
own
surprise
too
and
perhaps
the
very
unexpectedness
of
the
position
was
the
explanation
of
what
followed
can
a
sledge
on
a
switchback
at
carnival
stop
short
as
it
flies
down
the
hill
what
made
it
worse
andrey
antonovitch
had
been
all
his
life
serene
in
character
and
never
shouted
or
stamped
at
anyone
and
such
people
are
always
the
most
dangerous
if
it
once
happens
that
something
sets
their
sledge
sliding
downhill
everything
was
whirling
before
his
eyes
filibusters
he
yelled
still
more
shrilly
and
absurdly
and
his
voice
broke
he
stood
not
knowing
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
knowing
and
feeling
in
his
whole
being
that
he
certainly
would
do
something
directly
lord
was
heard
from
the
crowd
a
lad
began
crossing
himself
three
or
four
men
actually
did
try
to
kneel
down
but
the
whole
mass
moved
three
steps
forward
and
suddenly
all
began
talking
at
once
your
excellency
we
were
hired
for
a
term
the
manager
you
mustnt
say
and
so
on
and
so
on
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
alas
andrey
antonovitch
could
distinguish
nothing
the
flowers
were
still
in
his
hands
the
riot
was
as
real
to
him
as
the
prison
carts
were
to
stepan
trofimovitch
and
flitting
to
and
fro
in
the
crowd
of
rioters
who
gazed
openeyed
at
him
he
seemed
to
see
pyotr
stepanovitch
who
had
egged
them
onpyotr
stepanovitch
whom
he
hated
and
whose
image
had
never
left
him
since
yesterday
rods
he
cried
even
more
unexpectedly
a
dead
silence
followed
from
the
facts
i
have
learnt
and
those
i
have
conjectured
this
must
have
been
what
happened
at
the
beginning
but
i
have
no
such
exact
information
for
what
followed
nor
can
i
conjecture
it
so
easily
there
are
some
facts
however
in
the
first
place
rods
were
brought
on
the
scene
with
strange
rapidity
they
had
evidently
been
got
ready
beforehand
in
expectation
by
the
intelligent
chief
of
the
police
not
more
than
two
or
at
most
three
were
actually
flogged
however
that
fact
i
wish
to
lay
stress
on
its
an
absolute
fabrication
to
say
that
the
whole
crowd
of
rioters
or
at
least
half
of
them
were
punished
it
is
a
nonsensical
story
too
that
a
poor
but
respectable
lady
was
caught
as
she
passed
by
and
promptly
thrashed
yet
i
read
myself
an
account
of
this
incident
afterwards
among
the
provincial
items
of
a
petersburg
newspaper
many
people
in
the
town
talked
of
an
old
woman
called
avdotya
petrovna
tarapygin
who
lived
in
the
almshouse
by
the
cemetery
she
was
said
on
her
way
home
from
visiting
a
friend
to
have
forced
her
way
into
the
crowd
of
spectators
through
natural
curiosity
seeing
what
was
going
on
she
cried
out
what
a
shame
and
spat
on
the
ground
for
this
it
was
said
she
had
been
seized
and
flogged
too
this
story
not
only
appeared
in
print
but
in
our
excitement
we
positively
got
up
a
subscription
for
her
benefit
i
subscribed
twenty
kopecks
myself
and
would
you
believe
it
it
appears
now
that
there
was
no
old
woman
called
tarapygin
living
in
the
almshouse
at
all
i
went
to
inquire
at
the
almshouse
by
the
cemetery
myself
they
had
never
heard
of
anyone
called
tarapygin
there
and
whats
more
they
were
quite
offended
when
i
told
them
the
story
that
was
going
round
i
mention
this
fabulous
avdotya
petrovna
because
what
happened
to
her
if
she
really
had
existed
very
nearly
happened
to
stepan
trofimovitch
possibly
indeed
his
adventure
may
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
ridiculous
tale
about
the
old
woman
that
is
as
the
gossip
went
on
growing
he
was
transformed
into
this
old
dame
what
i
find
most
difficult
to
understand
is
how
he
came
to
slip
away
from
me
as
soon
as
he
got
into
the
square
as
i
had
a
misgiving
of
something
very
unpleasant
i
wanted
to
take
him
round
the
square
straight
to
the
entrance
to
the
governors
but
my
own
curiosity
was
roused
and
i
stopped
only
for
one
minute
to
question
the
first
person
i
came
across
and
suddenly
i
looked
round
and
found
stepan
trofimovitch
no
longer
at
my
side
instinctively
i
darted
off
to
look
for
him
in
the
most
dangerous
place
something
made
me
feel
that
his
sledge
too
was
flying
downhill
and
i
did
as
a
fact
find
him
in
the
very
centre
of
things
i
remember
i
seized
him
by
the
arm
but
he
looked
quietly
and
proudly
at
me
with
an
air
of
immense
authority
cher
he
pronounced
in
a
voice
which
quivered
on
a
breaking
note
if
they
are
dealing
with
people
so
unceremoniously
before
us
in
an
open
square
what
is
to
be
expected
from
that
man
for
instance
if
he
happens
to
act
on
his
own
authority
and
shaking
with
indignation
and
with
an
intense
desire
to
defy
them
he
pointed
a
menacing
accusing
finger
at
flibusterov
who
was
gazing
at
us

two
paces
away
that
man
cried
the
latter
blind
with
rage
what
man
and
who
are
you
he
stepped
up
to
him
clenching
his
fist
who
are
you
he
roared
ferociously
hysterically
and
desperately
i
must
mention
that
he
knew
stepan
trofimovitch
perfectly
well
by
sight
another
moment
and
he
would
have
certainly
seized
him
by
the
collar
but
luckily
hearing
him
shout
lembke
turned
his
head
he
gazed
intensely
but
with
perplexity
at
stepan
trofimovitch
seeming
to
consider
something
and
suddenly
he
shook
his
hand
impatiently
flibusterov
was
checked
i
drew
stepan
trofimovitch
out
of
the
crowd
though
perhaps
he
may
have
wished
to
retreat
himself
home
home
i
insisted
it
was
certainly
thanks
to
lembke
that
we
were
not
beaten
go
my
friend
i
am
to
blame
for
exposing
you
to
this
you
have
a
future
and
a
career
of
a
sort
before
you

he
resolutely
mounted
the
governors
steps
the
hallporter
knew
me
i
said
that
we
both
wanted
to
see
yulia
mihailovna
we
sat
down
in
the
waitingroom
and
waited
i
was
unwilling
to
leave
my
friend
but
i
thought
it
unnecessary
to
say
anything
more
to
him
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
consecrated
himself
to
certain
death
for
the
sake
of
his
country
we
sat
down
not
side
by
side
but
in
different
cornersi
nearer
to
the
entrance
he
at
some
distance
facing
me
with
his
head
bent
in
thought
leaning
lightly
on
his
stick
he
held
his
widebrimmed
hat
in
his
left
hand
we
sat
like
that
for
ten
minutes
ii
lembke
suddenly
came
in
with
rapid
steps
accompanied
by
the
chief
of
police
looked
absentmindedly
at
us
and
taking
no
notice
of
us
was
about
to
pass
into
his
study
on
the
right
but
stepan
trofimovitch
stood
before
him
blocking
his
way
the
tall
figure
of
stepan
trofimovitch
so
unlike
other
people
made
an
impression
lembke
stopped
who
is
this
he
muttered
puzzled
as
if
he
were
questioning
the
chief
of
police
though
he
did
not
turn
his
head
towards
him
and
was
all
the
time
gazing
at
stepan
trofimovitch
retired
college
assessor
stepan
trofimovitch
verhovensky
your
excellency
answered
stepan
trofimovitch
bowing
majestically
his
excellency
went
on
staring
at
him
with
a
very
blank
expression
however
what
is
it
and
with
the
curtness
of
a
great
official
he
turned
his
ear
to
stepan
trofimovitch
with
disdainful
impatience
taking
him
for
an
ordinary
person
with
a
written
petition
of
some
sort
i
was
visited
and
my
house
was
searched
today
by
an
official
acting
in
your
excellencys
name
therefore
i
am
desirous
name
name
lembke
asked
impatiently
seeming
suddenly
to
have
an
inkling
of
something
stepan
trofimovitch
repeated
his
name
still
more
majestically
aaah
its
that
hotbed
you
have
shown
yourself
sir
in
such
a
light
are
you
a
professor
a
professor
i
once
had
the
honour
of
giving
some
lectures
to
the
young
men
of
the
x
university
the
young
men
lembke
seemed
to
start
though
i
am
ready
to
bet
that
he
grasped
very
little
of
what
was
going
on
or
even
perhaps
did
not
know
with
whom
he
was
talking
that
sir
i
wont
allow
he
cried
suddenly
getting
terribly
angry
i
wont
allow
young
men
its
all
these
manifestoes
its
an
assault
on
society
sir
a
piratical
attack
filibustering
what
is
your
request
on
the
contrary
your
wife
requested
me
to
read
something
tomorrow
at
her
fte
ive
not
come
to
make
a
request
but
to
ask
for
my
rights
at
the
fte
therell
be
no
fte
i
wont
allow
your
fte
a
lecture
a
lecture
he
screamed
furiously
i
should
be
very
glad
if
you
would
speak
to
me
rather
more
politely
your
excellency
without
stamping
or
shouting
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
boy
perhaps
you
understand
whom
you
are
speaking
to
said
lembke
turning
crimson
perfectly
your
excellency
i
am
protecting
society
while
you
are
destroying
it
you
i
remember
about
you
though
you
used
to
be
a
tutor
in
the
house
of
madame
stavrogin
yes
i
was
in
the
position
of
tutor
in
the
house
of
madame
stavrogin
and
have
been
for
twenty
years
the
hotbed
of
all
that
has
now
accumulated
all
the
fruits
i
believe
i
saw
you
just
now
in
the
square
youd
better
look
out
sir
youd
better
look
out
your
way
of
thinking
is
well
known
you
may
be
sure
that
i
keep
my
eye
on
you
i
cannot
allow
your
lectures
sir
i
cannot
dont
come
with
such
requests
to
me
he
would
have
passed
on
again
i
repeat
that
your
excellency
is
mistaken
it
was
your
wife
who
asked
me
to
give
not
a
lecture
but
a
literary
reading
at
the
fte
tomorrow
but
i
decline
to
do
so
in
any
case
now
i
humbly
request
that
you
will
explain
to
me
if
possible
how
why
and
for
what
reason
i
was
subjected
to
an
official
search
today
some
of
my
books
and
papers
private
letters
to
me
were
taken
from
me
and
wheeled
through
the
town
in
a
barrow
who
searched
you
said
lembke
starting
and
returning
to
full
consciousness
of
the
position
he
suddenly
flushed
all
over
he
turned
quickly
to
the
chief
of
police
at
that
moment
the
long
stooping
and
awkward
figure
of
blum
appeared
in
the
doorway
why
this
official
here
said
stepan
trofimovitch
indicating
him
blum
came
forward
with
a
face
that
admitted
his
responsibility
but
showed
no
contrition
vous
ne
faites
que
des
btises
lembke
threw
at
him
in
a
tone
of
vexation
and
anger
and
suddenly
he
was
transformed
and
completely
himself
again
excuse
me
he
muttered
utterly
disconcerted
and
turning
absolutely
crimson
all
this
all
this
was
probably
a
mere
blunder
a
misunderstanding
nothing
but
a
misunderstanding
your
excellency
observed
stepan
trofimovitch
once
when
i
was
young
i
saw
a
characteristic
incident
in
the
corridor
of
a
theatre
a
man
ran
up
to
another
and
gave
him
a
sounding
smack
in
the
face
before
the
whole
public
perceiving
at
once
that
his
victim
was
not
the
person
whom
he
had
intended
to
chastise
but
someone
quite
different
who
only
slightly
resembled
him
he
pronounced
angrily
with
the
haste
of
one
whose
moments
are
preciousas
your
excellency
did
just
nowive
made
a
mistake
excuse
me
it
was
a
misunderstanding
nothing
but
a
misunderstanding
and
when
the
offended
man
remained
resentful
and
cried
out
he
observed
to
him
with
extreme
annoyance
why
i
tell
you
it
was
a
misunderstanding
what
are
you
crying
out
about
thats
thats
very
amusing
of
courselembke
gave
a
wry
smilebut
but
cant
you
see
how
unhappy
i
am
myself
he
almost
screamed
and
seemed
about
to
hide
his
face
in
his
hands
this
unexpected
and
piteous
exclamation
almost
a
sob
was
almost
more
than
one
could
bear
it
was
probably
the
first
moment
since
the
previous
day
that
he
had
full
vivid
consciousness
of
all
that
had
happenedand
it
was
followed
by
complete
humiliating
despair
that
could
not
be
disguisedwho
knows
in
another
minute
he
might
have
sobbed
aloud
for
the
first
moment
stepan
trofimovitch
looked
wildly
at
him
then
he
suddenly
bowed
his
head
and
in
a
voice
pregnant
with
feeling
pronounced
your
excellency
dont
trouble
yourself
with
my
petulant
complaint
and
only
give
orders
for
my
books
and
letters
to
be
restored
to
me
he
was
interrupted
at
that
very
instant
yulia
mihailovna
returned
and
entered
noisily
with
all
the
party
which
had
accompanied
her
but
at
this
point
i
should
like
to
tell
my
story
in
as
much
detail
as
possible
iii
in
the
first
place
the
whole
company
who
had
filled
three
carriages
crowded
into
the
waitingroom
there
was
a
special
entrance
to
yulia
mihailovnas
apartments
on
the
left
as
one
entered
the
house
but
on
this
occasion
they
all
went
through
the
waitingroomand
i
imagine
just
because
stepan
trofimovitch
was
there
and
because
all
that
had
happened
to
him
as
well
as
the
shpigulin
affair
had
reached
yulia
mihailovnas
ears
as
she
drove
into
the
town
lyamshin
who
for
some
misdemeanour
had
not
been
invited
to
join
the
party
and
so
knew
all
that
had
been
happening
in
the
town
before
anyone
else
brought
her
the
news
with
spiteful
glee
he
hired
a
wretched
cossack
nag
and
hastened
on
the
way
to
skvoreshniki
to
meet
the
returning
cavalcade
with
the
diverting
intelligence
i
fancy
that
in
spite
of
her
lofty
determination
yulia
mihailovna
was
a
little
disconcerted
on
hearing
such
surprising
news
but
probably
only
for
an
instant
the
political
aspect
of
the
affair
for
instance
could
not
cause
her
uneasiness
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
impressed
upon
her
three
or
four
times
that
the
shpigulin
ruffians
ought
to
be
flogged
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
certainly
had
for
some
time
past
been
a
great
authority
in
her
eyes
but
anyway
i
shall
make
him
pay
for
it
she
doubtless
reflected
the
he
of
course
referring
to
her
spouse
i
must
observe
in
passing
that
on
this
occasion
as
though
purposely
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
taken
no
part
in
the
expedition
and
no
one
had
seen
him
all
day
i
must
mention
too
by
the
way
that
varvara
petrovna
had
come
back
to
the
town
with
her
guests
in
the
same
carriage
with
yulia
mihailovna
in
order
to
be
present
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
committee
which
was
arranging
the
fte
for
the
next
day
she
too
must
have
been
interested
and
perhaps
even
agitated
by
the
news
about
stepan
trofimovitch
communicated
by
lyamshin
the
hour
of
reckoning
for
andrey
antonovitch
followed
at
once
alas
he
felt
that
from
the
first
glance
at
his
admirable
wife
with
an
open
air
and
an
enchanting
smile
she
went
quickly
up
to
stepan
trofimovitch
held
out
her
exquisitely
gloved
hand
and
greeted
him
with
a
perfect
shower
of
flattering
phrasesas
though
the
only
thing
she
cared
about
that
morning
was
to
make
haste
to
be
charming
to
stepan
trofimovitch
because
at
last
she
saw
him
in
her
house
there
was
not
one
hint
of
the
search
that
morning
it
was
as
though
she
knew
nothing
of
it
there
was
not
one
word
to
her
husband
not
one
glance
in
his
directionas
though
he
had
not
been
in
the
room
whats
more
she
promptly
confiscated
stepan
trofimovitch
and
carried
him
off
to
the
drawingroomas
though
he
had
had
no
interview
with
lembke
or
as
though
it
was
not
worth
prolonging
if
he
had
i
repeat
again
i
think
that
in
this
yulia
mihailovna
in
spite
of
her
aristocratic
tone
made
another
great
mistake
and
karmazinov
particularly
did
much
to
aggravate
this
he
had
taken
part
in
the
expedition
at
yulia
mihailovnas
special
request
and
in
that
way
had
incidentally
paid
his
visit
to
varvara
petrovna
and
she
was
so
poorspirited
as
to
be
perfectly
delighted
at
it
on
seeing
stepan
trofimovitch
he
called
out
from
the
doorway
he
came
in
behind
the
rest
and
pressed
forward
to
embrace
him
even
interrupting
yulia
mihailovna
what
years
what
ages
at
lastexcellent
ami
he
made
as
though
to
kiss
him
offering
his
cheek
of
course
and
stepan
trofimovitch
was
so
fluttered
that
he
could
not
avoid
saluting
it
cher
he
said
to
me
that
evening
recalling
all
the
events
of
that
day
i
wondered
at
that
moment
which
of
us
was
the
most
contemptible
he
embracing
me
only
to
humiliate
me
or
i
despising
him
and
his
face
and
kissing
it
on
the
spot
though
i
might
have
turned
away
foo
come
tell
me
about
yourself
tell
me
everything
karmazinov
drawled
and
lisped
as
though
it
were
possible
for
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
give
an
account
of
twentyfive
years
of
his
life
but
this
foolish
trifling
was
the
height
of
chic
remember
that
the
last
time
we
met
was
at
the
granovsky
dinner
in
moscow
and
that
twentyfour
years
have
passed
since
then
stepan
trofimovitch
began
very
reasonably
and
consequently
not
at
all
in
the
same
chic
style
ce
cher
homme
karmazinov
interrupted
with
shrill
familiarity
squeezing
his
shoulder
with
exaggerated
friendliness
make
haste
and
take
us
to
your
room
yulia
mihailovna
there
hell
sit
down
and
tell
us
everything
and
yet
i
was
never
at
all
intimate
with
that
peevish
old
woman
stepan
trofimovitch
went
on
complaining
to
me
that
same
evening
shaking
with
anger
we
were
almost
boys
and
id
begun
to
detest
him
even
then
just
as
he
had
me
of
course
yulia
mihailovnas
drawingroom
filled
up
quickly
varvara
petrovna
was
particularly
excited
though
she
tried
to
appear
indifferent
but
i
caught
her
once
or
twice
glancing
with
hatred
at
karmazinov
and
with
wrath
at
stepan
trofimovitchthe
wrath
of
anticipation
the
wrath
of
jealousy
and
love
if
stepan
trofimovitch
had
blundered
this
time
and
had
let
karmazinov
make
him
look
small
before
every
one
i
believe
she
would
have
leapt
up
and
beaten
him
i
have
forgotten
to
say
that
liza
too
was
there
and
i
had
never
seen
her
more
radiant
carelessly
lighthearted
and
happy
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
there
too
of
course
in
the
crowd
of
young
ladies
and
rather
vulgar
young
men
who
made
up
yulia
mihailovnas
usual
retinue
and
among
whom
this
vulgarity
was
taken
for
sprightliness
and
cheap
cynicism
for
wit
i
noticed
two
or
three
new
faces
a
very
obsequious
pole
who
was
on
a
visit
in
the
town
a
german
doctor
a
sturdy
old
fellow
who
kept
loudly
laughing
with
great
zest
at
his
own
wit
and
lastly
a
very
young
princeling
from
petersburg
like
an
automaton
figure
with
the
deportment
of
a
state
dignitary
and
a
fearfully
high
collar
but
it
was
evident
that
yulia
mihailovna
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
this
visitor
and
was
even
a
little
anxious
of
the
impression
her
salon
was
making
on
him
cher
m
karmazinov
said
stepan
trofimovitch
sitting
in
a
picturesque
pose
on
the
sofa
and
suddenly
beginning
to
lisp
as
daintily
as
karmazinov
himself
cher
m
karmazinov
the
life
of
a
man
of
our
time
and
of
certain
convictions
even
after
an
interval
of
twentyfive
years
is
bound
to
seem
monotonous
the
german
went
off
into
a
loud
abrupt
guffaw
like
a
neigh
evidently
imagining
that
stepan
trofimovitch
had
said
something
exceedingly
funny
the
latter
gazed
at
him
with
studied
amazement
but
produced
no
effect
on
him
whatever
the
prince
too
looked
at
the
german
turning
head
collar
and
all
towards
him
and
putting
up
his
pincenez
though
without
the
slightest
curiosity

is
bound
to
seem
monotonous
stepan
trofimovitch
intentionally
repeated
drawling
each
word
as
deliberately
and
nonchalantly
as
possible
and
so
my
life
has
been
throughout
this
quarter
of
a
century
et
comme
on
trouve
partout
plus
de
moines
que
de
raison
and
as
i
am
entirely
of
this
opinion
it
has
come
to
pass
that
throughout
this
quarter
of
a
century
i
cest
charmant
les
moines
whispered
yulia
mihailovna
turning
to
varvara
petrovna
who
was
sitting
beside
her
varvara
petrovna
responded
with
a
look
of
pride
but
karmazinov
could
not
stomach
the
success
of
the
french
phrase
and
quickly
and
shrilly
interrupted
stepan
trofimovitch
as
for
me
i
am
quite
at
rest
on
that
score
and
for
the
past
seven
years
ive
been
settled
at
karlsruhe
and
last
year
when
it
was
proposed
by
the
town
council
to
lay
down
a
new
waterpipe
i
felt
in
my
heart
that
this
question
of
waterpipes
in
karlsruhe
was
dearer
and
closer
to
my
heart
than
all
the
questions
of
my
precious
fatherland
in
this
period
of
socalled
reform
i
cant
help
sympathising
though
it
goes
against
the
grain
sighed
stepan
trofimovitch
bowing
his
head
significantly
yulia
mihailovna
was
triumphant
the
conversation
was
becoming
profound
and
taking
a
political
turn
a
drainpipe
the
doctor
inquired
in
a
loud
voice
a
waterpipe
doctor
a
waterpipe
and
i
positively
assisted
them
in
drawing
up
the
plan
the
doctor
went
off
into
a
deafening
guffaw
many
people
followed
his
example
laughing
in
the
face
of
the
doctor
who
remained
unconscious
of
it
and
was
highly
delighted
that
every
one
was
laughing
you
must
allow
me
to
differ
from
you
karmazinov
yulia
mihailovna
hastened
to
interpose
karlsruhe
is
all
very
well
but
you
are
fond
of
mystifying
people
and
this
time
we
dont
believe
you
what
russian
writer
has
presented
so
many
modern
types
has
brought
forward
so
many
contemporary
problems
has
put
his
finger
on
the
most
vital
modern
points
which
make
up
the
type
of
the
modern
man
of
action
you
only
you
and
no
one
else
its
no
use
your
assuring
us
of
your
coldness
towards
your
own
country
and
your
ardent
interest
in
the
waterpipes
of
karlsruhe
ha
ha
yes
no
doubt
lisped
karmazinov
i
have
portrayed
in
the
character
of
pogozhev
all
the
failings
of
the
slavophils
and
in
the
character
of
nikodimov
all
the
failings
of
the
westerners
i
say
hardly
all
lyamshin
whispered
slyly
but
i
do
this
by
the
way
simply
to
while
away
the
tedious
hours
and
to
satisfy
the
persistent
demands
of
my
fellowcountrymen
you
are
probably
aware
stepan
trofimovitch
yulia
mihailovna
went
on
enthusiastically
that
tomorrow
we
shall
have
the
delight
of
hearing
the
charming
lines
one
of
the
last
of
semyon
yakovlevitchs
exquisite

called

he
announces
in
this
piece
that
he
will
write
no
more
that
nothing
in
the
world
will
induce
him
to
if
angels
from
heaven
or
whats
more
all
the
best
society
were
to
implore
him
to
change
his
mind
in
fact
he
is
laying
down
the
pen
for
good
and
this
graceful
merci
is
addressed
to
the
public
in
grateful
acknowledgment
of
the
constant
enthusiasm
with
which
it
has
for
so
many
years
greeted
his
unswerving
loyalty
to
true
russian
thought
yulia
mihailovna
was
at
the
acme
of
bliss
yes
i
shall
make
my
farewell
i
shall
say
my
merci
and
depart
and
there
in
karlsruhe
i
shall
close
my
eyes
karmazinov
was
gradually
becoming
maudlin
like
many
of
our
great
writers
and
there
are
numbers
of
them
amongst
us
he
could
not
resist
praise
and
began
to
be
limp
at
once
in
spite
of
his
penetrating
wit
but
i
consider
this
is
pardonable
they
say
that
one
of
our
shakespeares
positively
blurted
out
in
private
conversation
that
we
great
men
cant
do
otherwise
and
so
on
and
whats
more
was
unaware
of
it
there
in
karlsruhe
i
shall
close
my
eyes
when
we
have
done
our
duty
all
thats
left
for
us
great
men
is
to
make
haste
to
close
our
eyes
without
seeking
a
reward
i
shall
do
so
too
give
me
the
address
and
i
shall
come
to
karlsruhe
to
visit
your
tomb

a

this
unfortunate
annoyance

i
had
no

so
longing

of
the
most

said
neatly

pyotr

bursting
into
the

ive
only
just
got
him
in

in
one
morning
he
has
been
searched
arrested
taken
by
the
collar
by
a
policeman
and
here
ladies
are
cooing
to
him
in
the
governors

every
bone
in

aching
with
rapture

wildest

too
grand
an
idea
to
be
unrecognised
by
stepan

yulia
mihailovna
took
up
the
gauntlet
with
energy
its
a
great
idea
but
its
exponents
are
not
always
great
men
et

stepan
trofimovitch
ended
addressing
his
son
and
rising
gracefully
from
his
seat
but
at
this
point
an
utterly
unexpected
circumstance
occurred
von
lembke
had
been
in
the
room
for
some
time
but
seemed
unnoticed
by
anyone
though
every
one
had
seen
him
come
in
in
accordance
with
her
former
plan
yulia
mihailovna
went
on
ignoring
him
he
took
up
his
position
near
the
door
and
with
a
stern
face
listened
gloomily
to
the
conversation
hearing
an
allusion
to
the
events
of
the
morning
he
began
fidgeting
uneasily
stared
at
the
prince
obviously
struck
by
his
stiffly
starched
prominent
collar
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
start
on
hearing
the
voice
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
seeing
him
burst
in
and
no
sooner
had
stepan
trofimovitch
uttered
his
phrase
about
socialists
than
lembke
went
up
to
him
pushing
against
lyamshin
who
at
once
skipped
out
of
the
way
with
an
affected
gesture
of
surprise
rubbing
his
shoulder
and
pretending
that
he
had
been
terribly
bruised
enough
said
von
lembke
to
stepan
trofimovitch
vigorously
gripping
the
hand
of
the
dismayed
gentleman
and
squeezing
it
with
all
his
might
in
both
of
his
enough
the
filibusters
of
our
day
are
unmasked
not
another
word
measures
have
been
taken
he
spoke
loudly
enough
to
be
heard
by
all
the
room
and
concluded
with
energy
the
impression
he
produced
was
poignant
everybody
felt
that
something
was
wrong
i
saw
yulia
mihailovna
turn
pale
the
effect
was
heightened
by
a
trivial
accident
after
announcing
that
measures
had
been
taken
lembke
turned
sharply
and
walked
quickly
towards
the
door
but
he
had
hardly
taken
two
steps
when
he
stumbled
over
a
rug
swerved
forward
and
almost
fell
for
a
moment
he
stood
still
looked
at
the
rug
at
which
he
had
stumbled
and
uttering
aloud
change
it
went
out
of
the
room
yulia
mihailovna
ran
after
him
her
exit
was
followed
by
an
uproar
in
which
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
anything
some
said
he
was
deranged
others
that
he
was
liable
to
attacks
others
put
their
fingers
to
their
forehead
lyamshin
in
the
corner
put
his
two
fingers
above
his
forehead
people
hinted
at
some
domestic
difficultiesin
a
whisper
of
course
no
one
took
up
his
hat
all
were
waiting
i
dont
know
what
yulia
mihailovna
managed
to
do
but
five
minutes
later
she
came
back
doing
her
utmost
to
appear
composed
she
replied
evasively
that
andrey
antonovitch
was
rather
excited
but
that
it
meant
nothing
that
he
had
been
like
that
from
a
child
that
she
knew
much
better
and
that
the
fte
next
day
would
certainly
cheer
him
up
then
followed
a
few
flattering
words
to
stepan
trofimovitch
simply
from
civility
and
a
loud
invitation
to
the
members
of
the
committee
to
open
the
meeting
now
at
once
only
then
all
who
were
not
members
of
the
committee
prepared
to
go
home
but
the
painful
incidents
of
this
fatal
day
were
not
yet
over
i
noticed
at
the
moment
when
nikolay
stavrogin
came
in
that
liza
looked
quickly
and
intently
at
him
and
was
for
a
long
time
unable
to
take
her
eyes
off
himso
much
so
that
at
last
it
attracted
attention
i
saw
mavriky
nikolaevitch
bend
over
her
from
behind
he
seemed
to
mean
to
whisper
something
to
her
but
evidently
changed
his
intention
and
drew
himself
up
quickly
looking
round
at
every
one
with
a
guilty
air
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
too
excited
curiosity
his
face
was
paler
than
usual
and
there
was
a
strangely
absentminded
look
in
his
eyes
after
flinging
his
question
at
stepan
trofimovitch
he
seemed
to
forget
about
him
altogether
and
i
really
believe
he
even
forgot
to
speak
to
his
hostess
he
did
not
once
look
at
lizanot
because
he
did
not
want
to
but
i
am
certain
because
he
did
not
notice
her
either
and
suddenly
after
the
brief
silence
that
followed
yulia
mihailovnas
invitation
to
open
the
meeting
without
loss
of
time
lizas
musical
voice
intentionally
loud
was
heard
she
called
to
stavrogin
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
a
captain
who
calls
himself
a
relation
of
yours
the
brother
of
your
wife
and
whose
name
is
lebyadkin
keeps
writing
impertinent
letters
to
me
complaining
of
you
and
offering
to
tell
me
some
secrets
about
you
if
he
really
is
a
connection
of
yours
please
tell
him
not
to
annoy
me
and
save
me
from
this
unpleasantness
there
was
a
note
of
desperate
challenge
in
these
wordsevery
one
realised
it
the
accusation
was
unmistakable
though
perhaps
it
was
a
surprise
to
herself
she
was
like
a
man
who
shuts
his
eyes
and
throws
himself
from
the
roof
but
nikolay
stavrogins
answer
was
even
more
astounding
to
begin
with
it
was
strange
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
and
listened
to
liza
with
unruffled
attention
there
was
no
trace
of
either
confusion
or
anger
in
his
face
simply
firmly
even
with
an
air
of
perfect
readiness
he
answered
the
fatal
question
yes
i
have
the
misfortune
to
be
connected
with
that
man
i
have
been
the
husband
of
his
sister
for
nearly
five
years
you
may
be
sure
i
will
give
him
your
message
as
soon
as
possible
and
ill
answer
for
it
that
he
shant
annoy
you
again
i
shall
never
forget
the
horror
that
was
reflected
on
the
face
of
varvara
petrovna
with
a
distracted
air
she
got
up
from
her
seat
lifting
up
her
right
hand
as
though
to
ward
off
a
blow
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
looked
at
her
looked
at
liza
at
the
spectators
and
suddenly
smiled
with
infinite
disdain
he
walked
deliberately
out
of
the
room
every
one
saw
how
liza
leapt
up
from
the
sofa
as
soon
as
he
turned
to
go
and
unmistakably
made
a
movement
to
run
after
him
but
she
controlled
herself
and
did
not
run
after
him
she
went
quietly
out
of
the
room
without
saying
a
word
or
even
looking
at
anyone
accompanied
of
course
by
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
rushed
after
her
the
uproar
and
the
gossip
that
night
in
the
town
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
varvara
petrovna
shut
herself
up
in
her
town
house
and
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
it
was
said
went
straight
to
skvoreshniki
without
seeing
his
mother
stepan
trofimovitch
sent
me
that
evening
to
cette
chre
amie
to
implore
her
to
allow
him
to
come
to
her
but
she
would
not
see
me
he
was
terribly
overwhelmed
he
shed
tears
such
a
marriage
such
a
marriage
such
an
awful
thing
in
the
family
he
kept
repeating
he
remembered
karmazinov
however
and
abused
him
terribly
he
set
to
work
vigorously
to
prepare
for
the
reading
too
andthe
artistic
temperamentrehearsed
before
the
lookingglass
and
went
over
all
the
jokes
and
witticisms
uttered
in
the
course
of
his
life
which
he
had
written
down
in
a
separate
notebook
to
insert
into
his
reading
next
day
my
dear
i
do
this
for
the
sake
of
a
great
idea

justifying
himself

the

the
fte
took
place
in
spite
of
all
the
perplexities
of
the
preceding
shpigulin

i
believe
that
even
if

had
died
the
previous
night
the
fte
would
still
have
taken
place
next

peculiar
was
the
significance
yulia
mihailovna
attached
to
it
alas
up
to
the
last
moment
she
was
blind
and
had
no
inkling
of
the
state
of
public
feeling
no
one
believed
at
last
that
the
festive
day
would
pass
without
some
tremendous
scandal
some
catastrophe
as
some
people
expressed
it
rubbing
their
hands
in
anticipation
many
people
it
is
true
tried
to
assume
a
frowning
and
diplomatic
countenance
but
speaking
generally
every
russian
is
inordinately
delighted
at
any
public
scandal
and
disorder
it
is
true
that
we
did
feel
something
much
more
serious
than
the
mere
craving
for
a
scandal
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
irritation
a
feeling
of
implacable
resentment
every
one
seemed
thoroughly
disgusted
with
everything
a
kind
of
bewildered
cynicism
a
forced
as
it
were
strained
cynicism
was
predominant
in
every
one
the
only
people
who
were
free
from
bewilderment
were
the
ladies
and
they
were
clear
on
only
one
point
their
remorseless
detestation
of
yulia
mihailovna
ladies
of
all
shades
of
opinion
were
agreed
in
this
and
she
poor
dear
had
no
suspicion
up
to
the
last
hour
she
was
persuaded
that
she
was
surrounded
by
followers
and
that
they
were
still
fanatically
devoted
to
her
i
have
already
hinted
that
some
low
fellows
of
different
sorts
had
made
their
appearance
amongst
us
in
turbulent
times
of
upheaval
or
transition
low
characters
always
come
to
the
front
everywhere
i
am
not
speaking
now
of
the
socalled
advanced
people
who
are
always
in
a
hurry
to
be
in
advance
of
every
one
else
their
absorbing
anxiety
and
who
always
have
some
more
or
less
definite
though
often
very
stupid
aim
no
i
am
speaking
only
of
the
riffraff
in
every
period
of
transition
this
riffraff
which
exists
in
every
society
rises
to
the
surface
and
is
not
only
without
any
aim
but
has
not
even
a
symptom
of
an
idea
and
merely
does
its
utmost
to
give
expression
to
uneasiness
and
impatience
moreover
this
riffraff
almost
always
falls
unconsciously
under
the
control
of
the
little
group
of
advanced
people
who
do
act
with
a
definite
aim
and
this
little
group
can
direct
all
this
rabble
as
it
pleases
if
only
it
does
not
itself
consist
of
absolute
idiots
which
however
is
sometimes
the
case
it
is
said
among
us
now
that
it
is
all
over
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
directed
by
the
internationale
and
yulia
mihailovna
by
pyotr
stepanovitch
while
she
controlled
under
his
rule
a
rabble
of
all
sorts
the
more
sober
minds
amongst
us
wonder
at
themselves
now
and
cant
understand
how
they
came
to
be
so
foolish
at
the
time
what
constituted
the
turbulence
of
our
time
and
what
transition
it
was
we
were
passing
through
i
dont
know
nor
i
think
does
anyone
unless
it
were
some
of
those
visitors
of
ours
yet
the
most
worthless
fellows
suddenly
gained
predominant
influence
began
loudly
criticising
everything
sacred
though
till
then
they
had
not
dared
to
open
their
mouths
while
the
leading
people
who
had
till
then
so
satisfactorily
kept
the
upper
hand
began
listening
to
them
and
holding
their
peace
some
even
simpered
approval
in
a
most
shameless
way
people
like
lyamshin
and
telyatnikov
like
gogols
tentyotnikov
drivelling
homebred
editions
of
radishtchev
wretched
little
jews
with
a
mournful
but
haughty
smile
guffawing
foreigners
poets
of
advanced
tendencies
from
the
capital
poets
who
made
up
with
peasant
coats
and
tarred
boots
for
the
lack
of
tendencies
or
talents
majors
and
colonels
who
ridiculed
the
senselessness
of
the
service
and
who
would
have
been
ready
for
an
extra
rouble
to
unbuckle
their
swords
and
take
jobs
as
railway
clerks
generals
who
had
abandoned
their
duties
to
become
lawyers
advanced
mediators
advancing
merchants
innumerable
divinity
students
women
who
were
the
embodiment
of
the
woman

these
suddenly
gained
complete
sway
among
us
and
over
whom
over
the
club
the
venerable
officials
over
generals
with
wooden
legs
over
the
very
strict
and
inaccessible
ladies
of
our
local
society
since
even
varvara
petrovna
was
almost
at
the
beck
and
call
of
this
rabble
right
up
to
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
with
her
son
our
other
local
minervas
may
well
be
pardoned
for
their
temporary
aberration
now
all
this
is
attributed
as
i
have
mentioned
already
to
the
internationale
this
idea
has
taken
such
root
that
it
is
given
as
the
explanation
to
visitors
from
other
parts
only
lately
councillor
kubrikov
a
man
of
sixtytwo
with
the
stanislav
order
on
his
breast
came
forward
uninvited
and
confessed
in
a
voice
full
of
feeling
that
he
had
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
been
for
fully
three
months
under
the
influence
of
the
internationale
when
with
every
deference
for
his
years
and
services
he
was
invited
to
be
more
definite
he
stuck
firmly
to
his
original
statement
though
he
could
produce
no
evidence
except
that
he
had
felt
it
in
all
his
feelings
so
that
they
crossexamined
him
no
further
i
repeat
again
there
was
still
even
among
us
a
small
group
who
held
themselves
aloof
from
the
beginning
and
even
locked
themselves
up
but
what
lock
can
stand
against
a
law
of
nature
daughters
will
grow
up
even
in
the
most
careful
families
and
it
is
essential
for
grownup
daughters
to
dance
and
so
all
these
people
too
ended
by
subscribing
to
the
governesses
fund
the
ball
was
assumed
to
be
an
entertainment
so
brilliant
so
unprecedented
marvels
were
told
about
it
there
were
rumours
of
princes
from
a
distance
with
lorgnettes
of
ten
stewards
all
young
dandies
with
rosettes
on
their
left
shoulder
of
some
petersburg
people
who
were
setting
the
thing
going
there
was
a
rumour
that
karmazinov
had
consented
to
increase
the
subscriptions
to
the
fund
by
reading
his
merci
in
the
costume
of
the
governesses
of
the
district
that
there
would
be
a
literary
quadrille
all
in
costume
and
every
costume
would
symbolise
some
special
line
of
thought
and
finally
that
honest
russian
thought
would
dance
in
costumewhich
would
certainly
be
a
complete
novelty
in
itself
who
could
resist
subscribing
every
one
subscribed
ii
the
programme
of
the
fte
was
divided
into
two
parts
the
literary
matine
from
midday
till
four
oclock
and
afterwards
a
ball
from
ten
oclock
onwards
through
the
night
but
in
this
very
programme
there
lay
concealed
germs
of
disorder
in
the
first
place
from
the
very
beginning
a
rumour
had
gained
ground
among
the
public
concerning
a
luncheon
immediately
after
the
literary
matine
or
even
while
it
was
going
on
during
an
interval
arranged
expressly
for
ita
free
luncheon
of
course
which
would
form
part
of
the
programme
and
be
accompanied
by
champagne
the
immense
price
of
the
tickets
three
roubles
tended
to
confirm
this
rumour
as
though
one
would
subscribe
for
nothing
the
fte
is
arranged
for
twentyfour
hours
so
food
must
be
provided
people
will
get
hungry
this
was
how
people
reasoned
in
the
town
i
must
admit
that
yulia
mihailovna
did
much
to
confirm
this
disastrous
rumour
by
her
own
heedlessness
a
month
earlier
under
the
first
spell
of
the
great
project
she
would
babble
about
it
to
anyone
she
met
and
even
sent
a
paragraph
to
one
of
the
petersburg
papers
about
the
toasts
and
speeches
arranged
for
her
fte
what
fascinated
her
most
at
that
time
was
the
idea
of
these
toasts
she
wanted
to
propose
them
herself
and
was
continually
composing
them
in
anticipation
they
were
to
make
clear
what
was
their
banner
what
was
it
i
dont
mind
betting
that
the
poor
dear
composed
nothing
after
all
they
were
to
get
into
the
petersburg
and
moscow
papers
to
touch
and
fascinate
the
higher
powers
and
then
to
spread
the
idea
over
all
the
provinces
of
russia
rousing
people
to
wonder
and
imitation
but
for
toasts
champagne
was
essential
and
as
champagne
cant
be
drunk
on
an
empty
stomach
it
followed
that
a
lunch
was
essential
too
afterwards
when
by
her
efforts
a
committee
had
been
formed
and
had
attacked
the
subject
more
seriously
it
was
proved
clearly
to
her
at
once
that
if
they
were
going
to
dream
of
banquets
there
would
be
very
little
left
for
the
governesses
however
well
people
subscribed
there
were
two
ways
out
of
the
difficulty
either
belshazzars
feast
with
toasts
and
speeches
and
ninety
roubles
for
the
governesses
or
a
considerable
sum
of
money
with
the
fte
only
as
a
matter
of
form
to
raise
it
the
committee
however
only
wanted
to
scare
her
and
had
of
course
worked
out
a
third
course
of
action
which
was
reasonable
and
combined
the
advantages
of
both
that
is
a
very
decent
fte
in
every
respect
only
without
champagne
and
so
yielding
a
very
respectable
sum
much
more
than
ninety
roubles
but
yulia
mihailovna
would
not
agree
to
it
her
proud
spirit
revolted
from
paltry
compromise
she
decided
at
once
that
if
the
original
idea
could
not
be
carried
out
they
should
rush
to
the
opposite
extreme
that
is
raise
an
enormous
subscription
that
would
be
the
envy
of
other
provinces
the
public
must
understand
she
said
at
the
end
of
her
flaming
speech
to
the
committee
that
the
attainment
of
an
object
of
universal
human
interest
is
infinitely
loftier
than
the
corporeal
enjoyments
of
the
passing
moment
that
the
fte
in
its
essence
is
only
the
proclamation
of
a
great
idea
and
so
we
ought
to
be
content
with
the
most
frugal
german
ball
simply
as
a
symbol
that
is
if
we
cant
dispense
with
this
detestable
ball
altogether
so
great
was
the
aversion
she
suddenly
conceived
for
it
but
she
was
pacified
at
last
it
was
then
that
the
literary
quadrille
and
the
other
sthetic
items
were
invented
and
proposed
as
substitutes
for
the
corporeal
enjoyments
it
was
then
that
karmazinov
finally
consented
to
read
merci
until
then
he
had
only
tantalised
them
by
his
hesitation
and
so
eradicate
the
very
idea
of
victuals
from
the
minds
of
our
incontinent
public
so
the
ball
was
once
more
to
be
a
magnificent
function
though
in
a
different
style
and
not
to
be
too
ethereal
it
was
decided
that
tea
with
lemon
and
round
biscuits
should
be
served
at
the
beginning
of
the
ball
and
later
on
orchade
and
lemonade
and
at
the
end
even
icesbut
nothing
else
for
those
who
always
and
everywhere
are
hungry
and
still
more
thirsty
they
might
open
a
buffet
in
the
farthest
of
the
suite
of
rooms
and
put
it
in
charge
of
prohorovitch
the
head
cook
of
the
club
who
would
subject
to
the
strict
supervision
of
the
committee
serve
whatever
was
wanted
at
a
fixed
charge
and
a
notice
should
be
put
up
on
the
door
of
the
hall
that
refreshments
were
extra
but
on
the
morning
they
decided
not
to
open
the
buffet
at
all
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
reading
though
the
buffet
would
have
been
five
rooms
off
the
white
hall
in
which
karmazinov
had
consented
to
read
merci
it
is
remarkable
that
the
committee
and
even
the
most
practical
people
in
it
attached
enormous
consequence
to
this
reading
as
for
people
of
poetical
tendencies
the
marshals
wife
for
instance
informed
karmazinov
that
after
the
reading
she
would
immediately
order
a
marble
slab
to
be
put
up
in
the
wall
of
the
white
hall
with
an
inscription
in
gold
letters
that
on
such
a
day
and
year
here
in
this
place
the
great
writer
of
russia
and
of
europe
had
read
merci
on
laying
aside
his
pen
and
so
had
for
the
first
time
taken
leave
of
the
russian
public
represented
by
the
leading
citizens
of
our
town
and
that
this
inscription
would
be
read
by
all
at
the
ball
that
is
only
five
hours
after
merci
had
been
read
i
know
for
a
fact
that
karmazinov
it
was
who
insisted
that
there
should
be
no
buffet
in
the
morning
on
any
account
while
he
was
reading
in
spite
of
some
protests
from
members
of
the
committee
that
this
was
rather
opposed
to
our
way
of
doing
things
this
was
the
position
of
affairs
while
in
the
town
people
were
still
reckoning
on
a
belshazzar
feast
that
is
on
refreshments
provided
by
the
committee
they
believed
in
this
to
the
last
hour
even
the
young
ladies
were
dreaming
of
masses
of
sweets
and
preserves
and
something
more
beyond
their
imagination
every
one
knew
that
the
subscriptions
had
reached
a
huge
sum
that
all
the
town
was
struggling
to
go
that
people
were
driving
in
from
the
surrounding
districts
and
that
there
were
not
tickets
enough
it
was
known
too
that
there
had
been
some
large
subscriptions
apart
from
the
price
paid
for
tickets
varvara
petrovna
for
instance
had
paid
three
hundred
roubles
for
her
ticket
and
had
given
almost
all
the
flowers
from
her
conservatory
to
decorate
the
room
the
marshals
wife
who
was
a
member
of
the
committee
provided
the
house
and
the
lighting
the
club
furnished
the
music
the
attendants
and
gave
up
prohorovitch
for
the
whole
day
there
were
other
contributions
as
well
though
lesser
ones
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
idea
was
mooted
of
cutting
down
the
price
of
tickets
from
three
roubles
to
two
indeed
the
committee
were
afraid
at
first
that
three
roubles
would
be
too
much
for
young
ladies
to
pay
and
suggested
that
they
might
have
family
tickets
so
that
every
family
should
pay
for
one
daughter
only
while
the
other
young
ladies
of
the
family
even
if
there
were
a
dozen
specimens
should
be
admitted
free
but
all
their
apprehensions
turned
out
to
be
groundless
it
was
just
the
young
ladies
who
did
come
even
the
poorest
clerks
brought
their
girls
and
it
was
quite
evident
that
if
they
had
had
no
girls
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
them
to
subscribe
for
tickets
one
insignificant
little
secretary
brought
all
his
seven
daughters
to
say
nothing
of
his
wife
and
a
niece
into
the
bargain
and
every
one
of
these
persons
held
in
her
hand
an
entrance
ticket
that
cost
three
roubles
it
may
be
imagined
what
an
upheaval
it
made
in
the
town
one
has
only
to
remember
that
as
the
fte
was
divided
into
two
parts
every
lady
needed
two
costumes
for
the
occasiona
morning
one
for
the
matine
and
a
ball
dress
for
the
evening
many
middleclass
people
as
it
appeared
afterwards
had
pawned
everything
they
had
for
that
day
even
the
family
linen
even
the
sheets
and
possibly
the
mattresses
to
the
jews
who
had
been
settling
in
our
town
in
great
numbers
during
the
previous
two
years
and
who
became
more
and
more
numerous
as
time
went
on
almost
all
the
officials
had
asked
for
their
salary
in
advance
and
some
of
the
landowners
sold
beasts
they
could
ill
spare
and
all
simply
to
bring
their
ladies
got
up
as
marchionesses
and
to
be
as
good
as
anybody
the
magnificence
of
dresses
on
this
occasion
was
something
unheard
of
in
our
neighbourhood
for
a
fortnight
beforehand
the
town
was
overflowing
with
funny
stories
which
were
all
brought
by
our
wits
to
yulia
mihailovnas
court
caricatures
were
passed
from
hand
to
hand
i
have
seen
some
drawings
of
the
sort
myself
in
yulia
mihailovnas
album
all
this
reached
the
ears
of
the
families
who
were
the
source
of
the
jokes
i
believe
this
was
the
cause
of
the
general
hatred
of
yulia
mihailovna
which
had
grown
so
strong
in
the
town
people
swear
and
gnash
their
teeth
when
they
think
of
it
now
but
it
was
evident
even
at
the
time
that
if
the
committee
were
to
displease
them
in
anything
or
if
anything
went
wrong
at
the
ball
the
outburst
of
indignation
would
be
something
surprising
thats
why
every
one
was
secretly
expecting
a
scandal
and
if
it
was
so
confidently
expected
how
could
it
fail
to
come
to
pass
the
orchestra
struck
up
punctually
at
midday
being
one
of
the
stewards
that
is
one
of
the
twelve
young
men
with
a
rosette
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
how
this
day
of
ignominious
memory
began
it
began
with
an
enormous
crush
at
the
doors
how
was
it
that
everything
including
the
police
went
wrong
that
day
i
dont
blame
the
genuine
public
the
fathers
of
families
did
not
crowd
nor
did
they
push
against
anyone
in
spite
of
their
position
on
the
contrary
i
am
told
that
they
were
disconcerted
even
in
the
street
at
the
sight
of
the
crowd
shoving
in
a
way
unheard
of
in
our
town
besieging
the
entry
and
taking
it
by
assault
instead
of
simply
going
in
meanwhile
the
carriages
kept
driving
up
and
at
last
blocked
the
street
now
at
the
time
i
write
i
have
good
grounds
for
affirming
that
some
of
the
lowest
rabble
of
our
town
were
brought
in
without
tickets
by
lyamshin
and
liputin
possibly
too
by
other
people
who
were
stewards
like
me
anyway
some
complete
strangers
who
had
come
from
the
surrounding
districts
and
elsewhere
were
present
as
soon
as
these
savages
entered
the
hall
they
began
asking
where
the
buffet
was
as
though
they
had
been
put
up
to
it
beforehand
and
learning
that
there
was
no
buffet
they
began
swearing
with
brutal
directness
and
an
unprecedented
insolence
some
of
them
it
is
true
were
drunk
when
they
came
some
of
them
were
dazed
like
savages
at
the
splendour
of
the
hall
as
they
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
and
subsided
for
a
minute
gazing
at
it
openmouthed
this
great
white
hall
really
was
magnificent
though
the
building
was
falling
into
decay
it
was
of
immense
size
with
two
rows
of
windows
with
an
oldfashioned
ceiling
covered
with
gilt
carving
with
a
gallery
with
mirrors
on
the
walls
red
and
white
draperies
marble
statues
nondescript
but
still
statues
with
heavy
old
furniture
of
the
napoleonic
period
white
and
gold
upholstered
in
red
velvet
at
the
moment
i
am
describing
a
high
platform
had
been
put
up
for
the
literary
gentlemen
who
were
to
read
and
the
whole
hall
was
filled
with
chairs
like
the
parterre
of
a
theatre
with
wide
aisles
for
the
audience
but
after
the
first
moments
of
surprise
the
most
senseless
questions
and
protests
followed
perhaps
we
dont
care
for
a
reading
weve
paid
our
money
the
audience
has
been
impudently
swindled
this
is
our
entertainment
not
the
lembkes
they
seemed
in
fact
to
have
been
let
in
for
this
purpose
i
remember
specially
an
encounter
in
which
the
princeling
with
the
standup
collar
and
the
face
of
a
dutch
doll
whom
i
had
met
the
morning
before
at
yulia
mihailovnas
distinguished
himself
he
had
at
her
urgent
request
consented
to
pin
a
rosette
on
his
left
shoulder
and
to
become
one
of
our
stewards
it
turned
out
that
this
dumb
wax
figure
could
act
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
if
he
could
not
talk
when
a
colossal
pockmarked
captain
supported
by
a
herd
of
rabble
following
at
his
heels
pestered
him
by
asking
which
way
to
the
buffet
he
made
a
sign
to
a
police
sergeant
his
hint
was
promptly
acted
upon
and
in
spite
of
the
drunken
captains
abuse
he
was
dragged
out
of
the
hall
meantime
the
genuine
public
began
to
make
its
appearance
and
stretched
in
three
long
files
between
the
chairs
the
disorderly
elements
began
to
subside
but
the
public
even
the
most
respectable
among
them
had
a
dissatisfied
and
perplexed
air
some
of
the
ladies
looked
positively
scared
at
last
all
were
seated
the
music
ceased
people
began
blowing
their
noses
and
looking
about
them
they
waited
with
too
solemn
an
airwhich
is
always
a
bad
sign
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
yet
of
the
lembkes
silks
velvets
diamonds
glowed
and
sparkled
on
every
side
whiffs
of
fragrance
filled
the
air
the
men
were
wearing
all
their
decorations
and
the
old
men
were
even
in
uniform
at
last
the
marshals
wife
came
in
with
liza
liza
had
never
been
so
dazzlingly
charming
or
so
splendidly
dressed
as
that
morning
her
hair
was
done
up
in
curls
her
eyes
sparkled
a
smile
beamed
on
her
face
she
made
an
unmistakable
sensation
people
scrutinised
her
and
whispered
about
her
they
said
that
she
was
looking
for
stavrogin
but
neither
stavrogin
nor
varvara
petrovna
were
there
at
the
time
i
did
not
understand
the
expression
of
her
face
why
was
there
so
much
happiness
such
joy
such
energy
and
strength
in
that
face
i
remembered
what
had
happened
the
day
before
and
could
not
make
it
out
but
still
the
lembkes
did
not
come
this
was
distinctly
a
blunder
i
learned
that
yulia
mihailovna
waited
till
the
last
minute
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
without
whom
she
could
not
stir
a
step
though
she
never
admitted
it
to
herself
i
must
mention
in
parenthesis
that
on
the
previous
day
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
committee
declined
to
wear
the
rosette
of
a
steward
which
had
disappointed
her
dreadfully
even
to
the
point
of
tears
to
her
surprise
and
later
on
her
extreme
discomfiture
to
anticipate
things
he
vanished
for
the
whole
morning
and
did
not
make
his
appearance
at
the
literary
matine
at
all
so
that
no
one
met
him
till
evening
at
last
the
audience
began
to
manifest
unmistakable
signs
of
impatience
no
one
appeared
on
the
platform
either
the
back
rows
began
applauding
as
in
a
theatre
the
elderly
gentlemen
and
the
ladies
frowned
the
lembkes
are
really
giving
themselves
unbearable
airs
even
among
the
better
part
of
the
audience
an
absurd
whisper
began
to
gain
ground
that
perhaps
there
would
not
be
a
fte
at
all
that
lembke
perhaps
was
really
unwell
and
so
on
and
so
on
but
thank
god
the
lembkes
at
last
appeared
she
was
leaning
on
his
arm
i
must
confess
i
was
in
great
apprehension
myself
about
their
appearance
but
the
legends
were
disproved
and
the
truth
was
triumphant
the
audience
seemed
relieved
lembke
himself
seemed
perfectly
well
every
one
i
remember
was
of
that
opinion
for
it
can
be
imagined
how
many
eyes
were
turned
on
him
i
may
mention
as
characteristic
of
our
society
that
there
were
very
few
of
the
betterclass
people
who
saw
reason
to
suppose
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
him
his
conduct
seemed
to
them
perfectly
normal
and
so
much
so
that
the
action
he
had
taken
in
the
square
the
morning
before
was
accepted
and
approved
thats
how
it
should
have
been
from
the
first
the
higher
officials
declared
if
a
man
begins
as
a
philanthropist
he
has
to
come
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
though
he
does
not
see
that
it
was
necessary
from
the
point
of
view
of
philanthropy
itselfthat
at
least
was
the
opinion
at
the
club
they
only
blamed
him
for
having
lost
his
temper
it
ought
to
have
been
done
more
coolly
but
there
he
is
a
new
man
said
the
authorities
all
eyes
turned
with
equal
eagerness
to
yulia
mihailovna
of
course
no
one
has
the
right
to
expect
from
me
an
exact
account
in
regard
to
one
point
that
is
a
mysterious
a
feminine
question
but
i
only
know
one
thing
on
the
evening
of
the
previous
day
she
had
gone
into
andrey
antonovitchs
study
and
was
there
with
him
till
long
after
midnight
andrey
antonovitch
was
comforted
and
forgiven
the
husband
and
wife
came
to
a
complete
understanding
everything
was
forgotten
and
when
at
the
end
of
the
interview
lembke
went
down
on
his
knees
recalling
with
horror
the
final
incident
of
the
previous
night
the
exquisite
hand
and
after
it
the
lips
of
his
wife
checked
the
fervent
flow
of
penitent
phrases
of
the
chivalrously
delicate
gentleman
who
was
limp
with
emotion
every
one
could
see
the
happiness
in
her
face
she
walked
in
with
an
openhearted
air
wearing
a
magnificent
dress
she
seemed
to
be
at
the
very
pinnacle
of
her
hearts
desires
the
ftethe
goal
and
crown
of
her
diplomacywas
an
accomplished
fact
as
they
walked
to
their
seats
in
front
of
the
platform
the
lembkes
bowed
in
all
directions
and
responded
to
greetings
they
were
at
once
surrounded
the
marshals
wife
got
up
to
meet
them
but
at
that
point
a
horrid
misunderstanding
occurred
the
orchestra
apropos
of
nothing
struck
up
a
flourish
not
a
triumphal
march
of
any
kind
but
a
simple
flourish
such
as
was
played
at
the
club
when
some
ones
health
was
drunk
at
an
official
dinner
i
know
now
that
lyamshin
in
his
capacity
of
steward
had
arranged
this
as
though
in
honour
of
the
lembkes
entrance
of
course
he
could
always
excuse
it
as
a
blunder
or
excessive
zeal
alas
i
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
they
no
longer
cared
even
to
find
excuses
and
that
all
such
considerations
were
from
that
day
a
thing
of
the
past
but
the
flourish
was
not
the
end
of
it
in
the
midst
of
the
vexatious
astonishment
and
the
smiles
of
the
audience
there
was
a
sudden
hurrah
from
the
end
of
the
hall
and
from
the
gallery
also
apparently
in
lembkes
honour
the
hurrahs
were
few
but
i
must
confess
they
lasted
for
some
time
yulia
mihailovna
flushed
her
eyes
flashed
lembke
stood
still
at
his
chair
and
turning
towards
the
voices
sternly
and
majestically
scanned
the
audience
they
hastened
to
make
him
sit
down
i
noticed
with
dismay
the
same
dangerous
smile
on
his
face
as
he
had
worn
the
morning
before
in
his
wifes
drawingroom
when
he
stared
at
stepan
trofimovitch
before
going
up
to
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
now
too
there
was
an
ominous
and
worst
of
all
a
rather
comic
expression
on
his
countenance
the
expression
of
a
man
resigned
to
sacrifice
himself
to
satisfy
his
wifes
lofty
aims
yulia
mihailovna
beckoned
to
me
hurriedly
and
whispered
to
me
to
run
to
karmazinov
and
entreat
him
to
begin
and
no
sooner
had
i
turned
away
than
another
disgraceful
incident
much
more
unpleasant
than
the
first
took
place
on
the
platform
the
empty
platform
on
which
till
that
moment
all
eyes
and
all
expectations
were
fastened
and
where
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
a
small
table
a
chair
in
front
of
it
and
on
the
table
a
glass
of
water
on
a
silver
salveron
the
empty
platform
there
suddenly
appeared
the
colossal
figure
of
captain
lebyadkin
wearing
a
dresscoat
and
a
white
tie
i
was
so
astounded
i
could
not
believe
my
eyes
the
captain
seemed
confused
and
remained
standing
at
the
back
of
the
platform
suddenly
there
was
a
shout
in
the
audience
lebyadkin
you
the
captains
stupid
red
face
he
was
hopelessly
drunk
expanded
in
a
broad
vacant
grin
at
this
greeting
he
raised
his
hand
rubbed
his
forehead
with
it
shook
his
shaggy
head
and
as
though
making
up
his
mind
to
go
through
with
it
took
two
steps
forward
and
suddenly
went
off
into
a
series
of
prolonged
blissful
gurgling
but
not
loud
guffaws
which
made
him
screw
up
his
eyes
and
set
all
his
bulky
person
heaving
this
spectacle
set
almost
half
the
audience
laughing
twenty
people
applauded
the
serious
part
of
the
audience
looked
at
one
another
gloomily
it
all
lasted
only
half
a
minute
however
liputin
wearing
his
stewards
rosette
ran
on
to
the
platform
with
two
servants
they
carefully
took
the
captain
by
both
arms
while
liputin
whispered
something
to
him
the
captain
scowled
muttered
ah
well
if
thats
it
waved
his
hand
turned
his
huge
back
to
the
public
and
vanished
with
his
escort
but
a
minute
later
liputin
skipped
on
to
the
platform
again
he
was
wearing
the
sweetest
of
his
invariable
smiles
which
usually
suggested
vinegar
and
sugar
and
carried
in
his
hands
a
sheet
of
notepaper
with
tiny
but
rapid
steps
he
came
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
the
public
through
our
inadvertency
there
has
arisen
a
comical
misunderstanding
which
has
been
removed
but
ive
hopefully
undertaken
to
do
something
at
the
earnest
and
most
respectful
request
of
one
of
our
local
poets
deeply
touched
by
the
humane
and
lofty
object
in
spite
of
his
appearance
the
object
which
has
brought
us
all
together
to
wipe
away
the
tears
of
the
poor
but
welleducated
girls
of
our
province
this
gentleman
i
mean
this
local
poet
although
desirous
of
preserving
his
incognito
would
gladly
have
heard
his
poem
read
at
the
beginning
of
the
ball
that
is
i
mean
of
the
matine
though
this
poem
is
not
in
the
programme
for
it
has
only
been
received
half
an
hour
ago
yet
it
has
seemed
to
usus
whom
did
he
mean
by
us
i
report
his
confused
and
incoherent
speech
word
for
wordthat
through
its
remarkable
navet
of
feeling
together
with
its
equally
remarkable
gaiety
the
poem
might
well
be
read
that
is
not
as
something
serious
but
as
something
appropriate
to
the
occasion
that
is
to
the
idea
especially
as
some
lines
and
i
wanted
to
ask
the
kind
permission
of
the
audience
read
it
boomed
a
voice
at
the
back
of
the
hall
then
i
am
to
read
it
read
it
read
it
cried
many
voices
with
the
permission
of
the
audience
i
will
read
it
liputin
minced
again
still
with
the
same
sugary
smile
he
still
seemed
to
hesitate
and
i
even
thought
that
he
was
rather
excited
these
people
are
sometimes
nervous
in
spite
of
their
impudence
a
divinity
student
would
have
carried
it
through
without
winking
but
liputin
did
after
all
belong
to
the
last
generation
i
must
say
that
is
i
have
the
honour
to
say
by
way
of
preface
that
it
is
not
precisely
an
ode
such
as
used
to
be
written
for
ftes
but
is
rather
so
to
say
a
jest
but
full
of
undoubted
feeling
together
with
playful
humour
and
so
to
say
the
most
realistic
truthfulness
read
it
read
it
he
unfolded
the
paper
no
one
of
course
was
in
time
to
stop
him
besides
he
was
wearing
his
stewards
badge
in
a
ringing
voice
he
declaimed
to
the
local
governesses
of
the
fatherland
from
the
poet
at
the
fte
governesses
all
good
morrow
triumph
on
this
festive
day

just

away
but
thats
lebyadkins
lebyadkins
cried
several
voices
there
was
laughter
and
even
applause
though
not
from
very
many
teaching
french
to
wetnosed
children
you
are
glad
enough
to
think
you
can
catch
a
wornout
sexton
even
he
is
worth
a
wink
hurrah
hurrah
but
in
these
great
days
of
progress
ladies
to
your
sorrow
know
you
cant
even
catch
a
sexton
if
you
have
not
got
a
dot
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
thats
realism
you
cant
hook
a
husband
without
a
dot
but
henceforth
since
through
our
feasting
capital
has
flowed
from
all
and
we
send
you
forth
to
conquest
dancing
dowried
from
this
hall
retrograde
or
vowed
georgesander
never
mind
rejoice
you
may
youre
a
governess
with
a
dowry
spit
on
all
and
frisk
away
i
must
confess
i
could
not
believe
my
ears
the
insolence
of
it
was
so
unmistakable
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
excusing
liputin
on
the
ground
of
stupidity
besides
liputin
was
by
no
means
stupid
the
intention
was
obvious
to
me
anyway
they
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
create
disorder
some
lines
in
these
idiotic
verses
for
instance
the
last
were
such
that
no
stupidity
could
have
let
them
pass
liputin
himself
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
undertaken
too
much
when
he
had
achieved
his
exploit
he
was
so
overcome
by
his
own
impudence
that
he
did
not
even
leave
the
platform
but
remained
standing
as
though
there
were
something
more
he
wanted
to
say
he
had
probably
imagined
that
it
would
somehow
produce
a
different
effect
but
even
the
group
of
ruffians
who
had
applauded
during
the
reading
suddenly
sank
into
silence
as
though
they
too
were
overcome
what
was
silliest
of
all
many
of
them
took
the
whole
episode
seriously
that
is
did
not
regard
the
verses
as
a
lampoon
but
actually
thought
it
realistic
and
true
as
regards
the
governessesa
poem
with
a
tendency
in
fact
but
the
excessive
freedom
of
the
verses
struck
even
them
at
last
as
for
the
general
public
they
were
not
only
scandalised
but
obviously
offended
i
am
sure
i
am
not
mistaken
as
to
the
impression
yulia
mihailovna
said
afterwards
that
in
another
moment
she
would
have
fallen
into
a
swoon
one
of
the
most
respectable
old
gentlemen
helped
his
old
wife
on
to
her
feet
and
they
walked
out
of
the
hall
accompanied
by
the
agitated
glances
of
the
audience
who
knows
the
example
might
have
infected
others
if
karmazinov
himself
wearing
a
dresscoat
and
a
white
tie
and
carrying
a
manuscript
in
his
hand
had
not
appeared
on
the
platform
at
that
moment
yulia
mihailovna
turned
an
ecstatic
gaze
at
him
as
on
her
deliverer
but
i
was
by
that
time
behind
the
scenes
i
was
in
quest
of
liputin
you
did
that
on
purpose
i
said
seizing
him
indignantly
by
the
arm
i
assure
you
i
never
thought
he
began
cringing
and
lying
at
once
pretending
to
be
unhappy
the
verses
had
only
just
been
brought
and
i
thought
that
as
an
amusing
pleasantry
you
did
not
think
anything
of
the
sort
you
cant
really
think
that
stupid
rubbish
an
amusing
pleasantry
yes
i
do
you
are
simply
lying
and
it
wasnt
brought
to
you
just
now
you
helped
lebyadkin
to
compose
it
yourself
yesterday
very
likely
to
create
a
scandal
the
last
verse
must
have
been
yours
the
part
about
the
sexton
too
why
did
he
come
on
in
a
dresscoat
you
must
have
meant
him
to
read
it
too
if
he
had
not
been
drunk
liputin
looked
at
me
coldly
and
ironically
what
business
is
it
of
yours
he
asked
suddenly
with
strange
calm
what
business
is
it
of
mine
you
are
wearing
the
stewards
badge
too
where
is
pyotr
stepanovitch
i
dont
know
somewhere
here
why
do
you
ask
because
now
i
see
through
it
its
simply
a
plot
against
yulia
mihailovna
so
as
to
ruin
the
day
by
a
scandal
liputin
looked
at
me
askance
again
but
what
is
it
to
you
he
said
grinning
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
away
it
came
over
me
with
a
rush
all
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
till
then
i
had
been
hoping
i
was
mistaken
what
was
i
to
do
i
was
on
the
point
of
asking
the
advice
of
stepan
trofimovitch
but
he
was
standing
before
the
lookingglass
trying
on
different
smiles
and
continually
consulting
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
he
had
notes
he
had
to
go
on
immediately
after
karmazinov
and
was
not
in
a
fit
state
for
conversation
should
i
run
to
yulia
mihailovna
but
it
was
too
soon
to
go
to
her
she
needed
a
much
sterner
lesson
to
cure
her
of
her
conviction
that
she
had
a
following
and
that
every
one
was
fanatically
devoted
to
her
she
would
not
have
believed
me
and
would
have
thought
i
was
dreaming
besides
what
help
could
she
be
eh
i
thought
after
all
what
business
is
it
of
mine
ill
take
off
my
badge
and
go
home
when
it
begins
that
was
my
mental
phrase
when
it
begins
i
remember
it
but
i
had
to
go
and
listen
to
karmazinov
taking
a
last
look
round
behind
the
scenes
i
noticed
that
a
good
number
of
outsiders
even
women
among
them
were
flitting
about
going
in
and
out
behind
the
scenes
was
rather
a
narrow
space
completely
screened
from
the
audience
by
a
curtain
and
communicating
with
other
rooms
by
means
of
a
passage
here
our
readers
were
awaiting
their
turns
but
i
was
struck
at
that
moment
by
the
reader
who
was
to
follow
stepan
trofimovitch
he
too
was
some
sort
of
professor
i
dont
know
to
this
day
exactly
what
he
was
who
had
voluntarily
left
some
educational
institution
after
a
disturbance
among
the
students
and
had
arrived
in
the
town
only
a
few
days
before
he
too
had
been
recommended
to
yulia
mihailovna
and
she
had
received
him
with
reverence
i
know
now
that
he
had
only
spent
one
evening
in
her
company
before
the
reading
he
had
not
spoken
all
that
evening
had
listened
with
an
equivocal
smile
to
the
jests
and
the
general
tone
of
the
company
surrounding
yulia
mihailovna
and
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
on
every
one
by
his
air
of
haughtiness
and
at
the
same
time
almost
timorous
readiness
to
take
offence
it
was
yulia
mihailovna
herself
who
had
enlisted
his
services
now
he
was
walking
from
corner
to
corner
and
like
stepan
trofimovitch
was
muttering
to
himself
though
he
looked
on
the
ground
instead
of
in
the
lookingglass
he
was
not
trying
on
smiles
though
he
often
smiled
rapaciously
it
was
obvious
that
it
was
useless
to
speak
to
him
either
he
looked
about
forty
was
short
and
bald
had
a
greyish
beard
and
was
decently
dressed
but
what
was
most
interesting
about
him
was
that
at
every
turn
he
took
he
threw
up
his
right
fist
brandished
it
above
his
head
and
suddenly
brought
it
down
again
as
though
crushing
an
antagonist
to
atoms
he
went
through
this
byplay
every
moment
it
made
me
uncomfortable
i
hastened
away
to
listen
to
karmazinov
iii
there
was
a
feeling
in
the
hall
that
something
was
wrong
again
let
me
state
to
begin
with
that
i
have
the
deepest
reverence
for
genius
but
why
do
our
geniuses
in
the
decline
of
their
illustrious
years
behave
sometimes
exactly
like
little
boys
what
though
he
was
karmazinov
and
came
forward
with
as
much
dignity
as
five
kammerherrs
rolled
into
one
how
could
he
expect
to
keep
an
audience
like
ours
listening
for
a
whole
hour
to
a
single
paper
i
have
observed
in
fact
that
however
big
a
genius
a
man
may
be
he
cant
monopolise
the
attention
of
an
audience
at
a
frivolous
literary
matine
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
with
impunity
the
entrance
of
the
great
writer
was
received
indeed
with
the
utmost
respect
even
the
severest
elderly
men
showed
signs
of
approval
and
interest
and
the
ladies
even
displayed
some
enthusiasm
the
applause
was
brief
however
and
somehow
uncertain
and
not
unanimous
yet
there
was
no
unseemly
behaviour
in
the
back
rows
till
karmazinov
began
to
speak
not
that
anything
very
bad
followed
then
but
only
a
sort
of
misunderstanding
i
have
mentioned
already
that
he
had
rather
a
shrill
voice
almost
feminine
in
fact
and
at
the
same
time
a
genuinely
aristocratic
lisp
he
had
hardly
articulated
a
few
words
when
someone
had
the
effrontery
to
laugh
aloudprobably
some
ignorant
simpleton
who
knew
nothing
of
the
world
and
was
congenitally
disposed
to
laughter
but
there
was
nothing
like
a
hostile
demonstration
on
the
contrary
people
said
shh
and
the
offender
was
crushed
but
mr
karmazinov
with
an
affected
air
and
intonation
announced
that
at
first
he
had
declined
absolutely
to
read
much
need
there
was
to
mention
it
there
are
some
lines
which
come
so
deeply
from
the
heart
that
it
is
impossible
to
utter
them
aloud
so
that
these
holy
things
cannot
be
laid
before
the
publicwhy
lay
them
thenbut
as
he
had
been
begged
to
do
so
he
was
doing
so
and
as
he
was
moreover
laying
down
his
pen
forever
and
had
sworn
to
write
no
more
he
had
written
this
last
farewell
and
as
he
had
sworn
never
on
any
inducement
to
read
anything
in
public
and
so
on
and
so
on
all
in
that
style
but
all
that
would
not
have
mattered
every
one
knows
what
authors
prefaces
are
like
though
i
may
observe
that
considering
the
lack
of
culture
of
our
audience
and
the
irritability
of
the
back
rows
all
this
may
have
had
an
influence
surely
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
read
a
little
story
a
short
tale
such
as
he
had
written
in
the
pastoverelaborate
that
is
and
affected
but
sometimes
witty
it
would
have
saved
the
situation
no
this
was
quite
another
story
it
was
a
regular
oration
good
heavens
what
wasnt
there
in
it
i
am
positive
that
it
would
have
reduced
to
rigidity
even
a
petersburg
audience
let
alone
ours
imagine
an
article
that
would
have
filled
some
thirty
pages
of
print
of
the
most
affected
aimless
prattle
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
gentleman
read
it
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
condescension
as
though
it
were
a
favour
so
that
it
was
almost
insulting
to
the
audience
the
subject
who
could
make
it
out
it
was
a
sort
of
description
of
certain
impressions
and
reminiscences
but
of
what
and
about
what
though
the
leading
intellects
of
the
province
did
their
utmost
during
the
first
half
of
the
reading
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
they
listened
to
the
second
part
simply
out
of
politeness
a
great
deal
was
said
about
love
indeed
of
the
love
of
the
genius
for
some
person
but
i
must
admit
it
made
rather
an
awkward
impression
for
the
great
writer
to
tell
us
about
his
first
kiss
seemed
to
my
mind
a
little
incongruous
with
his
short
and
fat
little
figure
another
thing
that
was
offensive
these
kisses
did
not
occur
as
they
do
with
the
rest
of
mankind
there
had
to
be
a
framework
of
gorse
it
had
to
be
gorse
or
some
such
plant
that
one
must
look
up
in
a
flora
and
there
had
to
be
a
tint
of
purple
in
the
sky
such
as
no
mortal
had
ever
observed
before
or
if
some
people
had
seen
it
they
had
never
noticed
it
but
he
seemed
to
say
i
have
seen
it
and
am
describing
it
to
you
fools
as
if
it
were
a
most
ordinary
thing
the
tree
under
which
the
interesting
couple
sat
had
of
course
to
be
of
an
orange
colour
they
were
sitting
somewhere
in
germany
suddenly
they
see
pompey
or
cassius
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
and
both
are
penetrated
by
a
thrill
of
ecstasy
some
woodnymph
squeaked
in
the
bushes
gluck
played
the
violin
among
the
reeds
the
title
of
the
piece
he
was
playing
was
given
in
full
but
no
one
knew
it
so
that
one
would
have
had
to
look
it
up
in
a
musical
dictionary
meanwhile
a
fog
came
on
such
a
fog
such
a
fog
that
it
was
more
like
a
million
pillows
than
a
fog
and
suddenly
everything
disappears
and
the
great
genius
is
crossing
the
frozen
volga
in
a
thaw
two
and
a
half
pages
are
filled
with
the
crossing
and
yet
he
falls
through
the
ice
the
genius
is
drowningyou
imagine
he
was
drowned
not
a
bit
of
it
this
was
simply
in
order
that
when
he
was
drowning
and
at
his
last
gasp
he
might
catch
sight
of
a
bit
of
ice
the
size
of
a
pea
but
pure
and
crystal
as
a
frozen
tear
and
in
that
tear
was
reflected
germany
or
more
accurately
the
sky
of
germany
and
its
iridescent
sparkle
recalled
to
his
mind
the
very
tear
which
dost
thou
remember
fell
from
thine
eyes
when
we
were
sitting
under
that
emerald
tree
and
thou
didst
cry
out
joyfully
there
is
no
crime
no
i
said
through
my
tears
but
if
that
is
so
there
are
no
righteous
either
we
sobbed
and
parted
forever
she
went
off
somewhere
to
the
sea
coast
while
he
went
to
visit
some
caves
and
then
he
descends
and
descends
and
descends
for
three
years
under
suharev
tower
in
moscow
and
suddenly
in
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
he
finds
in
a
cave
a
lamp
and
before
the
lamp
a
hermit
the
hermit
is
praying
the
genius
leans
against
a
little
barred
window
and
suddenly
hears
a
sigh
do
you
suppose
it
was
the
hermit
sighing
much
he
cares
about
the
hermit
not
a
bit
of
it
this
sigh
simply
reminds
him
of
her
first
sigh
thirtyseven
years
before
in
germany
when
dost
thou
remember
we
sat
under
an
agate
tree
and
thou
didst
say
to
me
why
love
see
ochra
is
growing
all
around
and
i
love
thee
but
the
ochra
will
cease
to
grow
and
i
shall
cease
to
love
then
the
fog
comes
on
again
hoffman
appears
on
the
scene
the
woodnymph
whistles
a
tune
from
chopin
and
suddenly
out
of
the
fog
appears
ancus
marcius
over
the
roofs
of
rome
wearing
a
laurel
wreath
a
chill
of
ecstasy
ran
down
our
backs
and
we
parted
foreverand
so
on
and
so
on
perhaps
i
am
not
reporting
it
quite
right
and
dont
know
how
to
report
it
but
the
drift
of
the
babble
was
something
of
that
sort
and
after
all
how
disgraceful
this
passion
of
our
great
intellects
for
jesting
in
a
superior
way
really
is
the
great
european
philosopher
the
great
man
of
science
the
inventor
the
martyrall
these
who
labour
and
are
heavy
laden
are
to
the
great
russian
genius
no
more
than
so
many
cooks
in
his
kitchen
he
is
the
master
and
they
come
to
him
cap
in
hand
awaiting
orders
it
is
true
he
jeers
superciliously
at
russia
too
and
there
is
nothing
he
likes
better
than
exhibiting
the
bankruptcy
of
russia
in
every
relation
before
the
great
minds
of
europe
but
as
regards
himself
no
he
is
at
a
higher
level
than
all
the
great
minds
of
europe
they
are
only
material
for
his
jests
he
takes
another
mans
idea
tacks
on
to
it
its
antithesis
and
the
epigram
is
made
there
is
such
a
thing
as
crime
there
is
no
such
thing
as
crime
there
is
no
such
thing
as
justice
there
are
no
just
men
atheism
darwinism
the
moscow
bells
but
alas
he
no
longer
believes
in
the
moscow
bells
rome
laurels
but
he
has
no
belief
in
laurels
even
we
have
a
conventional
attack
of
byronic
spleen
a
grimace
from
heine
something
of
petchorinand
the
machine
goes
on
rolling
whistling
at
full
speed
but
you
may
praise
me
you
may
praise
me
that
i
like
extremely
its
only
in
a
manner
of
speaking
that
i
lay
down
the
pen
i
shall
bore
you
three
hundred
times
more
youll
grow
weary
of
reading
me
of
course
it
did
not
end
without
trouble
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
it
was
his
own
doing
people
had
for
some
time
begun
shuffling
their
feet
blowing
their
noses
coughing
and
doing
everything
that
people
do
when
a
lecturer
whoever
he
may
be
keeps
an
audience
for
longer
than
twenty
minutes
at
a
literary
matine
but
the
genius
noticed
nothing
of
all
this
he
went
on
lisping
and
mumbling
without
giving
a
thought
to
the
audience
so
that
every
one
began
to
wonder
suddenly
in
a
back
row
a
solitary
but
loud
voice
was
heard
good
lord
what
nonsense
the
exclamation
escaped
involuntarily
and
i
am
sure
was
not
intended
as
a
demonstration
the
man
was
simply
worn
out
but
mr
karmazinov
stopped
looked
sarcastically
at
the
audience
and
suddenly
lisped
with
the
deportment
of
an
aggrieved
kammerherr
im
afraid
ive
been
boring
you
dreadfully
gentlemen
that
was
his
blunder
that
he
was
the
first
to
speak
for
provoking
an
answer
in
this
way
he
gave
an
opening
for
the
rabble
to
speak
too
and
even
legitimately
so
to
say
while
if
he
had
restrained
himself
people
would
have
gone
on
blowing
their
noses
and
it
would
have
passed
off
somehow
perhaps
he
expected
applause
in
response
to
his
question
but
there
was
no
sound
of
applause
on
the
contrary
every
one
seemed
to
subside
and
shrink
back
in
dismay
you
never
did
see
ancus
marcius
thats
all
brag
cried
a
voice
that
sounded
full
of
irritation
and
even
nervous
exhaustion
just
so
another
voice
agreed
at
once
there
are
no
such
things
as
ghosts
nowadays
nothing
but
natural
science
look
it
up
in
a
scientific
book
gentlemen
there
was
nothing
i
expected
less
than
such
objections
said
karmazinov
extremely
surprised
the
great
genius
had
completely
lost
touch
with
his
fatherland
in
karlsruhe
nowadays
its
outrageous
to
say
that
the
world
stands
on
three
fishes
a
young
lady
snapped
out
suddenly
you
cant
have
gone
down
to
the
hermits
cave
karmazinov
and
who
talks
about
hermits
nowadays
gentlemen
what
surprises
me
most
of
all
is
that
you
take
it
all
so
seriously
however
however
you
are
perfectly
right
no
one
has
greater
respect
for
truth
and
realism
than
i
have
though
he
smiled
ironically
he
was
tremendously
overcome
his
face
seemed
to
express
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
you
think
i
am
on
your
side
only
praise
me
praise
me
more
as
much
as
possible
i
like
it
extremely
gentlemen
he
cried
completely
mortified
at
last
i
see
that
my
poor
poem
is
quite
out
of
place
here
and
indeed
i
am
out
of
place
here
myself
i
think
you
threw
at
the
crow
and
you
hit
the
cow
some
fool
probably
drunk
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
of
course
no
notice
ought
to
have
been
taken
of
him
it
is
true
there
was
a
sound
of
disrespectful
laughter
a
cow
you
say
karmazinov
caught
it
up
at
once
his
voice
grew
shriller
and
shriller
as
for
crows
and
cows
gentlemen
i
will
refrain
ive
too
much
respect
for
any
audience
to
permit
myself
comparisons
however
harmless
but
i
did
think
youd
better
be
careful
sir
someone
shouted
from
a
back
row
but
i
had
supposed
that
laying
aside
my
pen
and
saying
farewell
to
my
readers
i
should
be
heard
no
no
we
want
to
hear
you
we
want
to
a
few
voices
from
the
front
row
plucked
up
spirit
to
exclaim
at
last
read
read
several
enthusiastic
ladies
voices
chimed
in
and
at
last
there
was
an
outburst
of
applause
sparse
and
feeble
it
is
true
believe
me
karmazinov
every
one
looks
on
it
as
an
honour
the
marshals
wife
herself
could
not
resist
saying
mr
karmazinov
cried
a
fresh
young
voice
in
the
back
of
the
hall
suddenly
it
was
the
voice
of
a
very
young
teacher
from
the
district
school
who
had
only
lately
come
among
us
an
excellent
young
man
quiet
and
gentlemanly
he
stood
up
in
his
place
mr
karmazinov
if
i
had
the
happiness
to
fall
in
love
as
you
have
described
to
us
i
really
shouldnt
refer
to
my
love
in
an
article
intended
for
public
reading
he
flushed
red
all
over
ladies
and
gentlemen
cried
karmazinov
i
have
finished
i
will
omit
the
end
and
withdraw
only
allow
me
to
read
the
six
last
lines
yes
dear
reader
farewell
he
began
at
once
from
the
manuscript
without
sitting
down
again
in
his
chair
farewell
reader
i
do
not
greatly
insist
on
our
parting
friends
what
need
to
trouble
you
indeed
you
may
abuse
me
abuse
me
as
you
will
if
it
affords
you
any
satisfaction
but
best
of
all
if
we
forget
one
another
forever
and
if
you
all
readers
were
suddenly
so
kind
as
to
fall
on
your
knees
and
begin
begging
me
with
tears
write
oh
write
for
us
karmazinovfor
the
sake
of
russia
for
the
sake
of
posterity
to
win
laurels
even
then
i
would
answer
you
thanking
you
of
course
with
every
courtesy
no
weve
had
enough
of
one
another
dear
fellowcountrymen
merci
its
time
we
took
our
separate
ways
merci
merci
merci
karmazinov
bowed
ceremoniously
and
as
red
as
though
he
had
been
cooked
retired
behind
the
scenes
nobody
would
go
down
on
their
knees
a
wild
idea
what
conceit
thats
only
humour
someone
more
reasonable
suggested
spare
me
your
humour
i
call
it
impudence
gentlemen
well
hes
finished
now
anyway
ech
what
a
dull
show
but
all
these
ignorant
exclamations
in
the
back
rows
though
they
were
confined
to
the
back
rows
were
drowned
in
applause
from
the
other
half
of
the
audience
they
called
for
karmazinov
several
ladies
with
yulia
mihailovna
and
the
marshals
wife
crowded
round
the
platform
in
yulia
mihailovnas
hands
was
a
gorgeous
laurel
wreath
resting
on
another
wreath
of
living
roses
on
a
white
velvet
cushion
laurels
karmazinov
pronounced
with
a
subtle
and
rather
sarcastic
smile
i
am
touched
of
course
and
accept
with
real
emotion
this
wreath
prepared
beforehand
but
still
fresh
and
unwithered
but
i
assure
you
mesdames
that
i
have
suddenly
become
so
realistic
that
i
feel
laurels
would
in
this
age
be
far
more
appropriate
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
cook
than
in
mine
well
a
cook
is
more
useful
cried
the
divinity
student
who
had
been
at
the
meeting
at
virginskys
there
was
some
disorder
in
many
rows
people
jumped
up
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
presentation
of
the
laurel
wreath
id
give
another
three
roubles
for
a
cook
this
minute
another
voice
assented
loudly
too
loudly
insistently
in
fact
so
would
i
and
i
is
it
possible
theres
no
buffet
gentlemen
its
simply
a
swindle
it
must
be
admitted
however
that
all
these
unbridled
gentlemen
still
stood
in
awe
of
our
higher
officials
and
of
the
police
superintendent
who
was
present
in
the
hall
ten
minutes
later
all
had
somehow
got
back
into
their
places
but
there
was
not
the
same
good
order
as
before
and
it
was
into
this
incipient
chaos
that
poor
stepan
trofimovitch
was
thrust
iv
i
ran
out
to
him
behind
the
scenes
once
more
and
had
time
to
warn
him
excitedly
that
in
my
opinion
the
game
was
up
that
he
had
better
not
appear
at
all
but
had
better
go
home
at
once
on
the
excuse
of
his
usual
ailment
for
instance
and
i
would
take
off
my
badge
and
come
with
him
at
that
instant
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
platform
he
stopped
suddenly
and
haughtily
looking
me
up
and
down
he
pronounced
solemnly
what
grounds
have
you
sir
for
thinking
me
capable
of
such
baseness
i
drew
back
i
was
as
sure
as
twice
two
make
four
that
he
would
not
get
off
without
a
catastrophe
meanwhile
as
i
stood
utterly
dejected
i
saw
moving
before
me
again
the
figure
of
the
professor
whose
turn
it
was
to
appear
after
stepan
trofimovitch
and
who
kept
lifting
up
his
fist
and
bringing
it
down
again
with
a
swing
he
kept
walking
up
and
down
absorbed
in
himself
and
muttering
something
to
himself
with
a
diabolical
but
triumphant
smile
i
somehow
almost
unintentionally
went
up
to
him
i
dont
know
what
induced
me
to
meddle
again
do
you
know
i
said
judging
from
many
examples
if
a
lecturer
keeps
an
audience
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
it
wont
go
on
listening
no
celebrity
is
able
to
hold
his
own
for
half
an
hour
he
stopped
short
and
seemed
almost
quivering
with
resentment
infinite
disdain
was
expressed
in
his
countenance
dont
trouble
yourself
he
muttered
contemptuously
and
walked
on
at
that
moment
stepan
trofimovitchs
voice
rang
out
in
the
hall
oh
hang
you
all
i
thought
and
ran
to
the
hall
stepan
trofimovitch
took
his
seat
in
the
lecturers
chair
in
the
midst
of
the
still
persisting
disorder
he
was
greeted
by
the
first
rows
with
looks
which
were
evidently
not
overfriendly
of
late
at
the
club
people
almost
seemed
not
to
like
him
and
treated
him
with
much
less
respect
than
formerly
but
it
was
something
to
the
good
that
he
was
not
hissed
i
had
had
a
strange
idea
in
my
head
ever
since
the
previous
day
i
kept
fancying
that
he
would
be
received
with
hisses
as
soon
as
he
appeared
they
scarcely
noticed
him
however
in
the
disorder
what
could
that
man
hope
for
if
karmazinov
was
treated
like
this
he
was
pale
it
was
ten
years
since
he
had
appeared
before
an
audience
from
his
excitement
and
from
all
that
i
knew
so
well
in
him
it
was
clear
to
me
that
he
too
regarded
his
present
appearance
on
the
platform
as
a
turningpoint
of
his
fate
or
something
of
the
kind
that
was
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
the
man
was
dear
to
me
and
what
were
my
feelings
when
he
opened
his
lips
and
i
heard
his
first
phrase
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
pronounced
suddenly
as
though
resolved
to
venture
everything
though
in
an
almost
breaking
voice
ladies
and
gentlemen
only
this
morning
there
lay
before
me
one
of
the
illegal
leaflets
that
have
been
distributed
here
lately
and
i
asked
myself
for
the
hundredth
time
wherein
lies
its
secret
the
whole
hall
became
instantly
still
all
looks
were
turned
to
him
some
with
positive
alarm
there
was
no
denying
he
knew
how
to
secure
their
interest
from
the
first
word
heads
were
thrust
out
from
behind
the
scenes

lyamshin
listened
greedily
yulia
mihailovna
waved
to
me
again
stop
him
whatever
happens
stop
him
she
whispered
in
agitation
i
could
only
shrug
my
shoulders
how
could
one
stop
a
man
resolved
to
venture
everything
alas
i
understood
what
was
in
stepan
trofimovitchs
mind
ha
ha
the
manifestoes
was
whispered
in
the
audience
the
whole
hall
was
stirred
ladies
and
gentlemen
ive
solved
the
whole
mystery
the
whole
secret
of
their
effect
lies
in
their
stupidity
his
eyes
flashed
yes
gentlemen
if
this
stupidity
were
intentional
pretended
and
calculated
oh
that
would
be
a
stroke
of
genius
but
we
must
do
them
justice
they
dont
pretend
anything
its
the
barest
most
simplehearted
most
shallow
stupidity

if
it
were
expressed
ever
so
little
more
cleverly
every
one
would
see
at
once
the
poverty
of
this
shallow
stupidity
but
as
it
is
every
one
is
left
wondering
no
one
can
believe
that
it
is
such
elementary
stupidity
its
impossible
that
theres
nothing
more
in
it
every
one
says
to
himself
and
tries
to
find
the
secret
of
it
sees
a
mystery
in
it

to
read
between

is
attained
oh
never
has
stupidity
been
so
solemnly
rewarded
though
it
has
so
often
deserved

epigram
of
1840
was
commented
in
a
very
modest
voice
however
but
it
was
followed
by
a
general
outbreak
of
noise
and
uproar
ladies
and
gentlemen
hurrah
i
propose
a
toast
to
stupidity
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
defying
the
audience
in
a
perfect
frenzy
i
ran
up
on
the
pretext
of
pouring
out
some
water
for
him

off
yulia
mihailovna
entreats
you
to
no
you
leave
me
alone
idle
young
man
he
cried
out
at
me
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
ran
away
messieurs
he
went
on
why
this
excitement
why
the
outcries
of
indignation
i
hear
i
have
come
forward
with
an
olive
branch
i
bring
you
the
last
word
for
in
this
business
i
have
the
last
wordand
we
shall
be
reconciled
down
with
him
shouted
some
hush
let
him
speak
let
him
have
his
say
yelled
another
section
the
young
teacher
was
particularly
excited
having
once
brought
himself
to
speak
he
seemed
now
unable
to
be
silent
messieurs
the
last
word
in
this
businessis
forgiveness
i
an
old
man
at
the
end
of
my
life
i
solemnly
declare
that
the
spirit
of
life
breathes
in
us
still
and
there
is
still
a
living
strength
in
the
young
generation
the
enthusiasm
of
the
youth
of
today
is
as
pure
and
bright
as
in
our
age
all
that
has
happened
is
a
change
of
aim
the
replacing
of
one
beauty
by
another
the
whole
difficulty
lies
in
the
question
which
is
more
beautiful
shakespeare
or
boots
raphael
or
petroleum
its
treachery
growled
some
compromising
questions
agent
provocateur
but
i
maintain
stepan
trofimovitch
shrilled
at
the
utmost
pitch
of
excitement
i
maintain
that
shakespeare
and
raphael
are
more
precious
than
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
more
precious
than
nationalism
more
precious
than
socialism
more
precious
than
the
young
generation
more
precious
than
chemistry
more
precious
than
almost
all
humanity
because
they
are
the
fruit
the
real
fruit
of
all
humanity
and
perhaps
the
highest
fruit
that
can
be
a
form
of
beauty
already
attained
but
for
the
attaining
of
which
i
would
not
perhaps
consent
to
live
oh
heavens
he
cried
clasping
his
hands
ten
years
ago
i
said
the
same
thing
from
the
platform
in
petersburg
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
same
words
and
in
just
the
same
way
they
did
not
understand
it
they
laughed
and
hissed
as
now
shallow
people
what
is
lacking
in
you
that
you
cannot
understand
but
let
me
tell
you
let
me
tell
you
without
the
english
life
is
still
possible
for
humanity
without
germany
life
is
possible
without
the
russians
it
is
only
too
possible
without
science
without
bread
life
is
possibleonly
without
beauty
it
is
impossible
for
there
will
be
nothing
left
in
the
world
thats
the
secret
at
the
bottom
of
everything
thats
what
history
teaches
even
science
would
not
exist
a
moment
without
beautydo
you
know
that
you
who
laughit
will
sink
into
bondage
you
wont
invent
a
nail
even
i
wont
yield
an
inch
he
shouted
absurdly
in
confusion
and
with
all
his
might
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
but
all
the
while
that
he
was
shrieking
senselessly
and
incoherently
the
disorder
in
the
hall
increased
many
people
jumped
up
from
their
seats
some
dashed
forward
nearer
to
the
platform
it
all
happened
much
more
quickly
than
i
describe
it
and
there
was
no
time
to
take
steps
perhaps
no
wish
to
either
its
all
right
for
you
with
everything
found
for
you
you
pampered
creatures
the
same
divinity
student
bellowed
at
the
foot
of
the
platform
grinning
with
relish
at
stepan
trofimovitch
who
noticed
it
and
darted
to
the
very
edge
of
the
platform
havent
i
havent
i
just
declared
that
the
enthusiasm
of
the
young
generation
is
as
pure
and
bright
as
it
was
and
that
it
is
coming
to
grief
through
being
deceived
only
in
the
forms
of
beauty
isnt
that
enough
for
you
and
if
you
consider
that
he
who
proclaims
this
is
a
father
crushed
and
insulted
can
oneoh
shallow
heartscan
one
rise
to
greater
heights
of
impartiality
and
fairness
ungrateful
unjust
why
why
cant
you
be
reconciled
and
he
burst
into
hysterical
sobs
he
wiped
away
his
dropping
tears
with
his
fingers
his
shoulders
and
breast
were
heaving
with
sobs
he
was
lost
to
everything
in
the
world
a
perfect
panic
came
over
the
audience
almost
all
got
up
from
their
seats
yulia
mihailovna
too
jumped
up
quickly
seizing
her
husband
by
the
arm
and
pulling
him
up
too
the
scene
was
beyond

to
ask
you
if

not
sold
him

a
recruit
fifteen
years

pay
a

would
he

in
his
struggle
for
existence
what
do
you
say
mr
sthete
i
decline
to
describe
the
scene
that
followed
to
begin
with
there
was
a
furious
volley
of
applause
the
applause
did
not
come
from
allprobably
from
some
fifth
part
of
the
audiencebut
they
applauded
furiously
the
rest
of
the
public
made
for
the
exit
but
as
the
applauding
part
of
the
audience
kept
pressing
forward
towards
the
platform
there
was
a
regular
block
the
ladies
screamed
some
of
the
girls
began
to
cry
and
asked
to
go
home

standing
up
by

gazing
wildly
about
him
yulia

completely
lost
her
headfor
the
first
time
during
her
career
amongst
us
as
for
stepan
trofimovitch
for
the
first
moment
he
seemed
literally
crushed
by
the
divinity
students
words
but
he
suddenly
raised
his
arms
as
though
holding
them
out
above
the
public
and
yelled
i
shake
the
dust
from
off
my
feet
and
i
curse
you
its
the
end
the
end
and
turning
he
ran
behind
the
scenes
waving
his
hands
menacingly
he
has
insulted
the
audience
verhovensky
the
angry
section
roared
they
even
wanted
to
rush
in
pursuit
of
him
it
was
impossible
to
appease
them
at
the
moment
any
way
anda
final
catastrophe
broke
like
a
bomb
on
the
assembly
and
exploded
in
its
midst
the
third
reader
the
maniac
who
kept
waving
his
fist
behind
the
scenes
suddenly
ran
on
to
the
platform
he
looked
like
a
perfect
madman
with
a
broad
triumphant
smile
full
of
boundless
selfconfidence
he
looked
round
at
the
agitated
hall
and
he
seemed
to
be
delighted
at
the
disorder
he
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
at
having
to
speak
in
such
an
uproar
on
the
contrary
he
was
obviously
delighted
this
was
so
obvious
that
it
attracted
attention
at
once
whats
this
now
people
were
heard
asking
who
is
this
shh
what
does
he
want
to
say
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
maniac
shouted
with
all
his
might
standing
at
the
very
edge
of
the
platform
and
speaking
with
almost
as
shrill
feminine
a
voice
as
karmazinovs
but
without
the
aristocratic
lisp
ladies
and
gentlemen
twenty
years
ago
on
the
eve
of
war
with
half
europe
russia
was
regarded
as
an
ideal
country
by
officials
of
all
ranks
literature
was
in
the
service
of
the
censorship
military
drill
was
all
that
was
taught
at
the
universities
the
troops
were
trained
like
a
ballet
and
the
peasants
paid
the
taxes
and
were
mute
under
the
lash
of
serfdom
patriotism
meant
the
wringing
of
bribes
from
the
quick
and
the
dead
those
who
did
not
take
bribes
were
looked
upon
as
rebels
because
they
disturbed
the
general
harmony
the
birch
copses
were
extirpated
in
support
of
discipline
europe
trembled
but
never
in
the
thousand
years
of
its
senseless
existence
had
russia
sunk
to
such
ignominy
he
raised
his
fist
waved
it
ecstatically
and
menacingly
over
his
head
and
suddenly
brought
it
down
furiously
as
though
pounding
an
adversary
to
powder
a
frantic
yell
rose
from
the
whole
hall
there
was
a
deafening
roar
of
applause
almost
half
the
audience
was
applauding
their
enthusiasm
was
excusable
russia
was
being
put
to
shame
publicly
before
every
one
who
could
fail
to
roar
with
delight
this
is
the
real
thing
come
this
is
something
like
hurrah
yes
this
is
none
of
your
sthetics
the
maniac
went
on
ecstatically
twenty
years
have
passed
since
then
universities
have
been
opened
and
multiplied
military
drill
has
passed
into
a
legend
officers
are
too
few
by
thousands
the
railways
have
eaten
up
all
the
capital
and
have
covered
russia
as
with
a
spiders
web
so
that
in
another
fifteen
years
one
will
perhaps
get
somewhere
bridges
are
rarely
on
fire
and
fires
in
towns
occur
only
at
regular
intervals
in
turn
at
the
proper
season
in
the
law
courts
judgments
are
as
wise
as
solomons
and
the
jury
only
take
bribes
through
the
struggle
for
existence
to
escape
starvation
the
serfs
are
free
and
flog
one
another
instead
of
being
flogged
by
the
landowners
seas
and
oceans
of
vodka

consumed
to
support

ancient
and

has
been
solemnly
put
up
a
colossal
bronze
globe
to
celebrate
a
thousand
years
of
disorder
and
confusion
europe
scowls
and
begins
to
be
uneasy
again
fifteen
years
of
reforms
and
yet
never
even
in
the
most
grotesque
periods
of
its
madness
has
russia
sunk
the
last
words
could
not
be
heard
in
the
roar
of
the
crowd
one
could
see
him
again
raise
his
arm
and
bring
it
down
triumphantly
again
enthusiasm
was
beyond
all
bounds
people
yelled
clapped
their
hands
even
some
of
the
ladies
shouted
enough
you
cant
beat
that
some
might
have
been
drunk
the
orator
scanned
them
all
and
seemed
revelling
in
his
own
triumph
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
lembke
in
indescribable
excitement
pointing
something
out
to
somebody
yulia
mihailovna
with
a
pale
face
said
something
in
haste
to
the
prince
who
had
run
up
to
her
but
at
that
moment
a
group
of
six
men
officials
more
or
less
burst
on
to
the
platform
seized
the
orator
and
dragged
him
behind
the
scenes
i
cant
understand
how
he
managed
to
tear
himself
away
from
them
but
he
did
escape
darted
up
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
again
and
succeeded
in
shouting
again
at
the
top
of
his
voice
waving
his
fist
but
never
has
russia
sunk
but
he
was
dragged
away
again
i
saw
some
fifteen
men
dash
behind
the
scenes
to
rescue
him
not
crossing
the
platform
but
breaking
down
the
light
screen
at
the
side
of
it
i
saw
afterwards
though
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
the
girl
student
virginskys
sister
leap
on
to
the
platform
with
the
same
roll
under
her
arm
dressed
as
before
as
plump
and
rosy
as
ever
surrounded
by
two
or
three
women
and
two
or
three
men
and
accompanied
by
her
mortal
enemy
the
schoolboy
i
even
caught
the
phrase
ladies
and
gentlemen
ive
come
to
call
attention
to
the
sufferings
of
poor
students
and
to
rouse
them
to
a
general
protest
but
i
ran
away
hiding
my
badge
in
my
pocket
i
made
my
way
from
the
house
into
the
street
by
back
passages
which
i
knew
of
first
of
all
of
course
i
went
to
stepan
trofimovitchs
chapter
ii
the
end
of
the
fete
i
he
would
not
see
me
he
had
shut
himself
up
and
was
writing
at
my
repeated
knocks
and
appeals
he
answered
through
the
door
my
friend
i
have
finished
everything
who
can
ask
anything
more
of
me
you
havent
finished
anything
youve
only
helped
to
make
a
mess
of
the
whole
thing
for
gods
sake
no
epigrams
stepan
trofimovitch
open
the
door
we
must
take
steps
they
may
still
come
and
insult
you
i
thought
myself
entitled
to
be
particularly
severe
and
even
rigorous
i
was
afraid
he
might
be
going
to
do
something
still
more
mad
but
to
my
surprise
i
met
an
extraordinary
firmness
dont
be
the
first
to
insult
me
then
i
thank
you
for
the
past
but
i
repeat
ive
done
with
all
men
good
and
bad
i
am
writing
to
darya
pavlovna
whom
ive
forgotten
so
unpardonably
till
now
you
may
take
it
to
her
tomorrow
if
you
like
now
merci
stepan
trofimovitch
i
assure
you
that
the
matter
is
more
serious
than
you
think
do
you
think
that
youve
crushed
someone
there
youve
pulverised
no
one
but
have
broken
yourself
to
pieces
like
an
empty
bottle
oh
i
was
coarse
and
discourteous
i
remember
it
with
regret
youve
absolutely
no
reason
to
write
to
darya
pavlovna
and
what
will
you
do
with
yourself
without
me
what
do
you
understand
about
practical
life
i
expect
you
are
plotting
something
else
youll
simply
come
to
grief
again
if
you
go
plotting
something
more
he
rose
and
came
close
up
to
the
door
youve
not
been
long
with
them
but
youve
caught
the
infection
of
their
tone
and
language
dieu
vous
pardonne
mon
ami
et
dieu
vous
garde
but
ive
always
seen
in
you
the
germs
of
delicate
feeling
and
you
will
get
over
it
perhapsaprs
le
temps
of
course
like
all
of
us
russians
as
for
what
you
say
about
my
impracticability
ill
remind
you
of
a
recent
idea
of
mine
a
whole
mass
of
people
in
russia
do
nothing
whatever
but
attack
other
peoples
impracticability
with
the
utmost
fury
and
with
the
tiresome
persistence
of
flies
in
the
summer
accusing
every
one
of
it
except
themselves
cher
remember
that
i
am
excited
and
dont
distress
me
once
more
merci
for
everything
and
let
us
part
like
karmazinov
and
the
public
that
is
let
us
forget
each
other
with
as
much
generosity
as
we
can
he
was
posing
in
begging
his
former
readers
so
earnestly
to
forget
him
quant

moi
i
am
not
so
conceited
and
i
rest
my
hopes
on
the
youth
of
your
inexperienced
heart
how
should
you
remember
a
useless
old
man
for
long
live
more
my
friend
as
nastasya
wished
me
on
my
last
nameday
ces
pauvres
gens

des
mots
charmants
et
pleins
de
philosophie
i
do
not
wish
you
much
happinessit
will
bore
you
i
do
not
wish
you
trouble
either
but
following
the
philosophy
of
the
peasant
i
will
repeat
simply
live
more
and
try
not
to
be
much
bored
this
useless
wish
i
add
from
myself
well
goodbye
and
goodbye
for
good
dont
stand
at
my
door
i
will
not
open
it
he
went
away
and
i
could
get
nothing
more
out
of
him
in
spite
of
his
excitement
he
spoke
smoothly
deliberately
with
weight
obviously
trying
to
be
impressive
of
course
he
was
rather
vexed
with
me
and
was
avenging
himself
indirectly
possibly
even
for
the
yesterdays
prison
carts
and
floors
that
give
way
his
tears
in
public
that
morning
in
spite
of
a
triumph
of
a
sort
had
put
him
he
knew
in
rather
a
comic
position
and
there
never
was
a
man
more
solicitous
of
dignity
and
punctilio
in
his
relations
with
his
friends
than
stepan
trofimovitch
oh
i
dont
blame
him
but
this
fastidiousness
and
irony
which
he
preserved
in
spite
of
all
shocks
reassured
me
at
the
time
a
man
who
was
so
little
different
from
his
ordinary
self
was
of
course
not
in
the
mood
at
that
moment
for
anything
tragic
or
extraordinary
so
i
reasoned
at
the
time
and
heavens
what
a
mistake
i
made
i
left
too
much
out
of
my
reckoning
in
anticipation
of
events
i
will
quote
the
few
first
lines
of
the
letter
to
darya
pavlovna
which
she
actually
received
the
following
day
mon
enfant
my
hand
trembles
but
ive
done
with
everything
you
were
not
present
at
my
last
struggle
you
did
not
come
to
that
matine
and
you
did
well
to
stay
away
but
you
will
be
told
that
in
our
russia
which
has
grown
so
poor
in
men
of
character
one
man
had
the
courage
to
stand
up
and
in
spite
of
deadly
menaces
showered
on
him
from
all
sides
to
tell
the
fools
the
truth
that
is
that
they
are
fools
oh
ce
sontdes
pauvres
petits
vauriens
et
rien
de
plus
des
petitsfoolsvoil
le
mot
the
die
is
cast
i
am
going
from
this
town
forever
and
i
know
not
whither
every
one
i
loved
has
turned
from
me
but
you
you
are
a
pure
and
nave
creature
you
a
gentle
being
whose
life
has
been
all
but
linked
with
mine
at
the
will
of
a
capricious
and
imperious
heart
you
who
looked
at
me
perhaps
with
contempt
when
i
shed
weak
tears
on
the
eve
of
our
frustrated
marriage
you
who
cannot
in
any
case
look
on
me
except
as
a
comic
figurefor
you
for
you
is
the
last
cry
of
my
heart
for
you
my
last
duty
for
you
alone
i
cannot
leave
you
forever
thinking
of
me
as
an
ungrateful
fool
a
churlish
egoist
as
probably
a
cruel
and
ungrateful
heartwhom
alas
i
cannot
forgetis
every
day
describing
me
to
you
and
so
on
and
so
on
four
large
pages
answering
his
i
wont
open
with
three
bangs
with
my
fist
on
the
door
and
shouting
after
him
that
i
was
sure
he
would
send
nastasya
for
me
three
times
that
day
but
i
would
not
come
i
gave
him
up
and
ran
off
to
yulia
mihailovna
ii
there
i
was
the
witness
of
a
revolting
scene
the
poor
woman
was
deceived
to
her
face
and
i
could
do
nothing
indeed
what
could
i
say
to
her
i
had
had
time
to
reconsider
things
a
little
and
reflect
that
i
had
nothing
to
go
upon
but
certain
feelings
and
suspicious
presentiments
i
found
her
in
tears
almost
in
hysterics
with
compresses
of
eaudecologne
and
a
glass
of
water
before
her
stood
pyotr
stepanovitch
who
talked
without
stopping
and
the
prince
who
held
his
tongue
as
though
it
had
been
under
a
lock
with
tears
and
lamentations
she
reproached
pyotr
stepanovitch
for
his
desertion
i
was
struck
at
once
by
the
fact
that
she
ascribed
the
whole
failure
the
whole
ignominy
of
the
matine
everything
in
fact
to
pyotr
stepanovitchs
absence
in
him
i
observed
an
important
change
he
seemed
a
shade
too
anxious
almost
serious
as
a
rule
he
never
seemed
serious
he
was
always
laughing
even
when
he
was
angry
and
he
was
often
angry
oh
he
was
angry
now
he
was
speaking
coarsely
carelessly
with
vexation
and
impatience
he
said
that
he
had
been
taken
ill
at
gaganovs
lodging
where
he
had
happened
to
go
early
in
the
morning
alas
the
poor
woman
was
so
anxious
to
be
deceived
again
the
chief
question
which
i
found
being
discussed
was
whether
the
ball
that
is
the
whole
second
half
of
the
fte
should
or
should
not
take
place
yulia
mihailovna
could
not
be
induced
to
appear
at
the
ball
after
the
insults
she
had
received
that
morning
in
other
words
her
heart
was
set
on
being
compelled
to
do
so
and
by
him
by
pyotr
stepanovitch
she
looked
upon
him
as
an
oracle
and
i
believe
if
he
had
gone
away
she
would
have
taken
to
her
bed
at
once
but
he
did
not
want
to
go
away
he
was
desperately
anxious
that
the
ball
should
take
place
and
that
yulia
mihailovna
should
be
present
at
it
come
what
is
there
to
cry
about
are
you
set
on
having
a
scene
on
venting
your
anger
on
somebody
well
vent
it
on
me
only
make
haste
about
it
for
the
time
is
passing
and
you
must
make
up
your
mind
we
made
a
mess
of
it
with
the
matine
well
pick
up
on
the
ball
here
the
prince
thinks
as
i
do
yes
if
it
hadnt
been
for
the
prince
how
would
things
have
ended
there
the
prince
had
been
at
first
opposed
to
the
ball
that
is
opposed
to
yulia
mihailovnas
appearing
at
it
the
ball
was
bound
to
go
on
in
any
case
but
after
two
or
three
such
references
to
his
opinion
he
began
little
by
little
to
grunt
his
acquiescence
i
was
surprised
too
at
the
extraordinary
rudeness
of
pyotr
stepanovitchs
tone
oh
i
scout
with
indignation
the
contemptible
slander
which
was
spread
later
of
some
supposed
liaison
between
yulia
mihailovna
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
there
was
no
such
thing
nor
could
there
be
he
gained
his
ascendency
over
her
from
the
first
only
by
encouraging
her
in
her
dreams
of
influence
in
society
and
in
the
ministry
by
entering
into
her
plans
by
inventing
them
for
her
and
working
upon
her
with
the
grossest
flattery
he
had
got
her
completely
into
his
toils
and
had
become
as
necessary
to
her
as
the
air
she
breathed
seeing
me
she
cried
with
flashing
eyes
here
ask
him
he
kept
by
my
side
all
the
while
just
like
the
prince
did
tell
me
isnt
it
plain
that
it
was
all
a
preconcerted
plot
a
base
designing
plot
to
damage
andrey
antonovitch
and
me
as
much
as
possible
oh
they
had
arranged
it
beforehand
they
had
a
plan
its
a
party
a
regular
party
you
are
exaggerating
as
usual
youve
always
some
romantic
notion
in
your
head
but
i
am
glad
to
see
mr
he
pretended
to
have
forgotten
my
name
hell
give
us
his
opinion
my
opinion
i
hastened
to
put
in
is
the
same
as
yulia
mihailovnas
the
plot
is
only
too
evident
i
have
brought
you
these
ribbons
yulia
mihailovna
whether
the
ball
is
to
take
place
or
not
is
not
my
business
for
its
not
in
my
power
to
decide
but
my
part
as
steward
is
over
forgive
my
warmth
but
i
cant
act
against
the
dictates
of
common
sense
and
my
own
convictions
you
hear
you
hear
she
clasped
her
hands
i
hear
and
i
tell
you
this
he
turned
to
me
i
think
you
must
have
eaten
something
which
has
made
you
all
delirious
to
my
thinking
nothing
has
happened
absolutely
nothing
but
what
has
happened
before
and
is
always
liable
to
happen
in
this
town
a
plot
indeed
it
was
an
ugly
failure
disgracefully
stupid
but
wheres
the
plot
a
plot
against
yulia
mihailovna
who
has
spoiled
them
and
protected
them
and
fondly
forgiven
them
all
their
schoolboy
pranks
yulia
mihailovna
what
have
i
been
hammering
into
you
for
the
last
month
continually
what
did
i
warn
you
what
did
you
want
with
all
these
peoplewhat
did
you
want
with
them
what
induced
you
to
mix
yourself
up
with
these
fellows
what
was
the
motive
what
was
the
object
of
it
to
unite
society
but
mercy
on
us
will
they
ever
be
united
when
did
you
warn
me
on
the
contrary
you
approved
of
it
you
even
insisted
on
it
i
confess
i
am
so
surprised
you
brought
all
sorts
of
strange
people
to
see
me
yourself
on
the
contrary
i
opposed
you
i
did
not
approve
of
it
as
for
bringing
them
to
see
you
i
certainly
did
but
only
after
theyd
got
in
by
dozens
and
only
of
late
to
make
up
the
literary
quadrillewe
couldnt
get
on
without
these
rogues
only
i
dont
mind
betting
that
a
dozen
or
two
more
of
the
same
sort
were
let
in
without
tickets
today
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
agreed
there
you
see
you
are
agreeing
already
think
what
the
tone
has
been
lately
herei
mean
in
this
wretched
town
its
nothing
but
insolence
impudence
its
been
a
crying
scandal
all
the
time
and
whos
been
encouraging
it
whos
screened
it
by
her
authority
whos
upset
them
all
who
has
made
all
the
small
fry
huffy
all
their
family
secrets
are
caricatured
in
your
album
didnt
you
pat
them
on
the
back
your
poets
and
caricaturists
didnt
you
let
lyamshin
kiss
your
hand
didnt
a
divinity
student
abuse
an
actual
state
councillor
in
your
presence
and
spoil
his
daughters
dress
with
his
tarred
boots
now
can
you
wonder
that
the
public
is
set
against
you
but
thats
all
your
doing
yours
oh
my
goodness
no
i
warned
you
we
quarrelled
do
you
hear
we
quarrelled
why
you
are
lying
to
my
face
of
course
its
easy
for
you
to
say
that
you
need
a
victim
to
vent
your
wrath
on
well
vent
it
on
me
as
ive
said
already
id
better
appeal
to
you
mr
he
was
still
unable
to
recall
my
name
well
reckon
on
our
fingers
i
maintain
that
apart
from
liputin
there
was
nothing
preconcerted
nothing
i
will
prove
it
but
first
let
us
analyse
liputin
he
came
forward
with
that
fool
lebyadkins
verses
do
you
maintain
that
that
was
a
plot
but
do
you
know
it
might
simply
have
struck
liputin
as
a
clever
thing
to
do
seriously
seriously
he
simply
came
forward
with
the
idea
of
making
every
one
laugh
and
entertaining
themhis
protectress
yulia
mihailovna
first
of
all
that
was
all
dont
you
believe
it
isnt
that
in
keeping
with
all
that
has
been
going
on
here
for
the
last
month
do
you
want
me
to
tell
the
whole
truth
i
declare
that
under
other
circumstances
it
might
have
gone
off
all
right
it
was
a
coarse
jokewell
a
bit
strong
perhaps
but
it
was
amusing
you
know
wasnt
it
what
you
think
what
liputin
did
was
clever
yulia
mihailovna
cried
in
intense
indignation
such
stupidity
such
tactlessness
so
contemptible
so
mean
it
was
intentional
oh
you
are
saying
it
on
purpose
i
believe
after
that
you
are
in
the
plot
with
them
yourself
of
course
i
was
behind
the
scenes
i
was
in
hiding
i
set
it
all
going
but
if
i
were
in
the
plotunderstand
that
anywayit
wouldnt
have
ended
with
liputin
so
according
to
you
i
had
arranged
with
my
papa
too
that
he
should
cause
such
a
scene
on
purpose
well
whose
fault
is
it
that
my
papa
was
allowed
to
read
who
tried
only
yesterday
to
prevent
you
from
allowing
it
only
yesterday
oh
hier
il
avait
tant
desprit
i
was
so
reckoning
on
him
and
then
he
has
such
manners
i
thought
with
him
and
karmazinov
only
think
yes
only
think
but
in
spite
of
tant
desprit
papa
has
made
things
worse
and
if
id
known
beforehand
that
hed
make
such
a
mess
of
it
i
should
certainly
not
have
persuaded
you
yesterday
to
keep
the
goat
out
of
the
kitchen
garden
should
isince
i
am
taking
part
in
this
conspiracy
against
your
fte
that
you
are
so
positive
about
and
yet
i
did
try
to
dissuade
you
yesterday
i
tried
to
because
i
foresaw
it
to
foresee
everything
was
of
course
impossible
he
probably
did
not
know
himself
a
minute
before
what
he
would
fire
offthese
nervous
old
men
cant
be
reckoned
on
like
other
people
but
you
can
still
save
the
situation
to
satisfy
the
public
send
to
him
tomorrow
by
administrative
order
and
with
all
the
ceremonies
two
doctors
to
inquire
into
his
health
even
today
in
fact
and
take
him
straight
to
the
hospital
and
apply
cold
compresses
every
one
would
laugh
anyway
and
see
that
there
was
nothing
to
take
offence
at
ill
tell
people
about
it
in
the
evening
at
the
ball
as
i
am
his
son
karmazinov
is
another
story
he
was
a
perfect
ass
and
dragged
out
his
article
for
a
whole
hour
he
certainly
must
have
been
in
the
plot
with
me
ill
make
a
mess
of
it
too
he
thought
to
damage
yulia
mihailovna
oh
karmazinov
quelle
honte
i
was
burning
burning
with
shame
for
his
audience
well
i
shouldnt
have
burnt
but
have
cooked
him
instead
the
audience
was
right
you
know
who
was
to
blame
for
karmazinov
again
did
i
foist
him
upon
you
was
i
one
of
his
worshippers
well
hang
him
but
the
third
maniac
the
politicalthats
a
different
matter
that
was
every
ones
blunder
not
only
my
plot
ah
dont
speak
of
it
that
was
awful
awful
that
was
my
fault
entirely
my
fault
of
course
it
was
but
i
dont
blame
you
for
that
no
one
can
control
them
these
candid
souls
you
cant
always
be
safe
from
them
even
in
petersburg
he
was
recommended
to
you
and
in
what
terms
too
so
you
will
admit
that
you
are
bound
to
appear
at
the
ball
tonight
its
an
important
business
it
was
you
put
him
on
to
the
platform
you
must
make
it
plain
now
to
the
public
that
you
are
not
in
league
with
him
that
the
fellow
is
in
the
hands
of
the
police
and
that
you
were
in
some
inexplicable
way
deceived
you
ought
to
declare
with
indignation
that
you
were
the
victim
of
a
madman
because
he
is
a
madman
and
nothing
more
thats
how
you
must
put
it
about
him
i
cant
endure
these
people
who
bite
i
say
worse
things
perhaps
but
not
from
the
platform
you
know
and
they
are
talking
about
a
senator
too
what
senator
whos
talking
i
dont
understand
it
myself
you
know
do
you
know
anything
about
a
senator
yulia
mihailovna
a
senator
you
see
they
are
convinced
that
a
senator
has
been
appointed
to
be
governor
here
and
that
you
are
being
superseded
from
petersburg
ive
heard
it
from
lots
of
people
ive
heard
it
too
i
put
in
who
said
so
asked
yulia
mihailovna
flushing
all
over
you
mean
who
said
so
first
how
can
i
tell
but
there
it
is
people
say
so
masses
of
people
are
saying
so
they
were
saying
so
yesterday
particularly
they
are
all
very
serious
about
it
though
i
cant
make
it
out
of
course
the
more
intelligent
and
competent
dont
talk
but
even
some
of
those
listen
how
mean
and
how
stupid
well
thats
just
why
you
must
make
your
appearance
to
show
these
fools
i
confess
i
feel
myself
that
its
my
duty
but
what
if
theres
another
disgrace
in
store
for
us
what
if
people
dont
come
no
one
will
come
you
know
no
one
how
hot
you
are
they
not
come
what
about
the
new
clothes
what
about
the
girls
dresses
i
give
you
up
as
a
woman
after
that
is
that
your
knowledge
of
human
nature
the
marshals
wife
wont
come
she
wont
but
after
all
what
has
happened
why
wont
they
come
he
cried
at
last
with
angry
impatience
ignominy
disgracethats
whats
happened
i
dont
know
what
to
call
it
but
after
it
i
cant
face
people
why
how
are
you
to
blame
for
it
after
all
why
do
you
take
the
blame
of
it
on
yourself
isnt
it
rather
the
fault
of
the
audience
of
your
respectable
residents
your
patresfamilias
they
ought
to
have
controlled
the
roughs
and
the
rowdiesfor
it
was
all
the
work
of
roughs
and
rowdies
nothing
serious
you
can
never
manage
things
with
the
police
alone
in
any
society
anywhere
among
us
every
one
asks
for
a
special
policeman
to
protect
him
wherever
he
goes
people
dont
understand
that
society
must
protect
itself
and
what
do
our
patresfamilias
the
officials
the
wives
and
daughters
do
in
such
cases
they
sit
quiet
and
sulk
in
fact
theres
not
enough
social
initiative
to
keep
the
disorderly
in
check
ah
thats
the
simple
truth
they
sit
quiet
sulk
and
gaze
about
them
and
if
its
the
truth
you
ought
to
say
so
aloud
proudly
sternly
just
to
show
that
you
are
not
defeated
to
those
respectable
residents
and
mothers
of
families
oh
you
can
do
it
you
have
the
gift
when
your
head
is
clear
you
will
gather
them
round
you
and
say
it
aloud
and
then
a
paragraph
in
the
voice
and
the
financial
news
wait
a
bit
ill
undertake
it
myself
ill
arrange
it
all
for
you
of
course
there
must
be
more
superintendence
you
must
look
after
the
buffet
you
must
ask
the
prince
you
must
ask
mr
you
must
not
desert
us
monsieur
just
when
we
have
to
begin
all
over
again
and
finally
you
must
appear
arminarm
with
andrey
antonovitch
how
is
andrey
antonovitch
oh
how
unjustly
how
untruly
how
cruelly
you
have
always
judged
that
angelic
man
yulia
mihailovna
cried
in
a
sudden
outburst
almost
with
tears
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
positively
taken
aback
for
the
moment
good
heavens
i
what
have
i
said
ive
always
you
never
have
never
you
have
never
done
him
justice
theres
no
understanding
a
woman
grumbled
pyotr
stepanovitch
with
a
wry
smile
he
is
the
most
sincere
the
most
delicate
the
most
angelic
of
men
the
most
kindhearted
of
men
well
really
as
for
kindheartedness
ive
always
done
him
justice
never
but
let
us
drop
it
i
am
too
awkward
in
my
defence
of
him
this
morning
that
little
jesuit
the
marshals
wife
also
dropped
some
sarcastic
hints
about
what
happened
yesterday
oh
she
has
no
thoughts
to
spare
for
yesterday
now
she
is
full
of
today
and
why
are
you
so
upset
at
her
not
coming
to
the
ball
tonight
of
course
she
wont
come
after
getting
mixed
up
in
such
a
scandal
perhaps
its
not
her
fault
but
still
her
reputation
her
hands
are
soiled
what
do
you
mean
i
dont
understand
why
are
her
hands
soiled
yulia
mihailovna
looked
at
him
in
perplexity
i
dont
vouch
for
the
truth
of
it
but
the
town
is
ringing
with
the
story
that
it
was
she
brought
them
together
what
do
you
mean
brought
whom
together
what
do
you
mean
to
say
you
dont
know
he
exclaimed
with
wellsimulated
wonder
why
stavrogin
and
lizaveta
nikolaevna
what
how
we
all
cried
out
at
once
is
it
possible
you
dont
know
phew
why
it
is
quite
a
tragic
romance
lizaveta
nikolaevna
was
pleased
to
get
out
of
that
ladys
carriage
and
get
straight
into
stavrogins
carriage
and
slipped
off
with
the
latter
to
skvoreshniki
in
full
daylight
only
an
hour
ago
hardly
an
hour
we
were
flabbergasted
of
course
we
fell
to
questioning
him
but
to
our
wonder
although
he
happened
to
be
a
witness
of
the
scene
himself
he
could
give
us
no
detailed
account
of
it
the
thing
seemed
to
have
happened
like
this
when
the
marshals
wife
was
driving
liza
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
from
the
matine
to
the
house
of
praskovya
ivanovna
whose
legs
were
still
bad
they
saw
a
carriage
waiting
a
short
distance
about
twentyfive
paces
to
one
side
of
the
front
door
when
liza
jumped
out
she
ran
straight
to
this
carriage
the
door
was
flung
open
and
shut
again
liza
called
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
spare
me
and
the
carriage
drove
off
at
full
speed
to
skvoreshniki
to
our
hurried
questions
whether
it
was
by
arrangement
who
was
in
the
carriage
pyotr
stepanovitch
answered
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
no
doubt
it
had
been
arranged
but
that
he
did
not
see
stavrogin
himself
possibly
the
old
butler
alexey
yegorytch
might
have
been
in
the
carriage
to
the
question
how
did
he
come
to
be
there
and
how
did
he
know
for
a
fact
that
she
had
driven
to
skvoreshniki
he
answered
that
he
happened
to
be
passing
and
at
seeing
liza
he
had
run
up
to
the
carriage
and
yet
he
could
not
make
out
who
was
in
it
an
inquisitive
man
like
him
and
that
mavriky
nikolaevitch
far
from
setting
off
in
pursuit
had
not
even
tried
to
stop
liza
and
had
even
laid
a
restraining
hand
on
the
marshals
wife
who
was
shouting
at
the
top
of
her
voice
she
is
going
to
stavrogin
to
stavrogin
at
this
point
i
lost
patience
and
cried
furiously
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
its
all
your
doing
you
rascal
this
was
what
you
were
doing
this
morning
you
helped
stavrogin
you
came
in
the
carriage
you
helped
her
into
it
it
was
you
you
you
yulia
mihailovna
he
is
your
enemy
he
will
be
your
ruin
too
beware
of
him
and
i
ran
headlong
out
of
the
house
i
wonder
myself
and
cannot
make
out
to
this
day
how
i
came
to
say
that
to
him
but
i
guessed
quite
right
it
had
all
happened
almost
exactly
as
i
said
as
appeared
later
what
struck
me
most
was
the
obviously
artificial
way
in
which
he
broke
the
news
he
had
not
told
it
at
once
on
entering
the
house
as
an
extraordinary
piece
of
news
but
pretended
that
we
knew
without
his
telling
us
which
was
impossible
in
so
short
a
time
and
if
we
had
known
it
we
could
not
possibly
have
refrained
from
mentioning
it
till
he
introduced
the
subject
besides
he
could
not
have
heard
yet
that
the
town
was
ringing
with
gossip
about
the
marshals
wife
in
so
short
a
time
besides
he
had
once
or
twice
given
a
vulgar
frivolous
smile
as
he
told
the
story
probably
considering
that
we
were
fools
and
completely
taken
in
but
i
had
no
thought
to
spare
for
him
the
central
fact
i
believed
and
ran
from
yulia
mihailovnas
beside
myself
the
catastrophe
cut
me
to
the
heart
i
was
wounded
almost
to
tears
perhaps
i
did
shed
some
indeed
i
was
at
a
complete
loss
what
to
do
i
rushed
to
stepan
trofimovitchs
but
the
vexatious
man
still
refused
to
open
the
door
nastasya
informed
me
in
a
reverent
whisper
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
but
i
did
not
believe
it
at
lizas
house
i
succeeded
in
questioning
the
servants
they
confirmed
the
story
of
the
elopement
but
knew
nothing
themselves
there
was
great
commotion
in
the
house
their
mistress
had
been
attacked
by
fainting
fits
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
with
her
i
did
not
feel
it
possible
to
ask
for
mavriky
nikolaevitch
to
my
inquiries
about
pyotr
stepanovitch
they
told
me
that
he
had
been
in
and
out
continually
of
late
sometimes
twice
in
the
day
the
servants
were
sad
and
showed
particular
respectfulness
in
speaking
of
liza
they
were
fond
of
her
that
she
was
ruined
utterly
ruined
i
did
not
doubt
but
the
psychological
aspect
of
the
matter
i
was
utterly
unable
to
understand
especially
after
her
scene
with
stavrogin
the
previous
day
to
run
about
the
town
and
inquire
at
the
houses
of
acquaintances
who
would
of
course
by
now
have
heard
the
news
and
be
rejoicing
at
it
seemed
to
me
revolting
besides
being
humiliating
for
liza
but
strange
to
say
i
ran
to
see
darya
pavlovna
though
i
was
not
admitted
no
one
had
been
admitted
into
the
house
since
the
previous
morning
i
dont
know
what
i
could
have
said
to
her
and
what
made
me
run
to
her
from
her
i
went
to
her
brothers
shatov
listened
sullenly
and
in
silence
i
may
observe
that
i
found
him
more
gloomy
than
i
had
ever
seen
him
before
he
was
awfully
preoccupied
and
seemed
only
to
listen
to
me
with
an
effort
he
said
scarcely
anything
and
began
walking
up
and
down
his
cell
from
corner
to
corner
treading
more
noisily
than
usual
as
i
was
going
down
the
stairs
he
shouted
after
me
to
go
to
liputins
there
youll
hear
everything
yet
i
did
not
go
to
liputins
but
after
id
gone
a
good
way
towards
home
i
turned
back
to
shatovs
again
and
half
opening
the
door
without
going
in
suggested
to
him
laconically
and
with
no
kind
of
explanation
wont
you
go
to
marya
timofyevna
today
at
this
shatov
swore
at
me
and
i
went
away
i
note
here
that
i
may
not
forget
it
that
he
did
purposely
go
that
evening
to
the
other
end
of
the
town
to
see
marya
timofyevna
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
some
time
he
found
her
in
excellent
health
and
spirits
and
lebyadkin
dead
drunk
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
the
first
room
this
was
at
nine
oclock
he
told
me
so
himself
next
day
when
we
met
for
a
moment
in
the
street
before
ten
oclock
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
the
ball
but
not
in
the
capacity
of
a
steward
besides
my
rosette
had
been
left
at
yulia
mihailovnas
i
was
tempted
by
irresistible
curiosity
to
listen
without
asking
any
questions
to
what
people
were
saying
in
the
town
about
all
that
had
happened
i
wanted
too
to
have
a
look
at
yulia
mihailovna
if
only
at
a
distance
i
reproached
myself
greatly
that
i
had
left
her
so
abruptly
that
afternoon
iii
all
that
night
with
its
almost
grotesque
incidents
and
the
terrible
dnouement
that
followed
in
the
early
morning
still
seems
to
me
like
a
hideous
nightmare
and
is
for
me
at
least
the
most
painful
chapter
in
my
chronicle
i
was
late
for
the
ball
and
it
was
destined
to
end
so
quickly
that
i
arrived
not
long
before
it
was
over
it
was
eleven
oclock
when
i
reached
the
entrance
of
the
marshals
house
where
the
same
white
hall
in
which
the
matine
had
taken
place
had
in
spite
of
the
short
interval
between
been
cleared
and
made
ready
to
serve
as
the
chief
ballroom
for
the
whole
town
as
we
expected
to
dance
in
but
far
as
i
had
been
that
morning
from
expecting
the
ball
to
be
a
success
i
had
had
no
presentiment
of
the
full
truth
not
one
family
of
the
higher
circles
appeared
even
the
subordinate
officials
of
rather
more
consequence
were
absentand
this
was
a
very
striking
fact
as
for
ladies
and
girls
pyotr
stepanovitchs
arguments
the
duplicity
of
which
was
obvious
now
turned
out
to
be
utterly
incorrect
exceedingly
few
had
come
to
four
men
there
was
scarcely
one
ladyand
what
ladies
they
were
regimental
ladies
of
a
sort
three
doctors
wives
with
their
daughters
two
or
three
poor
ladies
from
the
country
the
seven
daughters
and
the
niece
of
the
secretary
whom
i
have
mentioned
already
some
wives
of
tradesmen
of
postoffice
clerks
and
other
small
frywas
this
what
yulia
mihailovna
expected
half
the
tradespeople
even
were
absent
as
for
the
men
in
spite
of
the
complete
absence
of
all
persons
of
consequence
there
was
still
a
crowd
of
them
but
they
made
a
doubtful
and
suspicious
impression
there
were
of
course
some
quiet
and
respectful
officers
with
their
wives
some
of
the
most
docile
fathers
of
families
like
that
secretary
for
instance
the
father
of
his
seven
daughters
all
these
humble
insignificant
people
had
come
as
one
of
these
gentlemen
expressed
it
because
it
was
inevitable
but
on
the
other
hand
the
mass
of
freeandeasy
people
and
the
mass
too
of
those
whom
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
i
had
suspected
of
coming
in
without
tickets
seemed
even
bigger
than
in
the
afternoon
so
far
they
were
all
sitting
in
the
refreshment
bar
and
had
gone
straight
there
on
arriving
as
though
it
were
the
meetingplace
they
had
agreed
upon
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
the
refreshment
bar
had
been
placed
in
a
large
room
the
last
of
several
opening
out
of
one
another
here
prohoritch
was
installed
with
all
the
attractions
of
the
club
cuisine
and
with
a
tempting
display
of
drinks
and
dainties
i
noticed
several
persons
whose
coats
were
almost
in
rags
and
whose
getup
was
altogether
suspicious
and
utterly
unsuitable
for
a
ball
they
had
evidently
been
with
great
pains
brought
to
a
state
of
partial
sobriety
which
would
not
last
long
and
goodness
knows
where
they
had
been
brought
from
they
were
not
local
people
i
knew
of
course
that
it
was
part
of
yulia
mihailovnas
idea
that
the
ball
should
be
of
the
most
democratic
character
and
that
even
working
people
and
shopmen
should
not
be
excluded
if
any
one
of
that
class
chanced
to
pay
for
a
ticket
she
could
bravely
utter
such
words
in
her
committee
with
absolute
security
that
none
of
the
working
people
of
our
town
who
all
lived
in
extreme
poverty
would
dream
of
taking
a
ticket
but
in
spite
of
the
democratic
sentiments
of
the
committee
i
could
hardly
believe
that
such
sinisterlooking
and
shabby
people
could
have
been
admitted
in
the
regular
way
but
who
could
have
admitted
them
and
with
what
object
lyamshin
and
liputin
had
already
been
deprived
of
their
stewards
rosettes
though
they
were
present
at
the
ball
as
they
were
taking
part
in
the
literary
quadrille
but
to
my
amazement
liputins
place
was
taken
by
the
divinity
student
who
had
caused
the
greatest
scandal
at
the
matine
by
his
skirmish
with
stepan
trofimovitch
and
lyamshins
was
taken
by
pyotr
stepanovitch
himself
what
was
to
be
looked
for
under
the
circumstances
i
tried
to
listen
to
the
conversation
i
was
struck
by
the
wildness
of
some
ideas
i
heard
expressed
it
was
maintained
in
one
group
for
instance
that
yulia
mihailovna
had
arranged
lizas
elopement
with
stavrogin
and
had
been
paid
by
the
latter
for
doing
so
even
the
sum
paid
was
mentioned
it
was
asserted
that
she
had
arranged
the
whole
fte
with
a
view
to
it
and
that
that
was
the
reason
why
half
the
town
had
not
turned
up
at
the
ball
and
that
lembke
himself
was
so
upset
about
it
that
his
mind
had
given
way
and
that
crazy
as
he
was
she
had
got
him
in
tow
there
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
too
hoarse
wild
and
significant
every
one
was
criticising
the
ball
too
with
great
severity
and
abusing
yulia
mihailovna
without
ceremony
in
fact
it
was
disorderly
incoherent
drunken
and
excited
babble
so
it
was
difficult
to
put
it
together
and
make
anything
of
it
at
the
same
time
there
were
simplehearted
people
enjoying
themselves
at
the
refreshmentbar
there
were
even
some
ladies
of
the
sort
who
are
surprised
and
frightened
at
nothing
very
genial
and
festive
chiefly
military
ladies
with
their
husbands
they
made
parties
at
the
little
tables
were
drinking
tea
and
were
very
merry
the
refreshmentbar
made
a
snug
refuge
for
almost
half
of
the
guests
yet
in
a
little
time
all
this
mass
of
people
must
stream
into
the
ballroom
it
was
horrible
to
think
of
it
meanwhile
the
prince
had
succeeded
in
arranging
three
skimpy
quadrilles
in
the
white
hall
the
young
ladies
were
dancing
while
their
parents
were
enjoying
watching
them
but
many
of
these
respectable
persons
had
already
begun
to
think
how
they
could
after
giving
their
girls
a
treat
get
off
in
good
time
before
the
trouble
began
absolutely
every
one
was
convinced
that
it
certainly
would
begin
it
would
be
difficult
for
me
to
describe
yulia
mihailovnas
state
of
mind
i
did
not
talk
to
her
though
i
went
close
up
to
her
she
did
not
respond
to
the
bow
i
made
her
on
entering
she
did
not
notice
me
really
did
not
notice
there
was
a
painful
look
in
her
face
and
a
contemptuous
and
haughty
though
restless
and
agitated
expression
in
her
eyes
she
controlled
herself
with
evident
sufferingfor
whose
sake
with
what
object
she
certainly
ought
to
have
gone
away
still
more
to
have
got
her
husband
away
and
she
remained
from
her
face
one
could
see
that
her
eyes
were
fully
opened
and
that
it
was
useless
for
her
to
expect
any
thing
more
she
did
not
even
summon
pyotr
stepanovitch
he
seemed
to
avoid
her
i
saw
him
in
the
refreshmentroom
he
was
extremely
lively
but
she
remained
at
the
ball
and
did
not
let
andrey
antonovitch
leave
her
side
for
a
moment
oh
up
to
the
very
last
moment
even
that
morning
she
would
have
repudiated
any
hint
about
his
health
with
genuine
indignation
but
now
her
eyes
were
to
be
opened
on
this
subject
too
as
for
me
i
thought
from
the
first
glance
that
andrey
antonovitch
looked
worse
than
he
had
done
in
the
morning
he
seemed
to
be
plunged
into
a
sort
of
oblivion
and
hardly
to
know
where
he
was
sometimes
he
looked
about
him
with
unexpected
severityat
me
for
instance
twice
once
he
tried
to
say
something
he
began
loudly
and
audibly
but
did
not
finish
the
sentence
throwing
a
modest
old
clerk
who
happened
to
be
near
him
almost
into
a
panic
but
even
this
humble
section
of
the
assembly
held
sullenly
and
timidly
aloof
from
yulia
mihailovna
and
at
the
same
time
turned
upon
her
husband
exceedingly
strange
glances
open
and
staring
quite
out
of
keeping
with
their
habitually
submissive
demeanour
yes
that
struck
me
and
i
suddenly
began
to
guess
about
andrey
antonovitch
yulia
mihailovna
confessed
to
me
afterwards
yes
she
was
to
blame
again
probably
when
after
my
departure
she
had
settled
with
pyotr
stepanovitch
that
there
should
be
a
ball
and
that
she
should
be
present
she
must
have
gone
again
to
the
study
where
andrey
antonovitch
was
sitting
utterly
shattered
by
the
matine
must
again
have
used
all
her
fascinations
to
persuade
him
to
come
with
her
but
what
misery
she
must
have
been
in
now
and
yet
she
did
not
go
away
whether
it
was
pride
or
simply
she
lost
her
head
i
do
not
know
in
spite
of
her
haughtiness
she
attempted
with
smiles
and
humiliation
to
enter
into
conversation
with
some
ladies
but
they
were
confused
confined
themselves
to
distrustful
monosyllables
yes
and
no
and
evidently
avoided
her
the
only
person
of
undoubted
consequence
who
was
present
at
the
ball
was
that
distinguished
general
whom
i
have
described
already
the
one
who
after
stavrogins
duel
with
gaganov
opened
the
door
to
public
impatience
at
the
marshals
wifes
he
walked
with
an
air
of
dignity
through
the
rooms
looked
about
and
listened
and
tried
to
appear
as
though
he
had
come
rather
for
the
sake
of
observation
than
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
himself
he
ended
by
establishing
himself
beside
yulia
mihailovna
and
not
moving
a
step
away
from
her
evidently
trying
to
keep
up
her
spirits
and
reassure
her
he
certainly
was
a
most
kindhearted
man
of
very
high
rank
and
so
old
that
even
compassion
from
him
was
not
wounding
but
to
admit
to
herself
that
this
old
gossip
was
venturing
to
pity
her
and
almost
to
protect
her
knowing
that
he
was
doing
her
honour
by
his
presence
was
very
vexatious
the
general
stayed
by
her
and
never
ceased
chattering
they
say
a
town
cant
go
on
without
seven
righteous
men
seven
i
think
it
is
i
am
not
sure
of
the
number
fixed
i
dont
know
how
many
of
these
seven
the
certified
righteous
of
the
town
have
the
honour
of
being
present
at
your
ball
yet
in
spite
of
their
presence
i
begin
to
feel
unsafe
vous
me
pardonnez
charmante
dame
nestce
pas
i
speak
allegorically
but
i
went
into
the
refreshmentroom
and
i
am
glad
i
escaped
alive
our
priceless
prohoritch
is
not
in
his
place
there
and
i
believe
his
bar
will
be
destroyed
before
morning
but
i
am
laughing
i
am
only
waiting
to
see
what
the
literary
quadrille
is
going
to
be
like
and
then
home
to
bed
you
must
excuse
a
gouty
old
fellow
i
go
early
to
bed
and
i
would
advise
you
too
to
go
byby
as
they
say
aux
enfants
ive
come
you
know
to
have
a
look
at
the
pretty
girls
whom
of
course
i
could
meet
nowhere
in
such
profusion
as
here
they
all
live
beyond
the
river
and
i
dont
drive
out
so
far
theres
a
wife
of
an
officer
in
the
chasseurs
i
believe
he
is
who
is
distinctly
pretty
distinctly
and
she
knows
it
herself
ive
talked
to
the
sly
puss
she
is
a
sprightly
one
and
the
girls
too
are
freshlooking
but
thats
all
theres
nothing
but
freshness
still
its
a
pleasure
to
look
at
them
there
are
some
rosebuds
but
their
lips
are
thick
as
a
rule
theres
an
irregularity
about
female
beauty
in
russia
and
they
are
a
little
like
buns
vous
me
pardonnez
nestce
pas
with
good
eyes
however
laughing
eyes
these
rose
buds
are
charming
for
two
years
when
they
are
young
even
for
three
then
they
broaden
out
and
are
spoilt
forever
producing
in
their
husbands
that
deplorable
indifference
which
does
so
much
to
promote
the
woman
movement
that
is
if
i
understand
it
correctly
hm
its
a
fine
hall
the
rooms
are
not
badly
decorated
it
might
be
worse
the
music
might
be
much
worse
i
dont
say
it
ought
to
have
been
what
makes
a
bad
impression
is
that
there
are
so
few
ladies
i
say
nothing
about
the
dresses
its
bad
that
that
chap
in
the
grey
trousers
should
dare
to
dance
the
cancan
so
openly
i
can
forgive
him
if
he
does
it
in
the
gaiety
of
his
heart
and
since
he
is
the
local
chemist
still
eleven
oclock
is
a
bit
early
even
for
chemists
there
were
two
fellows
fighting
in
the
refreshmentbar
and
they
werent
turned
out
at
eleven
oclock
people
ought
to
be
turned
out
for
fighting
whatever
the
standard
of
manners
three
oclock
is
a
different
matter
then
one
has
to
make
concessions
to
public
opinionif
only
this
ball
survives
till
three
oclock
varvara
petrovna
has
not
kept
her
word
though
and
hasnt
sent
flowers
hm
she
has
no
thoughts
for
flowers
pauvre
mre
and
poor
liza
have
you
heard
they
say
its
a
mysterious
story
and
stavrogin
is
to
the
front
again
hm
i
would
have
gone
home
to
bed
i
can
hardly
keep
my
eyes
open
but
when
is
this
literary
quadrille
coming
on
at
last
the
literary
quadrille
began
whenever
of
late
there
had
been
conversation
in
the
town
on
the
ball
it
had
invariably
turned
on
this
literary
quadrille
and
as
no
one
could
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
it
aroused
extraordinary
curiosity
nothing
could
be
more
unfavourable
to
its
chance
of
success
and
great
was
the
disappointment
the
side
doors
of
the
white
hall
were
thrown
open
and
several
masked
figures
appeared
the
public
surrounded
them
eagerly
all
the
occupants
of
the
refreshmentbar
trooped
to
the
last
man
into
the
hall
the
masked
figures
took
their
places
for
the
dance
i
succeeded
in
making
my
way
to
the
front
and
installed
myself
just
behind
yulia
mihailovna
von
lembke
and
the
general
at
this
point
pyotr
stepanovitch
who
had
kept
away
till
that
time
skipped
up
to
yulia
mihailovna
ive
been
in
the
refreshmentroom
all
this
time
watching
he
whispered
with
the
air
of
a
guilty
schoolboy
which
he
however
assumed
on
purpose
to
irritate
her
even
more
she
turned
crimson
with
anger
you
might
give
up
trying
to
deceive
me
now
at
least
insolent
man
broke
from
her
almost
aloud
so
that
it
was
heard
by
other
people
pyotr
stepanovitch
skipped
away
extremely
well
satisfied
with
himself
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
more
pitiful
vulgar
dull
and
insipid
allegory
than
this
literary
quadrille
nothing
could
be
imagined
less
appropriate
to
our
local
society
yet
they
say
it
was
karmazinovs
idea
it
was
liputin
indeed
who
arranged
it
with
the
help
of
the
lame
teacher
who
had
been
at
the
meeting
at
virginskys
but
karmazinov
had
given
the
idea
and
had
it
was
said
meant
to
dress
up
and
to
take
a
special
and
prominent
part
in
it
the
quadrille
was
made
up
of
six
couples
of
masked
figures
who
were
not
in
fancy
dress
exactly
for
their
clothes
were
like
every
one
elses
thus
for
instance
one
short
and
elderly
gentleman
wearing
a
dresscoatin
fact
dressed
like
every
one
elsewore
a
venerable
grey
beard
tied
on
and
this
constituted
his
disguise
as
he
danced
he
pounded
up
and
down
taking
tiny
and
rapid
steps
on
the
same
spot
with
a
stolid
expression
of
countenance
he
gave
vent
to
sounds
in
a
subdued
but
husky
bass
and
this
huskiness
was
meant
to
suggest
one
of
the
wellknown
papers
opposite
this
figure
danced
two
giants
x
and
z
and
these
letters
were
pinned
on
their
coats
but
what
the
letters
meant
remained
unexplained
honest
russian
thought
was
represented
by
a
middleaged
gentleman
in
spectacles
dresscoat
and
gloves
and
wearing
fetters
real
fetters
under
his
arm
he
had
a
portfolio
containing
papers
relating
to
some
case
to
convince
the
sceptical
a
letter
from
abroad
testifying
to
the
honesty
of
honest
russian
thought
peeped
out
of
his
pocket
all
this
was
explained
by
the
stewards
as
the
letter
which
peeped
out
of
his
pocket
could
not
be
read
honest
russian
thought
had
his
right
hand
raised
and
in
it
held
a
glass
as
though
he
wanted
to
propose
a
toast
in
a
line
with
him
on
each
side
tripped
a
cropheaded
nihilist
girl
while
visvis
danced
another
elderly
gentleman
in
a
dresscoat
with
a
heavy
cudgel
in
his
hand
he
was
meant
to
represent
a
formidable
periodical
not
a
petersburg
one
and
seemed
to
be
saying
ill
pound
you
to
a
jelly
but
in
spite
of
his
cudgel
he
could
not
bear
the
spectacles
of
honest
russian
thought
fixed
upon
him
and
tried
to
look
away
and
when
he
did
the
pas
de
deux
he
twisted
turned
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himselfso
terrible
probably
were
the
stings
of
his
conscience
i
dont
remember
all
the
absurd
tricks
they
played
however
it
was
all
in
the
same
style
so
that
i
felt
at
last
painfully
ashamed
and
this
same
expression
as
it
were
of
shame
was
reflected
in
the
whole
public
even
on
the
most
sullen
figures
that
had
come
out
of
the
refreshmentroom
for
some
time
all
were
silent
and
gazed
with
angry
perplexity
when
a
man
is
ashamed
he
generally
begins
to
get
angry
and
is
disposed
to
be
cynical
by
degrees
a
murmur
arose
in
the
audience
whats
the
meaning
of
it
a
man
who
had
come
in
from
the
refreshmentroom
muttered
in
one
of
the
groups
its
silly
its
something
literary
its
a
criticism
of
the
voice
whats
that
to
me
from
another
group
asses
no
they
are
not
asses
its
we
who
are

are
you
an
ass
i
am
not
an
ass
well
if
you
are
not
i
am
certainly
not
from
a
third
group
we
ought
to
give
them
a
good
smacking
and
send
them
flying
pull
down
the
hall
from
a
fourth
group
i
wonder
the
lembkes
are
not
ashamed
to
look
on
why
should
they
be
ashamed
you
are
not
yes
i
am
ashamed
and
he
is
the
governor
and
you
are

pig
ive
never
seen
such
a
commonplace
ball
in
my
life
a
lady
observed
viciously
quite
close
to
yulia
mihailovna
obviously
with
the
intention
of
being
overheard
she
was
a
stout
lady
of
forty
with
rouge
on
her
cheeks
wearing
a
brightcoloured
silk
dress
almost
every
one
in
the
town
knew
her
but
no
one
received
her
she
was
the
widow
of
a
civil
councillor
who
had
left
her
a
wooden
house
and
a
small
pension
but
she
lived
well
and
kept
horses
two
months
previously
she
had
called
on
yulia
mihailovna
but
the
latter
had
not
received
her
that
might
have
been
foreseen
she
added
looking
insolently
into
yulia
mihailovnas
face
if
you
could
foresee
it
why
did
you
come
yulia
mihailovna
could
not
resist
saying
because
i
was
too
simple
the
sprightly
lady
answered
instantly
up
in
arms
and
eager
for
the
fray
but
the
general
intervened
chre
damehe
bent
over
to
yulia
mihailovnayoud
really
better
be
going
we
are
only
in
their
way
and
theyll
enjoy
themselves
thoroughly
without
us
youve
done
your
part
youve
opened
the
ball
now
leave
them
in
peace
and
andrey
antonovitch
doesnt
seem
to
be
feeling
quite
satisfactorily
to
avoid
trouble
but
it
was
too
late
all
through
the
quadrille
andrey
antonovitch
gazed
at
the
dancers
with
a
sort
of
angry
perplexity
and
when
he
heard
the
comments
of
the
audience
he
began
looking
about
him
uneasily
then
for
the
first
time
he
caught
sight
of
some
of
the
persons
who
had
come
from
the
refreshmentroom
there
was
an
expression
of
extreme
wonder
in
his
face
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
roar
of
laughter
at
a
caper
that
was
cut
in
the
quadrille
the
editor
of
the
menacing
periodical
not
a
petersburg
one
who
was
dancing
with
the
cudgel
in
his
hands
felt
utterly
unable
to
endure
the
spectacled
gaze
of
honest
russian
thought
and
not
knowing
how
to
escape
it
suddenly
in
the
last
figure
advanced
to
meet
him
standing
on
his
head
which
was
meant
by
the
way
to
typify
the
continual
turning
upside
down
of
common
sense
by
the
menacing
nonpetersburg
gazette
as
lyamshin
was
the
only
one
who
could
walk
standing
on
his
head
he
had
undertaken
to
represent
the
editor
with
the
cudgel
yulia
mihailovna
had
had
no
idea
that
anyone
was
going
to
walk
on
his
head
they
concealed
that
from
me
they
concealed
it
she
repeated
to
me
afterwards
in
despair
and
indignation
the
laughter
from
the
crowd
was
of
course
provoked
not
by
the
allegory
which
interested
no
one
but
simply
by
a
mans
walking
on
his
head
in
a
swallowtail
coat
lembke
flew
into
a
rage
and
shook
with
fury
rascal
he
cried
pointing
to
lyamshin
take
hold
of
the
scoundrel
turn
him
over
turn
his
legs
his
head
so
that
his
heads
up
up
lyamshin
jumped
on
to
his
feet
the
laughter
grew
louder
turn
out
all
the
scoundrels
who
are
laughing
lembke
prescribed
suddenly
there
was
an
angry
roar
and
laughter
in
the
crowd
you
cant
do
like
that
your
excellency
you
mustnt
abuse
the
public
you
are
a
fool
yourself
a
voice
cried
suddenly
from
a
corner
filibusters
shouted
someone
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
lembke
looked
round
quickly
at
the
shout
and
turned
pale
a
vacant
smile
came
on
to
his
lips
as
though
he
suddenly
understood
and
remembered
something
gentlemen
said
yulia
mihailovna
addressing
the
crowd
which
was
pressing
round
them
as
she
drew
her
husband
awaygentlemen
excuse
andrey
antonovitch
andrey
antonovitch
is
unwell
excuse
forgive
him
gentlemen
i
positively
heard
her
say
forgive
him
it
all
happened
very
quickly
but
i
remember
for
a
fact
that
a
section
of
the
public
rushed
out
of
the
hall
immediately
after
those
words
of
yulia
mihailovnas
as
though
panicstricken
i
remember
one
hysterical
tearful
feminine
shriek
ach
the
same
thing
again
and
in
the
retreat
of
the
guests
which
was
almost
becoming
a
crush
another
bomb
exploded
exactly
as
in
the
afternoon
fire
all
the
riverside
quarter
is
on
fire
i
dont
remember
where
this
terrible
cry
rose
first
whether
it
was
first
raised
in
the
hall
or
whether
someone
ran
upstairs
from
the
entry
but
it
was
followed
by
such
alarm
that
i
cant
attempt
to
describe
it
more
than
half
the
guests
at
the
ball
came
from
the
quarter
beyond
the
river
and
were
owners
or
occupiers
of
wooden
houses
in
that
district
they
rushed
to
the
windows
pulled
back
the
curtains
in
a
flash
and
tore
down
the
blinds
the
riverside
was
in
flames
the
fire
it
is
true
was
only
beginning
but
it
was
in
flames
in
three
separate
placesand
that
was
what
was
alarming
arson
the
shpigulin
men
roared
the
crowd
i
remember
some
very
characteristic
exclamations
ive
had
a
presentiment
in
my
heart
that
thered
be
arson
ive
had
a
presentiment
of
it
these
last
few
days
the
shpigulin
men
the
shpigulin
men
no
one
else
we
were
all
lured
here
on
purpose
to
set
fire
to
it
this
last
most
amazing
exclamation
came
from
a
woman
it
was
an
unintentional
involuntary
shriek
of
a
housewife
whose
goods
were
burning
every
one
rushed
for
the
door
i
wont
describe
the
crush
in
the
vestibule
over
sorting
out
cloaks
shawls
and
pelisses
the
shrieks
of
the
frightened
women
the
weeping
of
the
young
ladies
i
doubt
whether
there
was
any
theft
but
it
was
no
wonder
that
in
such
disorder
some
went
away
without
their
wraps
because
they
were
unable
to
find
them
and
this
grew
into
a
legend
with
many
additions
long
preserved
in
the
town
lembke
and
yulia
mihailovna
were
almost
crushed
by
the
crowd
at
the
doors
stop
every
one
dont
let
anyone
out
yelled
lembke
stretching
out
his
arms
menacingly
towards
the
crowding
people
every
one
without
exception
to
be
strictly
searched
at
once
a
storm
of
violent
oaths
rose
from
the
crowd
andrey
antonovitch
andrey
antonovitch
cried
yulia
mihailovna
in
complete
despair
arrest
her
first
shouted
her
husband
pointing
his
finger
at
her
threateningly
search
her
first
the
ball
was
arranged
with
a
view
to
the
fire
she
screamed
and
fell
into
a
swoon
oh
there
was
no
doubt
of
its
being
a
real
one
the
general
the
prince
and
i
rushed
to
her
assistance
there
were
others
even
among
the
ladies
who
helped
us
at
that
difficult
moment
we
carried
the
unhappy
woman
out
of
this
hell
to
her
carriage
but
she
only
regained
consciousness
as
she
reached
the
house
and
her
first
utterance
was
about
andrey
antonovitch
again
with
the
destruction
of
all
her
fancies
the
only
thing
left
in
her
mind
was
andrey
antonovitch
they
sent
for
a
doctor
i
remained
with
her
for
a
whole
hour
the
prince
did
so
too
the
general
in
an
access
of
generous
feeling
though
he
had
been
terribly
scared
meant
to
remain
all
night
by
the
bedside
of
the
unhappy
lady
but
within
ten
minutes
he
fell
asleep
in
an
armchair
in
the
drawingroom
while
waiting
for
the
doctor
and
there
we
left
him
the
chief
of
the
police
who
had
hurried
from
the
ball
to
the
fire
had
succeeded
in
getting
andrey
antonovitch
out
of
the
hall
after
us
and
attempted
to
put
him
into
yulia
mihailovnas
carriage
trying
all
he
could
to
persuade
his
excellency
to
seek
repose
but
i
dont
know
why
he
did
not
insist
andrey
antonovitch
of
course
would
not
hear
of
repose
and
was
set
on
going
to
the
fire
but
that
was
not
a
sufficient
reason
it
ended
in
his
taking
him
to
the
fire
in
his
droshky
he
told
us
afterwards
that
lembke
was
gesticulating
all
the
way
and
shouting
orders
that
it
was
impossible
to
obey
owing
to
their
unusualness
it
was
officially
reported
later
on
that
his
excellency
had
at
that
time
been
in
a
delirious
condition
owing
to
a
sudden
fright
there
is
no
need
to
describe
how
the
ball
ended
a
few
dozen
rowdy
fellows
and
with
them
some
ladies
remained
in
the
hall
there
were
no
police
present
they
would
not
let
the
orchestra
go
and
beat
the
musicians
who
attempted
to
leave
by
morning
they
had
pulled
all
prohoritchs
stall
to
pieces
had
drunk
themselves
senseless
danced
the
kamarinsky
in
its
unexpurgated
form
made
the
rooms
in
a
shocking
mess
and
only
towards
daybreak
part
of
this
hopelessly
drunken
rabble
reached
the
scene
of
the
fire
to
make
fresh
disturbances
there
the
other
part
spent
the
night
in
the
rooms
dead
drunk
with
disastrous
consequences
to
the
velvet
sofas
and
the
floor
next
morning
at
the
earliest
possibility
they
were
dragged
out
by
their
legs
into
the
street
so
ended
the
fte
for
the
benefit
of
the
governesses
of
our
province
iv
the
fire
frightened
the
inhabitants
of
the
riverside
just
because
it
was
evidently
a
case
of
arson
it
was
curious
that
at
the
first
cry
of
fire
another
cry
was
raised
that
the
shpigulin
men
had
done
it
it
is
now
well
known
that
three
shpigulin
men
really
did
have
a
share
in
setting
fire
to
the
town
but
that
was
all
all
the
other
factory
hands
were
completely
acquitted
not
only
officially
but
also
by
public
opinion
besides
those
three
rascals
of
whom
one
has
been
caught
and
confessed
and
the
other
two
have
so
far
escaped
fedka
the
convict
undoubtedly
had
a
hand
in
the
arson
that
is
all
that
is
known
for
certain
about
the
fire
till
now
but
when
it
comes
to
conjectures
its
a
very
different
matter
what
had
led
these
three
rascals
to
do
it
had
they
been
instigated
by
anyone
it
is
very
difficult
to
answer
all
these
questions
even
now
owing
to
the
strong
wind
the
fact
that
the
houses
at
the
riverside
were
almost
all
wooden
and
that
they
had
been
set
fire
to
in
three
places
the
fire
spread
quickly
and
enveloped
the
whole
quarter
with
extraordinary
rapidity
the
fire
burnt
however
only
at
two
ends
at
the
third
spot
it
was
extinguished
almost
as
soon
as
it
began
to
burnof
which
later
but
the
petersburg
and
moscow
papers
exaggerated
our
calamity
not
more
than
a
quarter
roughly
speaking
of
the
riverside
district
was
burnt
down
possibly
less
indeed
our
fire
brigade
though
it
was
hardly
adequate
to
the
size
and
population
of
the
town
worked
with
great
promptitude
and
devotion
but
it
would
not
have
been
of
much
avail
even
with
the
zealous
cooperation
of
the
inhabitants
if
the
wind
had
not
suddenly
dropped
towards
morning
when
an
hour
after
our
flight
from
the
ball
i
made
my
way
to
the
riverside
the
fire
was
at
its
height
a
whole
street
parallel
with
the
river
was
in
flames
it
was
as
light
as
day
i
wont
describe
the
fire
every
one
in
russia
knows
what
it
looks
like
the
bustle
and
crush
was
immense
in
the
lanes
adjoining
the
burning
street
the
inhabitants
fully
expecting
the
fire
to
reach
their
houses
were
hauling
out
their
belongings
but
had
not
yet
left
their
dwellings
and
were
waiting
meanwhile
sitting
on
their
boxes
and
feather
beds
under
their
windows
part
of
the
male
population
were
hard
at
work
ruthlessly
chopping
down
fences
and
even
whole
huts
which
were
near
the
fire
and
on
the
windward
side
none
were
crying
except
the
children
who
had
been
waked
out
of
their
sleep
though
the
women
who
had
dragged
out
their
chattels
were
lamenting
in
singsong
voices
those
who
had
not
finished
their
task
were
still
silent
busily
carrying
out
their
goods
sparks
and
embers
were
carried
a
long
way
in
all
directions
people
put
them
out
as
best
they
could
some
helped
to
put
the
fire
out
while
others
stood
about
admiring
it
a
great
fire
at
night
always
has
a
thrilling
and
exhilarating
effect
this
is
what
explains
the
attraction
of
fireworks
but
in
that
case
the
artistic
regularity
with
which
the
fire
is
presented
and
the
complete
lack
of
danger
give
an
impression
of
lightness
and
playfulness
like
the
effect
of
a
glass
of
champagne
a
real
conflagration
is
a
very
different
matter
then
the
horror
and
a
certain
sense
of
personal
danger
together
with
the
exhilarating
effect
of
a
fire
at
night
produce
on
the
spectator
though
of
course
not
in
the
householder
whose
goods
are
being
burnt
a
certain
concussion
of
the
brain
and
as
it
were
a
challenge
to
those
destructive
instincts
which
alas
lie
hidden
in
every
heart
even
that
of
the
mildest
and
most
domestic
little
clerk
this
sinister
sensation
is
almost
always
fascinating
i
really
dont
know
whether
one
can
look
at
a
fire
without
a
certain
pleasure
this
is
word
for
word
what
stepan
trofimovitch
said
to
me
one
night
on
returning
home
after
he
had
happened
to
witness
a
fire
and
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
spectacle
of
course
the
very
man
who
enjoys
the
spectacle
will
rush
into
the
fire
himself
to
save
a
child
or
an
old
woman
but
that
is
altogether
a
different
matter
following
in
the
wake
of
the
crowd
of
sightseers
i
succeeded
without
asking
questions
in
reaching
the
chief
centre
of
danger
where
at
last
i
saw
lembke
whom
i
was
seeking
at
yulia
mihailovnas
request
his
position
was
strange
and
extraordinary
he
was
standing
on
the
ruins
of
a
fence
thirty
paces
to
the
left
of
him
rose
the
black
skeleton
of
a
twostoried
house
which
had
almost
burnt
out
it
had
holes
instead
of
windows
at
each
story
its
roof
had
fallen
in
and
the
flames
were
still
here
and
there
creeping
among
the
charred
beams
at
the
farther
end
of
the
courtyard
twenty
paces
away
the
lodge
also
a
twostoried
building
was
beginning
to
burn
and
the
firemen
were
doing
their
utmost
to
save
it
on
the
right
the
firemen
and
the
people
were
trying
to
save
a
rather
large
wooden
building
which
was
not
actually
burning
though
it
had
caught
fire
several
times
and
was
inevitably
bound
to
be
burnt
in
the
end
lembke
stood
facing
the
lodge
shouting
and
gesticulating
he
was
giving
orders
which
no
one
attempted
to
carry
out
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
one
had
given
him
up
as
hopeless
and
left
him
anyway
though
every
one
in
the
vast
crowd
of
all
classes
among
whom
there
were
gentlemen
and
even
the
cathedral
priest
was
listening
to
him
with
curiosity
and
wonder
no
one
spoke
to
him
or
tried
to
get
him
away
lembke
with
a
pale
face
and
glittering
eyes
was
uttering
the
most
amazing
things
to
complete
the
picture
he
had
lost
his
hat
and
was
bareheaded
its
all
incendiarism
its
nihilism
if
anything
is
burning
its
nihilism
i
heard
almost
with
horror
and
though
there
was
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
yet
actual
madness
when
one
sees
it
always
gives
one
a
shock
your
excellency
said
a
policeman
coming
up
to
him
what
if
you
were
to
try
the
repose
of
home
its
dangerous
for
your
excellency
even
to
stand
here
this
policeman
as
i
heard
afterwards
had
been
told
off
by
the
chief
of
police
to
watch
over
andrey
antonovitch
to
do
his
utmost
to
get
him
home
and
in
case
of
danger
even
to
use
forcea
task
evidently
beyond
the
mans
power
they
will
wipe
away
the
tears
of
the
people
whose
houses
have
been
burnt
but
they
will
burn
down
the
town
its
all
the
work
of
four
scoundrels
four
and
a
half
arrest
the
scoundrel
he
worms
himself
into
the
honour
of
families
they
made
use
of
the
governesses
to
burn
down
the
houses
its
vile
vile
aie
whats
he
about
he
shouted
suddenly
noticing
a
fireman
at
the
top
of
the
burning
lodge
under
whom
the
roof
had
almost
burnt
away
and
round
whom
the
flames
were
beginning
to
flare
up
pull
him
down
pull
him
down
he
will
fall
he
will
catch
fire
put
him
out
what
is
he
doing
there
he
is
putting
the
fire
out
your
excellency
not
likely
the
fire
is
in
the
minds
of
men
and
not
in
the
roofs
of
houses
pull
him
down
and
give
it
up
better
give
it
up
much
better
let
it
put
itself
out
aie
who
is
crying
now
an
old
woman
its
an
old
woman
shouting
why
have
they
forgotten
the
old
woman
there
actually
was
an
old
woman
crying
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
burning
lodge
she
was
an
old
creature
of
eighty
a
relation
of
the
shopkeeper
who
owned
the
house
but
she
had
not
been
forgotten
she
had
gone
back
to
the
burning
house
while
it
was
still
possible
with
the
insane
idea
of
rescuing
her
feather
bed
from
a
corner
room
which
was
still
untouched
choking
with
the
smoke
and
screaming
with
the
heat
for
the
room
was
on
fire
by
the
time
she
reached
it
she
was
still
trying
with
her
decrepit
hands
to
squeeze
her
feather
bed
through
a
broken
window
pane
lembke
rushed
to
her
assistance
every
one
saw
him
run
up
to
the
window
catch
hold
of
one
corner
of
the
feather
bed
and
try
with
all
his
might
to
pull
it
out
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
a
board
fell
at
that
moment
from
the
roof
and
hit
the
unhappy
governor
it
did
not
kill
him
it
merely
grazed
him
on
the
neck
as
it
fell
but
andrey
antonovitchs
career
was
over
among
us
at
least
the
blow
knocked
him
off
his
feet
and
he
sank
on
the
ground
unconscious
the
day
dawned
at
last
gloomy
and
sullen
the
fire
was
abating
the
wind
was
followed
by
a
sudden
calm
and
then
a
fine
drizzling
rain
fell
i
was
by
that
time
in
another
part
some
distance
from
where
lembke
had
fallen
and
here
i
overheard
very
strange
conversations
in
the
crowd
a
strange
fact
had
come
to
light
on
the
very
outskirts
of
the
quarter
on
a
piece
of
waste
land
beyond
the
kitchen
gardens
not
less
than
fifty
paces
from
any
other
buildings
there
stood
a
little
wooden
house
which
had
only
lately
been
built
and
this
solitary
house
had
been
on
fire
at
the
very
beginning
almost
before
any
other
even
had
it
burnt
down
it
was
so
far
from
other
houses
that
no
other
building
in
the
town
could
have
caught
fire
from
it
and
vice
versa
if
the
whole
riverside
had
been
burnt
to
the
ground
that
house
might
have
remained
intact
whatever
the
wind
had
been
it
followed
that
it
had
caught
fire
separately
and
independently
and
therefore
not
accidentally
but
the
chief
point
was
that
it
was
not
burnt
to
the
ground
and
at
daybreak
strange
things
were
discovered
within
it
the
owner
of
this
new
house
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
rushed
up
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
in
flames
and
with
the
help
of
his
neighbours
pulled
apart
a
pile
of
faggots
which
had
been
heaped
up
by
the
side
wall
and
set
fire
to
in
this
way
he
saved
the
house
but
there
were
lodgers
in
the
housethe
captain
who
was
well
known
in
the
town
his
sister
and
their
elderly
servant
and
these
three
personsthe
captain
his
sister
and
their
servanthad
been
murdered
and
apparently
robbed
in
the
night
it
was
here
that
the
chief
of
police
had
gone
while
lembke
was
rescuing
the
feather
bed
by
morning
the
news
had
spread
and
an
immense
crowd
of
all
classes
even
the
riverside
people
who
had
been
burnt
out
had
flocked
to
the
waste
land
where
the
new
house
stood
it
was
difficult
to
get
there
so
dense
was
the
crowd
i
was
told
at
once
that
the
captain
had
been
found
lying
dressed
on
the
bench
with
his
throat
cut
and
that
he
must
have
been
dead
drunk
when
he
was
killed
so
that
he
had
felt
nothing
and
he
had
bled
like
a
bull
that
his
sister
marya
timofeyevna
had
been
stabbed
all
over
with
a
knife
and
she
was
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
doorway
so
that
probably
she
had
been
awake
and
had
fought
and
struggled
with
the
murderer
the
servant
who
had
also
probably
been
awake
had
her
skull
broken
the
owner
of
the
house
said
that
the
captain
had
come
to
see
him
the
morning
before
and
that
in
his
drunken
bragging
he
had
shown
him
a
lot
of
money
as
much
as
two
hundred
roubles
the
captains
shabby
old
green
pocketbook
was
found
empty
on
the
floor
but
marya
timofeyevnas
box
had
not
been
touched
and
the
silver
setting
of
the
ikon
had
not
been
removed
either
the
captains
clothes
too
had
not
been
disturbed
it
was
evident
that
the
thief
had
been
in
a
hurry
and
was
a
man
familiar
with
the
captains
circumstances
who
had
come
only
for
money
and
knew
where
it
was
kept
if
the
owner
of
the
house
had
not
run
up
at
that
moment
the
burning
faggot
stack
would
certainly
have
set
fire
to
the
house
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
out
from
the
charred
corpses
how
they
had
died
so
the
story
was
told
one
other
fact
was
added
that
the
person
who
had
taken
this
house
for
the
lebyadkins
was
no
other
than
mr
stavrogin
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
the
son
of
varvara
petrovna
he
had
come
himself
to
take
it
and
had
had
much
ado
to
persuade
the
owner
to
let
it
as
the
latter
had
intended
to
use
it
as
a
tavern
but
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
was
ready
to
give
any
rent
he
asked
and
had
paid
for
six
months
in
advance
the
fire
wasnt
an
accident
i
heard
said
in
the
crowd
but
the
majority
said
nothing
peoples
faces
were
sullen
but
i
did
not
see
signs
of
much
indignation
people
persisted
however
in
gossiping
about
stavrogin
saying
that
the
murdered
woman
was
his
wife
that
on
the
previous
day
he
had
dishonourably
abducted
a
young
lady
belonging
to
the
best
family
in
the
place
the
daughter
of
madame
drozdov
and
that
a
complaint
was
to
be
lodged
against
him
in
petersburg
and
that
his
wife
had
been
murdered
evidently
that
he
might
marry
the
young
lady
skvoreshniki
was
not
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
away
and
i
remember
i
wondered
whether
i
should
not
let
them
know
the
position
of
affairs
i
did
not
notice
however
that
there
was
anyone
egging
the
crowd
on
and
i
dont
want
to
accuse
people
falsely
though
i
did
see
and
recognised
at
once
in
the
crowd
at
the
fire
two
or
three
of
the
rowdy
lot
i
had
seen
in
the
refreshmentroom
i
particularly
remember
one
thin
tall
fellow
a
cabinetmaker
as
i
found
out
later
with
an
emaciated
face
and
a
curly
head
black
as
though
grimed
with
soot
he
was
not
drunk
but
in
contrast
to
the
gloomy
passivity
of
the
crowd
seemed
beside
himself
with
excitement
he
kept
addressing
the
people
though
i
dont
remember
his
words
nothing
coherent
that
he
said
was
longer
than
i
say
lads
what
do
you
say
to
this
are
things
to
go
on
like
this
and
so
saying
he
waved
his
arms

from
the
large
ballroom
of

the

in
which
the
last
interview
with
varvara

and
stepan
trofimovitch
had
taken
place
the

after
five
in
the
morning

standing
at

very
smart
light
green
dress
covered
with
lace
but
crushed
and
put
on
carelessly
and
with
haste
suddenly
noticing
that
some
of
the
hooks
were
undone
in
front
she
flushed
hurriedly
set
it
right
snatched
up
from
a
chair
the
red
shawl
she
had
flung
down
when
she
came
in
the
day
before
and
put
it
round
her
neck
some
locks
of
her
luxuriant
hair
had
come
loose
and
showed
below
the
shawl
on
her
right
shoulder
her
face
looked
weary
and
careworn
but
her
eyes
glowed
under
her
frowning
brows
she
went
up
to
the
window
again
and
pressed
her
burning
forehead
against
the
cold
pane
the
door
opened
and
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
came
in
ive
sent
a
messenger
on
horseback
he
said
in
ten
minutes
we
shall
hear
all
about
it
meantime
the
servants
say
that
part
of
the
riverside
quarter
has
been
burnt
down
on
the
right
side
of
the
bridge
near
the
quay
its
been
burning
since
eleven
oclock
now
the
fire
is
going
down
he
did
not
go
near
the
window
but
stood
three
steps
behind
her
she
did
not
turn
towards
him
it
ought
to
have
been
light
an
hour
ago
by
the
calendar
and
its
still
almost
night
she
said
irritably
calendars
always
tell
lies
he
observed
with
a
polite
smile
but
a
little
ashamed
he
made
haste
to
add
its
dull
to
live
by
the
calendar
liza
and
he
relapsed
into
silence
vexed
at
the
ineptitude
of
the
second
sentence
liza
gave
a
wry
smile
you
are
in
such
a
melancholy
mood
that
you
cannot
even
find
words
to
speak
to
me
but
you
need
not
trouble
theres
a
point
in
what
you
said
i
always
live
by
the
calendar
every
step
i
take
is
regulated
by
the
calendar
does
that
surprise
you
she
turned
quickly
from
the
window
and
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
you
sit
down
too
please
we
havent
long
to
be
together
and
i
want
to
say
anything
i
like
why
shouldnt
you
too
say
anything
you
like
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
sat
beside
her
and
softly
almost
timidly
took
her
hand
whats
the
meaning
of
this
tone
liza
where
has
it
suddenly
sprung
from
what
do
you
mean
by
we
havent
long
to
be
together
thats
the
second
mysterious
phrase
since
you
waked
half
an
hour
ago
you
are
beginning
to
reckon
up
my
mysterious
phrases
she
laughed
do
you
remember
i
told
you
i
was
a
dead
woman
when
i
came
in
yesterday
that
you
thought
fit
to
forget
to
forget
or
not
to
notice
i
dont
remember
liza
why
dead
you
must
live
and
is
that
all
youve
quite
lost
your
flow
of
words
ive
lived
my
hour
and
thats
enough
do
you
remember
christopher
ivanovitch
no
i
dont
he
answered
frowning
christopher
ivanovitch
at
lausanne
he
bored
you
dreadfully
he
always
used
to
open
the
door
and
say
ive
come
for
one
minute
and
then
stay
the
whole
day
i
dont
want
to
be
like
christopher
ivanovitch
and
stay
the
whole
day
a
look
of
pain
came
into
his
face
liza
it
grieves
me
this
unnatural
language
this
affectation
must
hurt
you
too
whats
it
for
whats
the
object
of
it
his
eyes
glowed
liza
he
cried
i
swear
i
love
you
now
more
than
yesterday
when
you
came
to
me
what
a
strange
declaration
why
bring
in
yesterday
and
today
and
these
comparisons
you
wont
leave
me
he
went
on
almost
with
despair
we
will
go
away
together
today
wont
we
wont
we
aie
dont
squeeze
my
hand
so
painfully
where
could
we
go
together
today
to
rise
again
somewhere
no
weve
made
experiments
enough
and
its
too
slow
for
me
and
i
am
not
fit
for
it
its
too
exalted
for
me
if
we
are
to
go
let
it
be
to
moscow
to
pay
visits
and
entertainthats
my
ideal
you
know
even
in
switzerland
i
didnt
disguise
from
you
what
i
was
like
as
we
cant
go
to
moscow
and
pay
visits
since
you
are
married
its
no
use
talking
of
that
liza
what
happened
yesterday
what
happened
is
over
thats
impossible
thats
cruel
what
if
it
is
cruel
you
must
bear
it
if
it
is
cruel
you
are
avenging
yourself
on
me
for
yesterdays
caprice
he
muttered
with
an
angry
smile
liza
flushed
what
a
mean
thought
why
then
did
you
bestow
on
me
so
great
a
happiness
have
i
the
right
to
know
no
you
must
manage
without
rights
dont
aggravate
the
meanness
of
your
supposition
by
stupidity
you
are
not
lucky
today
by
the
way
you
surely
cant
be
afraid
of
public
opinion
and
that
you
will
be
blamed
for
this
great
happiness
if
thats
it
for
gods
sake
dont
alarm
yourself
its
not
your
doing
at
all
and
you
are
not
responsible
to
anyone
when
i
opened
your
door
yesterday
you
didnt
even
know
who
was
coming
in
it
was
simply
my
caprice
as
you
expressed
it
just
now
and
nothing
more
you
can
look
every
one
in
the
face
boldly
and
triumphantly
your
words
that
laugh
have
been
making
me
feel
cold
with
horror
for
the
last
hour
that
happiness
of
which
you
speak
frantically
is
worth
everything
to
me
how
can
i
lose
you
now
i
swear
i
loved
you
less
yesterday
why
are
you
taking
everything
from
me
today
do
you
know
what
it
has
cost
me
this
new
hope
ive
paid
for
it
with
life
your
own
life
or
anothers
he
got
up
quickly
what
does
that
mean
he
brought
out
looking
at
her
steadily
have
you
paid
for
it
with
your
life
or
with
mine
is
what
i
mean
or
have
you
lost
all
power
of
understanding
cried
liza
flushing
why
did
you
start
up
so
suddenly
why
do
you
stare
at
me
with
such
a
look
you
frighten
me
what
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
all
the
time
i
noticed
some
time
ago
that
you
were
afraid
and
you
are
now
this
very
minute
good
heavens
how
pale
you
are
if
you
know
anything
liza
i
swear
i
dont
and
i
wasnt
talking
of
that
just
now
when
i
said
that
i
had
paid
for
it
with
life
i
dont
understand
you
she
brought
out
faltering
apprehensively
at
last
a
slow
brooding
smile
came
on
to
his
lips
he
slowly
sat
down
put
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
a
bad
dream
and
delirium
we
were
talking
of
two
different
things
i
dont
know
what
you
were
talking
about
do
you
mean
to
say
you
did
not
know
yesterday
that
i
should
leave
you
today
did
you
know
or
not
dont
tell
a
lie
did
you
or
not
i
did
he
said
softly
well
then
what
would
you
have
you
knew
and
yet
you
accepted
that
moment
for
yourself
arent
we
quits
tell
me
the
whole
truth
he
cried
in
intense
distress
when
you
opened
my
door
yesterday
did
you
know
yourself
that
it
was
only
for
one
hour
she
looked
at
him
with
hatred
really
the
most
sensible
person
can
ask
most
amazing
questions
and
why
are
you
so
uneasy
can
it
be
vanity
that
a
woman
should
leave
you
first
instead
of
your
leaving
her
do
you
know
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
since
ive
been
with
you
ive
discovered
that
you
are
very
generous
to
me
and
its
just
that
i
cant
endure
from
you
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
took
a
few
steps
about
the
room
very
well
perhaps
it
was
bound
to
end
so
but
how
can
it
all
have
happened
thats
a
question
to
worry
about
especially
as
you
know
the
answer
yourself
perfectly
well
and
understand
it
better
than
anyone
on
earth
and
were
counting
on
it
yourself
i
am
a
young
lady
my
heart
has
been
trained
on
the
opera
thats
how
it
all
began
thats
the
solution
no
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
fret
your
vanity
it
is
all
the
absolute
truth
it
began
with
a
fine
moment
which
was
too
much
for
me
to
bear
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
insulted
you
before
every
one
and
you
answered
me
so
chivalrously
i
went
home
and
guessed
at
once
that
you
were
running
away
from
me
because
you
were
married
and
not
from
contempt
for
me
which
as
a
fashionable
young
lady
i
dreaded
more
than
anything
i
understood
that
it
was
for
my
sake
for
me
mad
as
i
was
that
you
ran
away
you
see
how
i
appreciate
your
generosity
then
pyotr
stepanovitch
skipped
up
to
me
and
explained
it
all
to
me
at
once
he
revealed
to
me
that
you
were
dominated
by
a
great
idea
before
which
he
and
i
were
as
nothing
but
yet
that
i
was
a
stumblingblock
in
your
path
he
brought
himself
in
he
insisted
that
we
three
should
work
together
and
said
the
most
fantastic
things
about
a
boat
and
about
maplewood
oars
out
of
some
russian
song
i
complimented
him
and
told
him
he
was
a
poet
which
he
swallowed
as
the
real
thing
and
as
apart
from
him
i
had
known
long
before
that
i
had
not
the
strength
to
do
anything
for
long
i
made
up
my
mind
on
the
spot
well
thats
all
and
quite
enough
and
please
let
us
have
no
more
explanations
we
might
quarrel
dont
be
afraid
of
anyone
i
take
it
all
on
myself
i
am
horrid
and
capricious
i
was
fascinated
by
that
operatic
boat
i
am
a
young
lady
but
you
know
i
did
think
that
you
were
dreadfully
in
love
with
me
dont
despise
the
poor
fool
and
dont
laugh
at
the
tear
that
dropped
just
now
i
am
awfully
given
to
crying
with
selfpity
come
thats
enough
thats
enough
i
am
no
good
for
anything
and
you
are
no
good
for
anything
its
as
bad
for
both
of
us
so
lets
comfort
ourselves
with
that
anyway
it
eases
our
vanity
dream
and
delirium
cried
stavrogin
wringing
his
hands
and
pacing
about
the
room
liza
poor
child
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
ive
burnt
myself
in
a
candle
nothing
more
surely
you
are
not
crying
too
you
should
show
less
feeling
and
better
breeding
why
why
did
you
come
to
me
dont
you
understand
what
a
ludicrous
position
you
put
yourself
in
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
by
asking
such
questions
why
have
you
ruined
yourself
so
grotesquely
and
so
stupidly
and
whats
to
be
done
now
and
this
is
stavrogin
the
vampire
stavrogin
as
you
are
called
by
a
lady
here
who
is
in
love
with
you
listen
i
have
told
you
already
ive
put
all
my
life
into
one
hour
and
i
am
at
peace
do
the
same
with
yours
though
youve
no
need
to
you
have
plenty
of
hours
and
moments
of
all
sorts
before
you
as
many
as
you
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
not
one
hour
more
than
you
he
was
still
walking
up
and
down
and
did
not
see
the
rapid
penetrating
glance
she
turned
upon
him
in
which
there
seemed
a
dawning
hope
but
the
light
died
away
at
the
same
moment
if
you
knew
what
it
costs
me
that
i
cant
be
sincere
at
this
moment
liza
if
i
could
only
tell
you
tell
me
you
want
to
tell
me
something
to
me
god
save
me
from
your
secrets
she
broke
in
almost
in
terror
he
stopped
and
waited
uneasily
i
ought
to
confess
that
ever
since
those
days
in
switzerland
i
have
had
a
strong
feeling
that
you
have
something
awful
loathsome
some
bloodshed
on
your
conscience
and
yet
something
that
would
make
you
look
very
ridiculous
beware
of
telling
me
if
its
true
i
shall
laugh
you
to
scorn
i
shall
laugh
at
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life
aie
you
are
turning
pale
again
i
wont
i
wont
ill
go
at
once
she
jumped
up
from
her
chair
with
a
movement
of
disgust
and
contempt
torture
me
punish
me
vent
your
spite
on
me
he
cried
in
despair
you
have
the
full
right
i
knew
i
did
not
love
you
and
yet
i
ruined
you
yes
i
accepted
the
moment
for
my
own
i
had
a
hope
ive
had
it
a
long
time
my
last
hope
i
could
not
resist
the
radiance
that
flooded
my
heart
when
you
came
in
to
me
yesterday
of
yourself
alone
of
your
own
accord
i
suddenly
believed
perhaps
i
have
faith
in
it
still
i
will
repay
such
noble
frankness
by
being
as
frank
i
dont
want
to
be
a
sister
of
mercy
for
you
perhaps
i
really
may
become
a
nurse
unless
i
happen
appropriately
to
die
today
but
if
i
do
i
wont
be
your
nurse
though
of
course
you
need
one
as
much
as
any
crippled
creature
i
always
fancied
that
you
would
take
me
to
some
place
where
there
was
a
huge
wicked
spider
big
as
a
man
and
we
should
spend
our
lives
looking
at
it
and
being
afraid
of
it
thats
how
our
love
would
spend
itself
appeal
to
dashenka
she
will
go
with
you
anywhere
you
like
cant
you
help
thinking
of
her
even
now
poor
little
spaniel
give
her
my
greetings
does
she
know
that
even
in
switzerland
you
had
fixed
on
her
for
your
old
age
what
prudence
what
foresight
aie
whos
that
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
a
door
opened
a
crack
a
head
was
thrust
in
and
vanished
again
hurriedly
is
that
you
alexey
yegorytch
asked
stavrogin
no
its
only
i
pyotr
stepanovitch
thrust
himself
half
in
again
how
do
you
do
lizaveta
nikolaevna
good
morning
anyway
i
guessed
i
should
find
you
both
in
this
room
i
have
come
for
one
moment
literally
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
i
was
anxious
to
have
a
couple
of
words
with
you
at
all
costs
absolutely
necessary
only
a
few
words
stavrogin
moved
towards
him
but
turned
back
to
liza
at
the
third
step
if
you
hear
anything
directly
liza
let
me
tell
you
i
am
to
blame
for
it
she
started
and
looked
at
him
in
dismay
but
he
hurriedly
went
out
ii
the
room
from
which
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
peeped
in
was
a
large
oval
vestibule
alexey
yegorytch
had
been
sitting
there
before
pyotr
stepanovitch
came
in
but
the
latter
sent
him
away
stavrogin
closed
the
door
after
him
and
stood
expectant
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
rapidly
and
searchingly
at
him
well
if
you
know
already
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
hurriedly
his
eyes
looking
as
though
they
would
dive
into
stavrogins
soul
then
of
course
we
are
none
of
us
to
blame
above
all
not
you
for
its
such
a
concatenation
such
a
coincidence
of
events
in
brief
you
cant
be
legally
implicated
and
ive
rushed
here
to
tell
you
so
beforehand
have
they
been
burnt
murdered
murdered
but
not
burnt
thats
the
trouble
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
its
not
been
my
fault
however
much
you
may
suspect
me
eh
do
you
want
the
whole
truth
you
see
the
idea
really
did
cross
my
mindyou
hinted
it
yourself
not
seriously
but
teasing
me
for
of
course
you
would
not
hint
it
seriously
but
i
couldnt
bring
myself
to
it
and
wouldnt
bring
myself
to
it
for
anything
not
for
a
hundred
roublesand
what
was
there
to
be
gained
by
it
i
mean
for
me
for
me
he
was
in
desperate
haste
and
his
talk
was
like
the
clacking
of
a
rattle
but
what
a
coincidence
of
circumstances
i
gave
that
drunken
fool
lebyadkin
two
hundred
and
thirty
roubles
of
my
own
money
do
you
hear
my
own
money
there
wasnt
a
rouble
of
yours
and
whats
more
you
know
it
yourself
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
eveningdo
you
hear
not
yesterday
after
the
matine
but
the
day
before
yesterday
make
a
note
of
it
its
a
very
important
coincidence
for
i
did
not
know
for
certain
at
that
time
whether
lizaveta
nikolaevna
would
come
to
you
or
not
i
gave
my
own
money
simply
because
you
distinguished
yourself
by
taking
it
into
your
head
to
betray
your
secret
to
every
one
well
i
wont
go
into
that
thats
your
affair
your
chivalry
but
i
must
own
i
was
amazed
it
was
a
knockdown
blow
and
forasmuch
as
i
was
exceeding
weary
of
these
tragic
storiesand
let
me
tell
you
i
talk
seriously
though
i
do
use
biblical
languageas
it
was
all
upsetting
my
plans
in
fact
i
made
up
my
mind
at
any
cost
and
without
your
knowledge
to
pack
the
lebyadkins
off
to
petersburg
especially
as
he
was
set
on
going
himself
i
made
one
mistake
i
gave
the
money
in
your
namewas
it
a
mistake
or
not
perhaps
it
wasnt
a
mistake
eh
listen
now
listen
how
it
has
all
turned
out
in
the
heat
of
his
talk
he
went
close
up
to
stavrogin
and
took
hold
of
the
revers
of
his
coat
really
it
may
have
been
on
purpose
with
a
violent
movement
stavrogin
struck
him
on
the
arm
come
what
is
it
give
over
youll
break
my
arm
what
matters
is
the
way
things
have
turned
out
he
rattled
on
not
in
the
least
surprised
at
the
blow
i
forked
out
the
money
in
the
evening
on
condition
that
his
sister
and
he
should
set
off
early
next
morning
i
trusted
that
rascal
liputin
with
the
job
of
getting
them
into
the
train
and
seeing
them
off
but
that
beast
liputin
wanted
to
play
his
schoolboy
pranks
on
the
publicperhaps
you
heard
at
the
matine
listen
listen
they
both
got
drunk
made
up
verses
of
which
half
are
liputins
he
rigged
lebyadkin
out
in
a
dresscoat
assuring
me
meanwhile
that
he
had
packed
him
off
that
morning
but
he
kept
him
shut
somewhere
in
a
back
room
till
he
thrust
him
on
the
platform
at
the
matine
but
lebyadkin
got
drunk
quickly
and
unexpectedly
then
came
the
scandalous
scene
you
know
of
and
then
they
got
him
home
more
dead
than
alive
and
liputin
filched
away
the
two
hundred
roubles
leaving
him
only
small
change
but
it
appears
unluckily
that
already
that
morning
lebyadkin
had
taken
that
two
hundred
roubles
out
of
his
pocket
boasted
of
it
and
shown
it
in
undesirable
quarters
and
as
that
was
just
what
fedka
was
expecting
and
as
he
had
heard
something
at
kirillovs
do
you
remember
your
hint
he
made
up
his
mind
to
take
advantage
of
it
thats
the
whole
truth
i
am
glad
anyway
that
fedka
did
not
find
the
money
the
rascal
was
reckoning
on
a
thousand
you
know
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
seems
to
have
been
frightened
by
the
fire
himself
would
you
believe
it
that
fire
came
as
a
thunderbolt
for
me
devil
only
knows
what
to
make
of
it
it
is
taking
things
into
their
own
hands
you
see
as
i
expect
so
much
of
you
i
will
hide
nothing
from
you
ive
long
been
hatching
this
idea
of
a
fire
because
it
suits
the
national
and
popular
taste
but
i
was
keeping
it
for
a
critical
moment
for
that
precious
time
when
we
should
all
rise
up
and
and
they
suddenly
took
it
into
their
heads
to
do
it
on
their
own
initiative
without
orders
now
at
the
very
moment
when
we
ought
to
be
lying
low
and
keeping
quiet
such
presumption
the
fact
is
ive
not
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
yet
they
talk
about
two
shpigulin
men
but
if
there
are
any
of
our
fellows
in
it
if
any
one
of
them
has
had
a
hand
in
itso
much
the
worse
for
him
you
see
what
comes
of
letting
people
get
ever
so
little
out
of
hand
no
this
democratic
rabble
with
its
quintets
is
a
poor
foundation
what
we
want
is
one
magnificent
despotic
will
like
an
idol
resting
on
something
fundamental
and
external
then
the
quintets
will
cringe
into
obedience
and
be
obsequiously
ready
on
occasion
but
anyway
though
they
are
all
crying
out
now
that
stavrogin
wanted
his
wife
to
be
burnt
and
that
thats
what
caused
the
fire
in
the
town
but
why
are
they
all
saying
that
well
not
yet
and
i
must
confess
i
have
heard
nothing
of
the
sort
but
what
one
can
do
with
people
especially
when
theyve
been
burnt
out
vox
populi
vox
dei
a
stupid
rumour
is
soon
set
going
but
you
really
have
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
from
the
legal
point
of
view
you
are
all
right
and
with
your
conscience
also
for
you
didnt
want
it
done
did
you
theres
no
clue
nothing
but
the
coincidence
the
only
thing
is
fedka
may
remember
what
you
said
that
night
at
kirillovs
and
what
made
you
say
it
but
that
proves
nothing
and
we
shall
stop
fedkas
mouth
i
shall
stop
it
today
and
werent
the
bodies
burnt
at
all
not
a
bit
that
ruffian
could
not
manage
anything
properly
but
i
am
glad
anyway
that
you
are
so
calm
for
though
you
are
not
in
any
way
to
blame
even
in
thought
but
all
the
same
and
you
must
admit
that
all
this
settles
your
difficulties
capitally
you
are
suddenly
free
and
a
widower
and
can
marry
a
charming
girl
this
minute
with
a
lot
of
money
who
is
already
yours
into
the
bargain
see
what
can
be
done
by
crude
simple
coincidenceeh
are
you
threatening
me
you
fool
come
leave
off
leave
off
here
you
are
calling
me
a
fool
and
what
a
tone
to
use
you
ought
to
be
glad
yet
you
i
rushed
here
on
purpose
to
let
you
know
in
good
time
besides
how
could
i
threaten
you
as
if
i
cared
for
what
i
could
get
by
threats
i
want
you
to
help
from
goodwill
and
not
from
fear
you
are
the
light
and
the
sun
its
i
who
am
terribly
afraid
of
you
not
you
of
me
i
am
not
mavriky
nikolaevitch
and
only
fancy
as
i
flew
here
in
a
racing
droshky
i
saw
mavriky
nikolaevitch
by
the
fence
at
the
farthest
corner
of
your
garden
in
his
greatcoat
drenched
through
he
must
have
been
sitting
there
all
night
queer
goings
on
how
mad
people
can
be
mavriky
nikolaevitch
is
that
true
yes
yes
he
is
sitting
by
the
garden
fence
about
three
hundred
paces
from
here
i
think
i
made
haste
to
pass
him
but
he
saw
me
didnt
you
know
in
that
case
i
am
glad
i
didnt
forget
to
tell
you
a
man
like
that
is
more
dangerous
than
anyone
if
he
happens
to
have
a
revolver
about
him
and
then
the
night
the
sleet
or
natural
irritabilityfor
after
all
he
is
in
a
nice
position
ha
ha
what
do
you
think
why
is
he
sitting
there
he
is
waiting
for
lizaveta
nikolaevna
of
course
well
why
should
she
go
out
to
him
and
in
such
rain
too
what
a
fool
she
is
just
going
out
to
him
eh
thats
a
piece
of
news
so
then
but
listen
her
position
is
completely
changed
now
what
does
she
want
with
mavriky
now
you
are
free
a
widower
and
can
marry
her
tomorrow
she
doesnt
know
yetleave
it
to
me
and
ill
arrange
it
all
for
you
where
is
she
we
must
relieve
her
mind
too
relieve
her
mind
rather
lets
go
and
do
you
suppose
she
wont
guess
what
those
dead
bodies
mean
said
stavrogin
screwing
up
his
eyes
in
a
peculiar
way
of
course
she
wont
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
with
all
the
confidence
of
a
perfect
simpleton
for
legally
ech
what
a
man
you
are
what
if
she
did
guess
women
are
so
clever
at
shutting
their
eyes
to
such
things
you
dont
understand
women
apart
from
its
being
altogether
to
her
interest
to
marry
you
now
because
theres
no
denying
shes
disgraced
herself
apart
from
that
i
talked
to
her
of
the
boat
and
i
saw
that
one
could
affect
her
by
it
so
that
shows
you
what
the
girl
is
made
of
dont
be
uneasy
she
will
step
over
those
dead
bodies
without
turning
a
hairespecially
as
you
are
not
to
blame
for
them
not
in
the
least
are
you
she
will
only
keep
them
in
reserve
to
use
them
against
you
when
youve
been
married
two
or
three
years
every
woman
saves
up
something
of
the
sort
out
of
her
husbands
past
when
she
gets
married
but
by
that
time
what
may
not
happen
in
a
year
ha
ha
if
youve
come
in
a
racing
droshky
take
her
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
now
she
said
just
now
that
she
could
not
endure
me
and
would
leave
me
and
she
certainly
will
not
accept
my
carriage
what
can
she
really
be
leaving
how
can
this
have
come
about
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
staring
stupidly
at
him
shes
guessed
somehow
during
this
night
that
i
dont
love
her
which
she
knew
all
along
indeed
but
dont
you
love
her
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
with
an
expression
of
extreme
surprise
if
so
why
did
you
keep
her
when
she
came
to
you
yesterday
instead
of
telling
her
plainly
like
an
honourable
man
that
you
didnt
care
for
her
that
was
horribly
shabby
on
your
part
and
how
mean
you
make
me
look
in
her
eyes
stavrogin
suddenly
laughed
i
am
laughing
at
my
monkey
he
explained
at
once
ah
you
saw
that
i
was
putting
it
on
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
laughing
too
with
great
enjoyment
i
did
it
to
amuse
you
only
fancy
as
soon
as
you
came
out
to
me
i
guessed
from
your
face
that
youd
been
unlucky
a
complete
fiasco
perhaps
eh
there
ill
bet
anything
he
cried
almost
gasping
with
delight
that
youve
been
sitting
side
by
side
in
the
drawingroom
all
night
wasting
your
precious
time
discussing
something
lofty
and
elevated
there
forgive
me
forgive
me
its
not
my
business
i
felt
sure
yesterday
that
it
would
all
end
in
foolishness
i
brought
her
to
you
simply
to
amuse
you
and
to
show
you
that
you
wouldnt
have
a
dull
time
with
me
i
shall
be
of
use
to
you
a
hundred
times
in
that
way
i
always
like
pleasing
people
if
you
dont
want
her
now
which
was
what
i
was
reckoning
on
when
i
came
then
so
you
brought
her
simply
for
my
amusement
why
what
else
not
to
make
me
kill
my
wife
come
youve
not
killed
her
what
a
tragic
fellow
you
are
its
just
the
same
you
killed
her
i
didnt
kill
her
i
tell
you
i
had
no
hand
in
it
you
are
beginning
to
make
me
uneasy
though
go
on
you
said
if
you
dont
want
her
now
then

then
leave
it
to
me
of
course
i
can
quite
easily
marry
her
off
to
mavriky
nikolaevitch
though
i
didnt
make
him
sit
down
by
the
fence
dont
take
that
notion
into
your
head
i
am
afraid
of
him
now
you
talk
about
my
droshky
but
i
simply
dashed
by
what
if
he
has
a
revolver
its
a
good
thing
i
brought
mine
here
it
is
he
brought
a
revolver
out
of
his
pocket
showed
it
and
hid
it
again
at
once
i
took
it
as
i
was
coming
such
a
long
way
but
ill
arrange
all
that
for
you
in
a
twinkling
her
little
heart
is
aching
at
this
moment
for
mavriky
it
should
be
anyway
and
do
you
know
i
am
really
rather
sorry
for
her
if
i
take
her
to
mavriky
she
will
begin
about
you
directly
she
will
praise
you
to
him
and
abuse
him
to
his
face
you
know
the
heart
of
woman
there
you
are
laughing
again
i
am
awfully
glad
that
you
are
so
cheerful
now
come
lets
go
ill
begin
with
mavriky
right
away
and
about
them
those
whove
been
murdered
hadnt
we
better
keep
quiet
now
shell
hear
later
on
anyway
what
will
she
hear
whos
been
murdered
what
were
you
saying
about
mavriky
nikolaevitch
said
liza
suddenly
opening
the
door
ah
youve
been
listening
what
were
you
saying
just
now
about
mavriky
nikolaevitch
has
he
been
murdered
ah
then
you
didnt
hear
dont
distress
yourself
mavriky
nikolaevitch
is
alive
and
well
and
you
can
satisfy
yourself
of
it
in
an
instant
for
he
is
here
by
the
wayside
by
the
garden
fence
and
i
believe
hes
been
sitting
there
all
night
he
is
drenched
through
in
his
greatcoat
he
saw
me
as
i
drove
past
thats
not
true
you
said
murdered
whos
been
murdered
she
insisted
with
agonising
mistrust
the
only
people
who
have
been
murdered
are
my
wife
her
brother
lebyadkin
and
their
servant
stavrogin
brought
out
firmly
liza
trembled
and
turned
terribly
pale
a
strange
brutal
outrage
lizaveta
nikolaevna
a
simple
case
of
robbery
pyotr
stepanovitch
rattled
off
at
once
simply
robbery
under
cover
of
the
fire
the
crime
was
committed
by
fedka
the
convict
and
it
was
all
that
fool
lebyadkins
fault
for
showing
every
one
his
money
i
rushed
here
with
the
news
it
fell
on
me
like
a
thunderbolt
stavrogin
could
hardly
stand
when
i
told
him
we
were
deliberating
here
whether
to
tell
you
at
once
or
not
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
is
he
telling
the
truth
liza
articulated
faintly
no
its
false
false
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
starting
what
do
you
mean
by
that
heavens
i
shall
go
mad
cried
liza
do
you
understand
anyway
that
he
is
mad
now
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
at
the
top
of
his
voice
after
all
his
wife
has
just
been
murdered
you
see
how
white
he
is
why
he
has
been
with
you
the
whole
night
he
hasnt
left
your
side
a
minute
how
can
you
suspect
him
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
tell
me
as
before
god
are
you
guilty
or
not
and
i
swear
ill
believe
your
word
as
though
it
were
gods
and
ill
follow
you
to
the
end
of
the
earth
yes
i
will
ill
follow
you
like
a
dog
why
are
you
tormenting
her
you
fantastic
creature
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
in
exasperation
lizaveta
nikolaevna
upon
my
oath
you
can
crush
me
into
powder
but
he
is
not
guilty
on
the
contrary
it
has
crushed
him
and
he
is
raving
you
see
that
he
is
not
to
blame
in
any
way
not
in
any
way
not
even
in
thought
its
all
the
work
of
robbers
who
will
probably
be
found
within
a
week
and
flogged
its
all
the
work
of
fedka
the
convict
and
some
shpigulin
men
all
the
town
is
agog
with
it
thats
why
i
say
so
too
is
that
right
is
that
right
liza
waited
trembling
for
her
final
sentence
i
did
not
kill
them
and
i
was
against
it
but
i
knew
they
were
going
to
be
killed
and
i
did
not
stop
the
murderers
leave
me
liza
stavrogin
brought
out
and
he
walked
into
the
drawingroom
liza
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
walked
out
of
the
house
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
rushing
after
her
but
at
once
hurried
back
and
went
into
the
drawingroom
so
thats
your
line
thats
your
line
so
theres
nothing
you
are
afraid
of
he
flew
at
stavrogin
in
an
absolute
fury
muttering
incoherently
scarcely
able
to
find
words
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
stavrogin
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
did
not
answer
a
word
he
clutched
a
lock
of
his
hair
in
his
left
hand
and
smiled
helplessly
pyotr
stepanovitch
pulled
him
violently
by
the
sleeve
is
it
all
over
with
you
so
thats
the
line
you
are
taking
youll
inform
against
all
of
us
and
go
to
a
monastery
yourself
or
to
the
devil
but
ill
do
for
you
though
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
ah
thats
you
chattering
said
stavrogin
noticing
him
at
last
run
he
said
coming
to
himself
suddenly
run
after
her
order
the
carriage
dont
leave
her
run
run
take
her
home
so
that
no
one
may
know
and
that
she
maynt
go
there
to
the
bodies
to
the
bodies
force
her
to
get
into
the
carriage
alexey
yegorytch
alexey
yegorytch
stay
dont
shout
by
now
she
is
in
mavrikys
arms
mavriky
wont
put
her
into
your
carriage
stay
theres
something
more
important
than
the
carriage
he
seized
his
revolver
again
stavrogin
looked
at
him
gravely
very
well
kill
me
he
said
softly
almost
conciliatorily
foo
damn
it
what
a
maze
of
false
sentiment
a
man
can
get
into
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
shaking
with
rage
yes
really
you
ought
to
be
killed
she
ought
simply
to
spit
at
you
fine
sort
of
magic
boat
you
are
you
are
a
brokendown
leaky
old
hulk
you
ought
to
pull
yourself
together
if
only
from
spite
ech
why
what
difference
would
it
make
to
you
since
you
ask
for
a
bullet
through
your
brains
yourself
stavrogin
smiled
strangely
if
you
were
not
such
a
buffoon
i
might
perhaps
have
said
yes
now
if
you
had
only
a
grain
of
sense
i
am
a
buffoon
but
i
dont
want
you
my
better
half
to
be
one
do
you
understand
me
stavrogin
did
understand
though
perhaps
no
one
else
did
shatov
for
instance
was
astonished
when
stavrogin
told
him
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
enthusiasm
go
to
the
devil
now
and
tomorrow
perhaps
i
may
wring
something
out
of
myself
come
tomorrow
yes
yes
how
can
i
tell
go
to
hell
go
to
hell
and
he
walked
out
of
the
room
perhaps
after
all
it
may
be
for
the
best
pyotr
stepanovitch
muttered
to
himself
as
he
hid
the
revolver
iii
he
rushed
off
to
overtake
lizaveta
nikolaevna
she
had
not
got
far
away
only
a
few
steps
from
the
house
she
had
been
detained
by
alexey
yegorytch
who
was
following
a
step
behind
her
in
a
tail
coat
and
without
a
hat
his
head
was
bowed
respectfully
he
was
persistently
entreating
her
to
wait
for
a
carriage
the
old
man
was
alarmed
and
almost
in
tears
go
along
your
master
is
asking
for
tea
and
theres
no
one
to
give
it
to
him
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
pushing
him
away
he
took
lizas
arm
she
did
not
pull
her
arm
away
but
she
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
she
was
doing
she
was
still
dazed
to
begin
with
you
are
going
the
wrong
way
babbled
pyotr
stepanovitch
we
ought
to
go
this
way
and
not
by
the
garden
and
secondly
walking
is
impossible
in
any
case
its
over
two
miles
and
you
are
not
properly
dressed
if
you
would
wait
a
second
i
came
in
a
droshky
the
horse
is
in
the
yard
ill
get
it
instantly
put
you
in
and
get
you
home
so
that
no
one
sees
you
how
kind
you
are
said
liza
graciously
oh
not
at
all
any
humane
man
in
my
position
would
do
the
same
liza
looked
at
him
and
was
surprised
good
heavens
why
i
thought
it
was
that
old
man
here
still
listen
i
am
awfully
glad
that
you
take
it
like
this
because
its
all
such
a
frightfully
stupid
convention
and
since
its
come
to
that
hadnt
i
better
tell
the
old
man
to
get
the
carriage
at
once
its
only
a
matter
of
ten
minutes
and
well
turn
back
and
wait
in
the
porch
eh
i
want
first
where
are
those
murdered
people
ah
what
next
that
was
what
i
was
afraid
of
no
wed
better
leave
those
wretched
creatures
alone
its
no
use
your
looking
at
them
i
know
where
they
are
i
know
that
house
well
what
if
you
do
know
it
come
its
raining
and
theres
a
fog
a
nice
job
this
sacred
duty
ive
taken
upon
myself
listen
lizaveta
nikolaevna
its
one
of
two
alternatives
either
you
come
with
me
in
the
droshkyin
that
case
wait
here
and
dont
take
another
step
for
if
we
go
another
twenty
steps
we
must
be
seen
by
mavriky
nikolaevitch
mavriky
nikolaevitch
where
where
well
if
you
want
to
go
with
him
ill
take
you
a
little
farther
if
you
like
and
show
you
where
he

up
to
him
just
now
no
thank
you
he
is
waiting
for
me
good
god
she
suddenly
stopped
and
a
flush
of
colour
flooded
her
face
oh
come
now
if
he
is
an
unconventional
man
you
know
lizaveta
nikolaevna
its
none
of
my
business
i
am
a
complete
outsider
and
you
know
that
yourself
but
still
i
wish
you
well
if
your
fairy
boat
has
failed
you
if
it
has
turned
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
rotten
old
hulk
only
fit
to
be
chopped
up
ah

cried
liza
lovely
and
yet
your
tears
are
falling
you
must
have
spirit
you
must
be
as
good
as
a
man
in
every
way
in
our
age
when
woman
foo
hang
it
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
on
the
point
of
spitting
and
the
chief
point
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
regret
it
may
all
turn
out
for
the
best
mavriky
nikolaevitch
is
a
man
in
fact
he
is
a
man
of
feeling
though
not
talkative
but
thats
a
good
thing
too
as
long
as
he
has
no
conventional
notions
of
course
lovely
lovely
liza
laughed
hysterically
well
hang
it
all
lizaveta

said
pyotr
stepanovitch
suddenly
piqued

a
student
in
it
a
very
wealthy
official
of
some
sort
saxe

cried
suddenly
like
a
mad
creature
come
away
come
away
to
the
woods
to
the
fields
and
she
ran
back
lizaveta
nikolaevna
this
is
such
cowardice
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
running
after
her
and
why
dont
you
want
him
to
see
you
on
the
contrary
you
must
look
him
straight
in
the
face
with
pride
if
its
some
feeling
about
that
some
maidenly
thats
such
a
prejudice
so
out
of
date
but
where
are
you
going
where
are
you
going
ech
she
is
running
better
go
back
to
stavrogins
and
take
my
droshky
where
are
you
going
thats
the
way
to
the
fields
there
shes
fallen
down
he
stopped
liza
was
flying
along
like
a
bird
not
conscious
where
she
was
going
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
already
fifty
paces
behind
her
she
stumbled
over
a
mound
of
earth
and
fell
down
at
the
same
moment
there
was
the
sound
of
a
terrible
shout
from
behind
it
came
from
mavriky
nikolaevitch
who
had
seen
her
flight
and
her
fall
and
was
running
to
her
across
the
field
in
a
flash
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
retired
into
stavrogins
gateway
to
make
haste
and
get
into
his
droshky
mavriky
nikolaevitch
was
already
standing
in
terrible
alarm
by
liza
who
had
risen
to
her
feet
he
was
bending
over
her
and
holding
her
hands
in
both
of
his
all
the
incredible
surroundings
of
this
meeting
overwhelmed
him
and
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
he
saw
the
woman
for
whom
he
had
such
reverent
devotion
running
madly
across
the
fields
at
such
an
hour
in
such
weather
with
nothing
over
her
dress
the
gay
dress
she
wore
the
day
before
now
crumpled
and
muddy
from
her
fall
he
could
not
utter
a
word
he
took
off
his
greatcoat
and
with
trembling
hands
put
it
round
her
shoulders
suddenly
he
uttered
a
cry
feeling
that
she
had
pressed
her
lips
to
his
hand
liza
he
cried
i
am
no
good
for
anything
but
dont
drive
me
away
from
you
oh
no
let
us
make
haste
away
from
here
dont
leave
me
and
seizing
his
hand
she
drew
him
after
her
mavriky
nikolaevitch
she
suddenly
dropped
her
voice
timidly
i
kept
a
bold
face
there
all
the
time
but
now
i
am
afraid
of
death
i
shall
die
soon
very
soon
but
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
to
die
she
whispered
pressing
his
hand
tight
oh
if
there
were
someone
he
looked
round
in
despair
some
passerby
you
will
get
your
feet
wet
you
will
lose
your
reason
its
all
right
its
all
right
she
tried
to
reassure
him
thats
right
i
am
not
so
frightened
with
you
hold
my
hand
lead
me
where
are
we
going
now
home
no
i
want
first
to
see
the
people
who
have
been
murdered
his
wife
has
been
murdered
they
say
and
he
says
he
killed
her
himself
but
thats
not
true
is
it
i
want
to
see
for
myself
those
three
whove
been
killed
on
my
account
its
because
of
them
his
love
for
me
has
grown
cold
since
last
night
i
shall
see
and
find
out
everything
make
haste
make
haste
i
know
the
house
theres
a
fire
there
mavriky
nikolaevitch
my
dear
one
dont
forgive
me
in
my
shame
why
forgive
me
why
are
you
crying
give
me
a
blow
and
kill
me
here
in
the
field
like
a
dog
no
one
is
your
judge
now
mavriky
nikolaevitch
pronounced
firmly
god
forgive
you
i
least
of
all
can
be
your
judge
but
it
would
be
strange
to
describe
their
conversation
and
meanwhile
they
walked
hand
in
hand
quickly
hurrying
as
though
they
were
crazy
they
were
going
straight
towards
the
fire
mavriky
nikolaevitch
still
had
hopes
of
meeting
a
cart
at
least
but
no
one
came
that
way
a
mist
of
fine
drizzling
rain
enveloped
the
whole
country
swallowing
up
every
ray
of
light
every
gleam
of
colour
and
transforming
everything
into
one
smoky
leaden
indistinguishable
mass
it
had
long
been
daylight
yet
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
still
night
and
suddenly
in
this
cold
foggy
mist
there
appeared
coming
towards
them
a
strange
and
absurd
figure
picturing
it
now
i
think
i
should
not
have
believed
my
eyes
if
i
had
been
in
lizaveta
nikolaevnas
place
yet
she
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
recognised
the
approaching
figure
at
once
it
was
stepan
trofimovitch
how
he
had
gone
off
how
the
insane
impracticable
idea
of
his
flight
came
to
be
carried
out
of
that
later
i
will
only
mention
that
he
was
in
a
fever
that
morning
yet
even
illness
did
not
prevent
his
starting
he
was
walking
resolutely
on
the
damp
ground
it
was
evident
that
he
had
planned
the
enterprise
to
the
best
of
his
ability
alone
with
his
inexperience
and
lack
of
practical
sense
he
wore
travelling
dress
that
is
a
greatcoat
with
a
wide
patentleather
belt
fastened
with
a
buckle
and
a
pair
of
new
high
boots
pulled
over
his
trousers
probably
he
had
for
some
time
past
pictured
a
traveller
as
looking
like
this
and
the
belt
and
the
high
boots
with
the
shining
tops
like
a
hussars
in
which
he
could
hardly
walk
had
been
ready
some
time
before
a
broadbrimmed
hat
a
knitted
scarf
twisted
close
round
his
neck
a
stick
in
his
right
hand
and
an
exceedingly
small
but
extremely
tightly
packed
bag
in
his
left
completed
his
getup
he
had
besides
in
the
same
right
hand
an
open
umbrella
these
three
objectsthe
umbrella
the
stick
and
the
baghad
been
very
awkward
to
carry
for
the
first
mile
and
had
begun
to
be
heavy
by
the
second
can
it
really
be
you
cried
liza
looking
at
him
with
distressed
wonder
after
her
first
rush
of
instinctive
gladness
lise
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
rushing
to
her
almost
in
delirium
too
chre
chre
can
you
be
out
too
in
such
a
fog
you
see
the
glow
of
fire

tell
me
but

question
me

and
let
us
be
free
forever
to
be
quit
of
the
world
and
be
completely
free
il

pardonner
et

but
why
are
you
kneeling
down
because
taking
leave
of
the
world
i
want
to
take
leave
of
all
my
past
in
your
person
he
wept
and
raised
both
her
hands
to
his
tearstained
eyes
i
kneel
to
all
that
was
beautiful
in
my
life
i
kiss
and
give
thanks
now
ive
torn
myself
in
half
left
behind
a
mad
visionary
who
dreamed
of
soaring
to
the
sky
vingtdeux
ans
here
a
shattered
frozen
old
man
a
tutor
chez
ce
marchand

but
how
drenched
you
are
lise
he
cried
jumping
on
to
his
feet
feeling
that
his
knees
too
were
soaked
by
the
wet
earth
and
how
is
it
possible
you
are
in
such
a
dress
and
on
foot
and
in
these
fields
you
are
crying
vous
tes
malheureuse
bah
i
did
hear
something
but
where
have
you
come
from
now
he
asked
hurried
questions
with
an
uneasy
air
looking
in
extreme
bewilderment
at
mavriky
nikolaevitch
mais
savezvous
lheure
quil
est
stepan
trofimovitch
have
you
heard
anything
about
the
people
whove
been
murdered
is
it
true
is
it
true
these
people
i
saw
the
glow
of
their
work
all
night
they
were
bound
to
end
in
this
his
eyes
flashed
again
i
am
fleeing
away
from
madness
from
a
delirious
dream
i
am
fleeing
away
to
seek
for
russia
existetelle
la
russie
bah
cest
vous
cher
capitaine
ive
never
doubted
that
i
should
meet
you
somewhere
on
some
high
adventure
but
take
my
umbrella
andwhy
must
you
be
on
foot
for
gods
sake
do
at
least
take
my
umbrella
for
i
shall
hire
a
carriage
somewhere
in
any
case
i
am
on
foot
because
stasie
i
mean
nastasya
would
have
shouted
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
street
if
shed
found
out
i
was
going
away
so
i
slipped
away
as
far
as
possible
incognito
i
dont
know
in
the
voice
they
write
of
there
being
brigands
everywhere
but
i
thought
surely
i
shouldnt
meet
a
brigand
the
moment
i
came
out
on
the
road
chre
lise
i
thought
you
said
something
of
someones
being
murdered
oh
mon
dieu
you
are
ill
come
along
come
along
cried
liza
almost
in
hysterics
drawing
mavriky
nikolaevitch
after
her
again
wait
a
minute
stepan
trofimovitch
she
came
back
suddenly
to
him
stay
poor
darling
let
me
sign
you
with
the
cross
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
put
you
under
control
but
id
rather
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
you
you
too
pray
for
poor
lizajust
a
little
dont
bother
too
much
about
it
mavriky
nikolaevitch
give
that
baby
back
his
umbrella
you
must
give
it
him
thats
right
come
let
us
go
let
us
go
they
reached
the
fatal
house
at
the
very
moment
when
the
huge
crowd
which
had
gathered
round
it
had
already
heard
a
good
deal
of
stavrogin
and
of
how
much
it
was
to
his
interest
to
murder
his
wife
yet
i
repeat
the
immense
majority
went
on
listening
without
moving
or
uttering
a
word
the
only
people
who
were
excited
were
bawling
drunkards
and
excitable
individuals
of
the
same
sort
as
the
gesticulatory
cabinetmaker
every
one
knew
the
latter
as
a
man
really
of
mild
disposition
but
he
was
liable
on
occasion
to
get
excited
and
to
fly
off
at
a
tangent
if
anything
struck
him
in
a
certain
way
i
did
not
see
liza
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
arrive
petrified
with
amazement
i
first
noticed
liza
some
distance
away
in
the
crowd
and
i
did
not
at
once
catch
sight
of
mavriky
nikolaevitch
i
fancy
there
was
a
moment
when
he
fell
two
or
three
steps
behind
her
or
was
pressed
back
by
the
crush
liza
forcing
her
way
through
the
crowd
seeing
and
noticing
nothing
round
her
like
one
in
a
delirium
like
a
patient
escaped
from
a
hospital
attracted
attention
only
too
quickly
of
course
there
arose
a
hubbub
of
loud
talking
and
at
last
sudden
shouts
some
one
bawled
out
its
stavrogins
woman
and
on
the
other
side
its
not
enough
to
murder
them
she
wants
to
look
at
them
all
at
once
i
saw
an
arm
raised
above
her
head
from
behind
and
suddenly
brought
down
upon
it
liza
fell
to
the
ground
we
heard
a
fearful
scream
from
mavriky
nikolaevitch
as
he
dashed
to
her
assistance
and
struck
with
all
his
strength
the
man
who
stood
between
him
and
liza
but
at
that
instant
the
same
cabinetmaker
seized
him
with
both
arms
from
behind
for
some
minutes
nothing
could
be
distinguished
in
the
scrimmage
that
followed
i
believe
liza
got
up
but
was
knocked
down
by
another
blow
suddenly
the
crowd
parted
and
a
small
space
was
left
empty
round
lizas
prostrate
figure
and
mavriky
nikolaevitch
frantic
with
grief
and
covered
with
blood
was
standing
over
her
screaming
weeping
and
wringing
his
hands
i
dont
remember
exactly
what
followed
after
i
only
remember
that
they
began
to
carry
liza
away
i
ran
after
her
she
was
still
alive
and
perhaps
still
conscious
the
cabinetmaker
and
three
other
men
in
the
crowd
were
seized
these
three
still
deny
having
taken
any
part
in
the
dastardly
deed
stubbornly
maintaining
that
they
have
been
arrested
by
mistake
perhaps
its
the
truth
though
the
evidence
against
the
cabinetmaker
is
clear
he
is
so
irrational
that
he
is
still
unable
to
explain
what
happened
coherently
i
too
as
a
spectator
though
at
some
distance
had
to
give
evidence
at
the
inquest
i
declared
that
it
had
all
happened
entirely
accidentally
through
the
action
of
men
perhaps
moved
by
illfeeling
yet
scarcely
conscious
of
what
they
were
doingdrunk
and
irresponsible
i
am
of
that
opinion
to
this
day
chapter
iv
the
last
resolution
i
that
morning
many
people
saw
pyotr
stepanovitch
all
who
saw
him
remembered
that
he
was
in
a
particularly
excited
state
at
two
oclock
he
went
to
see
gaganov
who
had
arrived
from
the
country
only
the
day
before
and
whose
house
was
full
of
visitors
hotly
discussing
the
events
of
the
previous
day
pyotr
stepanovitch
talked
more
than
anyone
and
made
them
listen
to
him
he
was
always
considered
among
us
as
a
chatterbox
of
a
student
with
a
screw
loose
but
now
he
talked
of
yulia
mihailovna
and
in
the
general
excitement
the
theme
was
an
enthralling
one
as
one
who
had
recently
been
her
intimate
and
confidential
friend
he
disclosed
many
new
and
unexpected
details
concerning
her
incidentally
and
of
course
unguardedly
he
repeated
some
of
her
own
remarks
about
persons
known
to
all
in
the
town
and
thereby
piqued
their
vanity
he
dropped
it
all
in
a
vague
and
rambling
way
like
a
man
free
from
guile
driven
by
his
sense
of
honour
to
the
painful
necessity
of
clearing
up
a
perfect
mountain
of
misunderstandings
and
so
simplehearted
that
he
hardly
knew
where
to
begin
and
where
to
leave
off
he
let
slip
in
a
rather
unguarded
way
too
that
yulia
mihailovna
knew
the
whole
secret
of
stavrogin
and
that
she
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
intrigue
she
had
taken
him
in
too
for
he
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
also
been
in
love
with
this
unhappy
liza
yet
he
had
been
so
hoodwinked
that
he
had
almost
taken
her
to
stavrogin
himself
in
the
carriage
yes
yes
its
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
gentlemen
but
if
only
id
known
if
id
known
how
it
would
end
he
concluded
to
various
excited
inquiries
about
stavrogin
he
bluntly
replied
that
in
his
opinion
the
catastrophe
to
the
lebyadkins
was
a
pure
coincidence
and
that
it
was
all
lebyadkins
own
fault
for
displaying
his
money
he
explained
this
particularly
well
one
of
his
listeners
observed
that
it
was
no
good
his
pretending
that
he
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
almost
slept
at
yulia
mihailovnas
yet
now
he
was
the
first
to
blacken
her
character
and
that
this
was
by
no
means
such
a
fine
thing
to
do
as
he
supposed
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
immediately
defended
himself
i
ate
and
drank
there
not
because
i
had
no
money
and
its
not
my
fault
that
i
was
invited
there
allow
me
to
judge
for
myself
how
far
i
need
to
be
grateful
for
that
the
general
impression
was
in
his
favour
he
may
be
rather
absurd
and
of
course
he
is
a
nonsensical
fellow
yet
still
he
is
not
responsible
for
yulia
mihailovnas
foolishness
on
the
contrary
it
appears
that
he
tried
to
stop
her
about
two
oclock
the
news
suddenly
came
that
stavrogin
about
whom
there
was
so
much
talk
had
suddenly
left
for
petersburg
by
the
midday
train
this
interested
people
immensely
many
of
them
frowned
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
so
much
struck
that
i
was
told
he
turned
quite
pale
and
cried
out
strangely
why
how
could
they
have
let
him
go
he
hurried
away
from
gaganovs
forthwith
yet
he
was
seen
in
two
or
three
other
houses
towards
dusk
he
succeeded
in
getting
in
to
see
yulia
mihailovna
though
he
had
the
greatest
pains
to
do
so
as
she
had
absolutely
refused
to
see
him
i
heard
of
this
from
the
lady
herself
only
three
weeks
afterwards
just
before
her
departure
for
petersburg
she
gave
me
no
details
but
observed
with
a
shudder
that
he
had
on
that
occasion
astounded
her
beyond
all
belief
i
imagine
that
all
he
did
was
to
terrify
her
by
threatening
to
charge
her
with
being
an
accomplice
if
she
said
anything
the
necessity
for
this
intimidation
arose
from
his
plans
at
the
moment
of
which
she
of
course
knew
nothing
and
only
later
five
days
afterwards
she
guessed
why
he
had
been
so
doubtful
of
her
reticence
and
so
afraid
of
a
new
outburst
of
indignation
on
her
part
between
seven
and
eight
oclock
when
it
was
dark
all
the
five
members
of
the
quintet
met
together
at
ensign
erkels
lodgings
in
a
little
crooked
house
at
the
end
of
the
town
the
meeting
had
been
fixed
by
pyotr
stepanovitch
himself
but
he
was
unpardonably
late
and
the
members
waited
over
an
hour
for
him
this
ensign
erkel
was
that
young
officer
who
had
sat
the
whole
evening
at
virginskys
with
a
pencil
in
his
hand
and
a
notebook
before
him
he
had
not
long
been
in
the
town
he
lodged
alone
with
two
old
women
sisters
in
a
secluded
bystreet
and
was
shortly
to
leave
the
town
a
meeting
at
his
house
was
less
likely
to
attract
notice
than
anywhere
this
strange
boy
was
distinguished
by
extreme
taciturnity
he
was
capable
of
sitting
for
a
dozen
evenings
in
succession
in
noisy
company
with
the
most
extraordinary
conversation
going
on
around
him
without
uttering
a
word
though
he
listened
with
extreme
attention
watching
the
speakers
with
his
childlike
eyes
his
face
was
very
pretty
and
even
had
a
certain
look
of
cleverness
he
did
not
belong
to
the
quintet
it
was
supposed
that
he
had
some
special
job
of
a
purely
practical
character
it
is
known
now
that
he
had
nothing
of
the
sort
and
probably
did
not
understand
his
position
himself
it
was
simply
that
he
was
filled
with
heroworship
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
whom
he
had
only
lately
met
if
he
had
met
a
monster
of
iniquity
who
had
incited
him
to
found
a
band
of
brigands
on
the
pretext
of
some
romantic
and
socialistic
object
and
as
a
test
had
bidden
him
rob
and
murder
the
first
peasant
he
met
he
would
certainly
have
obeyed
and
done
it
he
had
an
invalid
mother
to
whom
he
sent
half
of
his
scanty
payand
how
she
must
have
kissed
that
poor
little
flaxen
head
how
she
must
have
trembled
and
prayed
over
it
i
go
into
these
details
about
him
because
i
feel
very
sorry
for
him
our
fellows
were
excited
the
events
of
the
previous
night
had
made
a
great
impression
on
them
and
i
fancy
they
were
in
a
panic
the
simple
disorderliness
in
which
they
had
so
zealously
and
systematically
taken
part
had
ended
in
a
way
they
had
not
expected
the
fire
in
the
night
the
murder
of
the
lebyadkins
the
savage
brutality
of
the
crowd
with
liza
had
been
a
series
of
surprises
which
they
had
not
anticipated
in
their
programme
they
hotly
accused
the
hand
that
had
guided
them
of
despotism
and
duplicity
in
fact
while
they
were
waiting
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
they
worked
each
other
up
to
such
a
point
that
they
resolved
again
to
ask
him
for
a
definite
explanation
and
if
he
evaded
again
as
he
had
done
before
to
dissolve
the
quintet
and
to
found
instead
a
new
secret
society
for
the
propaganda
of
ideas
and
on
their
own
initiative
on
the
basis
of
democracy
and
equality
liputin
shigalov
and
the
authority
on
the
peasantry
supported
this
plan
lyamshin
said
nothing
though
he
looked
approving
virginsky
hesitated
and
wanted
to
hear
pyotr
stepanovitch
first
it
was
decided
to
hear
pyotr
stepanovitch
but
still
he
did
not
come
such
casualness
added
fuel
to
the
flames
erkel
was
absolutely
silent
and
did
nothing
but
order
the
tea
which
he
brought
from
his
landladies
in
glasses
on
a
tray
not
bringing
in
the
samovar
nor
allowing
the
servant
to
enter
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
not
turn
up
till
halfpast
eight
with
rapid
steps
he
went
up
to
the
circular
table
before
the
sofa
round
which
the
company
were
seated
he
kept
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
refused
tea
he
looked
angry
severe
and
supercilious
he
must
have
observed
at
once
from
their
faces
that
they
were
mutinous
before
i
open
my
mouth
youve
got
something
hidden
out
with
it
liputin
began
in
the
name
of
all
and
declared
in
a
voice
quivering
with
resentment
that
if
things
were
going
on
like
that
they
might
as
well
blow
their
brains
out
oh
they
were
not
at
all
afraid
to
blow
their
brains
out
they
were
quite
ready
to
in
fact
but
only
to
serve
the
common
cause
a
general
movement
of
approbation
so
he
must
be
more
open
with
them
so
that
they
might
always
know
beforehand
or
else
what
would
things
be
coming
to
again
a
stir
and
some
guttural
sounds
to
behave
like
this
was
humiliating
and
dangerous
we
dont
say
so
because
we
are
afraid
but
if
one
acts
and
the
rest
are
only
pawns
then
one
would
blunder
and
all
would
be
lost
exclamations
yes
yes
general
approval
damn
it
all
what
do
you
want
what
connection
is
there
between
the
common
cause
and
the
petty
intrigues
of
mr
stavrogin
cried
liputin
boiling
over
suppose
he
is
in
some
mysterious
relation
to
the
centre
if
that
legendary
centre
really
exists
at
all
its
no
concern
of
ours
and
meantime
a
murder
has
been
committed
the
police
have
been
roused
if
they
follow
the
thread
they
may
find
what
it
starts
from
if
stavrogin
and
you
are
caught
we
shall
be
caught
too
added
the
authority
on
the
peasantry
and
to
no
good
purpose
for
the
common
cause
virginsky
concluded
despondently
what
nonsense
the
murder
is
a
chance
crime
it
was
committed
by
fedka
for
the
sake
of
robbery
hm
strange
coincidence
though
said
liputin
wriggling
and
if
you
will
have
it
its
all
through
you
through
us
in
the
first
place
you
liputin
had
a
share
in
the
intrigue
yourself
and
the
second
chief
point
is
you
were
ordered
to
get
lebyadkin
away
and
given
money
to
do
it
and
what
did
you
do
if
youd
got
him
away
nothing
would
have
happened
but
wasnt
it
you
yourself
who
suggested
the
idea
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
set
him
on
to
read
his
verses
an
idea
is
not
a
command
the
command
was
to
get
him
away
command
rather
a
queer
word
on
the
contrary
your
orders
were
to
delay
sending
him
off
you
made
a
mistake
and
showed
your
foolishness
and
selfwill
the
murder
was
the
work
of
fedka
and
he
carried
it
out
alone
for
the
sake
of
robbery
you
heard
the
gossip
and
believed
it
you
were
scared
stavrogin
is
not
such
a
fool
and
the
proof
of
that
is
he
left
the
town
at
twelve
oclock
after
an
interview
with
the
vicegovernor
if
there
were
anything
in
it
they
would
not
let
him
go
to
petersburg
in
broad
daylight
but
we
are
not
making
out
that
mr
stavrogin
committed
the
murder
himself
liputin
rejoined
spitefully
and
unceremoniously
he
may
have
known
nothing
about
it
like
me
and
you
know
very
well
that
i
knew
nothing
about
it
though
i
am
mixed
up
in
it
like
mutton
in
a
hash
whom
are
you
accusing
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
looking
at
him
darkly
those
whose
interest
it
is
to
burn
down
towns
you
make
matters
worse
by
wriggling
out
of
it
however
wont
you
read
this
and
pass
it
to
the
others
simply
as
a
fact
of
interest
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
lebyadkins
anonymous
letter
to
lembke
and
handed
it
to
liputin
the
latter
read
it
was
evidently
surprised
and
passed
it
thoughtfully
to
his
neighbour
the
letter
quickly
went
the
round
is
that
really
lebyadkins
handwriting
observed
shigalov
it
is
answered
liputin
and
tolkatchenko
the
authority
on
the
peasantry
i
simply
brought
it
as
a
fact
of
interest
and
because
i
knew
you
were
so
sentimental
over
lebyadkin
repeated
pyotr
stepanovitch
taking
the
letter
back
so
it
turns
out
gentlemen
that
a
stray
fedka
relieves
us
quite
by
chance
of
a
dangerous
man
thats
what
chance
does
sometimes
its
instructive
isnt
it
the
members
exchanged
rapid
glances
and
now
gentlemen
its
my
turn
to
ask
questions
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
assuming
an
air
of
dignity
let
me
know
what
business
you
had
to
set
fire
to
the
town
without
permission
whats
this
we
we
set
fire
to
the
town
that
is
laying
the
blame
on
others
they
exclaimed
i
quite
understand
that
you
carried
the
game
too
far
pyotr
stepanovitch
persisted
stubbornly
but
its
not
a
matter
of
petty
scandals
with
yulia
mihailovna
ive
brought
you
here
gentlemen
to
explain
to
you
the
greatness
of
the
danger
you
have
so
stupidly
incurred
which
is
a
menace
to
much
besides
yourselves
excuse
me
we
on
the
contrary
were
intending
just
now
to
point
out
to
you
the
greatness
of
the
despotism
and
unfairness
you
have
shown
in
taking
such
a
serious
and
also
strange
step
without
consulting
the
members
virginsky
who
had
been
hitherto
silent
protested
almost
with
indignation
and
so
you
deny
it
but
i
maintain
that
you
set
fire
to
the
town
you
and
none
but
you
gentlemen
dont
tell
lies
i
have
good
evidence
by
your
rashness
you
exposed
the
common
cause
to
danger
you
are
only
one
knot
in
an
endless
network
of
knotsand
your
duty
is
blind
obedience
to
the
centre
yet
three
men
of
you
incited
the
shpigulin
men
to
set
fire
to
the
town
without
the
least
instruction
to
do
so
and
the
fire
has
taken
place
what
three
what
three
of
us
the
day
before
yesterday
at
three
oclock
in
the
night
you
tolkatchenko
were
inciting
fomka
zavyalov
at
the
forgetmenot
upon
my
word
cried
the
latter
jumping
up
i
scarcely
said
a
word
to
him
and
what
i
did
say
was
without
intention
simply
because
he
had
been
flogged
that
morning
and
i
dropped
it
at
once
i
saw
he
was
too
drunk
if
you
had
not
referred
to
it
i
should
not
have
thought
of
it
again
a
word
could
not
set
the
place
on
fire
you
are
like
a
man
who
should
be
surprised
that
a
tiny
spark
could
blow
a
whole
powder
magazine
into
the
air
i
spoke
in
a
whisper
in
his
ear
in
a
corner
how
could
you
have
heard
of
it
tolkatchenko
reflected
suddenly
i
was
sitting
there
under
the
table
dont
disturb
yourselves
gentlemen
i
know
every
step
you
take
you
smile
sarcastically
mr
liputin
but
i
know
for
instance
that
you
pinched
your
wife
black
and
blue
at
midnight
three
days
ago
in
your
bedroom
as
you
were
going
to
bed
liputins
mouth
fell
open
and
he
turned
pale
it
was
afterwards
found
out
that
he
knew
of
this
exploit
of
liputins
from
agafya
liputins
servant
whom
he
had
paid
from
the
beginning
to
spy
on
him
this
only
came
out
later
may
i
state
a
fact
said
shigalov
getting
up
state
it
shigalov
sat
down
and
pulled
himself
together
so
far
as
i
understandand
its
impossible
not
to
understand
ityou
yourself
at
first
and
a
second
time
later
drew
with
great
eloquence
but
too
theoretically
a
picture
of
russia
covered
with
an
endless
network
of
knots
each
of
these
centres
of
activity
proselytising
and
ramifying
endlessly
aims
by
systematic
denunciation
to
injure
the
prestige
of
local
authority
to
reduce
the
villages
to
confusion
to
spread
cynicism
and
scandals
together
with
complete
disbelief
in
everything
and
an
eagerness
for
something
better
and
finally
by
means
of
fires
as
a
preeminently
national
method
to
reduce
the
country
at
a
given
moment
if
need
be
to
desperation
are
those
your
words
which
i
tried
to
remember
accurately
is
that
the
programme
you
gave
us
as
the
authorised
representative
of
the
central
committee
which
is
to
this
day
utterly
unknown
to
us
and
almost
like
a
myth
its
correct
only
you
are
very
tedious
every
one
has
a
right
to
express
himself
in
his
own
way
giving
us
to
understand
that
the
separate
knots
of
the
general
network
already
covering
russia
number
by
now
several
hundred
and
propounding
the
theory
that
if
every
one
does
his
work
successfully
all
russia
at
a
given
moment
at
a
signal
ah
damn
it
all
i
have
enough
to
do
without
you
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
twisting
in
his
chair
very
well
ill
cut
it
short
and
ill
end
simply
by
asking
if
weve
seen
the
disorderly
scenes
weve
seen
the
discontent
of
the
people
weve
seen
and
taken
part
in
the
downfall
of
local
administration
and
finally
weve
seen
with
our
own
eyes
the
town
on
fire
what
do
you
find
amiss
isnt
that
your
programme
what
can
you
blame
us
for
acting
on
your
own
initiative
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
furiously
while
i
am
here
you
ought
not
to
have
dared
to
act
without
my
permission
enough
we
are
on
the
eve
of
betrayal
and
perhaps
tomorrow
or
tonight
youll
be
seized
so
there
i
have
authentic
information
at
this
all
were
agape
with
astonishment
you
will
be
arrested
not
only
as
the
instigators
of
the
fire
but
as
a
quintet
the
traitor
knows
the
whole
secret
of
the
network
so
you
see
what
a
mess
youve
made
of
it
stavrogin
no
doubt
cried
liputin
what
why
stavrogin
pyotr
stepanovitch
seemed
suddenly
taken
aback
hang
it
all
he
cried
pulling
himself
together
at
once
its
shatov
i
believe
you
all
know
now
that
shatov
in
his
time
was
one
of
the
society
i
must
tell
you
that
watching
him
through
persons
he
does
not
suspect
i
found
out
to
my
amazement
that
he
knows
all
about
the
organisation
of
the
network
and
everything
in
fact
to
save
himself
from
being
charged
with
having
formerly
belonged
he
will
give
information
against
all
he
has
been
hesitating
up
till
now
and
i
have
spared
him
your
fire
has
decided
him
he
is
shaken
and
will
hesitate
no
longer
tomorrow
we
shall
be
arrested
as
incendiaries
and
political
offenders
is
it
true
how
does
shatov
know
the
excitement
was
indescribable
its
all
perfectly
true
i
have
no
right
to
reveal
the
source
from
which
i
learnt
it
or
how
i
discovered
it
but
i
tell
you
what
i
can
do
for
you
meanwhile
through
one
person
i
can
act
on
shatov
so
that
without
his
suspecting
it
he
will
put
off
giving
information
but
not
more
than
for
twentyfour
hours
all
were
silent
we
really
must
send
him
to
the
devil
tolkatchenko
was
the
first
to
exclaim
it
ought
to
have
been
done
long
ago
lyamshin
put
in
malignantly
striking
the
table
with
his
fist
but
how
is
it
to
be
done
muttered
liputin
pyotr
stepanovitch
at
once
took
up
the
question
and
unfolded
his
plan
the
plan
was
the
following
day
at
nightfall
to
draw
shatov
away
to
a
secluded
spot
to
hand
over
the
secret
printing
press
which
had
been
in
his
keeping
and
was
buried
there
and
there
to
settle
things
he
went
into
various
essential
details
which
we
will
omit
here
and
explained
minutely
shatovs
present
ambiguous
attitude
to
the
central
society
of
which
the
reader
knows
already
thats
all
very
well
liputin
observed
irresolutely
but
since
it
will
be
another
adventure
of
the
same
sort
it
will
make
too
great
a
sensation
no
doubt
assented
pyotr
stepanovitch
but
ive
provided
against
that
we
have
the
means
of
averting
suspicion
completely
and
with
the
same
minuteness
he
told
them
about
kirillov
of
his
intention
to
shoot
himself
and
of
his
promise
to
wait
for
a
signal
from
them
and
to
leave
a
letter
behind
him
taking
on
himself
anything
they
dictated
to
him
all
of
which
the
reader
knows
already
his
determination
to
take
his
own
lifea
philosophic
or
as
i
should
call
it
insane
decisionhas
become
known
there
pyotr
stepanovitch
went
on
to
explain
there
not
a
thread
not
a
grain
of
dust
is
overlooked
everything
is
turned
to
the
service
of
the
cause
foreseeing
how
useful
it
might
be
and
satisfying
themselves
that
his
intention
was
quite
serious
they
had
offered
him
the
means
to
come
to
russia
he
was
set
for
some
reason
on
dying
in
russia
gave
him
a
commission
which
he
promised
to
carry
out
and
he
had
done
so
and
had
moreover
bound
him
by
a
promise
as
you
already
know
to
commit
suicide
only
when
he
was
told
to
he
promised
everything
you
must
note
that
he
belongs
to
the
organisation
on
a
particular
footing
and
is
anxious
to
be
of
service
more
than
that
i
cant
tell
you
tomorrow
after
shatovs
affair
ill
dictate
a
note
to
him
saying
that
he
is
responsible
for
his
death
that
will
seem
very
plausible
they
were
friends
and
travelled
together
to
america
there
they
quarrelled
and
it
will
all
be
explained
in
the
letter
and
and
perhaps
if
it
seems
feasible
we
might
dictate
something
more
to
kirillovsomething
about
the
manifestoes
for
instance
and
even
perhaps
about
the
fire
but
ill
think
about
that
you
neednt
worry
yourselves
he
has
no
prejudices
hell
sign
anything
there
were
expressions
of
doubt
it
sounded
a
fantastic
story
but
they
had
all
heard
more
or
less
about
kirillov
liputin
more
than
all
he
may
change
his
mind
and
not
want
to
said
shigalov
he
is
a
madman
anyway
so
he
is
not
much
to
build
upon
dont
be
uneasy
gentlemen
he
will
want
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
snapped
out
i
am
obliged
by
our
agreement
to
give
him
warning
the
day
before
so
it
must
be
today
i
invite
liputin
to
go
with
me
at
once
to
see
him
and
make
certain
and
he
will
tell
you
gentlemen
when
he
comes
backtoday
if
need
bewhether
what
i
say
is
true
however
he
broke
off
suddenly
with
intense
exasperation
as
though
he
suddenly
felt
he
was
doing
people
like
them
too
much
honour
by
wasting
time
in
persuading
them
however
do
as
you
please
if
you
dont
decide
to
do
it
the
union
is
broken
upbut
solely
through
your
insubordination
and
treachery
in
that
case
we
are
all
independent
from
this
moment
but
under
those
circumstances
besides
the
unpleasantness
of
shatovs
betrayal
and
its
consequences
you
will
have
brought
upon
yourselves
another
little
unpleasantness
of
which
you
were
definitely
warned
when
the
union
was
formed
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
not
much
afraid
of
you
gentlemen
dont
imagine
that
i
am
so
involved
with
you
but
thats
no
matter
yes
we
decide
to
do
it
liputin
pronounced
theres
no
other
way
out
of
it
muttered
tolkatchenko
and
if
only
liputin
confirms
about
kirillov
then
i
am
against
it
with
all
my
soul
and
strength
i
protest
against
such
a
murderous
decision
said
virginsky
standing
up
but
asked
pyotr
stepanovitch
but
what
you
said
but
and
i
am
waiting
i
dont
think
i
did
say
but
i
only
meant
to
say
that
if
you
decide
to
do
it
then
then
virginsky
did
not
answer
i
think
that
one
is
at
liberty
to
neglect
danger
to
ones
own
life
said
erkel
suddenly
opening
his
mouth
but
if
it
may
injure
the
cause
then
i
consider
one
ought
not
to
dare
to
neglect
danger
to
ones
life
he
broke
off
in
confusion
blushing
absorbed
as
they
all
were
in
their
own
ideas
they
all
looked
at
him
in
amazementit
was
such
a
surprise
that
he
too
could
speak
i
am
for
the
cause
virginsky
pronounced
suddenly
every
one
got
up
it
was
decided
to
communicate
once
more
and
make
final
arrangements
at
midday
on
the
morrow
though
without
meeting
the
place
where
the
printing
press
was
hidden
was
announced
and
each
was
assigned
his
part
and
his
duty
liputin
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
promptly
set
off
together
to
kirillov
ii
all
our
fellows
believed
that
shatov
was
going
to
betray
them
but
they
also
believed
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
playing
with
them
like
pawns
and
yet
they
knew
too
that
in
any
case
they
would
all
meet
on
the
spot
next
day
and
that
shatovs
fate
was
sealed
they
suddenly
felt
like
flies
caught
in
a
web
by
a
huge
spider
they
were
furious
but
they
were
trembling
with
terror
pyotr
stepanovitch
of
course
had
treated
them
badly
it
might
all
have
gone
off
far
more
harmoniously
and
easily
if
he
had
taken
the
trouble
to
embellish
the
facts
ever
so
little
instead
of
putting
the
facts
in
a
decorous
light
as
an
exploit
worthy
of
ancient
rome
or
something
of
the
sort
he
simply
appealed
to
their
animal
fears
and
laid
stress
on
the
danger
to
their
own
skins
which
was
simply
insulting
of
course
there
was
a
struggle
for
existence
in
everything
and
there
was
no
other
principle
in
nature
they
all
knew
that
but
still
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
no
time
to
trot
out
the
romans
he
was
completely
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
stavrogins
flight
had
astounded
and
crushed
him
it
was
a
lie
when
he
said
that
stavrogin
had
seen
the
vicegovernor
what
worried
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
that
stavrogin
had
gone
off
without
seeing
anyone
even
his
motherand
it
was
certainly
strange
that
he
had
been
allowed
to
leave
without
hindrance
the
authorities
were
called
to
account
for
it
afterwards
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
been
making
inquiries
all
day
but
so
far
had
found
out
nothing
and
he
had
never
been
so
upset
and
how
could
he
how
could
he
give
up
stavrogin
all
at
once
like
this
that
was
why
he
could
not
be
very
tender
with
the
quintet
besides
they
tied
his
hands
he
had
already
decided
to
gallop
after
stavrogin
at
once
and
meanwhile
he
was
detained
by
shatov
he
had
to
cement
the
quintet
together
once
for
all
in
case
of
emergency
pity
to
waste
them
they
might
be
of
use
that
i
imagine
was
his
way
of
reasoning
as
for
shatov
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
would
betray
them
all
that
he
had
told
the
others
about
it
was
a
lie
he
had
never
seen
the
document
nor
heard
of
it
but
he
thought
it
as
certain
as
that
twice
two
makes
four
it
seemed
to
him
that
what
had
happenedthe
death
of
liza
the
death
of
marya
timofyevnawould
be
too
much
for
shatov
and
that
he
would
make
up
his
mind
at
once
who
knows
perhaps
he
had
grounds
for
supposing
it
it
is
known
too
that
he
hated
shatov
personally
there
had
at
some
time
been
a
quarrel
between
them
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
never
forgave
an
offence
i
am
convinced
indeed
that
this
was
his
leading
motive
we
have
narrow
brick
pavements
in
our
town
and
in
some
streets
only
raised
wooden
planks
instead
of
a
pavement
pyotr
stepanovitch
walked
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
taking
up
the
whole
of
it
utterly
regardless
of
liputin
who
had
no
room
to
walk
beside
him
and
so
had
to
hurry
a
step
behind
or
run
in
the
muddy
road
if
he
wanted
to
speak
to
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
suddenly
remembered
how
he
had
lately
splashed
through
the
mud
to
keep
pace
with
stavrogin
who
had
walked
as
he
was
doing
now
taking
up
the
whole
pavement
he
recalled
the
whole
scene
and
rage
choked
him
but
liputin
too
was
choking
with
resentment
pyotr
stepanovitch
might
treat
the
others
as
he
liked
but
him
why
he
knew
more
than
all
the
rest
was
in
closer
touch
with
the
work
and
taking
more
intimate
part
in
it
than
anyone
and
hitherto
his
services
had
been
continual
though
indirect
oh
he
knew
that
even
now
pyotr
stepanovitch
might
ruin
him
if
it
came
to
the
worst
but
he
had
long
hated
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
not
because
he
was
a
danger
but
because
of
his
overbearing
manner
now
when
he
had
to
make
up
his
mind
to
such
a
deed
he
raged
inwardly
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
alas
he
knew
that
next
day
like
a
slave
he
would
be
the
first
on
the
spot
and
would
bring
the
others
and
if
he
could
somehow
have
murdered
pyotr
stepanovitch
before
the
morrow
without
ruining
himself
of
course
he
would
certainly
have
murdered
him
absorbed
in
his
sensations
he
trudged
dejectedly
after
his
tormentor
who
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
existence
though
he
gave
him
a
rude
and
careless
shove
with
his
elbow
now
and
then
suddenly
pyotr
stepanovitch
halted
in
one
of
the
principal
thoroughfares
and
went
into
a
restaurant
what
are
you
doing
cried
liputin
boiling
over
this
is
a
restaurant
i
want
a
beefsteak
upon
my
word
it
is
always
full
of
people
what
if
it
is
but
we
shall
be
late
its
ten
oclock
already
you
cant
be
too
late
to
go
there
but
i
shall
be
late
they
are
expecting
me
back
well
let
them
but
it
would
be
stupid
of
you
to
go
to
them
with
all
your
bobbery
ive
had
no
dinner
and
the
later
you
go
to
kirillovs
the
more
sure
you
are
to
find
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
went
to
a
room
apart
liputin
sat
in
an
easy
chair
on
one
side
angry
and
resentful
and
watched
him
eating
half
an
hour
and
more
passed
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
not
hurry
himself
he
ate
with
relish
rang
the
bell
asked
for
a
different
kind
of
mustard
then
for
beer
without
saying
a
word
to
liputin
he
was
pondering
deeply
he
was
capable
of
doing
two
things
at
onceeating
with
relish
and
pondering
deeply
liputin
loathed
him
so
intensely
at
last
that
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
it
was
like
a
nervous
obsession
he
counted
every
morsel
of
beefsteak
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
put
into
his
mouth
he
loathed
him
for
the
way
he
opened
it
for
the
way
he
chewed
for
the
way
he
smacked
his
lips
over
the
fat
morsels
he
loathed
the
steak
itself
at
last
things
began
to
swim
before
his
eyes
he
began
to
feel
slightly
giddy
he
felt
hot
and
cold
run
down
his
spine
by
turns
you
are
doing
nothing
read
that
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
suddenly
throwing
him
a
sheet
of
paper
liputin
went
nearer
to
the
candle
the
paper
was
closely
covered
with
bad
handwriting
with
corrections
in
every
line
by
the
time
he
had
mastered
it
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
paid
his
bill
and
was
ready
to
go
when
they
were
on
the
pavement
liputin
handed
him
back
the
paper
keep
it
ill
tell
you
afterwards
what
do
you
say
to
it
though
liputin
shuddered
all
over
in
my
opinion
such
a
manifesto
is
nothing
but
a
ridiculous
absurdity
his
anger
broke
out
he
felt
as
though
he
were
being
caught
up
and
carried
along
if
we
decide
to
distribute
such
manifestoes
he
said
quivering
all
over
well
make
ourselves
contemptible
by
our
stupidity
and
incompetence
hm
i
think
differently
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
walking
on
resolutely
so
do
i
surely
it
isnt
your
work
thats
not
your
business
i
think
too
that
doggerel
a
noble
personality
is
the
most
utter
trash
possible
and
it
couldnt
have
been
written
by
herzen
you
are
talking
nonsense
its
a
good
poem
i
am
surprised
too
for
instance
said
liputin
still
dashing
along
with
desperate
leaps
that
it
is
suggested
that
we
should
act
so
as
to
bring
everything
to
the
ground
its
natural
in
europe
to
wish
to
destroy
everything
because
theres
a
proletariat
there
but
we
are
only
amateurs
here
and
in
my
opinion
are
only
showing
off
i
thought
you
were
a
fourierist
fourier
says
something
quite
different
quite
different
i
know
its
nonsense
no
fourier
isnt
nonsense
excuse
me
i
cant
believe
that
there
will
be
a
rising
in
may
liputin
positively
unbuttoned
his
coat
he
was
so
hot
well
thats
enough
but
now
that
i
maynt
forget
it
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
passing
with
extraordinary
coolness
to
another
subject
you
will
have
to
print
this
manifesto
with
your
own
hands
were
going
to
dig
up
shatovs
printing
press
and
you
will
take
it
tomorrow
as
quickly
as
possible
you
must
print
as
many
copies
as
you
can
and
then
distribute
them
all
the
winter
the
means
will
be
provided
you
must
do
as
many
copies
as
possible
for
youll
be
asked
for
them
from
other
places
no
excuse
me
i
cant
undertake
such
a
i
decline
youll
take
it
all
the
same
i
am
acting
on
the
instructions
of
the
central
committee
and
you
are
bound
to
obey
and
i
consider
that
our
centres
abroad
have
forgotten
what
russia
is
like
and
have
lost
all
touch
and
thats
why
they
talk
such
nonsense
i
even
think
that
instead
of
many
hundreds
of
quintets
in
russia
we
are
the
only
one
that
exists
and
there
is
no
network
at
all
liputin
gasped
finally
the
more
contemptible
of
you
then
to
run
after
the
cause
without
believing
in
it
and
you
are
running
after
me
now
like
a
mean
little
cur
no
im
not
we
have
a
full
right
to
break
off
and
found
a
new
society
fool
pyotr
stepanovitch
boomed
at
him
threateningly
all
of
a
sudden
with
flashing
eyes
they
stood
facing
one
another
for
some
time
pyotr
stepanovitch
turned
and
pursued
his
way
confidently
the
idea
flashed
through
liputins
mind
turn
and
go
back
if
i
dont
turn
now
i
shall
never
go
back
he
pondered
this
for
ten
steps
but
at
the
eleventh
a
new
and
desperate
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
he
did
not
turn
and
did
not
go
back
they
were
approaching
filipovs
house
but
before
reaching
it
they
turned
down
a
side
street
or
to
be
more
accurate
an
inconspicuous
path
under
a
fence
so
that
for
some
time
they
had
to
walk
along
a
steep
slope
above
a
ditch
where
they
could
not
keep
their
footing
without
holding
the
fence
at
a
dark
corner
in
the
slanting
fence
pyotr
stepanovitch
took
out
a
plank
leaving
a
gap
through
which
he
promptly
scrambled
liputin
was
surprised
but
he
crawled
through
after
him
then
they
replaced
the
plank
after
them
this
was
the
secret
way
by
which
fedka
used
to
visit
kirillov
shatov
mustnt
know
that
we
are
here
pyotr
stepanovitch
whispered
sternly
to
liputin
iii
kirillov
was
sitting
on
his
leather
sofa
drinking
tea
as
he
always
was
at
that
hour
he
did
not
get
up
to
meet
them
but
gave
a
sort
of
start
and
looked
at
the
newcomers
anxiously
you
are
not
mistaken
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
its
just
that
ive
come
about
today
no
no
tomorrow
about
this
time
and
he
hurriedly
sat
down
at
the
table
watching
kirillovs
agitation
with
some
uneasiness
but
the
latter
had
already
regained
his
composure
and
looked
as
usual
these
people
still
refuse
to
believe
in
you
you
are
not
vexed
at
my
bringing
liputin
today
i
am
not
vexed
tomorrow
i
want
to
be
alone
but
not
before
i
come
and
therefore
in
my
presence
i
should
prefer
not
in
your
presence
you
remember
you
promised
to
write
and
to
sign
all
i
dictated
i
dont
care
and
now
will
you
be
here
long
i
have
to
see
one
man
and
to
remain
half
an
hour
so
whatever
you
say
i
shall
stay
that
halfhour
kirillov
did
not
speak
liputin
meanwhile
sat
down
on
one
side
under
the
portrait
of
the
bishop
that
last
desperate
idea
gained
more
and
more
possession
of
him
kirillov
scarcely
noticed
him
liputin
had
heard
of
kirillovs
theory
before
and
always
laughed
at
him
but
now
he
was
silent
and
looked
gloomily
round
him
ive
no
objection
to
some
tea
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
moving
up
ive
just
had
some
steak
and
was
reckoning
on
getting
tea
with
you
drink
it
you
can
have
some
if
you
like
you
used
to
offer
it
to
me
observed
pyotr
stepanovitch
sourly
thats
no
matter
let
liputin
have
some
too
no
i
cant
dont
want
to
or
cant
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
turning
quickly
to
him
i
am
not
going
to
here
liputin
said
expressively
pyotr
stepanovitch
frowned
theres
a
flavour
of
mysticism
about
that
goodness
knows
what
to
make
of
you
people
no
one
answered
there
was
a
full
minute
of
silence
but
i
know
one
thing
he
added
abruptly
that
no
superstition
will
prevent
any
one
of
us
from
doing
his
duty
has
stavrogin
gone
asked
kirillov
yes
hes
done
well
pyotr
stepanovitchs
eyes
gleamed
but
he
restrained
himself
i
dont
care
what
you
think
as
long
as
every
one
keeps
his
word
ill
keep
my
word
i
always
knew
that
you
would
do
your
duty
like
an
independent
and
progressive
man
you
are
an
absurd
fellow
that
may
be
i
am
very
glad
to
amuse
you
i
am
always
glad
if
i
can
give
people
pleasure
you
are
very
anxious
i
should
shoot
myself
and
are
afraid
i
might
suddenly
not
well
you
see
it
was
your
own
doingconnecting
your
plan
with
our
work
reckoning
on
your
plan
we
have
already
done
something
so
that
you
couldnt
refuse
now
because
youve
let
us
in
for
it
youve
no
claim
at
all
i
understand
i
understand
you
are
perfectly
free
and
we
dont
come
in
so
long
as
your
free
intention
is
carried
out
and
am
i
to
take
on
myself
all
the
nasty
things
youve
done
listen
kirillov
are
you
afraid
if
you
want
to
cry
off
say
so
at
once
i
am
not
afraid
i
ask
because
you
are
making
so
many
inquiries
are
you
going
soon
asking
questions
again
kirillov
scanned
him
contemptuously
you
see
pyotr
stepanovitch
went
on
getting
angrier
and
angrier
and
unable
to
take
the
right
tone
you
want
me
to
go
away
to
be
alone
to
concentrate
yourself
but
all
thats
a
bad
sign
for
youfor
you
above
all
you
want
to
think
a
great
deal
to
my
mind
youd
better
not
think
and
really
you
make
me
uneasy
theres
only
one
thing
i
hate
that
at
such
a
moment
i
should
have
a
reptile
like
you
beside
me
oh
that
doesnt
matter
ill
go
away
at
the
time
and
stand
on
the
steps
if
you
like
if
you
are
so
concerned
about
trifles
when
it
comes
to
dying
then
its
all
a
very
bad
sign
ill
go
out
on
to
the
steps
and
you
can
imagine
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
that
i
am
a
man
infinitely
below
you
no
not
infinitely
youve
got
abilities
but
theres
a
lot
you
dont
understand
because
you
are
a
low
man
delighted
delighted
i
told
you
already
i
am
delighted
to
provide
entertainment
at
such
a
moment
you
dont
understand
anything
that
is
i
well
i
listen
with
respect
anyway
you
can
do
nothing
even
now
you
cant
hide
your
petty
spite
though
its
not
to
your
interest
to
show
it
youll
make
me
cross
and
then
i
may
want
another
six
months
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
at
his
watch
i
never
understood
your
theory
but
i
know
you
didnt
invent
it
for
our
sakes
so
i
suppose
you
would
carry
it
out
apart
from
us
and
i
know
too
that
you
havent
mastered
the
idea
but
the
idea
has
mastered
you
so
you
wont
put
it
off
what
the
idea
has
mastered
me
yes
and
not
i
mastered
the
idea
thats
good
you
have
a
little
sense
only
you
tease
me
and
i
am
proud
thats
a
good
thing
thats
a
good
thing
just
what
you
need
to
be
proud
enough
youve
drunk
your
tea
go
away
damn
it
all
i
suppose
i
mustpyotr
stepanovitch
got
upthough
its
early
listen
kirillov
shall
i
find
that
manyou
know
whom
i
meanat
myasnitchihas
or
has
she
too
been
lying
you
wont
find
him
because
he
is
here
and
not
there
here
damn
it
all
where
sitting
in
the
kitchen
eating
and
drinking
how
dared
he
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
flushing
angrily
it
was
his
duty
to
wait
what
nonsense
he
has
no
passport
no
money
i
dont
know
he
came
to
say
goodbye
he
is
dressed
and
ready
he
is
going
away
and
wont
come
back
he
says
you
are
a
scoundrel
and
he
doesnt
want
to
wait
for
your
money
ha
ha
he
is
afraid
that
ill
but
even
now
i
can
if
where
is
he
in
the
kitchen
kirillov
opened
a
side
door
into
a
tiny
dark
room
from
this
room
three
steps
led
straight
to
the
part
of
the
kitchen
where
the
cooks
bed
was
usually
put
behind
the
partition
here
in
the
corner
under
the
ikons
fedka
was
sitting
now
at
a
bare
deal
table
before
him
stood
a
pint
bottle
a
plate
of
bread
and
some
cold
beef
and
potatoes
on
an
earthenware
dish
he
was
eating
in
a
leisurely
way
and
was
already
half
drunk
but
he
was
wearing
his
sheepskin
coat
and
was
evidently
ready
for
a
journey
a
samovar
was
boiling
the
other
side
of
the
screen
but
it
was
not
for
fedka
who
had
every
night
for
a
week
or
more
zealously
blown
it
up
and
got
it
ready
for
alexey
nilitch
for
hes
such
a
habit
of
drinking
tea
at
nights
i
am
strongly
disposed
to
believe
that
as
kirillov
had
not
a
cook
he
had
cooked
the
beef
and
potatoes
that
morning
with
his
own
hands
for
fedka
what
notion
is
this
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
whisking
into
the
room
why
didnt
you
wait
where
you
were
ordered
and
swinging
his
fist
he
brought
it
down
heavily
on
the
table
fedka
assumed
an
air
of
dignity
you
wait
a
bit
pyotr
stepanovitch
you
wait
a
bit
he
began
with
a
swaggering
emphasis
on
each
word
its
your
first
duty
to
understand
here
that
you
are
on
a
polite
visit
to
mr
kirillov
alexey
nilitch
whose
boots
you
might
clean
any
day
because
beside
you
he
is
a
man
of
culture
and
you
are
onlyfoo
and
he
made
a
jaunty
show
of
spitting
to
one
side
haughtiness
and
determination
were
evident
in
his
manner
and
a
certain
very
threatening
assumption
of
argumentative
calm
that
suggested
an
outburst
to
follow
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
no
time
to
realise
the
danger
and
it
did
not
fit
in
with
his
preconceived
ideas
the
incidents
and
disasters
of
the
day
had
quite
turned
his
head
liputin
at
the
top
of
the
three
steps
stared
inquisitively
down
from
the
little
dark
room
do
you
or
dont
you
want
a
trustworthy
passport
and
good
money
to
go
where
youve
been
told
yes
or
no
dyou
see
pyotr
stepanovitch
youve
been
deceiving
me
from
the
first
and
so
youve
been
a
regular
scoundrel
to
me
for
all
the
world
like
a
filthy
human
lousethats
how
i
look
on
you
youve
promised
me
a
lot
of
money
for
shedding
innocent
blood
and
swore
it
was
for
mr
stavrogin
though
it
turns
out
to
be
nothing
but
your
want
of
breeding
i
didnt
get
a
farthing
out
of
it
let
alone
fifteen
hundred
and
mr
stavrogin
hit
you
in
the
face
which
has
come
to
our
ears
now
you
are
threatening
me
again
and
promising
me
moneywhat
for
you
dont
say
and
i
shouldnt
wonder
if
you
are
sending
me
to
petersburg
to
plot
some
revenge
in
your
spite
against
mr
stavrogin
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
reckoning
on
my
simplicity
and
that
proves
you
are
the
chief
murderer
and
do
you
know
what
you
deserve
for
the
very
fact
that
in
the
depravity
of
your
heart
youve
given
up
believing
in
god
himself
the
true
creator
you
are
no
better
than
an
idolater
and
are
on
a
level
with
the
tatar
and
the
mordva
alexey
nilitch
who
is
a
philosopher
has
expounded
the
true
god
the
creator
many
a
time
to
you
as
well
as
the
creation
of
the
world
and
the
fate
thats
to
come
and
the
transformation
of
every
sort
of
creature
and
every
sort
of
beast
out
of
the
apocalypse
but
youve
persisted
like
a
senseless
idol
in
your
deafness
and
your
dumbness
and
have
brought
ensign
erkel
to
the
same
like
the
veriest
evil
seducer
and
socalled
atheist
ah
you
drunken
dog
he
strips
the
ikons
of
their
setting
and
then
preaches
about
god
dyou
see
pyotr
stepanovitch
i
tell
you
truly
that
i
have
stripped
the
ikons
but
i
only
took
out
the
pearls
and
how
do
you
know
perhaps
my
own
tear
was
transformed
into
a
pearl
in
the
furnace
of
the
most
high
to
make
up
for
my
sufferings
seeing
i
am
just
that
very
orphan
having
no
daily
refuge
do
you
know
from
the
books
that
once
in
ancient
times
a
merchant
with
just
such
tearful
sighs
and
prayers
stole
a
pearl
from
the
halo
of
the
mother
of
god
and
afterwards
in
the
face
of
all
the
people
laid
the
whole
price
of
it
at
her
feet
and
the
holy
mother
sheltered
him
with
her
mantle
before
all
the
people
so
that
it
was
a
miracle
and
the
command
was
given
through
the
authorities
to
write
it
all
down
word
for
word
in
the
imperial
books
and
you
let
a
mouse
in
so
you
insulted
the
very
throne
of
god
and
if
you
were
not
my
natural
master
whom
i
dandled
in
my
arms
when
i
was
a
stripling
i
would
have
done
for
you
now
without
budging
from
this
place
pyotr
stepanovitch
flew
into
a
violent
rage
tell
me
have
you
seen
stavrogin
today
dont
you
dare
to
question
me
mr
stavrogin
is
fairly
amazed
at
you
and
he
had
no
share
in
it
even
in
wish
let
alone
instructions
or
giving
money
youve
presumed
with
me
youll
get
the
money
and
youll
get
another
two
thousand
in
petersburg
when
you
get
there
in
a
lump
sum
and
youll
get
more
you
are
lying
my
fine
gentleman
and
it
makes
me
laugh
to
see
how
easily
you
are
taken
in
mr
stavrogin
stands
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
above
you
and
you
yelp
at
him
from
below
like
a
silly
puppy
dog
while
he
thinks
it
would
be
doing
you
an
honour
to
spit
at
you
but
do
you
know
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
in
a
rage
that
i
wont
let
you
stir
a
step
from
here
you
scoundrel
and
ill
hand
you
straight
over
to
the
police
fedka
leapt
on
to
his
feet
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
fury
pyotr
stepanovitch
pulled
out
his
revolver
then
followed
a
rapid
and
revolting
scene
before
pyotr
stepanovitch
could
take
aim
fedka
swung
round
and
in
a
flash
struck
him
on
the
cheek
with
all
his
might
then
there
was
the
thud
of
a
second
blow
a
third
then
a
fourth
all
on
the
cheek
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
dazed
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
he
muttered
something
and
suddenly
crashed
full
length
to
the
ground
there
you
are
take
him
shouted
fedka
with
a
triumphant
swagger
he
instantly
took
up
his
cap
his
bag
from
under
the
bench
and
was
gone
pyotr
stepanovitch
lay
gasping
and
unconscious
liputin
even
imagined
that
he
had
been
murdered
kirillov
ran
headlong
into
the
kitchen
water
he
cried
and
ladling
some
water
in
an
iron
dipper
from
a
bucket
he
poured
it
over
the
injured
mans
head
pyotr
stepanovitch
stirred
raised
his
head
sat
up
and
looked
blankly
about
him
well
how
are
you
asked
kirillov
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
at
him
intently
still
not
recognising
him
but
seeing
liputin
peeping
in
from
the
kitchen
he
smiled
his
hateful
smile
and
suddenly
got
up
picking
up
his
revolver
from
the
floor
if
you
take
it
into
your
head
to
run
away
tomorrow
like
that
scoundrel
stavrogin
he
cried
pouncing
furiously
on
kirillov
pale
stammering
and
hardly
able
to
articulate
his
words
ill
hang
you
like
a
fly
or
crush
you
if
its
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
do
you
understand
and
he
held
the
revolver
straight
at
kirillovs
head
but
almost
at
the
same
minute
coming
completely
to
himself
he
drew
back
his
hand
thrust
the
revolver
into
his
pocket
and
without
saying
another
word
ran
out
of
the
house
liputin
followed
him
they
clambered
through
the
same
gap
and
again
walked
along
the
slope
holding
to
the
fence
pyotr
stepanovitch
strode
rapidly
down
the
street
so
that
liputin
could
scarcely
keep
up
with
him
at
the
first
crossing
he
suddenly
stopped
well
he
turned
to
liputin
with
a
challenge
liputin
remembered
the
revolver
and
was
still
trembling
all
over
after
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
but
the
answer
seemed
to
come
of
itself
irresistibly
from
his
tongue
i
think
i
think
that
did
you
see
what
fedka
was
drinking
in
the
kitchen
what
he
was
drinking
he
was
drinking
vodka
well
then
let
me
tell
you
its
the
last
time
in
his
life
he
will
drink
vodka
i
recommend
you
to
remember
that
and
reflect
on
it
and
now
go
to
hell
you
are
not
wanted
till
tomorrow
but
mind
now
dont
be
a
fool
liputin
rushed
home
full
speed
iv
he
had
long
had
a
passport
in
readiness
made
out
in
a
false
name
it
seems
a
wild
idea
that
this
prudent
little
man
the
petty
despot
of
his
family
who
was
above
all
things
a
sharp
man
of
business
and
a
capitalist
and
who
was
an
official
too
though
he
was
a
fourierist
should
long
before
have
conceived
the
fantastic
project
of
procuring
this
passport
in
case
of
emergency
that
he
might
escape
abroad
by
means
of
it
if
he
did
admit
the
possibility
of
this
if
though
no
doubt
he
was
never
able
himself
to
formulate
what
this
if
might
mean
but
now
it
suddenly
formulated
itself
and
in
a
most
unexpected
way
that
desperate
idea
with
which
he
had
gone
to
kirillovs
after
that
fool
he
had
heard
from
pyotr
stepanovitch
on
the
pavement
had
been
to
abandon
everything
at
dawn
next
day
and
to
emigrate
abroad
if
anyone
doubts
that
such
fantastic
incidents
occur
in
everyday
russian
life
even
now
let
him
look
into
the
biographies
of
all
the
russian
exiles
abroad
not
one
of
them
escaped
with
more
wisdom
or
real
justification
it
has
always
been
the
unrestrained
domination
of
phantoms
and
nothing
more
running
home
he
began
by
locking
himself
in
getting
out
his
travelling
bag
and
feverishly
beginning
to
pack
his
chief
anxiety
was
the
question
of
money
and
how
much
he
could
rescue
from
the
impending
ruinand
by
what
means
he
thought
of
it
as
rescuing
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
not
linger
an
hour
and
that
by
daylight
he
must
be
on
the
high
road
he
did
not
know
where
to
take
the
train
either
he
vaguely
determined
to
take
it
at
the
second
or
third
big
station
from
the
town
and
to
make
his
way
there
on
foot
if
necessary
in
that
way
instinctively
and
mechanically
he
busied
himself
in
his
packing
with
a
perfect
whirl
of
ideas
in
his
headand
suddenly
stopped
short
gave
it
all
up
and
with
a
deep
groan
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
he
felt
clearly
and
suddenly
realised
that
he
might
escape
but
that
he
was
by
now
utterly
incapable
of
deciding
whether
he
ought
to
make
off
before
or
after
shatovs
death
that
he
was
simply
a
lifeless
body
a
crude
inert
mass
that
he
was
being
moved
by
an
awful
outside
power
and
that
though
he
had
a
passport
to
go
abroad
that
though
he
could
run
away
from
shatov
otherwise
what
need
was
there
of
such
haste
yet
he
would
run
away
not
from
shatov
not
before
his
murder
but
after
it
and
that
that
was
determined
signed
and
sealed
in
insufferable
distress
trembling
every
instant
and
wondering
at
himself
alternately
groaning
aloud
and
numb
with
terror
he
managed
to
exist
till
eleven
oclock
next
morning
locked
in
and
lying
on
the
sofa
then
came
the
shock
he
was
awaiting
and
it
at
once
determined
him
when
he
unlocked
his
door
and
went
out
to
his
household
at
eleven
oclock
they
told
him
that
the
runaway
convict
and
brigand
fedka
who
was
a
terror
to
every
one
who
had
pillaged
churches
and
only
lately
been
guilty
of
murder
and
arson
who
was
being
pursued
and
could
not
be
captured
by
our
police
had
been
found
at
daybreak
murdered
five
miles
from
the
town
at
a
turning
off
the
high
road
and
that
the
whole
town
was
talking
of
it
already
he
rushed
headlong
out
of
the
house
at
once
to
find
out
further
details
and
learned
to
begin
with
that
fedka
who
had
been
found
with
his
skull
broken
had
apparently
been
robbed
and
secondly
that
the
police
already
had
strong
suspicion
and
even
good
grounds
for
believing
that
the
murderer
was
one
of
the
shpigulin
men
called
fomka
the
very
one
who
had
been
his
accomplice
in
murdering
the
lebyadkins
and
setting
fire
to
their
house
and
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
between
them
on
the
road
about
a
large
sum
of
money
stolen
from
lebyadkin
which
fedka
was
supposed
to
have
hidden
liputin
ran
to
pyotr
stepanovitchs
lodgings
and
succeeded
in
learning
at
the
back
door
on
the
sly
that
though
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
not
returned
home
till
about
one
oclock
at
night
he
had
slept
there
quietly
all
night
till
eight
oclock
next
morning
of
course
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
fedkas
death
and
that
such
careers
usually
have
such
an
ending
but
the
coincidence
of
the
fatal
words
that
it
was
the
last
time
fedka
would
drink
vodka
with
the
prompt
fulfilment
of
the
prediction
was
so
remarkable
that
liputin
no
longer
hesitated
the
shock
had
been
given
it
was
as
though
a
stone
had
fallen
upon
him
and
crushed
him
forever
returning
home
he
thrust
his
travellingbag
under
the
bed
without
a
word
and
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
fixed
he
was
the
first
to
appear
at
the
appointed
spot
to
meet
shatov
though
its
true
he
still
had
his
passport
in
his
pocket

v
a
wanderer
i
the
catastrophe
with
liza
and
the
death
of
marya
timofyevna
made
an
overwhelming
impression
on
shatov
i
have
already
mentioned
that
that
morning
i
met
him
in
passing
he
seemed
to
me
not
himself
he
told
me
among
other
things
that
on
the
evening
before
at
nine
oclock
that
is
three
hours
before
the
fire
had
broken
out
he
had
been
at
marya
timofyevnas
he
went
in
the
morning
to
look
at
the
corpses
but
as
far
as
i
know
gave
no
evidence
of
any
sort
that
morning
meanwhile
towards
the
end
of
the
day
there
was
a
perfect
tempest
in
his
soul
and
i
think
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
there
was
a
moment
at
dusk
when
he
wanted
to
get
up
go
out
and
tell
everything
what
that
everything
was
no
one
but
he
could
say
of
course
he
would
have
achieved
nothing
and
would
have
simply
betrayed
himself
he
had
no
proofs
whatever
with
which
to
convict
the
perpetrators
of
the
crime
and
indeed
he
had
nothing
but
vague
conjectures
to
go
upon
though
to
him
they
amounted
to
complete
certainty
but
he
was
ready
to
ruin
himself
if
he
could
only
crush
the
scoundrelshis
own
words
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
guessed
fairly
correctly
at
this
impulse
in
him
and
he
knew
himself
that
he
was
risking
a
great
deal
in
putting
off
the
execution
of
his
new
awful
project
till
next
day
on
his
side
there
was
as
usual
great
selfconfidence
and
contempt
for
all
these
wretched
creatures
and
for
shatov
in
particular
he
had
for
years
despised
shatov
for
his
whining
idiocy
as
he
had
expressed
it
in
former
days
abroad
and
he
was
absolutely
confident
that
he
could
deal
with
such
a
guileless
creature
that
is
keep
an
eye
on
him
all
that
day
and
put
a
check
on
him
at
the
first
sign
of
danger
yet
what
saved
the
scoundrels
for
a
short
time
was
something
quite
unexpected
which
they
had
not
foreseen
towards
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
at
the
very
time
when
the
quintet
was
meeting
at
erkels
and
waiting
in
indignation
and
excitement
for
pyotr
stepanovitch
shatov
was
lying
in
the
dark
on
his
bed
with
a
headache
and
a
slight
chill
he
was
tortured
by
uncertainty
he
was
angry
he
kept
making
up
his
mind
and
could
not
make
it
up
finally
and
felt
with
a
curse
that
it
would
all
lead
to
nothing
gradually
he
sank
into
a
brief
doze
and
had
something
like
a
nightmare
he
dreamt
that
he
was
lying
on
his
bed
tied
up
with
cords
and
unable
to
stir
and
meantime
he
heard
a
terrible
banging
that
echoed
all
over
the
house
a
banging
on
the
fence
at
the
gate
at
his
door
in
kirillovs
lodge
so
that
the
whole
house
was
shaking
and
a
faraway
familiar
voice
that
wrung
his
heart
was
calling
to
him
piteously
he
suddenly
woke
and
sat
up
in
bed
to
his
surprise
the
banging
at
the
gate
went
on
though
not
nearly
so
violent
as
it
had
seemed
in
his
dream
the
knocks
were
repeated
and
persistent
and
the
strange
voice
that
wrung
his
heart
could
still
be
heard
below
at
the
gate
though
not
piteously
but
angrily
and
impatiently
alternating
with
another
voice
more
restrained
and
ordinary
he
jumped
up
opened
the
casement
pane
and
put
his
head
out
whos
there
he
called
literally
numb
with
terror
if
you
are
shatov
the
answer
came
harshly
and
resolutely
from
below
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
straight
out
and
honestly
whether
you
agree
to
let
me
in
or
not
it
was
true
he
recognised
the
voice
marie
is
it
you
yes
yes
marya
shatov
and
i
assure
you
i
cant
keep
the
driver
a
minute
longer
this
minute
ill
get
a
candle
shatov
cried
faintly
then
he
rushed
to
look
for
the
matches
the
matches
as
always
happens
at
such
moments
could
not
be
found
he
dropped
the
candlestick
and
the
candle
on
the
floor
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
impatient
voice
from
below
again
he
abandoned
the
search
and
dashed
down
the
steep
stairs
to
open
the
gate
be
so
good
as
to
hold
the
bag
while
i
settle
with
this
blockhead
was
how

marya
shatov
greeted
him
below
and
she
thrust
into
his
hands
a
rather
light
cheap
canvas
handbag
studded
with
brass
nails
of
dresden
manufacture
she
attacked
the
driver
with
exasperation
allow
me
to
tell
you
you
are
asking
too
much
if

driving
me

extra
hour
through
these
filthy
streets

court

five
kopecks
with
eager
haste
shatov
pulled
a
fivekopeck
piece
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
driver
do
me
a
favour
i
beg
you
dont
dare
to
do
that
madame
shatov
flared
up
but
the
driver
drove
off
and
shatov
taking
her
hand
drew
her
through
the
gate
make
haste
marie

excuse
my
having
no
light
one
minute
he
picked
up
the
candlestick
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
matches
were
found
madame
shatov
stood
waiting
in
the
middle
of
the
room
silent
and
motionless
thank
god
here
they
are
at
last
he
cried
joyfully
lighting
up
the
room
marya
shatov
took
a
cursory
survey
of
his
abode
they
told
me
you
lived
in
a
poor
way
but
i
didnt
expect
it
to
be
as
bad
as
this
she
pronounced
with
an
air
of
disgust
and
she
moved
towards
the
bed
oh
i
am
tired
she
sat
down
on
the
hard
bed
with
an
exhausted
air
please
put
down
the
bag
and
sit
down
on
the
chair
yourself
just
as
you
like
though
you
are
in
the
way
standing
there
i
have
come
to
you
for
a
time
till
i
can
get
work
because
i
know
nothing
of
this
place
and
i
have
no
money
but
if
i
shall
be
in
your
way
i
beg
you
again
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
so
at
once
as
you
are
bound
to
do
if
you
are
an
honest
man
i
could
sell
something
tomorrow
and
pay
for
a
room
at
an
hotel
but
you
must
take
me
to
the
hotel
yourself
oh
but
i
am
tired
shatov
was
all
of
a
tremor
you
mustnt
marie
you
mustnt
go
to
an
hotel
an
hotel
what
for
what
for
he
clasped
his
hands
imploringly
well
if
i
can
get
on
without
the
hotel
i
must
any
way
explain
the
position
remember
shatov
that
we
lived
in
geneva
as
man
and
wife
for
a
fortnight
and
a
few
days
its
three
years
since
we
parted
without
any
particular
quarrel
though
but
dont
imagine
that
ive
come
back
to
renew
any
of
the
foolishness
of
the
past
ive
come
back
to
look
for
work
and
that
ive
come
straight
to
this
town
is
just
because
its
all
the
same
to
me
ive
not
come
to
say
i
am
sorry
for
anything
please
dont
imagine
anything
so
stupid
as
that
oh
marie
this
is
unnecessary
quite
unnecessary
shatov
muttered
vaguely
if
so
if
you
are
so
far
developed
as
to
be
able
to
understand
that
i
may
allow
myself
to
add
that
if
ive
come
straight
to
you
now
and
am
in
your
lodging
its
partly
because
i
always
thought
you
were
far
from
being
a
scoundrel
and
were
perhaps
much
better
than
other
blackguards
her
eyes
flashed
she
must
have
had
to
bear
a
great
deal
at
the
hands
of
some
blackguards
and
please
believe
me
i
wasnt
laughing
at
you
just
now
when
i
told
you
you
were
good
i
spoke
plainly
without
fine
phrases
and
i
cant
endure
them
but
thats
all
nonsense
i
always
hoped
you
would
have
sense
enough
not
to
pester
me
enough
i
am
tired
and
she
bent
on
him
a
long
harassed
and
weary
gaze
shatov
stood
facing
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
which
was
five
paces
away
and
listened
to
her
timidly
with
a
look
of
new
life
and
unwonted
radiance
on
his
face
this
strong
rugged
man
all
bristles
on
the
surface
was
suddenly
all
softness
and
shining
gladness
there
was
a
thrill
of
extraordinary
and
unexpected
feeling
in
his
soul
three
years
of
separation
three
years
of
the
broken
marriage
had
effaced
nothing
from
his
heart
and
perhaps
every
day
during
those
three
years
he
had
dreamed
of
her
of
that
beloved
being
who
had
once
said
to
him
i
love
you
knowing
shatov
i
can
say
with
certainty
that
he
could
never
have
allowed
himself
even
to
dream
that
a
woman
might
say
to
him
i
love
you
he
was
savagely
modest
and
chaste
he
looked
on
himself
as
a
perfect
monster
detested
his
own
face
as
well
as
his
character
compared
himself
to
some
freak
only
fit
to
be
exhibited
at
fairs
consequently
he
valued
honesty
above
everything
and
was
fanatically
devoted
to
his
convictions
he
was
gloomy
proud
easily
moved
to
wrath
and
sparing
of
words
but
here
was
the
one
being
who
had
loved
him
for
a
fortnight
that
he
had
never
doubted
never
a
being
he
had
always
considered
immeasurably
above
him
in
spite
of
his
perfectly
sober
understanding
of
her
errors
a
being
to
whom
he
could
forgive
everything
everything
of
that
there
could
be
no
question
indeed
it
was
quite
the
other
way
his
idea
was
that
he
was
entirely
to
blame
this
woman
this
marya
shatov
was
in
his
house
in
his
presence
again
it
was
almost
inconceivable
he
was
so
overcome
there
was
so
much
that
was
terrible
and
at
the
same
time
so
much
happiness
in
this
event
that
he
could
not
perhaps
would
notperhaps
was
afraid
torealise
the
position
it
was
a
dream
but
when
she
looked
at
him
with
that
harassed
gaze
he
suddenly
understood
that
this
woman
he
loved
so
dearly
was
suffering
perhaps
had
been
wronged
his
heart
went
cold
he
looked
at
her
features
with
anguish
the
first
bloom
of
youth
had
long
faded
from
this
exhausted
face
its
true
that
she
was
still
goodlookingin
his
eyes
a
beauty
as
she
had
always
been
in
reality
she
was
a
woman
of
twentyfive
rather
strongly
built
above
the
medium
height
taller
than
shatov
with
abundant
dark
brown
hair
a
pale
oval
face
and
large
dark
eyes
now
glittering
with
feverish
brilliance
but
the
lighthearted
nave
and
goodnatured
energy
he
had
known
so
well
in
the
past
was
replaced
now
by
a
sullen
irritability
and
disillusionment
a
sort
of
cynicism
which
was
not
yet
habitual
to
her
herself
and
which
weighed
upon
her
but
the
chief
thing
was
that
she
was
ill
that
he
could
see
clearly
in
spite
of
the
awe
in
which
he
stood
of
her
he
suddenly
went
up
to
her
and
took
her
by
both
hands
marie
you
know
you
are
very
tired
perhaps
for
gods
sake

directly
he
waved
his
hand
as
though
with
desperate
determination
and
snatched
up
his
cap
where
are
you
going

revolver
and
he
rushed
straight
to
kirillovs
this
was
probably
two
hours
before
the
visit
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
liputin
to
kirillov
though
shatov

yard
they
hardly

other
and

habit
of

all

and

intently
at
his
hurried
visitor

much
surprise

kirillov
cried
shatov
taking
the
teapot
under
his
arm
and
carrying
the
bread
and
sugar
in
both
hands
kirillov
if

your
wife
marya
shatov
was
unmistakably
pleased
at
her
husbands
haste
and
fell
upon
the
tea
almost
greedily
but
there
was
no
need
to
run
for
the
samovar
she
drank
only
half
a
cup
and
swallowed
a
tiny
piece
of
bread
the
veal
she
refused
with
disgust
and
irritation
you
are
ill
marie
all
this
is
a
sign
of
illness
shatov
remarked
timidly
as
he
waited
upon
her
of
course
im
ill
please

down
where
did
you

a
slavophil
he
smiled
a
wry
smile
with
the
effort
of
one
who
feels
he
has
made
a
strained
and
inappropriate
jest

i
only
meant
to
say
that
now
we
are
only
two
in
the
yard
but
that
the
lebyadkins
used
to
live
downstairs
that
woman
who
was
murdered
last
night
she
started
suddenly
i
heard
of
it
i
heard
of
it
as
soon
as
i
arrived
there
was
a
fire
here
wasnt
there
yes
marie
yes
and
perhaps
i
am
doing
a
scoundrelly
thing
this
moment
in
forgiving
the
scoundrels
he
stood
up
suddenly
and
paced
about
the
room
raising
his
arms
as
though
in
a
frenzy
but
marie
had
not
quite
understood
him
she
heard
his
answers
inattentively
she
asked
questions
but
did
not
listen
fine
things
are
being
done
among
you
oh
how
contemptible
it
all
is
what
scoundrels
men
all
are
but
do
sit
down
i
beg
you
oh
how
you
exasperate
me
and
she
let
her
head
sink
on
the
pillow
exhausted
marie
i
wont
perhaps
youll
lie
down
marie
she
made
no
answer
and
closed
her
eyes
helplessly
her
pale
face
looked
deathlike
she
fell
asleep
almost
instantly
shatov
looked
round
snuffed
the
candle
looked
uneasily
at
her
face
once
more
pressed
his
hands
tight
in
front
of
him
and
walked
on
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
into
the
passage
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
stood
in
the
corner
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
remained
so
for
ten
minutes
without
sound
or
movement
he
would
have
stood
there
longer
but
he
suddenly
caught
the
sound
of
soft
cautious
steps
below
someone
was
coming
up
the
stairs
shatov
remembered
he
had
forgotten
to
fasten
the
gate
whos
there
he
asked
in
a
whisper
the
unknown
visitor
went
on
slowly
mounting
the
stairs
without
answering
when
he
reached
the
top
he
stood
still
it
was
impossible
to
see
his
face
in
the
dark
suddenly
shatov
heard
the
cautious
question
ivan
shatov
shatov
said
who
he
was
but
at
once
held
out
his
hand
to
check
his
advance
the
latter
took
his
hand
and
shatov
shuddered
as
though
he
had
touched
some
terrible
reptile
stand
here
he
whispered
quickly
dont
go
in
i
cant
receive
you
just
now
my
wife
has
come
back
ill
fetch
the
candle
when
he
returned
with
the
candle
he
found
a
young
officer
standing
there
he
did
not
know
his
name
but
he
had
seen
him
before
erkel
said
the
lad
introducing
himself
youve
seen
me
at
virginskys
i
remember
you
sat
writing
listen
said
shatov
in
sudden
excitement
going
up
to
him
frantically
but
still
talking
in
a
whisper
you
gave
me
a
sign
just
now
when
you
took
my
hand
but
you
know
i
can
treat
all
these
signals
with
contempt
i
dont
acknowledge
them
i
dont
want
them
i
can
throw
you
downstairs
this
minute
do
you
know
that
no
i
know
nothing
about
that
and
i
dont
know
what
you
are
in
such
a
rage
about
the
visitor
answered
without
malice
and
almost
ingenuously
i
have
only
to
give
you
a
message
and
thats
what
ive
come
for
being
particularly
anxious
not
to
lose
time
you
have
a
printing
press
which
does
not
belong
to
you
and
of
which
you
are
bound
to
give
an
account
as
you
know
yourself
i
have
received
instructions
to
request
you
to
give
it
up
tomorrow
at
seven
oclock
in
the
evening
to
liputin

have
been
instructed
to
tell
you
also
that
nothing
more
will
be
asked
of
you
nothing
absolutely
nothing
your
request
is
granted
and
you
are
struck
off
our
list
i
was
instructed
to
tell
you
that
positively
who
instructed
you
to
tell
me
those
who
told
me
the
sign

abroad

i
think

no
matter
to
you
oh

why
didnt
you
come
before

you
were

understand
i
understand
that
you
were
not
alone
eh
hang
it
but
why
didnt
liputin
come
himself
so
i
shall
come
for
you
tomorrow
at
exactly
six
oclock
in
the
evening
and
well

there
on
foot

be
there
no
he
wont
verhovensky
is
leaving
the
town
at
eleven
oclock
tomorrow
morning
just
what
i
thought
shatov
whispered
furiously
and
he
struck
his
fist
on
his
hip
hes
run
off
the
sneak
he
sank
into
agitated
reflection
erkel
looked
intently
at
him
and
waited
in
silence
but
how
will
you
take
it
you
cant
simply
pick
it
up
in
your
hands
and
carry
it
there
will
be
no
need
to
youll
simply
point
out
the
place
and
well
just
make
sure
that
it
really
is
buried
there
we
only
know
whereabouts
the
place
is
we
dont
know
the
place
itself
and
have
you
pointed
the
place
out
to
anyone
else
yet
shatov
looked
at
him
you
you
a
chit
of
a
boy
like
you
a
silly
boy
like
you
you
too
have
got
caught
in
that
net
like
a
sheep
yes
thats
just
the
young
blood
they
want
well
go
along
eech
that
scoundrels
taken
you
all
in
and
run
away
erkel
looked
at
him
serenely
and
calmly
but
did
not
seem
to
understand
verhovensky
verhovensky
has
run
away
shatov
growled
fiercely
but
he
is
still
here
he
is
not
gone
away
he
is
not
going
till
tomorrow
erkel
observed
softly
and
persuasively
i
particularly
begged
him
to
be
present
as
a
witness
my
instructions
all
referred
to
him
he
explained
frankly
like
a
young
and
inexperienced
boy
but
i
regret
to
say
he
did
not
agree
on
the
ground
of
his
departure
and
he
really
is
in
a
hurry
shatov
glanced
compassionately
at
the
simple
youth
again
but
suddenly
gave
a
gesture
of
despair
as
though
he
thought
they
are
not
worth
pitying
all
right
ill
come
he
cut
him
short
and
now
get
away
be
off
so
ill
come
for
you
at
six
oclock
punctually
erkel
made
a
courteous
bow
and
walked
deliberately
downstairs
little
fool
shatov
could
not
help
shouting
after
him
from
the
top
what
is
it
responded
the
lad
from
the
bottom
nothing
you
can
go
i
thought
you
said
something
ii
erkel
was
a
little
fool
who
was
only
lacking
in
the
higher
form
of
reason
the
ruling
power
of
the
intellect
but
of
the
lesser
the
subordinate
reasoning
faculties
he
had
plentyeven
to
the
point
of
cunning
fanatically
childishly
devoted
to
the
cause
or
rather
in
reality
to
pyotr
verhovensky
he
acted
on
the
instructions
given
to
him
when
at
the
meeting
of
the
quintet
they
had
agreed
and
had
distributed
the
various
duties
for
the
next
day
when
pyotr
stepanovitch
gave
him
the
job
of
messenger
he
succeeded
in
talking
to
him
aside
for
ten
minutes
a
craving
for
active
service
was
characteristic
of
this
shallow
unreflecting
nature
which
was
forever
yearning
to
follow
the
lead
of
another
mans
will
of
course
for
the
good
of
the
common
or
the
great
cause
not
that
that
made
any
difference
for
little
fanatics
like
erkel
can
never
imagine
serving
a
cause
except
by
identifying
it
with
the
person
who
to
their
minds
is
the
expression
of
it
the
sensitive
affectionate
and
kindhearted
erkel
was
perhaps
the
most
callous
of
shatovs
wouldbe
murderers
and
though
he
had
no
personal
spite
against
him
he
would
have
been
present
at
his
murder
without
the
quiver
of
an
eyelid
he
had
been
instructed
for
instance
to
have
a
good
look
at
shatovs
surroundings
while
carrying
out
his
commission
and
when
shatov
receiving
him
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
blurted
out
to
him
probably
unaware
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
that
his
wife
had
come
back
to
himerkel
had
the
instinctive
cunning
to
avoid
displaying
the
slightest
curiosity
though
the
idea
flashed
through
his
mind
that
the
fact
of
his
wifes
return
was
of
great
importance
for
the
success
of
their
undertaking
and
so
it
was
in
reality
it
was
only
that
fact
that
saved
the
scoundrels
from
shatovs
carrying
out
his
intention
and
at
the
same
time
helped
them
to
get
rid
of
him
to
begin
with
it
agitated
shatov
threw
him
out
of
his
regular
routine
and
deprived
him
of
his
usual
clearsightedness
and
caution
any
idea
of
his
own
danger
would
be
the
last
thing
to
enter
his
head
at
this
moment
when
he
was
absorbed
with
such
different
considerations
on
the
contrary
he
eagerly
believed
that
pyotr
verhovensky
was
running
away
the
next
day
it
fell
in
exactly
with
his
suspicions
returning
to
the
room
he
sat
down
again
in
a
corner
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
bitter
thoughts
tormented
him
then
he
would
raise
his
head
again
and
go
on
tiptoe
to
look
at
her
good
god
she
will
be
in
a
fever
by
tomorrow
morning
perhaps
its
begun
already
she
must
have
caught
cold
she
is
not
accustomed
to
this
awful
climate
and
then
a
thirdclass
carriage
the
storm
the
rain
and
she
has
such
a
thin
little
pelisse
no
wrap
at
all
and
to
leave
her
like
this
to
abandon
her
in
her
helplessness
her
bag
too
her
bagwhat
a
tiny
light
thing
all
crumpled
up
scarcely
weighs
ten
pounds
poor
thing
how
worn
out
she
is
how
much
shes
been
through
she
is
proud
thats
why
she
wont
complain
but
she
is
irritable
very
irritable
its
illness
an
angel
will
grow
irritable
in
illness
what
a
dry
forehead
it
must
be
hothow
dark
she
is
under
the
eyes
and
and
yet
how
beautiful
the
oval
of
her
face
is
and
her
rich
hair
how
and
he
made
haste
to
turn
away
his
eyes
to
walk
away
as
though
he
were
frightened
at
the
very
idea
of
seeing
in
her
anything
but
an
unhappy
exhausted
fellowcreature
who
needed
helphow
could
he
think
of
hopes
oh
how
mean
how
base
is
man
and
he
would
go
back
to
his
corner
sit
down
hide
his
face
in
his
hands
and
again
sink
into
dreams
and
reminiscences
and
again
he
was
haunted
by
hopes
oh
i
am
tired
i
am
tired
he
remembered
her
exclamations
her
weak
broken
voice
good
god
abandon
her
now
and
she
has
only
eighty
kopecks
she
held
out
her
purse
a
tiny
old
thing
shes
come
to
look
for
a
job
what
does
she
know
about
jobs
what
do
they
know
about
russia
why
they
are
like
naughty
children
theyve
nothing
but
their
own
fancies
made
up
by
themselves
and
she
is
angry
poor
thing
that
russia
is
not
like
their
foreign
dreams
the
luckless
innocent
creatures
its
really
cold
here
though
he
remembered
that
she
had
complained
that
he
had
promised
to
heat
the
stove
there
are
logs
here
i
can
fetch
them
if
only
i
dont
wake
her
but
i
can
do
it
without
waking
her
but
what
shall
i
do
about
the
veal
when
she
gets
up
perhaps
she
will
be
hungry
well
that
will
do
later
kirillov
doesnt
go
to
bed
all
night
what
could
i
cover
her
with
she
is
sleeping
so
soundly
but
she
must
be
cold
ah
she
must
be
cold
and
once
more
he
went
to
look
at
her
her
dress
had
worked
up
a
little
and
her
right
leg
was
half
uncovered
to
the
knee
he
suddenly
turned
away
almost
in
dismay
took
off
his
warm
overcoat
and
remaining
in
his
wretched
old
jacket
covered
it
up
trying
not
to
look
at
it
a
great
deal
of
time
was
spent
in
righting
the
fire
stepping
about
on
tiptoe
looking
at
the
sleeping
woman
dreaming
in
the
corner
then
looking
at
her
again
two
or
three
hours
had
passed
during
that
time
verhovensky
and
liputin
had
been
at
kirillovs
at
last
he
too
began
to
doze
in
the
corner
he
heard
her
groan
she
waked
up
and
called
him
he
jumped
up
like
a
criminal
marie
i
was
dropping
asleep
ah
what
a
wretch
i
am
marie
she
sat
up
looking
about
her
with
wonder
seeming
not
to
recognise
where
she
was
and
suddenly
leapt
up
in
indignation

once
and

corner

floor

i
want
to
lie
on
the
floor
at
once
at
once
she
stood
up
tried
to
take
a
step
but
suddenly
a
violent
spasm
of
pain
deprived
her
of
all
power
and
all
determination
and
with
a
loud
groan
she
fell
back
on
the
bed
shatov
ran
up
but
marie
hiding
her
face
in
the
pillow
seized
his
hand
and
gripped
and
squeezed
it
with
all
her
might
this
lasted
a
minute
marie
darling
theres
a
doctor
frenzel
living
here
a
friend
of
mine
i
could
run
for
him
nonsense
what
do
you
mean
by
nonsense
tell
me
marie
what
is
it
hurting
you
for
we
might
try
fomentations
on
the
stomach
for
instance
i
can
do
that
without
a
doctor
or
else
mustard
poultices
whats
this
she
asked
strangely
raising
her
head
and
looking
at
him
in
dismay
whats
what
marie
said
shatov
not
understanding
what
are
you
asking
about
good
heavens
i
am
quite
bewildered
excuse
my
not
understanding
ach
let
me
alone
its
not
your
business
to
understand
and
it
would
be
too
absurd
she
said
with
a
bitter
smile
talk
to
me
about
something
walk
about
the
room
and
talk
dont
stand
over
me
and
dont
look
at
me
i
particularly
ask
you
that
for
the
fivehundredth
time
shatov
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
looking
at
the
floor
and
doing
his
utmost
not
to
glance
at
her
theresdont
be
angry
marie
i
entreat
youtheres
some
veal
here
and
theres
tea
not
far
off
you
had
so
little
before
she
made
an
angry
gesture
of
disgust
shatov
bit
his
tongue
in
despair
listen
i
intend
to
open
a
bookbinding
business
here
on
rational
cooperative
principles
since
you
live
here
what
do
you
think
of
it
would
it
be
successful
ech
marie
people
dont
read
books
here
and
there
are
none
here
at
all
and
are
they
likely
to
begin
binding
them
who
are
they
the
local
readers
and
inhabitants
generally
marie
well
then
speak
more
clearly
they
indeed
and
one
doesnt
know
who
they
are
you
dont
know
grammar
its
in
the
spirit
of
the
language
shatov
muttered
oh
get
along
with
your
spirit
you
bore
me
why
shouldnt
the
local
inhabitant
or
reader
have
his
books
bound
because
reading
books
and
having
them
bound
are
two
different
stages
of
development
and
theres
a
vast
gulf
between
them
to
begin
with
a
man
gradually
gets
used
to
reading
in
the
course
of
ages
of
course
but
takes
no
care
of
his
books
and
throws
them
about
not
thinking
them
worth
attention
but
binding
implies
respect
for
books
and
implies
that
not
only
he
has
grown
fond
of
reading
but
that
he
looks
upon
it
as
something
of
value
that
period
has
not
been
reached
anywhere
in
russia
yet
in
europe
books
have
been
bound
for
a
long
while
though
thats
pedantic
anyway
its
not
stupid
and
reminds
me
of
the
time
three
years
ago
you
used
to
be
rather
clever
sometimes
three
years
ago
she
said
this
as
disdainfully
as
her
other
capricious
remarks
marie
marie
said
shatov
turning
to
her
much
moved
oh
marie
if
you
only
knew
how
much
has
happened
in
those
three
years
i
heard
afterwards
that
you
despised
me
for
changing
my
convictions
but
what
are
the
men
ive
broken
with
the
enemies
of
all
true
life
outofdate
liberals
who
are
afraid
of
their
own
independence
the
flunkeys
of
thought
the
enemies
of
individuality
and
freedom
the
decrepit
advocates
of
deadness
and
rottenness
all
they
have
to
offer
is
senility
a
glorious
mediocrity
of
the
most
bourgeois
kind
contemptible
shallowness
a
jealous
equality
equality
without
individual
dignity
equality
as
its
understood
by
flunkeys
or
by
the
french
in
93
and
the
worst
of
it
is
there
are
swarms
of
scoundrels
among
them
swarms
of
scoundrels
yes
there
are
a
lot
of
scoundrels
she
brought
out
abruptly
with
painful
effort
she
lay
stretched
out
motionless
as
though
afraid
to
move
with
her
head
thrown
back
on
the
pillow
rather
on
one
side
staring
at
the
ceiling
with
exhausted
but
glowing
eyes
her
face
was
pale
her
lips
were
dry
and
hot
you
recognise
it
marie
you
recognise
it
cried
shatov
she
tried
to
shake
her
head
and
suddenly
the
same
spasm
came
over
her
again
again
she
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
again
for
a
full
minute
she
squeezed
shatovs
hand
till
it
hurt
he
had
run
up
beside
himself
with
alarm
marie
marie
but
it
may
be
very
serious
marie
be
quiet
i
wont
have
it
i
wont
have
it
she
screamed
almost
furiously
turning
her
face
upwards
again
dont
dare
to
look
at
me
with
your
sympathy
walk
about
the
room
say
something
talk
shatov
began
muttering
something
again
like
one
distraught
what
do
you
do
here
she
asked
interrupting
him
with
contemptuous
impatience
i
work
in
a
merchants
office
i
could
get
a
fair
amount
of
money
even
here
if
i
cared
to
marie
so
much
the
better
for
you
oh
dont
suppose
i
meant
anything
marie
i
said
it
without
thinking
and
what
do
you
do
besides
what
are
you
preaching
you
cant
exist
without
preaching
thats
your
character
i
am
preaching
god
marie
in
whom
you
dont
believe
yourself
i
never
could
see
the
idea
of
that
lets
leave
that
marie
well
talk
of
that
later
what
sort
of
person
was
this
marya
timofyevna
here
well
talk
of
that
later
too
marie
dont
dare
to
say
such
things
to
me
is
it
true
that
her
death
may
have
been
caused
by
the
wickedness
of
these
people
not
a
doubt
of
it
growled
shatov
marie
suddenly
raised
her
head
and
cried
out
painfully
dont
dare
speak
of
that
to
me
again
dont
dare
to
never
never
and
she
fell
back
in
bed
again
overcome
by
the
same
convulsive
agony
it
was
the
third
time
but
this
time
her
groans
were
louder
in
fact
she
screamed
oh
you
insufferable
man
oh
you
unbearable
man
she
cried
tossing
about
recklessly
and
pushing
away
shatov
as
he
bent
over
her
marie
ill
do
anything
you
like
ill
walk
about
and
talk
surely
you
must
see
that
it
has
begun
whats
begun
marie
how
can
i
tell
do
i
know
anything
about
it
i
curse
myself
oh
curse
it
all
from
the
beginning
marie
if
youd
tell
me
whats
beginning
or
else
i
if
you
dont
what
am
i
to
make
of
it
you
are
a
useless
theoretical
babbler
oh
curse
everything
on
earth
marie
marie
he
seriously
thought
that
she
was
beginning
to
go
mad
surely
you
must
see
that
i
am
in
the
agonies
of
childbirth
she
said
sitting
up
and
gazing
at
him
with
a
terrible
hysterical
vindictiveness
that
distorted
her
whole
face
i
curse
him
before
he
is
born
this
child
marie
cried
shatov
realising
at
last
what
it
meant
marie
but
why
didnt
you
tell
me
before
he
pulled
himself
together
at
once
and
seized
his
cap
with
an
air
of
vigorous
determination
how
could
i
tell
when
i
came
in
here
should
i
have
come
to
you
if
id
known
i
was
told
it
would
be
another
ten
days
where

you
going
where
are
you
going
you
mustnt

to
fetch
a
midwife

revolver

get

to

to

the
better

a
midwife
and
an
old
woman
too
but
how
am
i
to
leave
you
alone
marie
but
reflecting
that
it
was
better
to
leave
her
alone
now
in
spite
of
her
desperate
state
than
to
leave
her
without
help
later
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
groans
nor
her
angry
exclamations
but
rushed
downstairs
hurrying
all
he
could
iii
first
of
all
he
went
to
kirillov
it
was
by
now
about
one
oclock
in
the
night
kirillov
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
kirillov
my
wife

in
childbirth

a
lot
of
old
women
very
sorry
that
i
am
no
good
at
childbearing
kirillov
answered
thoughtfully
that
is
not
at
childbearing
but
at
doing
anything
for
childbearing
or
no
i
dont
know
how
to
say
it
you
mean
you
cant
assist
at
a
confinement
yourself
but
thats
not
what
ive
come
for
an
old
woman
i
want
a
woman
a
nurse
a
servant
you
shall
have
an
old
woman
but
not
directly
perhaps
if
you
like
ill
come
instead
oh
impossible
i
am
running
to
madame
virginsky
the
midwife
now
a
horrid
woman
oh
yes
kirillov
yes
but
she
is
the
best
of
them
all
yes
itll
all
be
without
reverence
without
gladness
with
contempt
with
abuse
with
blasphemy
in
the
presence
of
so
great
a
mystery
the
coming
of
a
new
creature
oh
she
is
cursing
it
already
if
you
like
ill
no

but
while
im
running
oh

madame
virginsky
come

you
go
to
the
foot
of
my
staircase
and
quietly

but
dont
venture
to
go
in
youll
frighten
her
dont
go
in
on
any
account
you
must
only
listen
in
case
anything
dreadful
happens
if
anything
very
bad
happens
then
run
in
i
understand
ive
another
rouble
here
it
is
i
meant
to
have
a
fowl
tomorrow
but
now
i
dont
want
to
make
haste
run
with
all
your
might
theres
a
samovar
all
the
night
kirillov
knew
nothing
of
the
present
design
against
shatov
nor
had
he
had
any
idea
in
the
past
of
the
degree
of
danger
that
threatened
him
he
only
knew
that
shatov
had
some
old
scores
with
those
people
and
although
he
was
to
some
extent
involved
with
them
himself
through
instructions
he
had
received
from
abroad
not
that
these
were
of
much
consequence
however
for
he
had
never
taken
any
direct
share
in
anything
yet
of
late
he
had
given
it
all
up
having
left
off
doing
anything
especially
for
the
cause
and
devoted
himself
entirely
to
a
life
of
contemplation
although
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
at
the
meeting
invited
liputin
to
go
with
him
to
kirillovs
to
make
sure
that
the
latter
would
take
upon
himself
at
a
given
moment
the
responsibility
for
the
shatov
business
yet
in
his
interview
with
kirillov
he
had
said
no
word
about
shatov
nor
alluded
to
him
in
any
wayprobably
considering
it
impolitic
to
do
so
and
thinking
that
kirillov
could
not
be
relied
upon
he
put
off
speaking
about
it
till
next
day
when
it
would
be
all
over
and
would
therefore
not
matter
to
kirillov
such
at
least
was
pyotr
stepanovitchs
judgment
of
him
liputin
too
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
shatov
was
not
mentioned
in
spite
of
what
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
promised
but
he
was
too
much
agitated
to
protest
shatov
ran
like
a
hurricane
to
virginskys
house
cursing
the
distance
and
feeling
it
endless
he
had
to
knock
a
long
time
at
virginskys
every
one
had
been
asleep
a
long
while
but
shatov
did
not
scruple
to
bang
at
the
shutters
with
all
his
might
the
dog
chained
up
in
the
yard
dashed
about
barking
furiously
the
dogs
caught
it
up
all
along
the
street
and
there
was
a
regular
babel
of
barking
why
are
you
knocking
and
what
do
you
want
shatov
heard
at
the
window
at
last
virginskys
gentle
voice
betraying
none
of
the
resentment
appropriate
to
the
outrage
the
shutter
was
pushed
back
a
little
and
the
casement
was
opened
whos
there
what
scoundrel
is
it
shrilled
a
female
voice
which
betrayed
all
the
resentment
appropriate
to
the
outrage
it
was
the
old
maid
virginskys
relation
i
am
shatov
my
wife
has
come
back
to
me
and
she
is
just
confined
well
let
her
be
get
along
ive
come
for
arina
prohorovna
i
wont
go
without
arina
prohorovna
she
cant
attend
to
every
one
practice
at
night
is
a
special
line
take
yourself
off
to
maksheyevs
and
dont
dare
to
make
that
din
rattled
the
exasperated
female
voice
he
could
hear
virginsky
checking
her
but
the
old
maid
pushed
him
away
and
would
not
desist
i
am
not
going
away
shatov
cried
again
wait
a
little
wait
a
little
virginsky
cried
at
last
overpowering
the
lady
i
beg
you
to
wait
five
minutes
shatov
ill
wake
arina
prohorovna
please
dont
knock
and
dont
shout
oh
how
awful
it
all
is
after
five
endless
minutes
arina
prohorovna
made
her
appearance
has
your
wife
come
shatov
heard
her
voice
at
the
window
and
to
his
surprise
it
was
not
at
all
illtempered
only
as
usual
peremptory
but
arina
prohorovna
could
not
speak
except
in
a
peremptory
tone
yes
my
wife
and
she
is
in
labour
marya
ignatyevna
yes
marya
ignatyevna
of
course
its
marya
ignatyevna
a
silence
followed
shatov
waited
he
heard
a
whispering
in
the
house
has
she
been
here
long
madame
virginsky
asked
again
she
came
this
evening
at
eight
oclock
please
make
haste
again
he
heard
whispering
as
though
they
were
consulting
listen
you
are
not
making
a
mistake
did
she
send
you
for
me
herself
no
she
didnt
send
for
you
she
wants
a
peasant
woman
so
as
not
to
burden
me
with
expense
but
dont
be
afraid
ill
pay
you
very
good
ill
come
whether
you
pay
or
not
i
always
thought
highly
of
marya
ignatyevna
for
the
independence
of
her
sentiments
though
perhaps
she
wont
remember
me
have
you
got
the
most
necessary
things
ive
nothing
but
ill
get
everything
everything
there
is
something
generous
even
in
these
people
shatov
reflected
as
he
set
off
to
lyamshins
the
convictions
and
the
man
are
two
very
different
things
very
likely
ive
been
very
unfair
to
them
we
are
all
to
blame
we
are
all
to
blame
and
if
only
all
were
convinced
of
it
he
had
not
to
knock
long
at
lyamshins
the
latter
to
shatovs
surprise
opened
his
casement
at
once
jumping
out
of
bed
barefoot
and
in
his
nightclothes
at
the
risk
of
catching
cold
and
he
was
hypochondriacal
and
always
anxious
about
his
health
but
there
was
a
special
cause
for
such
alertness
and
haste
lyamshin
had
been
in
a
tremor
all
the
evening
and
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
for
excitement
after
the
meeting
of
the
quintet
he
was
haunted
by
the
dread
of
uninvited
and
undesired
visitors
the
news
of
shatovs
giving
information
tormented
him
more
than
anything
and
suddenly
there
was
this
terrible
loud
knocking
at
the
window
as
though
to
justify
his
fears
he
was
so
frightened
at
seeing
shatov
that
he
at
once
slammed
the
casement
and
jumped
back
into
bed
shatov
began
furiously
knocking
and
shouting
how
dare
you
knock
like
that
in
the
middle
of
the
night
shouted
lyamshin
in
a
threatening
voice
though
he
was
numb
with
fear
when
at
least
two
minutes
later
he
ventured
to
open
the
casement
again
and
was
at
last
convinced
that
shatov
had
come
alone
heres
your
revolver
for
you
take
it
back
give
me
fifteen
roubles
whats
the
matter

minute

my
rug
over

roubles

once
if

and

most
reason
to
be
afraid
of
the
police

or

and
you

hold
such
contemptible
opinions

hinting
at
stop

gods
sake

on
knocking
upon
my
word
who

money
at
night
what
do

for
unless
you

drunk
my
wife
has
come

taken
ten
roubles
off
the
price
i
havent
fired
it
once
take
the
revolver
take
it
this
minute
lyamshin
mechanically
put
his
hand
out
of
the
casement
and
took
the
revolver
he
waited
a
little
and
suddenly
thrusting
his
head
out
of
the
casement
and
with
a
shiver
running
down
his
spine
faltered
as
though
he
were
beside
himself
you
are
lying
your
wife
hasnt
come
back
to
you
its
its
simply
that

fool

to

pyotr
verhovensky
to
run
away
not
for
me
ive
just
been
to
the
midwife
madame
virginsky
and
she
consented
at
once
to
come
to
me
you
can
ask
them
my
wife
is
in
agony
i
need
the
money
give
it
me
a
swarm
of
ideas
flared
up
in
lyamshins
crafty
mind
like
a
shower
of
fireworks
it
all
suddenly
took
a
different
colour
though
still
panic
prevented
him
from
reflecting
but
how
you
are
not
living
with
your
wife
ill
break
your
skull
for
questions
like
that
oh
dear
i
understand
forgive
me
i
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
but

prohorovna

just
now
that

not
true

lie

not
a
fool
excuse

i
really
cant
and
utterly
distraught
he
began
shutting
the
casement
again
for
the
third
time
but
shatov
gave
such
a
yell
that
he
put
his
head
out
again
but
this
is
simply
an
unprovoked
assault
what
do

want
of
me
what
is

furiously
at

windowframe
for
the
third

he
held
a
note
to
him
out
of
the
window
shatov
seized
itit
was
a
note
for
five
roubles

wont
he
was
in
a
perfect
frenzy
desperate
and
perspiring
the
two
notes
he
had
just
given
him
were
each
for
a
rouble
shatov
had
seven
roubles
altogether
now
well
damn

other
eight

at
home
you
fool
lyamshin
reflected
quickly
stay
stay
he
shouted
frantically
after
shatov
who
was
already
running
off
stay
come
back
tell
me
please
is
it
true
what
you
said
that
your
wife
has
come
back
fool
cried
shatov
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
and
ran
home
as
hard
as
he
could
iv
i
may
mention
that
anna
prohorovna
knew
nothing
of
the
resolutions
that
had
been
taken
at
the
meeting
the
day
before
on
returning
home
overwhelmed
and
exhausted
virginsky
had
not
ventured
to
tell
her
of
the
decision
that
had
been
taken
yet
he
could
not
refrain
from
telling
her
halfthat
is
all
that
verhovensky
had
told
them
of
the
certainty
of
shatovs
intention
to
betray
them
but
he
added
at
the
same
time
that
he
did
not
quite
believe
it
arina
prohorovna
was
terribly
alarmed
this
was
why
she
decided
at
once
to
go
when
shatov
came
to
fetch
her
though
she
was
tired
out
as
she
had
been
hard
at
work
at
a
confinement
all
the
night
before
she
had
always
been
convinced
that
a
wretched
creature
like
shatov
was
capable
of
any
political
baseness
but
the
arrival
of
marya
ignatyevna
put
things
in
a
different
light
shatovs
alarm
the
despairing
tone
of
his
entreaties
the
way
he
begged
for
help
clearly
showed
a
complete
change
of
feeling
in
the
traitor
a
man
who
was
ready
to
betray
himself
merely
for
the
sake
of
ruining
others
would
she
thought
have
had
a
different
air
and
tone
in
short
arina
prohorovna
resolved
to
look
into
the
matter
for
herself
with
her
own
eyes
virginsky
was
very
glad
of
her
decision
he
felt
as
though
a
hundredweight
had
been
lifted
off
him
he
even
began
to
feel
hopeful
shatovs
appearance
seemed
to
him
utterly
incompatible
with
verhovenskys
supposition
shatov
was
not
mistaken
on
getting
home
he
found
arina
prohorovna
already
with
marie
she
had
just
arrived
had
contemptuously
dismissed
kirillov
whom
she
found
hanging
about
the
foot
of
the
stairs
had
hastily
introduced
herself
to
marie
who
had
not
recognised
her
as
her
former
acquaintance
found
her
in
a
very
bad
way
that
is
illtempered
irritable
and
in
a
state
of
cowardly
despair
and
within
five
minutes
had
completely
silenced
all
her
protests
why
do
you
keep
on
that
you
dont
want
an
expensive
midwife
she
was
saying
at
the
moment
when
shatov
came
in
thats
perfect
nonsense
its
a
false
idea
arising
from
the
abnormality
of
your
condition
in
the
hands
of
some
ordinary
old
woman
some
peasant
midwife
youd
have
fifty
chances
of
going
wrong
and
then
youd
have
more
bother
and
expense
than
with
a
regular
midwife
how
do
you
know
i
am
an
expensive
midwife
you
can
pay
afterwards
i
wont
charge
you
much
and
i
answer
for
my
success
you
wont
die
in
my
hands
ive
seen
worse
cases
than
yours
and
i
can
send
the
baby
to
a
foundling
asylum
tomorrow
if
you
like
and
then
to
be
brought
up
in
the
country
and
thats
all
it
will
mean
and
meantime
youll
grow
strong
again
take
up
some
rational
work
and
in
a
very
short
time
youll
repay
shatov
for
sheltering
you
and
for
the
expense
which
will
not
be
so
great
its
not
that
ive
no
right
to
be
a
burden
rational
feelings
and
worthy
of
a
citizen
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
shatov
will
spend
scarcely
anything
if
he
is
willing
to
become
ever
so
little
a
man
of
sound
ideas
instead
of
the
fantastic
person
he
is
he
has
only
not
to
do
anything
stupid
not
to
raise
an
alarm
not
to
run
about
the
town
with
his
tongue
out
if
we
dont
restrain
him
he
will
be
knocking
up
all
the
doctors
of
the
town
before
the
morning
he
waked
all
the
dogs
in
my
street
theres
no
need
of
doctors
ive
said
already
ill
answer
for
everything
you
can
hire
an
old
woman
if
you
like
to
wait
on
you
that
wont
cost
much
though
he
too
can
do
something
besides
the
silly
things
hes
been
doing
hes
got
hands
and
feet
he
can
run
to
the
chemists
without
offending
your
feelings
by
being
too
benevolent
as
though
it
were
a
case
of
benevolence
hasnt
he
brought
you
into
this
position
didnt
he
make
you
break
with
the
family
in
which
you
were
a
governess
with
the
egoistic
object
of
marrying
you
we
heard
of
it
you
know
though
he
did
run
for
me
like
one
possessed
and
yell
so
all
the
street
could
hear
i
wont
force
myself
upon
anyone
and
have
come
only
for
your
sake
on
the
principle
that
all
of
us
are
bound
to
hold
together
and
i
told
him
so
before
i
left
the
house
if
you
think
i
am
in
the
way
goodbye
i
only
hope
you
wont
have
trouble
which
might
so
easily
be
averted
and
she
positively
got
up
from
the
chair
marie
was
so
helpless
in
such
pain
andthe
truth
must
be
confessedso
frightened
of
what
was
before
her
that
she
dared
not
let
her
go
but
this
woman
was
suddenly
hateful
to
her
what
she
said
was
not
what
she
wanted
there
was
something
quite
different
in
maries
soul
yet
the
prediction
that
she
might
possibly
die
in
the
hands
of
an
inexperienced
peasant
woman
overcame
her
aversion
but
she
made
up
for
it
by
being
more
exacting
and
more
ruthless
than
ever
with
shatov
she
ended
by
forbidding
him
not
only
to
look
at
her
but
even
to
stand
facing
her
her
pains
became
more
violent
her
curses
her
abuse
became
more
and
more
frantic
ech
well
send
him
away
arina
prohorovna
rapped
out
i
dont
know
what
he
looks
like
he
is
simply
frightening
you
he
is
as
white
as
a
corpse
what
is
it
to
you
tell
me
please
you
absurd
fellow
what
a
farce
shatov
made
no
reply
he
made
up
his
mind
to
say
nothing
ive
seen
many
a
foolish
father
half
crazy
in
such
cases
but
they
at
any
rate
be
quiet
or
leave
me
to
die
dont
say
another
word
i
wont
have
it
i
wont
have
it
screamed
marie
its
impossible
not
to
say
another
word
if
you
are
not
out
of
your
mind
as
i
think
you
are
in
your
condition
we
must
talk
of
what
we
want
anyway
tell
me
have
you
anything
ready
you
answer
shatov
she
is
incapable
tell
me
whats
needed
that
means
youve
nothing
ready
she
reckoned
up
all
that
was
quite
necessary
and
one
must
do
her
the
justice
to
say
she
only
asked
for
what
was
absolutely
indispensable
the
barest
necessaries
some
things
shatov
had
marie
took
out
her
key
and
held
it
out
to
him
for
him
to
look
in
her
bag
as
his
hands
shook
he
was
longer
than
he
should
have
been
opening
the
unfamiliar
lock
marie
flew
into
a
rage
but
when
arina
prohorovna
rushed
up
to
take
the
key
from
him
she
would
not
allow
her
on
any
account
to
look
into
her
bag
and
with
peevish
cries
and
tears
insisted
that
no
one
should
open
the
bag
but
shatov
some
things
he
had
to
fetch
from
kirillovs
no
sooner
had
shatov
turned
to
go
for
them
than
she
began
frantically
calling
him
back
and
was
only
quieted
when
shatov
had
rushed
impetuously
back
from
the
stairs
and
explained
that
he
should
only
be
gone
a
minute
to
fetch
something
indispensable
and
would
be
back
at
once
well
my
lady
its
hard
to
please
you
laughed
arina
prohorovna
one
minute
he
must
stand
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
not
dare
to
look
at
you
and
the
next
he
mustnt
be
gone
for
a
minute
or
you
begin
crying
he
may
begin
to
imagine
something
come
come
dont
be
silly
dont
blubber
i
was
laughing
you
know
he
wont
dare
to
imagine
anything
tut
tut
tut
if
he
didnt
love
you
like
a
sheep
he
wouldnt
run
about
the
streets
with
his
tongue
out
and
wouldnt
have
roused
all
the
dogs
in
the
town
he
broke
my
windowframe
v
he
found
kirillov
still
pacing
up
and
down
his
room
so
preoccupied
that
he
had
forgotten
the
arrival
of
shatovs
wife
and
heard
what
he
said
without
understanding
him
oh
yes
he
recollected
suddenly
as
though
tearing
himself
with
an
effort
and
only
for
an
instant
from
some
absorbing
idea
yes
an
old
woman
a
wife
or
an
old
woman
stay
a
minute
a
wife
and
an
old
woman
is
that
it
i
remember
ive
been
the
old
woman
will
come
only
not
just
now
take
the
pillow
is
there
anything
else
yes
stay
do
you
have
moments
of
the
eternal
harmony
shatov
you
know
kirillov
you
mustnt
go
on
staying
up
every
night
kirillov
came
out
of
his
reverie
and
strange
to
say
spoke
far
more
coherently
than
he
usually
did
it
was
clear
that
he
had
formulated
it
long
ago
and
perhaps
written
it
down
there
are
secondsthey
come
five
or
six
at
a
timewhen
you
suddenly
feel
the
presence
of
the
eternal
harmony
perfectly
attained
its
something
not
earthlyi
dont
mean
in
the
sense
that
its
heavenlybut
in
that
sense
that
man
cannot
endure
it
in
his
earthly
aspect
he
must
be
physically
changed
or
die
this
feeling
is
clear
and
unmistakable
its
as
though
you
apprehend
all
nature
and
suddenly
say
yes
thats
right
god
when
he
created
the
world
said
at
the
end
of
each
day
of
creation
yes
its
right
its
good
it
its
not
being
deeply
moved
but
simply
joy
you
dont
forgive
anything
because
there
is
no
more
need
of
forgiveness
its
not
that
you
loveoh
theres
something
in
it
higher
than
lovewhats
most
awful
is
that
its
terribly
clear
and
such
joy
if
it
lasted
more
than
five
seconds
the
soul
could
not
endure
it
and
must
perish
in
those
five
seconds
i
live
through
a
lifetime
and
id
give
my
whole
life
for
them
because
they
are
worth
it
to
endure
ten
seconds
one
must
be
physically
changed
i
think
man
ought
to
give
up
having
childrenwhats
the
use
of
children
whats
the
use
of
evolution
when
the
goal
has
been
attained
in
the
gospel
it
is
written
that
there
will
be
no
childbearing
in
the
resurrection
but
that
men
will
be
like
the
angels
of
the
lord
thats
a
hint
is
your
wife
bearing
a
child
kirillov
does
this
often
happen
once
in
three
days
or
once
a
week
dont
you
have
fits
perhaps
no
well
you
will
be
careful
kirillov
ive
heard
thats
just
how
fits
begin
an
epileptic
described
exactly
that
sensation
before
a
fit
word
for
word
as
youve
done
he
mentioned
five
seconds
too
and
said
that
more
could
not
be
endured
remember
mahomets
pitcher
from
which
no
drop
of
water
was
spilt
while
he
circled
paradise
on
his
horse
that
was
a
case
of
five
seconds
too
thats
too
much
like
your
eternal
harmony
and
mahomet
was
an
epileptic
be
careful
kirillov
its
epilepsy
it
wont
have
time
kirillov
smiled
gently
vi
the
night
was
passing
shatov
was
sent
hither
and
thither
abused
called
back
marie
was
reduced
to
the
most
abject
terror
for
life
she
screamed
that
she
wanted
to
live
that
she
must
she
must
and
was
afraid
to
die
i
dont
want
to
i
dont
want
to
she
repeated
if
arina
prohorovna
had
not
been
there
things
would
have
gone
very
badly
by
degrees
she
gained
complete
control
of
the
patientwho
began
to
obey
every
word
every
order
from
her
like
a
child
arina
prohorovna
ruled
by
sternness
not
by
kindness
but
she
was
firstrate
at
her
work
it
began
to
get
light
arina
prohorovna
suddenly
imagined
that
shatov
had
just
run
out
on
to
the
stairs
to
say
his
prayers
and
began
laughing
marie
laughed
too
spitefully
malignantly
as
though
such
laughter
relieved
her
at
last
they
drove
shatov
away
altogether
a
damp
cold
morning
dawned
he
pressed
his
face
to
the
wall
in
the
corner
just
as
he
had
done
the
evening
before
when
erkel
came
he
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
afraid
to
think
but
his
mind
caught
at
every
thought
as
it
does
in
dreams
he
was
continually
being
carried
away
by
daydreams
which
snapped
off
short
like
a
rotten
thread
from
the
room
came
no
longer
groans
but
awful
animal
cries
unendurable
incredible
he
tried
to
stop
up
his
ears
but
could
not
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
repeating
unconsciously
marie
marie
then
suddenly
he
heard
a
cry
a
new
cry
which
made
shatov
start
and
jump
up
from
his
knees
the
cry
of
a
baby
a
weak
discordant
cry
he
crossed
himself
and
rushed
into
the
room
arina
prohorovna
held
in
her
hands
a
little
red
wrinkled
creature
screaming
and
moving
its
little
arms
and
legs
fearfully
helpless
and
looking
as
though
it
could
be
blown
away
by
a
puff
of
wind
but
screaming
and
seeming
to
assert
its
full
right
to
live
marie
was
lying
as
though
insensible
but
a
minute
later
she
opened
her
eyes
and
bent
a
strange
strange
look
on
shatov
it
was
something
quite
new
that
look
what
it
meant
exactly
he
was
not
able
to
understand
yet
but
he
had
never
known
such
a
look
on
her
face
before
is
it
a
boy
is
it
a
boy
she
asked
arina
prohorovna
in
an
exhausted
voice
it
is
a
boy
the
latter
shouted
in
reply
as
she
bound
up
the
child
when
she
had
bound
him
up
and
was
about
to
lay
him
across
the
bed
between
the
two
pillows
she
gave
him
to
shatov
for
a
minute
to
hold
marie
signed
to
him
on
the
sly
as
though
afraid
of
arina
prohorovna
he
understood
at
once
and
brought
the
baby
to
show
her
how
pretty
he
is
she
whispered
weakly
with
a
smile
foo
what
does
he
look
like
arina
prohorovna
laughed
gaily
in
triumph
glancing
at
shatovs
face
what
a
funny
face
you
may
be
merry
arina
prohorovna
its
a
great
joy
shatov
faltered
with
an
expression
of
idiotic
bliss
radiant
at
the
phrase
marie
had
uttered
about
the
child
where
does
the
great
joy
come
in
said
arina
prohorovna
goodhumouredly
bustling
about
clearing
up
and
working
like
a
convict
the
mysterious
coming
of
a
new
creature
a
great
and
inexplicable
mystery
and
what
a
pity
it
is
arina
prohorovna
that
you
dont
understand
it
shatov
spoke
in
an
incoherent
stupefied
and
ecstatic
way
something
seemed
to
be
tottering
in
his
head
and
welling
up
from
his
soul
apart
from
his
own
will
there
were
two
and
now
theres
a
third
human
being
a
new
spirit
finished
and
complete
unlike
the
handiwork
of
man
a
new
thought
and
a
new
love
its
positively
frightening
and
theres
nothing
grander
in
the
world
ech
what
nonsense
he
talks
its
simply
a
further
development
of
the
organism
and
theres
nothing
else
in
it
no
mystery
said
arina
prohorovna
with
genuine
and
goodhumoured
laughter
if
you
talk
like
that
every
fly
is
a
mystery
but
i
tell
you
what
superfluous
people
ought
not
to
be
born
we
must
first
remould
everything
so
that
they
wont
be
superfluous
and
then
bring
them
into
the
world
as
it
is
we
shall
have
to
take
him
to
the
foundling
the
day
after
tomorrow
though
thats
as
it
should
be
i
will
never
let
him
go
to
the
foundling
shatov
pronounced
resolutely
staring
at
the
floor
you
adopt
him
as
your
son
he
is
my
son
of
course
he
is
a
shatov
legally
he
is
a
shatov
and
theres
no
need
for
you
to
pose
as
a
humanitarian
men
cant
get
on
without
fine
words
there
there
its
all
right
but
look
here
my
friends
she
added
having
finished
clearing
up
at
last
its
time
for
me
to
go
ill
come
again
this
morning
and
again
in
the
evening
if
necessary
but
now
since
everything
has
gone
off
so
well
i
must
run
off
to
my
other
patients
theyve
been
expecting
me
long
ago
i
believe
you
got
an
old
woman
somewhere
shatov
an
old
woman
is
all
very
well
but
dont
you
her
tender
husband
desert
her
sit
beside
her
you
may
be
of
use
marya
ignatyevna
wont
drive
you
away
i
fancy
there
there
i
was
only
laughing
at
the
gate
to
which
shatov
accompanied
her
she
added
to
him
alone
youve
given
me
something
to
laugh
at
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
shant
charge
you
anything
i
shall
laugh
at
you
in
my
sleep
i
have
never
seen
anything
funnier
than
you
last
night
she
went
off
very
well
satisfied
shatovs
appearance
and
conversation
made
it
as
clear
as
daylight
that
this
man
was
going
in
for
being
a
father
and
was
a
ninny
she
ran
home
on
purpose
to
tell
virginsky
about
it
though
it
was
shorter
and
more
direct
to
go
to
another
patient
marie
she
told
you
not
to
go
to
sleep
for
a
little
time
though
i
see
its
very
hard
for
you
shatov
began
timidly
ill
sit
here
by
the
window
and
take
care
of
you
shall
i
and
he
sat
down
by
the
window
behind
the
sofa
so
that
she
could
not
see
him
but
before
a
minute
had
passed
she
called
him
and
fretfully
asked
him
to
arrange
the
pillow
he
began
arranging
it
she
looked
angrily
at
the
wall
thats
not
right
thats
not
right
what
hands
shatov
did
it
again
stoop
down
to
me
she
said
wildly
trying
hard
not
to
look
at
him
he
started
but
stooped
down
more
not
so
nearer
and
suddenly
her
left
arm
was
impulsively
thrown
round
his
neck
and
he
felt
her
warm
moist
kiss
on
his
forehead
marie
her
lips
were
quivering
she
was
struggling
with
herself
but
suddenly
she
raised
herself
and
said
with
flashing
eyes
nikolay
stavrogin
is
a
scoundrel
and
she
fell
back
helplessly
with
her
face
in
the
pillow
sobbing
hysterically
and
tightly
squeezing
shatovs
hand
in
hers
from
that
moment
she
would
not
let
him
leave
her
she
insisted
on
his
sitting
by
her
pillow
she
could
not
talk
much
but
she
kept
gazing
at
him
and
smiling
blissfully
she
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
a
silly
girl
everything
seemed
transformed
shatov
cried
like
a
boy
then
talked
of
god
knows
what
wildly
crazily
with
inspiration
kissed
her
hands
she
listened
entranced
perhaps
not
understanding
him
but
caressingly
ruffling
his
hair
with
her
weak
hand
smoothing
it
and
admiring
it
he
talked
about
kirillov
of
how
they
would
now
begin
a
new
life
for
good
of
the
existence
of
god
of
the
goodness
of
all
men

she
took
out
the
child
again
to
gaze
at
it
rapturously
marie
he
cried
as
he
held
the
child
in
his
arms
all
the
old
madness
shame
and
deadness
is
over
isnt
it
let
us
work
hard
and
begin
a
new
life
the
three
of
us
yes
yes
oh
by
the
way
what
shall
we
call
him
marie
what
shall
we
call
him
she
repeated
with
surprise
and
there
was
a
sudden
look
of
terrible
grief
in
her
face
she
clasped
her
hands
looked
reproachfully
at
shatov
and
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
marie
what
is
it
he
cried
with
painful
alarm
how
could
you
how
could
you
oh
you
ungrateful
man
marie
forgive
me
marie
i
only
asked
you
what
his
name
should
be
i
dont
know
ivan
ivan
she
raised
her
flushed
and
tearstained
face
how
could
you
suppose
we
should
call
him
by
another
horrible
name
marie
calm
yourself
oh
what
a
nervous
state
you
are
in
thats
rude
again
putting
it
down
to
my
nerves
i
bet
that
if
id
said
his
name
was
to
be
that
other
horrible
name
youd
have
agreed
at
once
and
not
have
noticed
it
even
oh
men
the
mean
ungrateful
creatures
they
are
all
alike
a
minute
later
of
course
they
were
reconciled
shatov
persuaded
her
to
have
a
nap
she
fell
asleep
but
still
kept
his
hand
in
hers
she
waked
up
frequently
looked
at
him
as
though
afraid
he
would
go
away
and
dropped
asleep
again
kirillov
sent
an
old
woman
to
congratulate
them
as
well
as
some
hot
tea
some
freshly
cooked
cutlets
and
some
broth
and
white
bread
for
marya
ignatyevna
the
patient
sipped
the
broth
greedily
the
old
woman
undid
the
babys
wrappings
and
swaddled
it
afresh
marie
made
shatov
have
a
cutlet
too
time
was
passing
shatov
exhausted
fell
asleep
himself
in
his
chair
with
his
head
on
maries
pillow
so
they
were
found
by
arina
prohorovna
who
kept
her
word
she
waked
them
up
gaily
asked
marie
some
necessary
questions
examined
the
baby
and
again
forbade
shatov
to
leave
her
then
jesting
at
the
happy
couple
with
a
shade
of
contempt
and
superciliousness
she
went
away
as
well
satisfied
as
before
it
was
quite
dark
when
shatov
waked
up
he
made
haste
to
light
the
candle
and
ran
for
the
old
woman
but
he
had
hardly
begun
to
go
down
the
stairs
when
he
was
struck
by
the
sound
of
the
soft
deliberate
steps
of
someone
coming
up
towards
him
erkel
came
in
dont
come
in
whispered
shatov
and
impulsively
seizing
him
by
the
hand
he
drew
him
back
towards
the
gate
wait
here
ill
come
directly
id
completely
forgotten
you
completely
oh
how
you
brought
it
back
he
was
in
such
haste
that
he
did
not
even
run
in
to
kirillovs
but
only
called
the
old
woman
marie
was
in
despair
and
indignation
that
he
could
dream
of
leaving
her
alone
but
he
cried
ecstatically
this
is
the
very
last
step
and
then
for
a
new
life
and
well
never
never
think
of
the
old
horrors
again
he
somehow
appeased
her
and
promised
to
be
back
at
nine
oclock
he
kissed
her
warmly
kissed
the
baby
and
ran
down
quickly
to
erkel
they
set
off
together
to
stavrogins
park
at
skvoreshniki
where
in
a
secluded
place
at
the
very
edge
of
the
park
where
it
adjoined
the
pine
wood
he
had
eighteen
months
before
buried
the
printing
press
which
had
been
entrusted
to
him
it
was
a
wild
and
deserted
place
quite
hidden
and
at
some
distance
from
the
stavrogins
house
it
was
two
or
perhaps
three
miles
from
filipovs
house
are
we
going
to
walk
all
the
way
ill
take
a
cab
i
particularly
beg
you
not
to
replied
erkel
they
insisted
on
that
a
cabman
would
be
a
witness
well
bother
i
dont
care
only
to
make
an
end
of
it
they
walked
very
fast
erkel
you
little
boy
cried
shatov
have
you
ever
been
happy
you
seem
to
be
very
happy
just
now
observed
erkel
with
curiosity
chapter
vi
a
busy
night
i
during
that
day
virginsky
had
spent
two
hours
in
running
round
to
see
the
members
of
the
quintet
and
to
inform
them
that
shatov
would
certainly
not
give
information
because
his
wife
had
come
back
and
given
birth
to
a
child
and
no
one
who
knew
anything
of
human
nature
could
suppose
that
shatov
could
be
a
danger
at
this
moment
but
to
his
discomfiture
he
found
none
of
them
at
home
except
erkel
and
lyamshin
erkel
listened
in
silence
looking
candidly
into
his
eyes
and
in
answer
to
the
direct
question
would
he
go
at
six
oclock
or
not
he
replied
with
the
brightest
of
smiles
that
of
course
he
would
go
lyamshin
was
in
bed
seriously
ill
as
it
seemed
with
his
head
covered
with
a
quilt
he
was
alarmed
at
virginskys
coming
in
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
began
speaking
he
waved
him
off
from
under
the
bedclothes
entreating
him
to
let
him
alone
he
listened
to
all
he
said
about
shatov
however
and
seemed
for
some
reason
extremely
struck
by
the
news
that
virginsky
had
found
no
one
at
home
it
seemed
that
lyamshin
knew
already
through
liputin
of
fedkas
death
and
hurriedly
and
incoherently
told
virginsky
about
it
at
which
the
latter
seemed
struck
in
his
turn
to
virginskys
direct
question
should
they
go
or
not
he
began
suddenly
waving
his
hands
again
entreating
him
to
let
him
alone
and
saying
that
it
was
not
his
business
and
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
virginsky
returned
home
dejected
and
greatly
alarmed
it
weighed
upon
him
that
he
had
to
hide
it
from
his
family
he
was
accustomed
to
tell
his
wife
everything
and
if
his
feverish
brain
had
not
hatched
a
new
idea
at
that
moment
a
new
plan
of
conciliation
for
further
action
he
might
have
taken
to
his
bed
like
lyamshin
but
this
new
idea
sustained
him
whats
more
he
began
impatiently
awaiting
the
hour
fixed
and
set
off
for
the
appointed
spot
earlier
than
was
necessary
it
was
a
very
gloomy
place
at
the
end
of
the
huge
park
i
went
there
afterwards
on
purpose
to
look
at
it
how
sinister
it
must
have
looked
on
that
chill
autumn
evening
it
was
at
the
edge
of
an
old
wood
belonging
to
the
crown
huge
ancient
pines
stood
out
as
vague
sombre
blurs
in
the
darkness
it
was
so
dark
that
they
could
hardly
see
each
other
two
paces
off
but
pyotr
stepanovitch
liputin
and
afterwards
erkel
brought
lanterns
with
them
at
some
unrecorded
date
in
the
past
a
rather
absurdlooking
grotto
had
for
some
reason
been
built
here
of
rough
unhewn
stones
the
table
and
benches
in
the
grotto
had
long
ago
decayed
and
fallen
two
hundred
paces
to
the
right
was
the
bank
of
the
third
pond
of
the
park
these
three
ponds
stretched
one
after
another
for
a
mile
from
the
house
to
the
very
end
of
the
park
one
could
scarcely
imagine
that
any
noise
a
scream
or
even
a
shot
could
reach
the
inhabitants
of
the
stavrogins
deserted
house
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
departure
the
previous
day
and
alexey
yegorytchs
absence
left
only
five
or
six
people
in
the
house
all
more
or
less
invalided
so
to
speak
in
any
case
it
might
be
assumed
with
perfect
confidence
that
if
cries
or
shouts
for
help
were
heard
by
any
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
isolated
house
they
would
only
have
excited
terror
no
one
would
have
moved
from
his
warm
stove
or
snug
shelf
to
give
assistance
by
twenty
past
six
almost
all
of
them
except
erkel
who
had
been
told
off
to
fetch
shatov
had
turned
up
at
the
trystingplace
this
time
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
not
late
he
came
with
tolkatchenko
tolkatchenko
looked
frowning
and
anxious
all
his
assumed
determination
and
insolent
bravado
had
vanished
he
scarcely
left
pyotr
stepanovitchs
side
and
seemed
to
have
become
all
at
once
immensely
devoted
to
him
he
was
continually
thrusting
himself
forward
to
whisper
fussily
to
him
but
the
latter
scarcely
answered
him
or
muttered
something
irritably
to
get
rid
of
him
shigalov
and
virginsky
had
arrived
rather
before
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
as
soon
as
he
came
they
drew
a
little
apart
in
profound
and
obviously
intentional
silence
pyotr
stepanovitch
raised
his
lantern
and
examined
them
with
unceremonious
and
insulting
minuteness
they
mean
to
speak
flashed
through
his
mind
isnt
lyamshin
here
he
asked
virginsky
who
said
he
was
ill
i
am
here
responded
lyamshin
suddenly
coming
from
behind
a
tree
he
was
in
a
warm
greatcoat
and
thickly
muffled
in
a
rug
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
his
face
even
with
a
lantern
so
liputin
is
the
only
one
not
here
liputin
too
came
out
of
the
grotto
without
speaking
pyotr
stepanovitch
raised
the
lantern
again
why
were
you
hiding
in
there
why
didnt
you
come
out
i
imagine
we
still
keep
the
right
of
freedom
of
our
actions
liputin
muttered
though
probably
he
hardly
knew
what
he
wanted
to
express
gentlemen
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
raising
his
voice
for
the
first
time
above
a
whisper
which
produced
an
effect
i
think
you
fully
understand
that
its
useless
to
go
over
things
again
everything
was
said
and
fully
thrashed
out
yesterday
openly
and
directly
but
perhapsas
i
see
from
your
facessomeone
wants
to
make
some
statement
in
that
case
i
beg
you
to
make
haste
damn
it
all
theres
not
much
time
and
erkel
may
bring
him
in
a
minute
he
is
sure
to
bring
him
tolkatchenko
put
in
for
some
reason
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
printing
press
will
be
handed
over
to
begin
with
inquired
liputin
though
again
he
seemed
hardly
to
understand
why
he
asked
the
question
of
course
why
should
we
lose
it
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
lifting
the
lantern
to
his
face
but
you
see
we
all
agreed
yesterday
that
it
was
not
really
necessary
to
take
it
he
need
only
show
you
the
exact
spot
where
its
buried
we
can
dig
it
up
afterwards
for
ourselves
i
know
that
its
somewhere
ten
paces
from
a
corner
of
this
grotto
but
damn
it
all
how
could
you
have
forgotten
liputin
it
was
agreed
that
you
should
meet
him
alone
and
that
we
should
come
out
afterwards
its
strange
that
you
should
askor
didnt
you
mean
what
you
said
liputin
kept
gloomily
silent
all
were
silent
the
wind
shook
the
tops
of
the
pinetrees
i
trust
however
gentlemen
that
every
one
will
do
his
duty
pyotr
stepanovitch
rapped
out
impatiently
i
know
that
shatovs
wife
has
come
back
and
has
given
birth
to
a
child
virginsky
said
suddenly
excited
and
gesticulating
and
scarcely
able
to
speak
distinctly
knowing
what
human
nature
is
we
can
be
sure
that
now
he
wont
give
information
because
he
is
happy
so
i
went
to
every
one
this
morning
and
found
no
one
at
home
so
perhaps
now
nothing
need
be
done
he
stopped
short
with
a
catch
in
his
breath
if
you
suddenly
became
happy
mr
virginsky
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
stepping
up
to
him
would
you
abandonnot
giving
information
theres
no
question
of
thatbut
any
perilous
public
action
which
you
had
planned
before
you
were
happy
and
which
you
regarded
as
a
duty
and
obligation
in
spite
of
the
risk
and
loss
of
happiness
no
i
wouldnt
abandon
it
i
wouldnt
on
any
account
said
virginsky
with
absurd
warmth
twitching
all
over
you
would
rather
be
unhappy
again
than
be
a
scoundrel
yes
yes
quite
the
contrary
id
rather
be
a
complete
scoundrel
that
is
no
not
a
scoundrel
at
all
but
on
the
contrary
completely
unhappy
rather
than
a
scoundrel
well
then
let
me
tell
you
that
shatov
looks
on
this
betrayal
as
a
public
duty
its
his
most
cherished
conviction
and
the
proof
of
it
is
that
he
runs
some
risk
himself
though
of
course
they
will
pardon
him
a
great
deal
for
giving
information
a
man
like
that
will
never
give
up
the
idea
no
sort
of
happiness
would
overcome
him
in
another
day
hell
go
back
on
it
reproach
himself
and
will
go
straight
to
the
police
whats
more
i
dont
see
any
happiness
in
the
fact
that
his
wife
has
come
back
after
three
years
absence
to
bear
him
a
child
of
stavrogins
but
no
one
has
seen
shatovs
letter
shigalov
brought
out
all
at
once
emphatically
ive
seen
it
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
it
exists
and
all
this
is
awfully
stupid
gentlemen
and
i
protest
virginsky
cried
boiling
over
suddenly
i
protest
with
all
my
might
i
want
this
is
what
i
want
i
suggest
that
when
he
arrives
we
all
come
out
and
question
him
and
if
its
true
we
induce
him
to
repent
of
it
and
if
he
gives
us
his
word
of
honour
let
him
go
in
any
case
we
must
have
a
trial
it
must
be
done
after
trial
we
mustnt
lie
in
wait
for
him
and
then
fall
upon
him
risk
the
cause
on
his
word
of
honourthats
the
acme
of
stupidity
damnation
how
stupid
it
all
is
now
gentlemen
and
a
pretty
part
you
are
choosing
to
play
at
the
moment
of
danger
i
protest
i
protest
virginsky
persisted
dont
bawl
anyway
we
shant
hear
the
signal
shatov
gentlemen
damnation
how
stupid
this
is
now
ive
told
you
already
that
shatov
is
a
slavophil
that
is
one
of
the
stupidest
set
of
people
but
damn
it
all
never
mind
thats
no
matter
you
put
me
out
shatov
is
an
embittered
man
gentlemen
and
since
he
has
belonged
to
the
party
anyway
whether
he
wanted
to
or
no
i
had
hoped
till
the
last
minute
that
he
might
have
been
of
service
to
the
cause
and
might
have
been
made
use
of
as
an
embittered
man
i
spared
him
and
was
keeping
him
in
reserve
in
spite
of
most
exact
instructions
ive
spared
him
a
hundred
times
more
than
he
deserved
but
hes
ended
by
betraying
us
but
hang
it
all
i
dont
care
youd
better
try
running
away
now
any
of
you
no
one
of
you
has
the
right
to
give
up
the
job
you
can
kiss
him
if
you
like
but
you
havent
the
right
to
stake
the
cause
on
his
word
of
honour
thats
acting
like
swine
and
spies
in
government
pay
whos
a
spy
in
government
pay
here
liputin
filtered
out
you
perhaps
youd
better
hold
your
tongue
liputin
you
talk
for
the
sake
of
talking
as
you
always
do
all
men
are
spies
gentlemen
who
funk
their
duty
at
the
moment
of
danger
there
will
always
be
some
fools
wholl
run
in
a
panic
at
the
last
moment
and
cry
out
aie
forgive
me
and
ill
give
them
all
away
but
let
me
tell
you
gentlemen
no
betrayal
would
win
you
a
pardon
now
even
if
your
sentence
were
mitigated
it
would
mean
siberia
and
whats
more
theres
no
escaping
the
weapons
of
the
other
sideand
their
weapons
are
sharper
than
the
governments
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
furious
and
said
more
than
he
meant
to
with
a
resolute
air
shigalov
took
three
steps
towards
him
since
yesterday
evening
ive
thought
over
the
question
he
began
speaking
with
his
usual
pedantry
and
assurance
i
believe
that
if
the
earth
had
given
way
under
his
feet
he
would
not
have
raised
his
voice
nor
have
varied
one
tone
in
his
methodical
exposition
thinking
the
matter
over
ive
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
projected
murder
is
not
merely
a
waste
of
precious
time
which
might
be
employed
in
a
more
suitable
and
befitting
manner
but
presents
moreover
that
deplorable
deviation
from
the
normal
method
which
has
always
been
most
prejudicial
to
the
cause
and
has
delayed
its
triumph
for
scores
of
years
under
the
guidance
of
shallow
thinkers
and
preeminently
of
men
of
political
instead
of
purely
socialistic
leanings
i
have
come
here
solely
to
protest
against
the
projected
enterprise
for
the
general
edification
intending
then
to
withdraw
at
the
actual
moment
which
you
for
some
reason
i
dont
understand
speak
of
as
a
moment
of
danger
to
you
i
am
goingnot
from
fear
of
that
danger
nor
from
a
sentimental
feeling
for
shatov
whom
i
have
no
inclination
to
kiss
but
solely
because
all
this
business
from
beginning
to
end
is
in
direct
contradiction
to
my
programme
as
for
my
betraying
you
and
my
being
in
the
pay
of
the
government
you
can
set
your
mind
completely
at
rest
i
shall
not
betray
you
he
turned
and
walked
away
damn
it
all
hell
meet
them
and
warn
shatov
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
pulling
out
his
revolver
they
heard
the
click
of
the
trigger
you
may
be
confident
said
shigalov
turning
once
more
that
if
i
meet
shatov
on
the
way
i
may
bow
to
him
but
i
shall
not
warn
him
but
do
you
know
you
may
have
to
pay
for
this
mr
fourier
i
beg
you
to
observe
that
i
am
not
fourier
if
you
mix
me
up
with
that
mawkish
theoretical
twaddler
you
simply
prove
that
you
know
nothing
of
my
manuscript
though
it
has
been
in
your
hands
as
for
your
vengeance
let
me
tell
you
that
its
a
mistake
to
cock
your
pistol
thats
absolutely
against
your
interests
at
the
present
moment
but
if
you
threaten
to
shoot
me
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
youll
gain
nothing
by
it
but
unnecessary
trouble
you
may
kill
me
but
sooner
or
later
youll
come
to
my
system
all
the
same
goodbye
at
that
instant
a
whistle
was
heard
in
the
park
two
hundred
paces
away
from
the
direction
of
the
pond
liputin
at
once
answered
whistling
also
as
had
been
agreed
the
evening
before
as
he
had
lost
several
teeth
and
distrusted
his
own
powers
he
had
this
morning
bought
for
a
farthing
in
the
market
a
childs
clay
whistle
for
the
purpose
erkel
had
warned
shatov
on
the
way
that
they
would
whistle
as
a
signal
so
that
the
latter
felt
no
uneasiness
dont
be
uneasy
ill
avoid
them
and
they
wont
notice
me
at
all
shigalov
declared
in
an
impressive
whisper
and
thereupon
deliberately
and
without
haste
he
walked
home
through
the
dark
park
everything
to
the
smallest
detail
of
this
terrible
affair
is
now
fully
known
to
begin
with
liputin
met
erkel
and
shatov
at
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
shatov
did
not
bow
or
offer
him
his
hand
but
at
once
pronounced
hurriedly
in
a
loud
voice
well
where
have
you
put
the
spade
and
havent
you
another
lantern
you
neednt
be
afraid
theres
absolutely
no
one
here
and
they
wouldnt
hear
at
skvoreshniki
now
if
we
fired
a
cannon
here
this
is
the
place
here
this
very
spot
and
he
stamped
with
his
foot
ten
paces
from
the
end
of
the
grotto
towards
the
wood
at
that
moment
tolkatchenko
rushed
out
from
behind
a
tree
and
sprang
at
him
from
behind
while
erkel
seized
him
by
the
elbows
liputin
attacked
him
from
the
front
the
three
of
them
at
once
knocked
him
down
and
pinned
him
to
the
ground
at
this
point
pyotr
stepanovitch
darted
up
with
his
revolver
it
is
said
that
shatov
had
time
to
turn
his
head
and
was
able
to
see
and
recognise
him
three
lanterns
lighted
up
the
scene
shatov
suddenly
uttered
a
short
and
desperate
scream
but
they
did
not
let
him
go
on
screaming
pyotr
stepanovitch
firmly
and
accurately
put
his
revolver
to
shatovs
forehead
pressed
it
to
it
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
shot
seems
not
to
have
been
loud
nothing
was
heard
at
skvoreshniki
anyway
shigalov
who
was
scarcely
three
paces
away
of
course
heard
ithe
heard
the
shout
and
the
shot
but
as
he
testified
afterwards
he
did
not
turn
nor
even
stop
death
was
almost
instantaneous
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
the
only
one
who
preserved
all
his
faculties
but
i
dont
think
he
was
quite
cool
squatting
on
his
heels
he
searched
the
murdered
mans
pockets
hastily
though
with
steady
hand
no
money
was
found
his
purse
had
been
left
under
marya
ignatyevnas
pillow
two
or
three
scraps
of
paper
of
no
importance
were
found
a
note
from
his
office
the
title
of
some
book
and
an
old
bill
from
a
restaurant
abroad
which
had
been
preserved
goodness
knows
why
for
two
years
in
his
pocket
pyotr
stepanovitch
transferred
these
scraps
of
paper
to
his
own
pocket
and
suddenly
noticing
that
they
had
all
gathered
round
were
gazing
at
the
corpse
and
doing
nothing
he
began
rudely
and
angrily
abusing
them
and
urging
them
on
tolkatchenko
and
erkel
recovered
themselves
and
running
to
the
grotto
brought
instantly
from
it
two
stones
which
they
had
got
ready
there
that
morning
these
stones
which
weighed
about
twenty
pounds
each
were
securely
tied
with
cord
as
they
intended
to
throw
the
body
in
the
nearest
of
the
three
ponds
they
proceeded
to
tie
the
stones
to
the
head
and
feet
respectively
pyotr
stepanovitch
fastened
the
stones
while
tolkatchenko
and
erkel
only
held
and
passed
them
erkel
was
foremost
and
while
pyotr
stepanovitch
grumbling
and
swearing
tied
the
dead
mans
feet
together
with
the
cord
and
fastened
the
stone
to
thema
rather
lengthy
operationtolkatchenko
stood
holding
the
other
stone
at
armslength
his
whole
person
bending
forward
as
it
were
deferentially
to
be
in
readiness
to
hand
it
without
delay
it
never
once
occurred
to
him
to
lay
his
burden
on
the
ground
in
the
interval
when
at
last
both
stones
were
tied
on
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
got
up
from
the
ground
to
scrutinise
the
faces
of
his
companions
something
strange
happened
utterly
unexpected
and
surprising
to
almost
every
one
as
i
have
said
already
all
except
perhaps
tolkatchenko
and
erkel
were
standing
still
doing
nothing
though
virginsky
had
rushed
up
to
shatov
with
the
others
he
had
not
seized
him
or
helped
to
hold
him
lyamshin
had
joined
the
group
after
the
shot
had
been
fired
afterwards
while
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
busy
with
the
corpsefor
perhaps
ten
minutesnone
of
them
seemed
to
have
been
fully
conscious
they
grouped
themselves
around
and
seemed
to
have
felt
amazement
rather
than
anxiety
or
alarm
liputin
stood
foremost
close
to
the
corpse
virginsky
stood
behind
him
peeping
over
his
shoulder
with
a
peculiar
as
it
were
unconcerned
curiosity
he
even
stood
on
tiptoe
to
get
a
better
view
lyamshin
hid
behind
virginsky
he
took
an
apprehensive
peep
from
time
to
time
and
slipped
behind
him
again
at
once
when
the
stones
had
been
tied
on
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
risen
to
his
feet
virginsky
began
faintly
shuddering
all
over
clasped
his
hands
and
cried
out
bitterly
at
the
top
of
his
voice
its
not
the
right
thing
its
not
its
not
at
all
he
would
perhaps
have
added
something
more
to
his
belated
exclamation
but
lyamshin
did
not
let
him
finish
he
suddenly
seized
him
from
behind
and
squeezed
him
with
all
his
might
uttering
an
unnatural
shriek
there
are
moments
of
violent
emotion
of
terror
for
instance
when
a
man
will
cry
out
in
a
voice
not
his
own
unlike
anything
one
could
have
anticipated
from
him
and
this
has
sometimes
a
very
terrible
effect
lyamshin
gave
vent
to
a
scream
more
animal
than
human
squeezing
virginsky
from
behind
more
and
more
tightly
and
convulsively
he
went
on
shrieking
without
a
pause
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
keeping
up
a
continual
patter
with
his
feet
as
though
he
were
beating
a
drum
virginsky
was
so
scared
that
he
too
screamed
out
like
a
madman
and
with
a
ferocity
a
vindictiveness
that
one
could
never
have
expected
of
virginsky
he
tried
to
pull
himself
away
from
lyamshin
scratching
and
punching
him
as
far
as
he
could
with
his
arms
behind
him
erkel
at
last
helped
to
pull
lyamshin
away
but
when
in
his
terror
virginsky
had
skipped
ten
paces
away
from
him
lyamshin
catching
sight
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
began
yelling
again
and
flew
at
him
stumbling
over
the
corpse
he
fell
upon
pyotr
stepanovitch
pressing
his
head
to
the
latters
chest
and
gripping
him
so
tightly
in
his
arms
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
tolkatchenko
and
liputin
could
all
of
them
do
nothing
at
the
first
moment
pyotr
stepanovitch
shouted
swore
beat
him
on
the
head
with
his
fists
at
last
wrenching
himself
away
he
drew
his
revolver
and
put
it
in
the
open
mouth
of
lyamshin
who
was
still
yelling
and
was
by
now
tightly
held
by
tolkatchenko
erkel
and
liputin
but
lyamshin
went
on
shrieking
in
spite
of
the
revolver
at
last
erkel
crushing
his
silk
handkerchief
into
a
ball
deftly
thrust
it
into
his
mouth
and
the
shriek
ceased
meantime
tolkatchenko
tied
his
hands
with
what
was
left
of
the
rope
its
very
strange
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
scrutinising
the
madman
with
uneasy
wonder
he
was
evidently
struck
i
expected
something
very
different
from
him
he
added
thoughtfully
they
left
erkel
in
charge
of
him
for
a
time
they
had
to
make
haste
to
get
rid
of
the
corpse
there
had
been
so
much
noise
that
someone
might
have
heard
tolkatchenko
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
took
up
the
lanterns
and
lifted
the
corpse
by
the
head
while
liputin
and
virginsky
took
the
feet
and
so
they
carried
it
away
with
the
two
stones
it
was
a
heavy
burden
and
the
distance
was
more
than
two
hundred
paces
tolkatchenko
was
the
strongest
of
them
he
advised
them
to
keep
in
step
but
no
one
answered
him
and
they
all
walked
anyhow
pyotr
stepanovitch
walked
on
the
right
and
bending
forward
carried
the
dead
mans
head
on
his
shoulder
while
with
the
left
hand
he
supported
the
stone
as
tolkatchenko
walked
more
than
half
the
way
without
thinking
of
helping
him
with
the
stone
pyotr
stepanovitch
at
last
shouted
at
him
with
an
oath
it
was
a
single
sudden
shout
they
all
went
on
carrying
the
body
in
silence
and
it
was
only
when
they
reached
the
pond
that
virginsky
stooping
under
his
burden
and
seeming
to
be
exhausted
by
the
weight
of
it
cried
out
again
in
the
same
loud
and
wailing
voice
its
not
the
right
thing
no
no
its
not
the
right
thing
the
place
to
which
they
carried
the
dead
man
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
rather
large
pond
which
was
the
farthest
of
the
three
from
the
house
was
one
of
the
most
solitary
and
unfrequented
spots
in
the
park
especially
at
this
late
season
of
the
year
at
that
end
the
pond
was
overgrown
with
weeds
by
the
banks
they
put
down
the
lantern
swung
the
corpse
and
threw
it
into
the
pond
they
heard
a
muffled
and
prolonged
splash
pyotr
stepanovitch
raised
the
lantern
and
every
one
followed
his
example
peering
curiously
to
see
the
body
sink
but
nothing
could
be
seen
weighted
with
the
two
stones
the
body
sank
at
once
the
big
ripples
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
water
and
quickly
passed
away
it
was
over
virginsky
went
off
with
erkel
who
before
giving
up
lyamshin
to
tolkatchenko
brought
him
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
reporting
to
the
latter
that
lyamshin
had
come
to
his
senses
was
penitent
and
begged
forgiveness
and
indeed
had
no
recollection
of
what
had
happened
to
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
walked
off
alone
going
round
by
the
farther
side
of
the
pond
skirting
the
park
this
was
the
longest
way
to
his
surprise
liputin
overtook
him
before
he
got
halfway
home
pyotr
stepanovitch
pyotr
stepanovitch
lyamshin
will
give
information
no
he
will
come
to
his
senses
and
realise
that
he
will
be
the
first
to
go
to
siberia
if
he
did
no
one
will
betray
us
now
even
you
wont
what
about
you
no
fear
ill
get
you
all
out
of
the
way
the
minute
you
attempt
to
turn
traitors
and
you
know
that
but
you
wont
turn
traitors
have
you
run
a
mile
and
a
half
to
tell
me
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
pyotr
stepanovitch
perhaps
we
shall
never
meet
again
whats
put
that
into
your
head
only
tell
me
one
thing
well
what
though
i
want
you
to
take
yourself
off
one
question
but
answer
it
truly
are
we
the
only
quintet
in
the
world
or
is
it
true
that
there
are
hundreds
of
others
its
a
question
of
the
utmost
importance
to
me
pyotr
stepanovitch
i
see
that
from
the
frantic
state
you
are
in
but
do
you
know
liputin
you
are
more
dangerous
than
lyamshin
i
know
i
know
but
the
answer
your
answer
you
are
a
stupid
fellow
i
should
have
thought
it
could
make
no
difference
to
you
now
whether
its
the
only
quintet
or
one
of
a
thousand
that
means
its
the
only
one
i
was
sure
of
it
cried
liputin
i
always
knew
it
was
the
only
one
i
knew
it
all
along
and
without
waiting
for
any
reply
he
turned
and
quickly
vanished
into
the
darkness
pyotr
stepanovitch
pondered
a
little
no
no
one
will
turn
traitor
he
concluded
with
decision
but
the
group
must
remain
a
group
and
obey
or
ill
what
a
wretched
set
they
are
though
ii
he
first
went
home
and
carefully
without
haste
packed
his
trunk
at
six
oclock
in
the
morning
there
was
a
special
train
from
the
town
this
early
morning
express
only
ran
once
a
week
and
was
only
a
recent
experiment
though
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
told
the
members
of
the
quintet
that
he
was
only
going
to
be
away
for
a
short
time
in
the
neighbourhood
his
intentions
as
appeared
later
were
in
reality
very
different
having
finished
packing
he
settled
accounts
with
his
landlady
to
whom
he
had
previously
given
notice
of
his
departure
and
drove
in
a
cab
to
erkels
lodgings
near
the
station
and
then
just
upon
one
oclock
at
night
he
walked
to
kirillovs
approaching
as
before
by
fedkas
secret
way
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
in
a
painful
state
of
mind
apart
from
other
extremely
grave
reasons
for
dissatisfaction
he
was
still
unable
to
learn
anything
of
stavrogin
he
had
it
seemsfor
i
cannot
assert
it
for
a
factreceived
in
the
course
of
that
day
probably
from
petersburg
secret
information
of
a
danger
awaiting
him
in
the
immediate
future
there
are
of
course
many
legends
in
the
town
relating
to
this
period
but
if
any
facts
were
known
it
was
only
to
those
immediately
concerned
i
can
only
surmise
as
my
own
conjecture
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
may
well
have
had
affairs
going
on
in
other
neighbourhoods
as
well
as
in
our
town
so
that
he
really
may
have
received
such
a
warning
i
am
convinced
indeed
in
spite
of
liputins
cynical
and
despairing
doubts
that
he
really
had
two
or
three
other
quintets
for
instance
in
petersburg
and
moscow
and
if
not
quintets
at
least
colleagues
and
correspondents
and
possibly
was
in
very
curious
relations
with
them
not
more
than
three
days
after
his
departure
an
order
for
his
immediate
arrest
arrived
from
petersburgwhether
in
connection
with
what
had
happened
among
us
or
elsewhere
i
dont
know
this
order
only
served
to
increase
the
overwhelming
almost
panic
terror
which
suddenly
came
upon
our
local
authorities
and
the
society
of
the
town
till
then
so
persistently
frivolous
in
its
attitude
on
the
discovery
of
the
mysterious
and
portentous
murder
of
the
student
shatovthe
climax
of
the
long
series
of
senseless
actions
in
our
midstas
well
as
the
extremely
mysterious
circumstances
that
accompanied
that
murder
but
the
order
came
too
late
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
already
in
petersburg
living
under
another
name
and
learning
what
was
going
on
he
made
haste
to
make
his
escape
abroad
but
i
am
anticipating
in
a
shocking
way
he
went
in
to
kirillov
looking
illhumoured
and
quarrelsome
apart
from
the
real
task
before
him
he
felt
as
it
were
tempted
to
satisfy
some
personal
grudge
to
avenge
himself
on
kirillov
for
something
kirillov
seemed
pleased
to
see
him
he
had
evidently
been
expecting
him
a
long
time
with
painful
impatience
his
face
was
paler
than
usual
there
was
a
fixed
and
heavy
look
in
his
black
eyes
i
thought
you
werent
coming
he
brought
out
drearily
from
his
corner
of
the
sofa
from
which
he
had
not
however
moved
to
greet
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
stood
before
him
and
before
uttering
a
word
looked
intently
at
his
face
everything
is
in
order
then
and
we
are
not
drawing
back
from
our
resolution
bravo
he
smiled
an
offensively
patronising
smile
but
after
all
he
added
with
unpleasant
jocosity
if
i
am
behind
my
time
its
not
for
you
to
complain
i
made
you
a
present
of
three
hours
i
dont
want
extra
hours
as
a
present
from
you
and
you
cant
make
me
a
present
you
fool
what
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
startled
but
instantly
controlled
himself
what
huffiness
so
we
are
in
a
savage
temper
he
rapped
out
still
with
the
same
offensive
superciliousness
at
such
a
moment
composure
is
what
you
need
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
consider
yourself
a
columbus
and
me
a
mouse
and
not
to
take
offence
at
anything
i
say
i
gave
you
that
advice
yesterday
i
dont
want
to
look
upon
you
as
a
mouse
whats
that
a
compliment
but
the
tea
is
coldand
that
shows
that
everything
is
topsyturvy
bah
but
i
see
something
in
the
window
on
a
plate
he
went
to
the
window
oh
oh
boiled
chicken
and
rice
but
why
havent
you
begun
upon
it
yet
so
we
are
in
such
a
state
of
mind
that
even
chicken
ive
dined
and
its
not
your
business
hold
your
tongue
oh
of
course
besides
its
no
consequencethough
for
me
at
the
moment
it
is
of
consequence
only
fancy
i
scarcely
had
any
dinner
and
so
if
as
i
suppose
that
chicken
is
not
wanted
now
eh
eat
it
if
you
can
thank
you
and
then
ill
have
tea
he
instantly
settled
himself
at
the
other
end
of
the
sofa
and
fell
upon
the
chicken
with
extraordinary
greediness
at
the
same
time
he
kept
a
constant
watch
on
his
victim
kirillov
looked
at
him
fixedly
with
angry
aversion
as
though
unable
to
tear
himself
away
i
say
though
pyotr
stepanovitch
fired
off
suddenly
while
he
still
went
on
eating
what
about
our
business
we
are
not
crying
off
are
we
how
about
that
document
ive
decided
in
the
night
that
its
nothing
to
me
ill
write
it
about
the
manifestoes
yes
about
the
manifestoes
too
but
ill
dictate
it
of
course
thats
nothing
to
you
can
you
possibly
mind
whats
in
the
letter
at
such
a
moment
thats
not
your
business
its
not
mine
of
course
it
need
only
be
a
few
lines
though
that
you
and
shatov
distributed
the
manifestoes
and
with
the
help
of
fedka
who
hid
in
your
lodgings
this
last
point
about
fedka
and
your
lodgings
is
very
importantthe
most
important
of
all
indeed
you
see
i
am
talking
to
you
quite
openly
shatov
why
shatov
i
wont
mention
shatov
for
anything
what
next
what
is
it
to
you
you
cant
hurt
him
now
his
wife
has
come
back
to
him
she
has
waked
up
and
has
sent
to
ask
me
where
he
is
she
has
sent
to
ask
you
where
he
is
hm
thats
unfortunate
she
may
send
again
no
one
ought
to
know
i
am
here
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
uneasy
she
wont
know
shes
gone
to
sleep
again
theres
a
midwife
with
her
arina
virginsky
so
thats
how
it
was
she
wont
overhear
i
suppose
i
say
youd
better
shut
the
front
door
she
wont
overhear
anything
and
if
shatov
comes
ill
hide
you
in
another
room
shatov
wont
come
and
you
must
write
that
you
quarrelled
with
him
because
he
turned
traitor
and
informed
the
police
this
evening
and
caused
his
death
he
is
dead
cried
kirillov
jumping
up
from
the
sofa
he
died
at
seven
oclock
this
evening
or
rather
at
seven
oclock
yesterday
evening
and
now
its
one
oclock
you
have
killed
him
and
i
foresaw
it
yesterday
no
doubt
you
did
with
this
revolver
here
he
drew
out
his
revolver
as
though
to
show
it
but
did
not
put
it
back
again
and
still
held
it
in
his
right
hand
as
though
in
readiness
you
are
a
strange
man
though
kirillov
you
knew
yourself
that
the
stupid
fellow
was
bound
to
end
like
this
what
was
there
to
foresee
in
that
i
made
that
as
plain
as
possible
over
and
over
again
shatov
was
meaning
to
betray
us
i
was
watching
him
and
it
could
not
be
left
like
that
and
you
too
had
instructions
to
watch
him
you
told
me
so
yourself
three
weeks
ago
hold
your
tongue
youve
done
this
because
he
spat
in
your
face
in
geneva
for
that
and
for
other
things
toofor
many
other
things
not
from
spite
however
why
do
you
jump
up
why
look
like
that
oh
oh
so
thats
it
is
it
he
jumped
up
and
held
out
his
revolver
before
him
kirillov
had
suddenly
snatched
up
from
the
window
his
revolver
which
had
been
loaded
and
put
ready
since
the
morning
pyotr
stepanovitch
took
up
his
position
and
aimed
his
weapon
at
kirillov
the
latter
laughed
angrily
confess
you
scoundrel
that
you
brought
your
revolver
because
i
might
shoot
you
but
i
shant
shoot
you
though
though
and
again
he
turned
his
revolver
upon
pyotr
stepanovitch
as
it
were
rehearsing
as
though
unable
to
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
imagining
how
he
would
shoot
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
holding
his
ground
waited
for
him
waited
for
him
till
the
last
minute
without
pulling
the
trigger
at
the
risk
of
being
the
first
to
get
a
bullet
in
his
head
it
might
well
be
expected
of
the
maniac
but
at
last
the
maniac
dropped
his
hand
gasping
and
trembling
and
unable
to
speak
youve
played
your
little
game
and
thats
enough
pyotr
stepanovitch
too
dropped
his
weapon
i
knew
it
was
only
a
game
only
you
ran
a
risk
let
me
tell
you
i
might
have
fired
and
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
with
a
fair
show
of
composure
and
poured
himself
out
some
tea
though
his
hand
trembled
a
little
kirillov
laid
his
revolver
on
the
table
and
began
walking
up
and
down
i
wont
write
that
i
killed
shatov
and
i
wont
write
anything
now
you
wont
have
a
document
i
shant
no
you
wont
what
meanness
and
what
stupidity
pyotr
stepanovitch
turned
green
with
resentment
i
foresaw
it
though
youve
not
taken
me
by
surprise
let
me
tell
you
as
you
please
however
if
i
could
make
you
do
it
by
force
i
would
you
are
a
scoundrel
though
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
more
and
more
carried
away
and
unable
to
restrain
himself
you
asked
us
for
money
out
there
and
promised
us
no
end
of
things
i
wont
go
away
with
nothing
however
ill
see
you
put
the
bullet
through
your
brains
first
anyway
i
want
you
to
go
away
at
once
kirillov
stood
firmly
before
him
no
thats
impossible
pyotr
stepanovitch
took
up
his
revolver
again
now
in
your
spite
and
cowardice
you
may
think
fit
to
put
it
off
and
to
turn
traitor
tomorrow
so
as
to
get
money
again
theyll
pay
you
for
that
of
course
damn
it
all
fellows
like
you
are
capable
of
anything
only
dont
trouble
yourself
ive
provided
for
all
contingencies
i
am
not
going
till
ive
dashed
your
brains
out
with
this
revolver
as
i
did
to
that
scoundrel
shatov
if
you
are
afraid
to
do
it
yourself
and
put
off
your
intention
damn
you
you
are
set
on
seeing
my
blood
too
i
am
not
acting
from
spite
let
me
tell
you
its
nothing
to
me
i
am
doing
it
to
be
at
ease
about
the
cause
one
cant
rely
on
men
you
see
that
for
yourself
i
dont
understand
what
fancy
possesses
you
to
put
yourself
to
death
it
wasnt
my
idea
you
thought
of
it
yourself
before
i
appeared
and
talked
of
your
intention
to
the
committee
abroad
before
you
said
anything
to
me
and
you
know
no
one
has
forced
it
out
of
you
no
one
of
them
knew
you
but
you
came
to
confide
in
them
yourself
from
sentimentalism
and
whats
to
be
done
if
a
plan
of
action
here
which
cant
be
altered
now
was
founded
upon
that
with
your
consent
and
upon
your
suggestion
your
suggestion
mind
that
you
have
put
yourself
in
a
position
in
which
you
know
too
much
if
you
are
an
ass
and
go
off
tomorrow
to
inform
the
police
that
would
be
rather
a
disadvantage
to
us
what
do
you
think
about
it
yes
youve
bound
yourself
youve
given
your
word
youve
taken
money
that
you
cant
deny
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
much
excited
but
for
some
time
past
kirillov
had
not
been
listening
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
lost
in
thought
again
i
am
sorry
for
shatov
he
said
stopping
before
pyotr
stepanovitch
again
why
so
i
am
sorry
if
thats
all
and
do
you
suppose
hold
your
tongue
you
scoundrel
roared
kirillov
making
an
alarming
and
unmistakable
movement
ill
kill
you
there
there
there
i
told
a
lie
i
admit
it
i
am
not
sorry
at
all
come
thats
enough
thats
enough
pyotr
stepanovitch
started
up
apprehensively
putting
out
his
hand
kirillov
subsided
and
began
walking
up
and
down
again
i
wont
put
it
off
i
want
to
kill
myself
now
all
are
scoundrels
well
thats
an
idea
of
course
all
are
scoundrels
and
since
life
is
a
beastly
thing
for
a
decent
man
fool
i
am
just
such
a
scoundrel
as
you
as
all
not
a
decent
man
theres
never
been
a
decent
man
anywhere
hes
guessed
the
truth
at
last
can
you
kirillov
with
your
sense
have
failed
to
see
till
now
that
all
men
are
alike
that
there
are
none
better
or
worse
only
some
are
stupider
than
others
and
that
if
all
are
scoundrels
which
is
nonsense
though
there
oughtnt
to
be
any
people
that
are
not
ah
why
you
are
really
in
earnest
kirillov
looked
at
him
with
some
wonder
you
speak
with
heat
and
simply
can
it
be
that
even
fellows
like
you
have
convictions
kirillov
ive
never
been
able
to
understand
why
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
i
only
know
its
from
conviction
strong
conviction
but
if
you
feel
a
yearning
to
express
yourself
so
to
say
i
am
at
your
service
only
you
must
think
of
the
time
what
time
is
it
oh
oh
just
two
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
at
his
watch
and
lighted
a
cigarette
it
seems
we
can
come
to
terms
after
all
he
reflected
ive
nothing
to
say
to
you
muttered
kirillov
i
remember
that
something
about
god
comes
into
it
you
explained
it
to
me
oncetwice
in
fact
if
you
stopped
yourself
you
become
god
thats
it
isnt
it
yes
i
become
god
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
not
even
smile
he
waited
kirillov
looked
at
him
subtly
you
are
a
political
impostor
and
intriguer
you
want
to
lead
me
on
into
philosophy
and
enthusiasm
and
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
so
as
to
disperse
my
anger
and
then
when
i
am
reconciled
with
you
beg
from
me
a
note
to
say
i
killed
shatov
pyotr
stepanovitch
answered
with
almost
natural
frankness
well
supposing
i
am
such
a
scoundrel
but
at
the
last
moments
does
that
matter
to
you
kirillov
what
are
we
quarrelling
about
tell
me
please
you
are
one
sort
of
man
and
i
am
anotherwhat
of
it
and
whats
more
we
are
both
of
us
scoundrels
yes
scoundrels
if
you
like
but
you
know
that
thats
only
words
all
my
life
i
wanted
it
not
to
be
only
words
i
lived
because
i
did
not
want
it
to
be
even
now
every
day
i
want
it
to
be
not
words
well
every
one
seeks
to
be
where
he
is
best
off
the
fish
that
is
every
one
seeks
his
own
comfort
thats
all
thats
been
a
commonplace
for
ages
and
ages
comfort
do
you
say
oh
its
not
worth
while
quarrelling
over
words
no
you
were
right
in
what
you
said
let
it
be
comfort
god
is
necessary
and
so
must
exist
well
thats
all
right
then
but
i
know
he
doesnt
and
cant
thats
more
likely
surely
you
must
understand
that
a
man
with
two
such
ideas
cant
go
on
living
must
shoot
himself
you
mean
surely
you
must
understand
that
one
might
shoot
oneself
for
that
alone
you
dont
understand
that
there
may
be
a
man
one
man
out
of
your
thousands
of
millions
one
man
who
wont
bear
it
and
does
not
want
to
all
i
understand
is
that
you
seem
to
be
hesitating
thats
very
bad
stavrogin
too
is
consumed
by
an
idea
kirillov
said
gloomily
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
he
had
not
noticed
the
previous
remark
what
pyotr
stepanovitch
pricked
up
his
ears
what
idea
did
he
tell
you
something
himself
no
i
guessed
it
myself
if
stavrogin
has
faith
he
does
not
believe
that
he
has
faith
if
he
hasnt
faith
he
does
not
believe
that
he
hasnt
well
stavrogin
has
got
something
else
worse
than
that
in
his
head
pyotr
stepanovitch
muttered
peevishly
uneasily
watching
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
and
the
pallor
of
kirillov
damn
it
all
he
wont
shoot
himself
he
was
thinking
i
always
suspected
it
its
a
maggot
in
the
brain
and
nothing
more
what
a
rotten
lot
of
people
you
are
the
last
to
be
with
me
i
shouldnt
like
to
part
on
bad
terms
with
you
kirillov
vouchsafed
suddenly
pyotr
stepanovitch
did
not
answer
at
once
damn
it
all
what
is
it
now
he
thought
again
i
assure
you
kirillov
i
have
nothing
against
you
personally
as
a
man
and
always
you
are
a
scoundrel
and
a
false
intellect
but
i
am
just
the
same
as
you
are
and
i
will
shoot
myself
while
you
will
remain
living
you
mean
to
say
i
am
so
abject
that
i
want
to
go
on
living
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
it
was
judicious
to
keep
up
such
a
conversation
at
such
a
moment
or
not
and
resolved
to
be
guided
by
circumstances
but
the
tone
of
superiority
and
of
contempt
for
him
which
kirillov
had
never
disguised
had
always
irritated
him
and
now
for
some
reason
it
irritated
him
more
than
everpossibly
because
kirillov
who
was
to
die
within
an
hour
or
so
pyotr
stepanovitch
still
reckoned
upon
this
seemed
to
him
as
it
were
already
only
half
a
man
some
creature
whom
he
could
not
allow
to
be
haughty
you
seem
to
be
boasting
to
me
of
your
shooting
yourself
ive
always
been
surprised
at
every
ones
going
on
living
said
kirillov
not
hearing
his
remark
hm
admitting
thats
an
idea
but
you
ape
you
assent
to
get
the
better
of
me
hold
your
tongue
you
wont
understand
anything
if
there
is
no
god
then
i
am
god
there
i
could
never
understand
that
point
of
yours
why
are
you
god
if
god
exists
all
is
his
will
and
from
his
will
i
cannot
escape
if
not
its
all
my
will
and
i
am
bound
to
show
selfwill
selfwill
but
why
are
you
bound
because
all
will
has
become
mine
can
it
be
that
no
one
in
the
whole
planet
after
making
an
end
of
god
and
believing
in
his
own
will
will
dare
to
express
his
selfwill
on
the
most
vital
point
its
like
a
beggar
inheriting
a
fortune
and
being
afraid
of
it
and
not
daring
to
approach
the
bag
of
gold
thinking
himself
too
weak
to
own
it
i
want
to
manifest
my
selfwill
i
may
be
the
only
one
but
ill
do
it
do
it
by
all
means
i
am
bound
to
shoot
myself
because
the
highest
point
of
my
selfwill
is
to
kill
myself
with
my
own
hands
but
you
wont
be
the
only
one
to
kill
yourself
there
are
lots
of
suicides
with
good
cause
but
to
do
it
without
any
cause
at
all
simply
for
selfwill
i
am
the
only
one
he
wont
shoot
himself
flashed
across
pyotr
stepanovitchs
mind
again
do
you
know
he
observed
irritably
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
kill
someone
else
to
show
my
selfwill
not
myself
you
might
be
of
use
ill
tell
you
whom
if
you
are
not
afraid
then
you
neednt
shoot
yourself
today
perhaps
we
may
come
to
terms
to
kill
someone
would
be
the
lowest
point
of
selfwill
and
you
show
your
whole
soul
in
that
i
am
not
you
i
want
the
highest
point
and
ill
kill
myself
hes
come
to
it
of
himself
pyotr
stepanovitch
muttered
malignantly
i
am
bound
to
show
my
unbelief
said
kirillov
walking
about
the
room
i
have
no
higher
idea
than
disbelief
in
god
i
have
all
the
history
of
mankind
on
my
side
man
has
done
nothing
but
invent
god
so
as
to
go
on
living
and
not
kill
himself
thats
the
whole
of
universal
history
up
till
now
i
am
the
first
one
in
the
whole
history
of
mankind
who
would
not
invent
god
let
them
know
it
once
for
all
he
wont
shoot
himself
pyotr
stepanovitch
thought
anxiously
let
whom
know
it
he
said
egging
him
on
its
only
you
and
me
here
you
mean
liputin
let
every
one
know
all
will
know
there
is
nothing
secret
that
will
not
be
made
known
he
said
so
and
he
pointed
with
feverish
enthusiasm
to
the
image
of
the
saviour
before
which
a
lamp
was
burning
pyotr
stepanovitch
lost
his
temper
completely
so
you
still
believe
in
him
and
youve
lighted
the
lamp
to
be
on
the
safe
side
i
suppose
the
other
did
not
speak
do
you
know
to
my
thinking
you
believe
perhaps
more
thoroughly
than
any
priest
believe
in
whom
in
him
listen
kirillov
stood
still
gazing
before
him
with
fixed
and
ecstatic
look
listen
to
a
great
idea
there
was
a
day
on
earth
and
in
the
midst
of
the
earth
there
stood
three
crosses
one
on
the
cross
had
such
faith
that
he
said
to
another
today
thou
shalt
be
with
me
in
paradise
the
day
ended
both
died
and
passed
away
and
found
neither
paradise
nor
resurrection
his
words
did
not
come
true
listen
that
man
was
the
loftiest
of
all
on
earth
he
was
that
which
gave
meaning
to
life
the
whole
planet
with
everything
on
it
is
mere
madness
without
that
man
there
has
never
been
any
like
him
before
or
since
never
up
to
a
miracle
for
that
is
the
miracle
that
there
never
was
or
never
will
be
another
like
him
and
if
that
is
so
if
the
laws
of
nature
did
not
spare
even
him
have
not
spared
even
their
miracle
and
made
even
him
live
in
a
lie
and
die
for
a
lie
then
all
the
planet
is
a
lie
and
rests
on
a
lie
and
on
mockery
so
then
the
very
laws
of
the
planet
are
a
lie
and
the
vaudeville
of
devils
what
is
there
to
live
for
answer
if
you
are
a
man
thats
a
different
matter
it
seems
to
me
youve
mixed
up
two
different
causes
and
thats
a
very
unsafe
thing
to
do
but
excuse
me
if
you
are
god
if
the
lie
were
ended
and
if
you
realised
that
all
the
falsity
comes
from
the
belief
in
that
former
god
so
at
last
you
understand
cried
kirillov
rapturously
so
it
can
be
understood
if
even
a
fellow
like
you
understands
do
you
understand
now
that
the
salvation
for
all
consists
in
proving
this
idea
to
every
one
who
will
prove
it
i
i
cant
understand
how
an
atheist
could
know
that
there
is
no
god
and
not
kill
himself
on
the
spot
to
recognise
that
there
is
no
god
and
not
to
recognise
at
the
same
instant
that
one
is
god
oneself
is
an
absurdity
else
one
would
certainly
kill
oneself
if
you
recognise
it
you
are
sovereign
and
then
you
wont
kill
yourself
but
will
live
in
the
greatest
glory
but
one
the
first
must
kill
himself
for
else
who
will
begin
and
prove
it
so
i
must
certainly
kill
myself
to
begin
and
prove
it
now
i
am
only
a
god
against
my
will
and
i
am
unhappy
because
i
am
bound
to
assert
my
will
all
are
unhappy
because
all
are
afraid
to
express
their
will
man
has
hitherto
been
so
unhappy
and
so
poor
because
he
has
been
afraid
to
assert
his
will
in
the
highest
point
and
has
shown
his
selfwill
only
in
little
things
like
a
schoolboy
i
am
awfully
unhappy
for
im
awfully
afraid
terror
is
the
curse
of
man
but
i
will
assert
my
will
i
am
bound
to
believe
that
i
dont
believe
i
will
begin
and
will
make
an
end
of
it
and
open
the
door
and
will
save
thats
the
only
thing
that
will
save
mankind
and
will
recreate
the
next
generation
physically
for
with
his
present
physical
nature
man
cant
get
on
without
his
former
god
i
believe
for
three
years
ive
been
seeking
for
the
attribute
of
my
godhead
and
ive
found
it
the
attribute
of
my
godhead
is
selfwill
thats
all
i
can
do
to
prove
in
the
highest
point
my
independence
and
my
new
terrible
freedom
for
it
is
very
terrible
i
am
killing
myself
to
prove
my
independence
and
my
new
terrible
freedom
his
face
was
unnaturally
pale
and
there
was
a
terribly
heavy
look
in
his
eyes
he
was
like
a
man
in
delirium
pyotr
stepanovitch
thought
he
would
drop
on
to
the
floor
give
me
the
pen
kirillov
cried
suddenly
quite
unexpectedly
in
a
positive
frenzy
dictate
ill
sign
anything
ill
sign
that
i
killed
shatov
even
dictate
while
it
amuses
me
i
am
not
afraid
of
what
the
haughty
slaves
will
think
you
will
see
for
yourself
that
all
that
is
secret
shall
be
made
manifest
and
you
will
be
crushed
i
believe
i
believe
pyotr
stepanovitch
jumped
up
from
his
seat
and
instantly
handed
him
an
inkstand
and
paper
and
began
dictating
seizing
the
moment
quivering
with
anxiety
i
alexey
kirillov
declare
stay
i
wont
to
whom
am
i
declaring
it
kirillov
was
shaking
as
though
he
were
in
a
fever
this
declaration
and
the
sudden
strange
idea
of
it
seemed
to
absorb
him
entirely
as
though
it
were
a
means
of
escape
by
which
his
tortured
spirit
strove
for
a
moments
relief
to
whom
am
i
declaring
it
i
want
to
know
to
whom
to
no
one
every
one
the
first
person
who
reads
it
why
define
it
the
whole
world
the
whole
world
bravo
and
i
wont
have
any
repentance
i
dont
want
penitence
and
i
dont
want
it
for
the
police
no
of
course
theres
no
need
of
it
damn
the
police
write
if
you
are
in
earnest
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
hysterically
stay
i
want
to
put
at
the
top
a
face
with
the
tongue
out
ech
what
nonsense
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
crossly
you
can
express
all
that
without
the
drawing
bythe
tone
by
the
tone
thats
true
yes
by
the
tone
by
the
tone
of
it
dictate
the
tone
i
alexey
kirillov
pyotr
stepanovitch
dictated
firmly
and
peremptorily
bending
over
kirillovs
shoulder
and
following
every
letter
which
the
latter
formed
with
a
hand
trembling
with
excitement
i
kirillov
declare
that
today
the
th
october
at
about
eight
oclock
in
the
evening
i
killed
the
student
shatov
in
the
park
for
turning
traitor
and
giving
information
of
the
manifestoes
and
of
fedka
who
has
been
lodging
with
us
for
ten
days
in
filipovs
house
i
am
shooting
myself
today
with
my
revolver
not
because
i
repent
and
am
afraid
of
you
but
because
when
i
was
abroad
i
made
up
my
mind
to
put
an
end
to
my
life
is
that
all
cried
kirillov
with
surprise
and
indignation
not
another
word
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
waving
his
hand
attempting
to
snatch
the
document
from
him
stay
kirillov
put
his
hand
firmly
on
the
paper
stay
its
nonsense
i
want
to
say
with
whom
i
killed
him
why
fedka
and
what
about
the
fire
i
want
it
all
and
i
want
to
be
abusive
in
tone
too
in
tone
enough
kirillov
i
assure
you
its
enough
cried
pyotr
stepanovitch
almost
imploringly
trembling
lest
he
should
tear
up
the
paper
that
they
may
believe
you
you
must
say
it
as
obscurely
as
possible
just
like
that
simply
in
hints
you
must
only
give
them
a
peep
of
the
truth
just
enough
to
tantalise
them
theyll
tell
a
story
better
than
ours
and
of
course
theyll
believe
themselves
more
than
they
would
us
and
you
know
its
better
than
anythingbetter
than
anything
let
me
have
it
its
splendid
as
it
is
give
it
to
me
give
it
to
me
and
he
kept
trying
to
snatch
the
paper
kirillov
listened
openeyed
and
appeared
to
be
trying
to
reflect
but
he
seemed
beyond
understanding
now
damn
it
all
pyotr
stepanovitch
cried
all
at
once
illhumouredly
he
hasnt
signed
it
why
are
you
staring
like
that
sign
i
want
to
abuse
them
muttered
kirillov
he
took
the
pen
however
and
signed
i
want
to
abuse
them
write
vive
la
rpublique
and
that
will
be
enough
bravo
kirillov
almost
bellowed
with
delight
vive

et
universelle

ou

there
thats
better
thats
better
he
wrote
it
gleefully
under
his
signature
enough
enough
repeated
pyotr
stepanovitch
stay
a
little
more
ill
sign
it
again
in
french
you
know
de

gentilhomme
russe
et
citoyen
du
monde
ha
ha
he
went
off
in
a
peal
of
laughter
no
no
no
stay
ive
found
something
better
than
all
eureka
gentilhomme
sminariste
russe
et
citoyen
du
monde
civilis
thats
better
than
any
he
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
and
suddenly
with
a
rapid
gesture
snatched
up
the
revolver
from
the
window
ran
with
it
into
the
next
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
stood
for
a
moment
pondering
and
gazing
at
the
door
if
he
does
it
at
once
perhaps
hell
do
it
but
if
he
begins
thinking
nothing
will
come
of
it
meanwhile
he
took
up
the
paper
sat
down
and
looked
at
it
again
the
wording
of
the
document
pleased
him
again
whats
needed
for
the
moment
whats
wanted
is
to
throw
them
all
off
the
scent
and
keep
them
busy
for
a
time
the
park
theres
no
park
in
the
town
and
theyll
guess
its
skvoreshniki
of
themselves
but
while
they
are
arriving
at
that
time
will
be
passing
then
the
search
will
take
time
too
then
when
they
find
the
body
it
will
prove
that
the
story
is
true
and
it
will
follow
thats
it
all
true
that
its
true
about
fedka
too
and
fedka
explains
the
fire
the
lebyadkins
so
that
it
was
all
being
hatched
here
at
filipovs
while
they
overlooked
it
and
saw
nothingthat
will
quite
turn
their
heads
they
will
never
think
of
the
quintet
shatov
and
kirillov
and
fedka
and
lebyadkin
and
why
they
killed
each
otherthat
will
be
another
question
for
them
oh
damn
it
all
i
dont
hear
the
shot
though
he
had
been
reading
and
admiring
the
wording
of
it
he
had
been
listening
anxiously
all
the
time
and
he
suddenly
flew
into
a
rage
he
looked
anxiously
at
his
watch
it
was
getting
late
and
it
was
fully
ten
minutes
since
kirillov
had
gone
out
snatching
up
the
candle
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
kirillov
had
shut
himself
up
he
was
just
at
the
door
when
the
thought
struck
him
that
the
candle
had
burnt
out
that
it
would
not
last
another
twenty
minutes
and
that
there
was
no
other
in
the
room
he
took
hold
of
the
handle
and
listened
warily
he
did
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
he
suddenly
opened
the
door
and
lifted
up
the
candle
something
uttered
a
roar
and
rushed
at
him
he
slammed
the
door
with
all
his
might
and
pressed
his
weight
against
it
but
all
sounds
died
away
and
again
there
was
deathlike
stillness
he
stood
for
a
long
while
irresolute
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
he
had
been
able
to
see
very
little
in
the
second
he
held
the
door
open
but
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
face
of
kirillov
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
by
the
window
and
the
savage
fury
with
which
the
latter
had
rushed
upon
him
pyotr
stepanovitch
started
rapidly
set
the
candle
on
the
table
made
ready
his
revolver
and
retreated
on
tiptoe
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
so
that
if
kirillov
opened
the
door
and
rushed
up
to
the
table
with
the
revolver
he
would
still
have
time
to
be
the
first
to
aim
and
fire
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
by
now
lost
all
faith
in
the
suicide
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
thinking
flashed
like
a
whirlwind
through
pyotr
stepanovitchs
mind
and
the
room
was
dark
and
horrible
too
he
roared
and
rushed
at
me
there
are
two
possibilities
either
i
interrupted
him
at
the
very
second
when
he
was
pulling
the
trigger
or
or
he
was
standing
planning
how
to
kill
me
yes
thats
it
he
was
planning
it
he
knows
i
wont
go
away
without
killing
him
if
he
funks
it
himselfso
that
he
would
have
to
kill
me
first
to
prevent
my
killing
him
and
again
again
there
is
silence
i
am
really
frightened
he
may
open
the
door
all
of
a
sudden
the
nuisance
of
it
is
that
he
believes
in
god
like
any
priest
he
wont
shoot
himself
for
anything
there
are
lots
of
these
people
nowadays
whove
come
to
it
of
themselves
a
rotten
lot
oh
damn
it
the
candle
the
candle
itll
go
out
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
certain
i
must
put
a
stop
to
it
come
what
may
i
must
put
a
stop
to
it
now
i
can
kill
him
with
that
document
here
no
one
would
think
of
my
killing
him
i
can
put
him
in
such
an
attitude
on
the
floor
with
an
unloaded
revolver
in
his
hand
that
theyd
be
certain
hed
done
it
himself
ach
damn
it
how
is
one
to
kill
him
if
i
open
the
door
hell
rush
out
again
and
shoot
me
first
damn
it
all
hell
be
sure
to
miss
he
was
in
agonies
trembling
at
the
necessity
of
action
and
his
own
indecision
at
last
he
took
up
the
candle
and
again
approached
the
door
with
the
revolver
held
up
in
readiness
he
put
his
left
hand
in
which
he
held
the
candle
on
the
doorhandle
but
he
managed
awkwardly
the
handle
clanked
there
was
a
rattle
and
a
creak
he
will
fire
straightway
flashed
through
pyotr
stepanovitchs
mind
with
his
foot
he
flung
the
door
open
violently
raised
the
candle
and
held
out
the
revolver
but
no
shot
nor
cry
came
from
within
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
he
started
the
room
led
nowhere
there
was
no
exit
no
means
of
escape
from
it
he
lifted
the
candle
higher
and
looked
about
him
more
attentively
there
was
certainly
no
one
he
called
kirillovs
name
in
a
low
voice
then
again
louder
no
one
answered
can
he
have
got
out
by
the
window
the
casement
in
one
window
was
in
fact
open
absurd
he
couldnt
have
got
away
through
the
casement
pyotr
stepanovitch
crossed
the
room
and
went
up
to
the
window
he
couldnt
possibly
all
at
once
he
turned
round
quickly
and
was
aghast
at
something
extraordinary
against
the
wall
facing
the
windows
on
the
right
of
the
door
stood
a
cupboard
on
the
right
side
of
this
cupboard
in
the
corner
formed
by
the
cupboard
and
the
wall
stood
kirillov
and
he
was
standing
in
a
very
strange
way
motionless
perfectly
erect
with
his
arms
held
stiffly
at
his
sides
his
head
raised
and
pressed
tightly
back
against
the
wall
in
the
very
corner
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
conceal
and
efface
himself
everything
seemed
to
show
that
he
was
hiding
yet
somehow
it
was
not
easy
to
believe
it
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
standing
a
little
sideways
to
the
corner
and
could
only
see
the
projecting
parts
of
the
figure
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
move
to
the
left
to
get
a
full
view
of
kirillov
and
solve
the
mystery
his
heart
began
beating
violently
and
he
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
blind
fury
he
started
from
where
he
stood
and
shouting
and
stamping
with
his
feet
he
rushed
to
the
horrible
place
but
when
he
reached
kirillov
he
stopped
short
again
still
more
overcome
horrorstricken
what
struck
him
most
was
that
in
spite
of
his
shout
and
his
furious
rush
the
figure
did
not
stir
did
not
move
in
a
single
limbas
though
it
were
of
stone
or
of
wax
the
pallor
of
the
face
was
unnatural
the
black
eyes
were
quite
unmoving
and
were
staring
away
at
a
point
in
the
distance
pyotr
stepanovitch
lowered
the
candle
and
raised
it
again
lighting
up
the
figure
from
all
points
of
view
and
scrutinising
it
he
suddenly
noticed
that
although
kirillov
was
looking
straight
before
him
he
could
see
him
and
was
perhaps
watching
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
then
the
idea
occurred
to
him
to
hold
the
candle
right
up
to
the
wretchs
face
to
scorch
him
and
see
what
he
would
do
he
suddenly
fancied
that
kirillovs
chin
twitched
and
that
something
like
a
mocking
smile
passed
over
his
lipsas
though
he
had
guessed
pyotr
stepanovitchs
thought
he
shuddered
and
beside
himself
clutched
violently
at
kirillovs
shoulder
then
something
happened
so
hideous
and
so
soon
over
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
could
never
afterwards
recover
a
coherent
impression
of
it
he
had
hardly
touched
kirillov
when
the
latter
bent
down
quickly
and
with
his
head
knocked
the
candle
out
of
pyotr
stepanovitchs
hand
the
candlestick
fell
with
a
clang
on
the
ground
and
the
candle
went
out
at
the
same
moment
he
was
conscious
of
a
fearful
pain
in
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
he
cried
out
and
all
that
he
could
remember
was
that
beside
himself
he
hit
out
with
all
his
might
and
struck
three
blows
with
the
revolver
on
the
head
of
kirillov
who
had
bent
down
to
him
and
had
bitten
his
finger
at
last
he
tore
away
his
finger
and
rushed
headlong
to
get
out
of
the
house
feeling
his
way
in
the
dark
he
was
pursued
by
terrible
shouts
from
the
room
directly
directly
directly
directly
ten
times
but
he
still
ran
on
and
was
running
into
the
porch
when
he
suddenly
heard
a
loud
shot
then
he
stopped
short
in
the
dark
porch
and
stood
deliberating
for
five
minutes
at
last
he
made
his
way
back
into
the
house
but
he
had
to
get
the
candle
he
had
only
to
feel
on
the
floor
on
the
right
of
the
cupboard
for
the
candlestick
but
how
was
he
to
light
the
candle
there
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
a
vague
recollection
he
recalled
that
when
he
had
run
into
the
kitchen
the
day
before
to
attack
fedka
he
had
noticed
in
passing
a
large
red
box
of
matches
in
a
corner
on
a
shelf
feeling
with
his
hands
he
made
his
way
to
the
door
on
the
left
leading
to
the
kitchen
found
it
crossed
the
passage
and
went
down
the
steps
on
the
shelf
on
the
very
spot
where
he
had
just
recalled
seeing
it
he
felt
in
the
dark
a
full
unopened
box
of
matches
he
hurriedly
went
up
the
steps
again
without
striking
a
light
and
it
was
only
when
he
was
near
the
cupboard
at
the
spot
where
he
had
struck
kirillov
with
the
revolver
and
been
bitten
by
him
that
he
remembered
his
bitten
finger
and
at
the
same
instant
was
conscious
that
it
was
unbearably
painful
clenching
his
teeth
he
managed
somehow
to
light
the
candleend
set
it
in
the
candlestick
again
and
looked
about
him
near
the
open
casement
with
his
feet
towards
the
righthand
corner
lay
the
dead
body
of
kirillov
the
shot
had
been
fired
at
the
right
temple
and
the
bullet
had
come
out
at
the
top
on
the
left
shattering
the
skull
there
were
splashes
of
blood
and
brains
the
revolver
was
still
in
the
suicides
hand
on
the
floor
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
after
a
careful
look
round
pyotr
stepanovitch
got
up
and
went
out
on
tiptoe
closed
the
door
left
the
candle
on
the
table
in
the
outer
room
thought
a
moment
and
resolved
not
to
put
it
out
reflecting
that
it
could
not
possibly
set
fire
to
anything
looking
once
more
at
the
document
left
on
the
table
he
smiled
mechanically
and
then
went
out
of
the
house
still
for
some
reason
walking
on
tiptoe
he
crept
through
fedkas
hole
again
and
carefully
replaced
the
posts
after
him
iii
precisely
at
ten
minutes
to
six
pyotr
stepanovitch
and
erkel
were
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
at
the
railwaystation
beside
a
rather
long
train
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
setting
off
and
erkel
was
saying
goodbye
to
him
the
luggage
was
in
and
his
bag
was
in
the
seat
he
had
taken
in
a
secondclass
carriage
the
first
bell
had
rung
already
they
were
waiting
for
the
second
pyotr
stepanovitch
looked
about
him
openly
watching
the
passengers
as
they
got
into
the
train
but
he
did
not
meet
anyone
he
knew
well
only
twice
he
nodded
to
acquaintancesa
merchant
whom
he
knew
slightly
and
then
a
young
village
priest
who
was
going
to
his
parish
two
stations
away
erkel
evidently
wanted
to
speak
of
something
of
importance
in
the
last
moments
though
possibly
he
did
not
himself
know
exactly
of
what
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
begin
he
kept
fancying
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
seemed
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
and
was
impatient
for
the
last
bell
you
look
at
every
one
so
openly
he
observed
with
some
timidity
as
though
he
would
have
warned
him
why
not
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
conceal
myself
at
present
its
too
soon
dont
be
uneasy
all
i
am
afraid
of
is
that
the
devil
might
send
liputin
this
way
he
might
scent
me
out
and
race
off
here
pyotr
stepanovitch
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
erkel
brought
out
resolutely
liputin
none
of
them
pyotr
stepanovitch
nonsense
they
are
all
bound
by
what
happened
yesterday
there
isnt
one
who
would
turn
traitor
people
wont
go
to
certain
destruction
unless
theyve
lost
their
reason
pyotr
stepanovitch
but
they
will
lose
their
reason
evidently
that
idea
had
already
occurred
to
pyotr
stepanovitch
too
and
so
erkels
observation
irritated
him
the
more
you
are
not
in
a
funk
too
are
you
erkel
i
rely
on
you
more
than
on
any
of
them
ive
seen
now
what
each
of
them
is
worth
tell
them
today
all
ive
told
you
i
leave
them
in
your
charge
go
round
to
each
of
them
this
morning
read
them
my
written
instructions
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
when
you
are
all
together
and
they
are
capable
of
listening
again
and
believe
me
they
will
be
by
tomorrow
for
theyll
be
in
an
awful
funk
and
that
will
make
them
as
soft
as
wax
the
great
thing
is
that
you
shouldnt
be
downhearted
ach
pyotr
stepanovitch
it
would
be
better
if
you
werent
going
away
but
i
am
only
going
for
a
few
days
i
shall
be
back
in
no
time
pyotr
stepanovitch
erkel
brought
out
warily
but
resolutely
what
if
you
were
going
to
petersburg
of
course
i
understand
that
you
are
only
doing
whats
necessary
for
the
cause
i
expected
as
much
from
you
erkel
if
you
have
guessed
that
i
am
going
to
petersburg
you
can
realise
that
i
couldnt
tell
them
yesterday
at
that
moment
that
i
was
going
so
far
for
fear
of
frightening
them
you
saw
for
yourself
what
a
state
they
were
in
but
you
understand
that
i
am
going
for
the
cause
for
work
of
the
first
importance
for
the
common
cause
and
not
to
save
my
skin
as
liputin
imagines
pyotr
stepanovitch
what
if
you
were
going
abroad
i
should
understand
i
should
understand
that
you
must
be
careful
of
yourself
because
you
are
everything
and
we
are
nothing
i
shall
understand
pyotr
stepanovitch
the
poor
boys
voice
actually
quivered
thank
you
erkel
aie
youve
touched
my
bad
finger
erkel
had
pressed
his
hand
awkwardly
the
bad
finger
was
discreetly
bound
up
in
black
silk
but
i
tell
you
positively
again
that
i
am
going
to
petersburg
only
to
sniff
round
and
perhaps
shall
only
be
there
for
twentyfour
hours
and
then
back
here
again
at
once
when
i
come
back
i
shall
stay
at
gaganovs
country
place
for
the
sake
of
appearances
if
there
is
any
notion
of
danger
i
should
be
the
first
to
take
the
lead
and
share
it
if
i
stay
longer
in
petersburg
ill
let
you
know
at
once

in
the
way
weve
arranged
and
youll
tell
them
the
second
bell
rang
ah
then
theres
only
five
minutes
before
the
train
starts
i
dont
want
the
group
here
to
break
up
you
know
i
am
not
afraid
dont
be
anxious
about
me
i
have
plenty
of
such
centres
and
its
not
much
consequence
but
theres
no
harm
in
having
as
many
centres
as
possible
but
i
am
quite
at
ease
about
you
though
i
am
leaving
you
almost
alone
with
those
idiots
dont
be
uneasy
they
wont
turn
traitor
they
wont
have
the
pluck
ha
ha
you
going
today
too
he
cried
suddenly
in
a
quite
different
cheerful
voice
to
a
very
young
man
who
came
up
gaily
to
greet
him
i
didnt
know
you
were
going
by
the
express
too
where
are
you
off
to
your
mothers
the
mother
of
the
young
man
was
a
very
wealthy
landowner
in
a
neighbouring
province
and
the
young
man
was
a
distant
relation
of
yulia
mihailovnas
and
had
been
staying
about
a
fortnight
in
our
town
no
i
am
going
farther
to
r
ive
eight
hours
to
live
through
in
the
train
off
to
petersburg
laughed
the
young
man
what
makes
you
suppose
i
must
be
going
to
petersburg
said
pyotr
stepanovitch
laughing
even
more
openly
the
young
man
shook
his
gloved
finger
at
him
well
youve
guessed
right
pyotr
stepanovitch
whispered
to
him
mysteriously
i
am
going
with
letters
from
yulia
mihailovna
and
have
to
call
on
three
or
four
personages
as
you
can
imaginebother
them
all
to
speak
candidly
its
a
beastly
job
but
why
is
she
in
such
a
panic
tell
me
the
young
man
whispered
too
she
wouldnt
see
even
me
yesterday
i
dont
think
she
has
anything
to
fear
for
her
husband
quite
the
contrary
he
fell
down
so
creditably
at
the
fireready
to
sacrifice
his
life
so
to
speak
well
there
it
is
laughed
pyotr
stepanovitch
you
see
she
is
afraid
that
people
may
have
written
from
here
already
that
is
some
gentlemen
the
fact
is
stavrogin
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
or
rather
prince
k
ech
its
a
long
story
ill
tell
you
something
about
it
on
the
journey
if
you
likeas
far
as
my
chivalrous
feelings
will
allow
me
at
least
this
is
my
relation
lieutenant
erkel
who
lives
down
here
the
young
man
who
had
been
stealthily
glancing
at
erkel
touched
his
hat
erkel
made
a
bow
but
i
say
verhovensky
eight
hours
in
the
train
is
an
awful
ordeal
berestov
the
colonel
an
awfully
funny
fellow
is
travelling
with
me
in
the
first
class
he

a
neighbour
of
ours
in
the
country

very
decent
fellow
hes
got
ideas

only
been
here
a
couple
of
days
hes
passionately
fond
of
whist
couldnt
we

up
a
game
eh

fourthpripuhlov

twith
a
beard

millionairei

a
very
interesting
moneybag
we

a
laugh
i
shall
be
delighted
and
i
am
awfully
fond
of
cards
in
the
train
but
i
am
going
second
class
nonsense

no
matter

in
with
us
ill
tell
them
directly
to
move
you

the
first
class

chief
guard

do
anything
i
tell
him
what
have
you
got
a
bag
a
rug
firstrate
come
along
pyotr
stepanovitch
took
his
bag
his
rug
and
his
book
and
at
once
and
with
alacrity
transferred
himself
to
the
first
class
erkel
helped
him
the
third
bell
rang
well
erkel
hurriedly
and
with
a
preoccupied
air
pyotr
stepanovitch
held
out
his
hand
from
the
window
for
the
last
time
you
see
i
am
sitting
down
to
cards
with
them
why
explain
pyotr
stepanovitch
i
understand
i
understand
it
all
well
au
revoir
pyotr
stepanovitch
turned
away
suddenly
on
his
name
being
called
by
the
young
man
who
wanted
to
introduce
him
to
his
partners
and
erkel
saw
nothing
more
of
pyotr
stepanovitch
he
returned
home
very
sad
not
that
he
was
alarmed
at
pyotr
stepanovitchs
leaving
them
so
suddenly
but
he
had
turned
away
from
him
so
quickly
when
that
young
swell
had
called
to
him
and
he
might
have
said
something
different
to
him
not
au
revoir
or
or
at
least
have
pressed
his
hand
more
warmly
that
last
was
bitterest
of
all
something
else
was
beginning
to
gnaw
in
his
poor
little
heart
something
which
he
could
not
understand
himself
yet
something
connected
with
the
evening
before
chapter
vii
stepan
trofimovitchs
last
wandering
i
i
am
persuaded
that
stepan
trofimovitch
was
terribly
frightened
as
he
felt
the
time
fixed
for
his
insane
enterprise
drawing
near
i
am
convinced
that
he
suffered
dreadfully
from
terror
especially
on
the
night
before
he
startedthat
awful
night
nastasya
mentioned
afterwards
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
late
and
fallen
asleep
but
that
proves
nothing
men
sentenced
to
death
sleep
very
soundly
they
say
even
the
night
before
their
execution
though
he
set
off
by
daylight
when
a
nervous
man
is
always
a
little
more
confident
and
the
major
virginskys
relative
used
to
give
up
believing
in
god
every
morning
when
the
night
was
over
yet
i
am
convinced
he
could
never
without
horror
have
imagined
himself
alone
on
the
high
road
in
such
a
position
no
doubt
a
certain
desperation
in
his
feelings
softened
at
first
the
terrible
sensation
of
sudden
solitude
in
which
he
at
once
found
himself
as
soon
as
he
had
left
nastasya
and
the
corner
in
which
he
had
been
warm
and
snug
for
twenty
years
but
it
made
no
difference
even
with
the
clearest
recognition
of
all
the
horrors
awaiting
him
he
would
have
gone
out
to
the
high
road
and
walked
along
it
there
was
something
proud
in
the
undertaking
which
allured
him
in
spite
of
everything
oh
he
might
have
accepted
varvara
petrovnas
luxurious
provision
and
have
remained
living
on
her
charity
comme
un
humble
dependent
but
he
had
not
accepted
her
charity
and
was
not
remaining
and
here
he
was
leaving
her
of
himself
and
holding
aloft
the
standard
of
a
great
idea
and
going
to
die
for
it
on
the
open
road
that
is
how
he
must
have
been
feeling
thats
how
his
action
must
have
appeared
to
him
another
question
presented
itself
to
me
more
than
once
why
did
he
run
away
that
is
literally
run
away
on
foot
rather
than
simply
drive
away
i
put
it
down
at
first
to
the
impracticability
of
fifty
years
and
the
fantastic
bent
of
his
mind
under
the
influence
of
strong
emotion
i
imagined
that
the
thought
of
posting
tickets
and
horses
even
if
they
had
bells
would
have
seemed
too
simple
and
prosaic
to
him
a
pilgrimage
on
the
other
hand
even
under
an
umbrella
was
ever
so
much
more
picturesque
and
in
character
with
love
and
resentment
but
now
that
everything
is
over
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
all
came
about
in
a
much
simpler
way
to
begin
with
he
was
afraid
to
hire
horses
because
varvara
petrovna
might
have
heard
of
it
and
prevented
him
from
going
by
force
which
she
certainly
would
have
done
and
he
certainly
would
have
given
in
and
then
farewell
to
the
great
idea
forever
besides
to
take
tickets
for
anywhere
he
must
have
known
at
least
where
he
was
going
but
to
think
about
that
was
the
greatest
agony
to
him
at
that
moment
he
was
utterly
unable
to
fix
upon
a
place
for
if
he
had
to
fix
on
any
particular
town
his
enterprise
would
at
once
have
seemed
in
his
own
eyes
absurd
and
impossible
he
felt
that
very
strongly
what
should
he
do
in
that
particular
town
rather
than
in
any
other
look
out
for
ce
marchand
but
what
marchand
at
that
point
his
second
and
most
terrible
question
cropped
up
in
reality
there
was
nothing
he
dreaded
more
than
ce
marchand
whom
he
had
rushed
off
to
seek
so
recklessly
though
of
course
he
was
terribly
afraid
of
finding
him
no
better
simply
the
high
road
better
simply
to
set
off
for
it
and
walk
along
it
and
to
think
of
nothing
so
long
as
he
could
put
off
thinking
the
high
road
is
something
very
very
long
of
which
one
cannot
see
the
endlike
human
life
like
human
dreams
there
is
an
idea
in
the
open
road
but
what
sort
of
idea
is
there
in
travelling
with
posting
tickets
posting
tickets
mean
an
end
to
ideas
vive
la
grande
route
and
then
as
god
wills
after
the
sudden
and
unexpected
interview
with
liza
which
i
have
described
he
rushed
on
more
lost
in
forgetfulness
than
ever
the
high
road
passed
half
a
mile
from
skvoreshniki
and
strange
to
say
he
was
not
at
first
aware
that
he
was
on
it
logical
reasoning
or
even
distinct
consciousness
was
unbearable
to
him
at
this
moment
a
fine
rain
kept
drizzling
ceasing
and
drizzling
again
but
he
did
not
even
notice
the
rain
he
did
not
even
notice
either
how
he
threw
his
bag
over
his
shoulder
nor
how
much
more
comfortably
he
walked
with
it
so
he
must
have
walked
like
that
for
nearly
a
mile
or
so
when
he
suddenly
stood
still
and
looked
round
the
old
road
black
marked
with
wheelruts
and
planted
with
willows
on
each
side
ran
before
him
like
an
endless
thread
on
the
right
hand
were
bare
plains
from
which
the
harvest
had
long
ago
been
carried
on
the
left
there
were
bushes
and
in
the
distance
beyond
them
a
copse
and
far
far
away
a
scarcely
perceptible
line
of
the
railway
running
aslant
and
on
it
the
smoke
of
a
train
but
no
sound
was
heard
stepan
trofimovitch
felt
a
little
timid
but
only
for
a
moment
he
heaved
a
vague
sigh
put
down
his
bag
beside
a
willow
and
sat
down
to
rest
as
he
moved
to
sit
down
he
was
conscious
of
being
chilly
and
wrapped
himself
in
his
rug
noticing
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
raining
he
put
up
his
umbrella
he
sat
like
that
for
some
time
moving
his
lips
from
time
to
time
and
firmly
grasping
the
umbrella
handle
images
of
all
sorts
passed
in
feverish
procession
before
him
rapidly
succeeding
one
another
in
his
mind
lise
lise
he
thought
and
with
her
ce
maurice
strange
people
but
what
was
the
strange
fire
and
what
were
they
talking
about
and
who
were
murdered
i
fancy
nastasya
has
not
found
out
yet
and
is
still
waiting
for
me
with
my
coffee
cards
did
i
really
lose
men
at
cards
hm
among
us
in
russia
in
the
times
of
serfdom
so
called
my
god
yesfedka
he
started
all
over
with
terror
and
looked
about
him
what
if
that
fedka
is
in
hiding
somewhere
behind
the
bushes
they
say
he
has
a
regular
band
of
robbers
here
on
the
high
road
oh
mercy
i
ill
tell
him
the
whole
truth
then
that
i
was
to
blame
and
that
ive
been
miserable
about
him
for
ten
years
more
miserable
than
he
was
as
a
soldier
and
ill
give
him
my
purse
hm
jai
en
tout
quarante
roubles
il
prendra
les
roubles
et
il
me
tuera
tout
de
mme
in
his
panic
he
for
some
reason
shut
up
the
umbrella
and
laid
it
down
beside
him
a
cart
came
into
sight
on
the
high
road
in
the
distance
coming
from
the
town
grace

dieu
thats
a
cart
and
its
coming
at
a
walking
pace
that
cant
be
dangerous
the
wretched
little
horses
here
i
always
said
that
breed
it
was
pyotr
ilyitch
though
he
talked
at
the
club
about
horsebreeding
and
i
trumped
him
et
puis
but
whats
that
behind
i
believe
theres
a
woman
in
the
cart
a
peasant
and
a
woman
cela
commence

tre
rassurant
the
woman
behind
and
the
man
in
front
cest
trs
rassurant
theres
a
cow
behind
the
cart
tied
by
the
horns
cest
rassurant
au
plus
haut
degr
the
cart
reached
him
it
was
a
fairly
solid
peasant
cart
the
woman
was
sitting
on
a
tightly
stuffed
sack
and
the
man
on
the
front
of
the
cart
with
his
legs
hanging
over
towards
stepan
trofimovitch
a
red
cow
was
in
fact
shambling
behind
tied
by
the
horns
to
the
cart
the
man
and
the
woman
gazed
openeyed
at
stepan
trofimovitch
and
stepan
trofimovitch
gazed
back
at
them
with
equal
wonder
but
after
he
had
let
them
pass
twenty
paces
he
got
up
hurriedly
all
of
a
sudden
and
walked
after
them
in
the
proximity
of
the
cart
it
was
natural
that
he
should
feel
safer
but
when
he
had
overtaken
it
he
became
oblivious
of
everything
again
and
sank
back
into
his
disconnected
thoughts
and
fancies
he
stepped
along
with
no
suspicion
of
course
that
for
the
two
peasants
he
was
at
that
instant
the
most
mysterious
and
interesting
object
that
one
could
meet
on
the
high
road
what
sort
may
you
be
pray
if
its
not
uncivil
to
ask
the
woman
could
not
resist
asking
at
last
when
stepan
trofimovitch
glanced
absentmindedly
at
her
she
was
a
woman
of
about
seven
and
twenty
sturdily
built
with
black
eyebrows
rosy
cheeks
and
a
friendly
smile
on
her
red
lips
between
which
gleamed
white
even
teeth
you
you
are
addressing
me
muttered
stepan
trofimovitch
with
mournful
wonder
a
merchant
for
sure
the
peasant
observed
confidently
he
was
a
wellgrown
man
of
forty
with
a
broad
and
intelligent
face
framed
in
a
reddish
beard
no
i
am
not
exactly
a
merchant
i
i
moi
cest
autre
chose
stepan
trofimovitch
parried
the
question
somehow
and
to
be
on
the
safe
side
he
dropped
back
a
little
from
the
cart
so
that
he
was
walking
on
a
level
with
the
cow
must
be
a
gentleman
the
man
decided
hearing
words
not
russian
and
he
gave
a
tug
at
the
horse
thats
what
set
us
wondering
you
are
out
for
a
walk
seemingly
the
woman
asked
inquisitively
again
you
you
ask
me
foreigners
come
from
other
parts
sometimes
by
the
train
your
boots
dont
seem
to
be
from
hereabouts
they
are
army
boots
the
man
put
in
complacently
and
significantly
no
i
am
not
precisely
in
the
army
i
what
an
inquisitive
woman
stepan
trofimovitch
mused
with
vexation
and
how
they
stare
at
me
mais
enfin
in
fact
its
strange
that
i
feel
as
it
were
consciencestricken
before
them
and
yet
ive
done
them
no
harm
the
woman
was
whispering
to
the
man
if
its
no
offence
wed
give
you
a
lift
if
so
be
its
agreeable
stepan
trofimovitch
suddenly
roused
himself
yes
yes
my
friends
i
accept
it
with
pleasure
for
im
very
tired
but
how
am
i
to
get
in
how
wonderful
it
is
he
thought
to
himself
that
ive
been
walking
so
long
beside
that
cow
and
it
never
entered
my
head
to
ask
them
for
a
lift
this
real
life
has
something
very
original
about
it
but
the
peasant
had
not
however
pulled
up
the
horse
but
where
are
you
bound
for
he
asked
with
some
mistrustfulness
stepan
trofimovitch
did
not
understand
him
at
once
to
hatovo
i
suppose
hatov
no
not
to
hatovs
exactly
and
i
dont
know
him
though
ive
heard
of
him
the
village
of
hatovo
the
village
seven
miles
from
here
a
village
cest
charmant
to
be
sure
ive
heard
of
it
stepan
trofimovitch
was
still
walking
they
had
not
yet
taken
him
into
the
cart
a
guess
that
was
a
stroke
of
genius
flashed
through
his
mind
you
think
perhaps
that
i
am
ive
got
a
passport
and
i
am
a
professor
that
is
if
you
like
a
teacher
but
a
head
teacher
i
am
a
head
teacher
oui
cest
comme
a
quon
peut
traduire
i
should
be
very
glad
of
a
lift
and
ill
buy
you
ill
buy
you
a
quart
of
vodka
for
it
itll
be
half
a
rouble
sir
its
a
bad
road
or
it
wouldnt
be
fair
to
ourselves
put
in
the
woman
half
a
rouble
very
good
then
half

cest

mais
the
peasant
stopped
the
horse
and
by
their
united
efforts
stepan
trofimovitch
was
dragged
into
the
cart
and
seated
on
the
sack
by
the
woman
he
was
still
pursued
by
the
same
whirl
of
ideas
sometimes
he
was
aware
himself
that
he
was
terribly
absentminded
and
that
he
was
not
thinking
of
what
he
ought
to
be
thinking
of
and
wondered
at
it
this
consciousness
of
abnormal
weakness
of
mind
became
at
moments
very
painful
and
even
humiliating
to
him
how
how
is
this
youve
got
a
cow
behind
he
suddenly
asked
the
woman
what
do
you
mean
sir
as
though
youd
never
seen
one
laughed
the
woman

bought

round
us
all
of
them
there

half
of
them
left
its
heartbreaking
and
again
he
lashed
the
horse
which
had
got
stuck
in
a
rut
yes
that
does
happen
among
you

in

stepan
trofimovitch
broke
off
if
you
are
a
teacher
what
are
you
going
to
hatovo
for
maybe
you

stepan
trofimovitch
cut
her
short
impatiently
awfully
inquisitive
people
but
the
woman
speaks
better
than
he
does
and
i
notice
that
since
february
19
their

little

note

the
peasant
persisted
thats
true
indeed
the
woman
put
in
with
animation
for
if

youll

at
two
oclock
tomorrow
the
woman
decided
finally
but
stepan
trofimovitch
was
obstinately
silent
his
questioners
too
sank
into
silence
the
peasant
tugged
at
his
horse
at
rare
intervals
the
peasant
woman
exchanged
brief
remarks
with
him
stepan
trofimovitch
fell
into
a
doze
he
was
tremendously
surprised
when
the
woman
laughing
gave
him
a
poke
and
he
found
himself
in
a
rather
large
village
at
the
door
of
a
cottage
with
three
windows
youve
had
a
nap
sir
what
is
it
where
am
i
ah
yes
well
never
mind
sighed
stepan
trofimovitch
and
he
got
out
of
the
cart
he
looked
about
him
mournfully
the
village
scene
seemed
strange
to
him
and
somehow
terribly
remote
and
the
halfrouble
i
was
forgetting
it
he
said
to
the
peasant
turning
to
him
with
an
excessively
hurried
gesture
he
was
evidently
by
now
afraid
to
part
from
them
well
settle
indoors
walk
in
the
peasant
invited
him
its
comfortable
inside
the
woman
said
reassuringly
stepan
trofimovitch
mounted
the
shaky
steps
how
can
it
be
he
murmured
in
profound
and
apprehensive
perplexity
he
went
into
the
cottage
however
elle
la
voulu
he
felt
a
stab
at
his
heart
and
again
he
became
oblivious
of
everything
even
of
the
fact
that
he
had
gone
into
the
cottage
it
was
a
light
and
fairly
clean
peasants
cottage
with
three
windows
and
two
rooms
not
exactly
an
inn
but
a
cottage
at
which
people
who
knew
the
place
were
accustomed
to
stop
on
their
way
through
the
village
stepan
trofimovitch
quite
unembarrassed
went
to
the
foremost
corner
forgot
to
greet
anyone
sat
down
and
sank
into
thought
meanwhile
a
sensation
of
warmth
extremely
agreeable
after
three
hours
of
travelling
in
the
damp
was
suddenly
diffused
throughout
his
person
even
the
slight
shivers
that
spasmodically
ran
down
his
spinesuch
as
always
occur
in
particularly
nervous
people
when
they
are
feverish
and
have
suddenly
come
into
a
warm
room
from
the
coldbecame
all
at
once
strangely
agreeable
he
raised
his
head
and
the
delicious
fragrance
of
the
hot
pancakes
with
which
the
woman
of
the
house
was
busy
at
the
stove
tickled
his
nostrils
with
a
childlike
smile
he
leaned
towards
the
woman
and
suddenly
said
whats
that
are
they
pancakes

cest

the
woman
politely

said
stepan
trofimovitch
reviving
get
the
samovar
with
the
greatest
pleasure
on
a
large
plate
with
a
big
blue

it
were

made
half
of
wheat
covered
with
fresh
hot
butter
most
delicious
pancakes
stepan
trofimovitch
tasted
them
with
relish
how
rich
they
are
and
how
good
and
if
one
could
only
have

stepan
trofimovitch
assented
with
a
blissful
smile
ask
a
peasant
to
do
anything
for
you
and
if
he
can
and
will
he
will
serve
you
with
care
and
friendliness
but
ask
him
to
fetch
you
vodkaand
his
habitual
serenity
and
friendliness
will
pass
at
once
into
a
sort
of
joyful
haste
and
alacrity
he
will
be
as
keen
in
your
interest
as
though
you
were
one
of
his
family
the
peasant
who
fetches
vodkaeven
though
you
are
going
to
drink
it
and
not
he
and
he
knows
that
beforehandseems
as
it
were
to
be
enjoying
part
of
your
future
gratification
within
three
minutes
the
tavern
was
only
two
paces
away
a
bottle
and
a
large
greenish
wineglass
were
set
on
the
table
before
stepan
trofimovitch
is
that
all
for
me
he
was
extremely
surprised
ive
always
had
vodka
but
i
never
knew
you
could
get
so
much
for
five
farthings
he
filled
the
wineglass
got
up
and
with
a
certain
solemnity
crossed
the
room
to
the
other
corner
where
his
fellowtraveller
the
blackbrowed
peasant
woman
who
had
shared
the
sack
with
him
and
bothered
him
with
her
questions
had
ensconced
herself
the
woman
was
taken
aback
and
began
to
decline
but
after
having
said
all
that
was
prescribed
by
politeness
she
stood
up
and
drank
it
decorously
in
three
sips
as
women
do
and
with
an
expression
of
intense
suffering
on
her
face
gave
back
the
wineglass
and
bowed
to
stepan
trofimovitch
he
returned
the
bow
with
dignity
and
returned
to
the
table
with
an
expression
of
positive
pride
on
his
countenance
all
this
was
done
on
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
a
second
before
he
had
no
idea
that
he
would
go
and
treat
the
peasant
woman
i
know
how
to
get
on
with
peasants
to
perfection
to
perfection
and
ive
always
told
them
so
he
thought
complacently
pouring
out
the
rest
of
the
vodka
though
there
was
less
than
a
glass
left
it
warmed
and
revived
him
and
even
went
a
little
to
his
head
je
suis
malade

fait
mais

would
you
care
to
purchase
a
gentle
feminine
voice
asked
close
by
him
he
raised
his
eyes
and
to
his
surprise
saw
a
ladyune
dame
et
elle
en
avait
lair
somewhat
over
thirty
very
modest
in
appearance
dressed
not
like
a
peasant
in
a
dark
gown
with
a
grey
shawl
on
her
shoulders
there
was
something
very
kindly
in
her
face
which
attracted
stepan
trofimovitch
immediately
she
had
only
just
come
back
to
the
cottage
where
her
things
had
been
left
on
a
bench
close
by
the
place
where
stepan
trofimovitch
had
seated
himself
among
them
was
a
portfolio
at
which
he
remembered
he
had
looked
with
curiosity
on
going
in
and
a
pack
not
very
large
of
american
leather
from
this
pack
she
took
out
two
nicely
bound
books
with
a
cross
engraved
on
the
cover
and
offered
them
to
stepan
trofimovitch
et
mais
je
crois
que
cest

with
the
greatest
pleasure
ah
now
i
understand

a
gospelwoman
ive
read
more
than
once
half
a
rouble
thirtyfive
kopecks
answered
the
gospelwoman
with
the
greatest
pleasure
je
nai
rien
contre
levangile
and
ive
been
wanting
to
reread
it
for
a
long
time
the
idea
occurred
to
him
at
the
moment
that
he
had
not
read
the
gospel
for
thirty
years
at
least
and
at
most
had
recalled
some
passages
of
it
seven
years
before
when
reading
renans
vie
de
jsus
as
he
had
no
small
change
he
pulled
out
his
four
tenrouble
notesall
that
he
had
the
woman
of
the
house
undertook
to
get
change
and
only
then
he
noticed
looking
round
that
a
good
many
people
had
come
into
the
cottage
and
that
they
had
all
been
watching
him
for
some
time
past
and
seemed
to
be
talking
about
him
they
were
talking
too
of
the
fire
in
the
town
especially
the
owner
of
the
cart
who
had
only
just
returned
from
the
town
with
the
cow
they
talked
of
arson
of
the
shpigulin
men
he
said
nothing
to
me
about
the
fire
when
he
brought
me
along
although
he
talked
of
everything
struck
stepan
trofimovitch
for
some
reason
master
stepan
trofimovitch
sir
is
it
you
i
see
well
i
never
should
have
thought

exclaimed
a
middleaged
man
who
looked
like
an
oldfashioned
houseserf
wearing
no
beard
and
dressed
in
an
overcoat
with
a
wide
turndown
collar
stepan
trofimovitch
was
alarmed
at
hearing
his
own
name
excuse
me
he
muttered

broke
her

out
of
her

now
her

on
my
way
to
the
town
to

my

quite
so

i
felt
so
pleased
when
i
saw
you
you
used
to
be
so
kind
to
me
anisim
smiled
delightedly
but
where
are
you
travelling
to
sir
all
by
yourself
as
it
seems
youve
never
been
a
journey
alone
i
fancy
stepan
trofimovitch
looked
at
him
in
alarm
you
are
going
maybe
to
our
parts
to
spasov
yes
i
am
going
to
spasov
il

you
dont
say
its
to
fyodor
matveyevitchs
they
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
he
had
such
a
respect
for
you
in
old
days
he
often
speaks
of
you
now
yes
yes
to
fyodor
matveyevitchs
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
the
peasants
here
are
wondering
they
make
out
they
met
you
sir
walking
on
the
high
road
they
are
a
foolish
lot
i
i
yes
you
know
anisim
i
made
a
wager
you
know
like
an
englishman
that
i
would
go
on
foot
and
i
the
perspiration
came
out
on
his
forehead
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
anisim
listened
with
merciless
curiosity
but
stepan
trofimovitch
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
was
so
disconcerted
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
getting
up
and
going
out
of
the
cottage
but
the
samovar
was
brought
in
and
at
the
same
moment
the
gospelwoman
who
had
been
out
of
the
room
returned
with
the
air
of
a
man
clutching
at
a
straw
he
turned
to
her
and
offered
her
tea
anisim
submitted
and
walked
away
the
peasants
certainly
had
begun
to
feel
perplexed
what
sort
of
person
is
he
he
was
found
walking
on
the
high
road
he
says
he
is
a
teacher
he
is
dressed
like
a
foreigner
and
has
no
more
sense
than
a
little
child
he
answers
queerly
as
though
he
had
run
away
from
someone
and
hes
got
money
an
idea
was
beginning
to
gain
ground
that
information
must
be
given
to
the
authorities
especially
as
things
werent
quite
right
in
the
town
but
anisim
set
all
that
right
in
a
minute
going
into
the
passage
he
explained
to
every
one
who
cared
to
listen
that
stepan
trofimovitch
was
not
exactly
a
teacher
but
a
very
learned
man
and
busy
with
very
learned
studies
and
was
a
landowner
of
the
district
himself
and
had
been
living
for
twentytwo
years
with
her
excellency
the
generals
widow
the
stout
madame
stavrogin
and
was
by
way
of
being
the
most
important
person
in
her
house
and
was
held
in
the
greatest
respect
by
every
one
in
the
town
he
used
to
lose
by
fifties
and
hundreds
in
an
evening
at
the
club
of
the
nobility
and
in
rank
he
was
a
councillor
which
was
equal
to
a
lieutenantcolonel
in
the
army
which
was
next
door
to
being
a
colonel
as
for
his
having
money
he
had
so
much
from
the
stout
madame
stavrogin
that
there
was
no
reckoning
itand
so
on
and
so
on
mais
cest
une
dame
et
trs
comme
il
faut
thought
stepan
trofimovitch
as
he
recovered
from
anisims
attack
gazing
with
agreeable
curiosity
at
his
neighbour
the
gospel
pedlar
who
was
however
drinking
the
tea
from
a
saucer
and
nibbling
at
a
piece
of
sugar
ce
petit
morceau
de
sucre
ce
nest
rien
there
is
something
noble
and
independent
about
her
and
at
the
same
timegentle
le
comme
il
faut
tout
pur
but
rather
in
a
different
style
he
soon
learned
from
her
that
her
name
was
sofya
matveyevna
ulitin
and
she
lived
at
k
that
she
had
a
sister
there
a
widow
that
she
was
a
widow
too
and
that
her
husband
who
was
a
sublieutenant
risen
from
the
ranks
had
been
killed
at
sevastopol
but
you
are
still
so
young
vous
navez

said
sofya
matveyevna
smiling
what
you
understand
french
a
little
i
lived
for
four
years
after
that
in
a
gentlemans
family
and
there
i
picked
it
up
from
the
children
she
told
him
that
being
left
a
widow
at
eighteen
she
was
for
some
time
in
sevastopol
as
a
nurse
and
had
afterwards
lived
in
various
places
and
now
she
travelled
about
selling
the
gospel
mais
mon
dieu
wasnt
it
you
who
had
a
strange
adventure
in
our
town
a
very
strange
adventure
she
flushed
it
turned
out
that
it
had
been
she
ces
vauriens
ces
malheureux
he
began
in
a
voice
quivering
with
indignation
miserable
and
hateful
recollections
stirred
painfully
in
his
heart
for
a
minute
he
seemed
to
sink
into
oblivion
bah
but
shes
gone
away
again
he
thought
with
a
start
noticing
that
she
was
not
by
his
side
she
keeps
going
out
and
is
busy
about
something
i
notice
that
she
seems
upset
too
bah
je
deviens
egoiste
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
anisim
again
but
this
time
in
the
most
menacing
surroundings
the
whole
cottage
was
full
of
peasants
and
it
was
evidently
anisim
who
had
brought
them
all
in
among
them
were
the
master
of
the
house
and
the
peasant
with
the
cow
two
other
peasants
they
turned
out
to
be
cabdrivers
another
little
man
half
drunk
dressed
like
a
peasant
but
cleanshaven
who
seemed
like
a
townsman
ruined
by
drink
and
talked
more
than
any
of
them
and
they
were
all
discussing
him
stepan
trofimovitch
the
peasant
with
the
cow
insisted
on
his
point
that
to
go
round
by
the
lake
would
be
thirtyfive
miles
out
of
the
way
and
that
he
certainly
must
go
by
steamer
the
halfdrunken
man
and
the
man
of
the
house
warmly
retorted
seeing
that
though
of
course
it
will
be
nearer
for
his
honour
on
the
steamer
over
the
lake
thats
true
enough
but
maybe
according
to
present
arrangements
the
steamer
doesnt
go
there
brother
it
does
go
it
does
it
will
go
for
another
week
cried
anisim
more
excited
than
any
of
them
thats
true
enough
but
it
doesnt
arrive
punctually
seeing
its
late
in
the
season
and
sometimes
itll
stay
three
days
together
at
ustyevo
itll
be
there
tomorrow
at
two
oclock
punctually
youll
be
at
spasov
punctually
by
the
evening
cried
anisim
eager
to
do
his
best
for
stepan
trofimovitch
mais
questce
quil
a
cet
homme
thought
stepan
trofimovitch
trembling
and
waiting
in
terror
for
what
was
in
store
for
him
the
cabdrivers
too
came
forward
and
began
bargaining
with
him
they
asked
three
roubles
to
ustyevo
the
others
shouted
that
that
was
not
too
much
that
that
was
the
fare
and
that
they
had
been
driving
from
here
to
ustyevo
all
the
summer
for
that
fare
but
its
nice
here
too
and
i
dont
want
stepan
trofimovitch
mumbled
in
protest
nice
it
is

right
there
its
wonderfully
nice
at
spasov
now

fyodor

be
so
pleased
to
see

mon

mes
amis
all
this
is
such
a
surprise
to
me
at
last
sofya
matveyevna
came
back
but
she
sat
down
on
the
bench
looking
dejected
and
mournful
i
cant
get
to
spasov
she
said
to
the
woman
of
the
cottage
why
you
are
bound
to
spasov
too
then
cried
stepan
trofimovitch
starting
it
appeared
that
a
lady
had
the
day
before
told
her
to
wait
at
hatovo
and
had
promised
to
take
her
to
spasov
and
now
this
lady
had
not
turned
up
after
all
what

repeated
sofya
matveyevna

already
which
of
you
did
i
engage
stepan
trofimovitch
suddenly
felt
an
intense
desire
to
go
to
spasov
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
were
getting
into
a
covered
trap
he
very
lively
and
quite
satisfied
she
with
her
pack
beside
him
with
a
grateful
smile
on
her
face
anisim
helped
them
in
a
good
journey
to
you
sir
said
he
bustling
officiously
round
the
trap
it

stepan
trofimovitch
began
hurriedly
as
soon
as
the
trap
started
you
see
i
jaime

le
vrai
peuple
that
is
the
real
ones
who
are
on
the
high
road
it
seems
to
me
they
care
for
nothing
but
where
exactly
i
am
going
but
let
bygones
be
bygones
i
fancy
i
am
talking
at
random
but
i
believe
its
from
being
flustered
you
dont
seem
quite
well
sofya
matveyevna
watched
him
keenly
though
respectfully
no
no
i
must
only
wrap
myself
up
besides
theres
a
fresh
wind
very
fresh
in
fact
but
let
us
forget
that
thats
not
what
i
really
meant
to
say
chre
et
incomparable
amie
i
feel
that
i
am
almost
happy
and
its
your
doing
happiness
is
not
good
for
me
for
it
makes
me
rush
to
forgive
all
my
enemies
at
once
why
thats
a
very
good
thing
sir
not
always
chre
innocente
levangile
voyezvous
dsormais
nous
prcherons
ensemble
and
i
will
gladly
sell
your
beautiful
little
books
yes
i
feel
that
that
perhaps
is
an
idea
quelque
chose
de
trs
nouveau
dans
ce
genre
the
peasants
are
religious
cest
admis
but
they
dont
yet
know
the
gospel
i
will
expound
it
to
them
by
verbal
explanation
one
might
correct
the
mistakes
in
that
remarkable
book
which
i
am
of
course
prepared
to
treat
with
the
utmost
respect
i
will
be
of
service
even
on
the
high
road
ive
always
been
of
use
i
always
told
them
so
et

cette
chre
ingrate
oh
we
will
forgive
we
will
forgive
first
of
all
we
will
forgive
all
and
always
we
will
hope
that
we
too
shall
be
forgiven
yes
for
all
every
one
of
us
have
wronged
one
another
all
are
guilty
thats
a
very
good
saying
i
think
sir
yes
yes
i
feel
that
i
am
speaking
well
i
shall
speak
to
them
very
well
but
what
was
the
chief
thing
i
meant
to
say
i
keep
losing
the
thread
and
forgetting
will
you
allow
me
to
remain
with
you
i
feel
that
the
look
in
your
eyes
and
i
am
surprised
in
fact
at
your
manners
you
are
simplehearted
you
call
me
sir
and
turn
your
cup
upside
down
on
your
saucer
and
that
horrid
lump
of
sugar
but
theres
something
charming
about
you
and
i
see
from
your
features
oh
dont
blush
and
dont
be
afraid
of
me
as
a
man
chre
et
incomparable
pour
moi
une
femme
cest
tout
i
cant
live
without
a
woman
but
only
at
her
side
only
at
her
side
i
am
awfully
muddled
awfully
i
cant
remember
what
i
meant
to
say
oh
blessed
is
he
to
whom
god
always
sends
a
woman
and
and
i
fancy
indeed
that
i
am
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
theres
a
lofty
idea
in
the
open
road
too
thats
what
i
meant
to
say
thats
itabout
the
idea
now
ive
remembered
it
but
i
kept
losing
it
before
and
why
have
they
taken
us
farther
it
was
nice
there
too
but
herecela

from
me

oh
how
kind
you
are
he
ceased
speaking
and
with
strange
suddenness
dropped
into
a
feverish
shivery
sleep
the
road
by
which
they
drove
the
twelve
miles
was
not
a
smooth
one
and
their
carriage
jolted
cruelly
stepan
trofimovitch
woke
up
frequently
quickly
raised
his
head
from
the
little
pillow
which
sofya
matveyevna
had
slipped
under
it
clutched
her
by
the
hand
and
asked
are
you
here
as
though
he
were
afraid
she
had
left
him
he
told
her
too
that
he
had
dreamed
of
gaping
jaws
full
of
teeth
and
that
he
had
very
much
disliked
it
sofya
matveyevna
was
in
great
anxiety
about
him
they
were
driven
straight
up
to
a
large
cottage
with
a
frontage
of
four
windows
and
other
rooms
in
the
yard
stepan
trofimovitch
waked
up
hurriedly
went
in
and
walked
straight
into
the
second
room
which
was
the
largest
and
best
in
the
house
an
expression
of
fussiness
came
into
his
sleepy
face
he
spoke
at
once
to
the
landlady
a
tall
thickset
woman
of
forty
with
very
dark
hair
and
a
slight
moustache
and
explained
that
he
required
the
whole
room
for
himself
and
that
the
door
was
to
be
shut
and
no
one
else
was
to
be
admitted
parce
que
nous
avons

parler
oui
jai
beaucoup

vous
dire
chre
amie
ill
pay
you
ill
pay
you
he
said
with
a
wave
of
dismissal
to
the
landlady
though
he
was
in
a
hurry
he
seemed
to
articulate
with
difficulty
the
landlady
listened
grimly
and
was
silent
in
token
of
consent
but
there
was
a
feeling
of
something
menacing
about
her
silence
he
did
not
notice
this
and
hurriedly
he
was
in
a
terrible
hurry
insisted
on
her
going
away
and
bringing
them
their
dinner
as
quickly
as
possible
without
a
moments
delay
at
that
point
the
moustached
woman
could
contain
herself
no
longer
this
is
not
an
inn
sir
we
dont
provide
dinners
for
travellers
we
can
boil
you
some
crayfish
or
set
the
samovar
but
weve
nothing
more
there
wont
be
fresh
fish
till
tomorrow
but
stepan
trofimovitch
waved
his
hands
repeating
with
wrathful
impatience
ill
pay
only
make
haste
make
haste
they
settled
on
fish
soup
and
roast
fowl
the
landlady
declared
that
fowl
was
not
to
be
procured
in
the
whole
village
she
agreed
however
to
go
in
search
of
one
but
with
the
air
of
doing
him
an
immense
favour
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
stepan
trofimovitch
instantly
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
made
sofya
matveyevna
sit
down
beside
him
there
were
several
armchairs
as
well
as
a
sofa
in
the
room
but
they
were
of
a
most
uninviting
appearance
the
room
was
rather
a
large
one
with
a
corner
in
which
there
was
a
bed
partitioned
off
it
was
covered
with
old
and
tattered
yellow
paper
and
had
horrible
lithographs
of
mythological
subjects
on
the
walls
in
the
corner
facing
the
door
there
was
a
long
row
of
painted
ikons
and
several
sets
of
brass
ones
the
whole
room
with
its
strangely
illassorted
furniture
was
an
unattractive
mixture
of
the
town
element
and
of
peasant
traditions
but
he
did
not
even
glance
at
it
all
nor
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
vast
lake
the
edge
of
which
was
only
seventy
feet
from
the
cottage
at
last
we
are
by
ourselves
and
we
will
admit
no
one
i
want
to
tell
you
everything
everything
from
the
very
beginning
sofya
matveyevna
checked
him
with
great
uneasiness
are
you
aware
stepan
trofimovitch
comment
vous
savez
dj
mon

he
smiled
with
delight
i
heard
it
this
morning
from
anisim
ivanovitch
when
you
were
talking
to
him
but
i
venture
to
tell
you
for
my
part
and
she
whispered
hurriedly
to
him
looking
nervously
at
the
closed
door
for
fear
anyone
should
overhearthat
here
in
this
village
it
was
dreadful
that
though
all
the
peasants
were
fishermen
they
made
their
living
chiefly
by
charging
travellers
every
summer
whatever
they
thought
fit
the
village
was
not
on
the
high
road
but
an
outoftheway
one
and
people
only
called
there
because
the
steamers
stopped
there
and
that
when
the
steamer
did
not
calland
if
the
weather
was
in
the
least
unfavourable
it
would
notthen
numbers
of
travellers
would
be
waiting
there
for
several
days
and
all
the
cottages
in
the
village
would
be
occupied
and
that
was
just
the
villagers
opportunity
for
they
charged
three
times
its
value
for
everythingand
their
landlord
here
was
proud
and
stuck
up
because
he
was
for
these
parts
very
rich
he
had
a
net
which
had
cost
a
thousand
roubles
stepan
trofimovitch
looked
almost
reproachfully
at
sofya
matveyevnas
extremely
excited
face
and
several
times
he
made
a
motion
to
stop
her
but
she
persisted
and
said
all
she
had
to
say
she
said
she
had
been
there
before
already
in
the
summer
with
a
very
genteel
lady
from
the
town
and
stayed
there
too
for
two
whole
days
till
the
steamer
came
and
what
they
had
to
put
up
with
did
not
bear
thinking
of
here
stepan
trofimovitch
youve
been
pleased
to
ask
for
this
room
for
yourself
alone
i
only
speak
to
warn
you
in
the
other
room
there
are
travellers
already
an
elderly
man
and
a
young
man
and
a
lady
with
children
and
by
tomorrow
before
two
oclock
the
whole
house
will
be
filled
up
for
since
the
steamer
hasnt
been
here
for
two
days
it
will
be
sure
to
come
tomorrow
so
for
a
room
apart
and
for
ordering
dinner
and
for
putting
out
the
other
travellers
theyll
charge
you
a
price
unheard
of
even
in
the
capital
but
he
was
in
distress
in
real
distress
assez
mon
enfant
i
beseech
you
nous
avons
notre
argentet
aprs
le
bon
dieu
and
i
am
surprised
that
with
the
loftiness
of
your
ideas
you
assez
assez
vous
me
tourmentez
he
articulated
hysterically
we
have
all
our
future
before
us
and
you
you
fill
me
with
alarm
for
the
future
he
proceeded
at
once
to
unfold
his
whole
story
with
such
haste
that
at
first
it
was
difficult
to
understand
him
it
went
on
for
a
long
time
the
soup
was
served
the
fowl
was
brought
in
followed
at
last
by
the
samovar
and
still
he
talked
on
he
told
it
somewhat
strangely
and
hysterically
and
indeed
he
was
ill
it
was
a
sudden
extreme
effort
of
his
intellectual
faculties
which
was
bound
in
his
overstrained
condition
of
coursesofya
matveyevna
foresaw
it
with
distress
all
the
time
he
was
talkingto
result
immediately
afterwards
in
extreme
exhaustion
he
began
his
story
almost
with
his
childhood
when
with
fresh
heart
he
ran
about
the
meadows
it
was
an
hour
before
he
reached
his
two
marriages
and
his
life
in
berlin
i
dare
not
laugh
however
it
really
was
for
him
a
matter
of
the
utmost
importance
and
to
adopt
the
modern
jargon
almost
a
question
of
struggling
for
existence
he
saw
before
him
the
woman
whom
he
had
already
elected
to
share
his
new
life
and
was
in
haste
to
consecrate
her
so
to
speak
his
genius
must
not
be
hidden
from
her
perhaps
he
had
formed
a
very
exaggerated
estimate
of
sofya
matveyevna
but
he
had
already
chosen
her
he
could
not
exist
without
a
woman
he
saw
clearly
from
her
face
that
she
hardly
understood
him
and
could
not
grasp
even
the
most
essential
part
ce
nest
rien
nous
attendrons
and
meanwhile
she
can
feel
it
intuitively
my
friend
i
need
nothing
but
your
heart
he
exclaimed
interrupting
his
narrative
and
that
sweet
enchanting
look
with
which
you
are
gazing
at
me
now
oh
dont
blush
ive
told
you
already
the
poor
woman
who
had
fallen
into
his
hands
found
much
that
was
obscure
especially
when
his
autobiography
almost
passed
into
a
complete
dissertation
on
the
fact
that
no
one
had
been
ever
able
to
understand
stepan
trofimovitch
and
that
men
of
genius
are
wasted
in
russia
it
was
all
so
very
intellectual
she
reported
afterwards
dejectedly
she
listened
in
evident
misery
rather
roundeyed
when
stepan
trofimovitch
fell
into
a
humorous
vein
and
threw
off
witty
sarcasms
at
the
expense
of
our
advanced
and
governing
classes
she
twice
made
grievous
efforts
to
laugh
in
response
to
his
laughter
but
the
result
was
worse
than
tears
so
that
stepan
trofimovitch
was
at
last
embarrassed
by
it
himself
and
attacked
the
nihilists
and
modern
people
with
all
the
greater
wrath
and
zest
at
this
point
he
simply
alarmed
her
and
it
was
not
until
he
began
upon
the
romance
of
his
life
that
she
felt
some
slight
relief
though
that
too
was
deceptive
a
woman
is
always
a
woman
even
if
she
is
a
nun
she
smiled
shook
her
head
and
then
blushed
crimson
and
dropped
her
eyes
which
roused
stepan
trofimovitch
to
absolute
ecstasy
and
inspiration
so
much
that
he
began
fibbing
freely
varvara
petrovna
appeared
in
his
story
as
an
enchanting
brunette
who
had
been
the
rage
of
petersburg
and
many
european
capitals
and
her
husband
had
been
struck
down
on
the
field
of
sevastopol
simply
because
he
had
felt
unworthy
of
her
love
and
had
yielded
her
to
his
rival
that
is
stepan
trofimovitch
dont
be
shocked
my
gentle
one
my
christian
he
exclaimed
to
sofya
matveyevna
almost
believing
himself
in
all
that
he
was
telling
it
was
something
so
lofty
so
subtle
that
we
never
spoke
of
it
to
one
another
all
our
lives
as
the
story
went
on
the
cause
of
this
position
of
affairs
appeared
to
be
a
blonde
lady
if
not
darya
pavlovna
i
dont
know
of
whom
stepan
trofimovitch
could
have
been
thinking
this
blonde
owed
everything
to
the
brunette
and
had
grown
up
in
her
house
being
a
distant
relation
the
brunette
observing
at
last
the
love
of
the
blonde
girl
to
stepan
trofimovitch
kept
her
feelings
locked
up
in
her
heart
the
blonde
girl
noticing
on
her
part
the
love
of
the
brunette
to
stepan
trofimovitch
also
locked
her
feelings
in
her
own
heart
and
all
three
pining
with
mutual
magnanimity
kept
silent
in
this
way
for
twenty
years
locking
their
feelings
in
their
hearts
oh
what
a
passion
that
was
what
a
passion
that
was
he
exclaimed
with
a
stifled
sob
of
genuine
ecstasy
i
saw
the
full
blooming
of
her
beauty
of
the
brunettes
that
is
i
saw
daily
with
an
ache
in
my
heart
how
she
passed
by
me
as
though
ashamed
she
was
so
fair
once
he
said
ashamed
she
was
so
fat
at
last
he
had
run
away
casting
off
all
this
feverish
dream
of
twenty
yearsvingt
ansand
now
here
he
was
on
the
high
road
then
in
a
sort
of
delirium
be
began
explaining
to
sofya
matveyevna
the
significance
of
their
meeting
that
day
so
chance
an
encounter
and
so
fateful
for
all
eternity
sofya
matveyevna
got
up
from
the
sofa
in
terrible
confusion
at
last
he
had
positively
made
an
attempt
to
drop
on
his
knees
before
her
which
made
her
cry
it
was
beginning
to
get
dark
they
had
been
for
some
hours
shut
up
in
the
room
no
youd
better
let
me
go
into
the
other
room
she
faltered
or
else
theres
no
knowing
what
people
may
think
she
tore
herself
away
at
last
he
let
her
go
promising
her
to
go
to
bed
at
once
as
they
parted
he
complained
that
he
had
a
bad
headache
sofya
matveyevna
had
on
entering
the
cottage
left
her
bag
and
things
in
the
first
room
meaning
to
spend
the
night
with
the
people
of
the
house
but
she
got
no
rest
in
the
night
stepan
trofimovitch
was
attacked
by
the
malady
with
which
i
and
all
his
friends
were
so
familiarthe
summer
cholera
which
was
always
the
outcome
of
any
nervous
strain
or
moral
shock
with
him
poor
sofya
matveyevna
did
not
sleep
all
night
as
in
waiting
on
the
invalid
she
was
obliged
pretty
often
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
cottage
through
the
landladys
room
the
latter
as
well
as
the
travellers
who
were
sleeping
there
grumbled
and
even
began
swearing
when
towards
morning
she
set
about
preparing
the
samovar
stepan
trofimovitch
was
half
unconscious
all
through
the
attack
at
times
he
had
a
vision
of
the
samovar
being
set
of
someone
giving
him
something
to
drink
raspberry
tea
and
putting
something
warm
to
his
stomach
and
his
chest
but
he
felt
almost
every
instant
that
she
was
here
beside
him
that
it
was
she
going
out
and
coming
in
lifting
him
off
the
bed
and
settling
him
in
it
again
towards
three
oclock
in
the
morning
he
began
to
be
easier
he
sat
up
put
his
legs
out
of
bed
and
thinking
of
nothing
he
fell
on
the
floor
at
her
feet
this
was
a
very
different
matter
from
the
kneeling
of
the
evening
he
simply
bowed
down
at
her
feet
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
dress
dont
sir
i
am
not
worth
it
she
faltered
trying
to
get
him
back
on
to
the
bed
my
saviour
he
cried
clasping
his
hands
reverently
before
her
vous
tes
noble
comme
une
marquise
ii
am
a
wretch
oh
ive
been
dishonest
all
my
life
calm
yourself
sofya
matveyevna
implored
him
it
was
all
lies
that
i
told
you
this
eveningto
glorify
myself
to
make
it
splendid
from
pure
wantonnessall
all
every
word
oh
i
am
a
wretch
i
am
a
wretch
the
first
attack
was
succeeded
in
this
way
by
a
secondan
attack
of
hysterical
remorse
i
have
mentioned
these
attacks
already
when
i
described
his
letters
to
varvara
petrovna
he
suddenly
recalled
lise
and
their
meeting
the
previous
morning
it
was
so
awful
and
there
must
have
been
some
disaster
and
i
didnt
ask
didnt
find
out
i
thought
only
of
myself
oh
whats
the
matter
with
her
do
you
know
whats
the
matter
with
her
he
besought
sofya
matveyevna
then
he
swore
that
he
would
never
change
that
he
would
go
back
to
her
that
is
varvara
petrovna
we
that
is
he
and
sofya
matveyevna
will
go
to
her
steps
every
day
when
she
is
getting
into
her
carriage
for
her
morning
drive
and
we
will
watch
her
in
secret
oh
i
wish
her
to
smite
me
on
the
other
cheek
its
a
joy
to
wish
it
i
shall
turn
her
my
other
cheek
comme
dans
votre
livre
only
now
for
the
first
time
i
understand
what
is
meant
by
turning
the
other
cheek
i
never
understood
before
the
two
days
that
followed
were
among
the
most
terrible
in
sofya
matveyevnas
life
she
remembers
them
with
a
shudder
to
this
day
stepan
trofimovitch
became
so
seriously
ill
that
he
could
not
go
on
board
the
steamer
which
on
this
occasion
arrived
punctually
at
two
oclock
in
the
afternoon
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
leave
him
alone
so
she
did
not
leave
for
spasov
either
from
her
account
he
was
positively
delighted
at
the
steamers
going
without
him
well
thats
a
good
thing
thats
capital
he
muttered
in
his
bed
ive
been
afraid
all
the
time
that
we
should
go
here
its
so
nice
better
than
anywhere
you
wont
leave
me
oh
you
have
not
left
me
it
was
by
no
means
so
nice
here
however
he
did
not
care
to
hear
of
her
difficulties
his
head
was
full
of
fancies
and
nothing
else
he
looked
upon
his
illness
as
something
transitory
a
trifling
ailment
and
did
not
think
about
it
at
all
he
thought
of
nothing
but
how
they
would
go
and
sell
these
books
he
asked
her
to
read
him
the
gospel
i
havent
read
it
for
a
long
time
in
the
original
some
one
may
ask
me
about
it
and
i
shall
make
a
mistake
i
ought
to
prepare
myself
after
all
she
sat
down
beside
him
and
opened
the
book
you
read
beautifully
he
interrupted
her
after
the
first
line
i
see
i
see
i
was
not
mistaken
he
added
obscurely
but
ecstatically
he
was
in
fact
in
a
continual
state
of
enthusiasm
she
read
the
sermon
on
the
mount
assez

enough
dont
you
think
that
that
is
enough
and
he
closed
his
eyes
helplessly
he
was
very
weak
but
had
not
yet
lost
consciousness
sofya
matveyevna
was
getting
up
thinking
that
he
wanted
to
sleep

he
stopped

my
friend
ive
been
telling
lies
all
my
life
even
when
i
told
the
truth
i
never
spoke
for
the
sake
of
the
truth
but
always
for
my
own
sake
i
knew
it
before
but
i
only
see
it
now
oh
where
are
those
friends
whom
i
have
insulted
with
my
friendship
all
my
life
and
all
all
savezvous
perhaps
i
am
telling
lies
now
no
doubt
i
am
telling
lies
now
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
believe
myself
when
i
am
lying
the
hardest
thing
in
life
is
to
live
without
telling
lies
and
without
believing
in
ones
lies
yes
yes
thats
just
it
but
wait
a
bit

added
enthusiastically

sofya

asked
timidly
hadnt

pause

he
exclaimed
with
flashing
eyes
and
raising
his
head
from
the
pillow
i
never
knew
that
grand
passage
you
hear
better
be

you
stepan

ill
never
leave
you
she
took
his
hand
pressed
it
in
both
of
hers
and
laid
it
against
her
heart
looking
at
him
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
at
that
moment
she
said
describing
it
afterwards
his
lips
twitched
convulsively
but
stepan
trofimovitch
what
are
we
to
do
though
oughtnt
we
to
let
some
of
your
friends
know
or
perhaps
your
relations
but
at
that
he
was
so
dismayed
that
she
was
very
sorry
that
she
had
spoken
of
it
again
trembling
and
shaking
he
besought
her
to
fetch
no
one
not
to
do
anything
he
kept
insisting
no
one
no
one
well
be
alone
by
ourselves
alone
nous
partirons
ensemble
another
difficulty
was
that
the
people
of
the
house
too
began
to
be
uneasy
they
grumbled
and
kept
pestering
sofya
matveyevna
she
paid
them
and
managed
to
let
them
see
her
money
this
softened
them
for
the
time
but
the
man
insisted
on
seeing
stepan
trofimovitchs
papers
the
invalid
pointed
with
a
supercilious
smile
to
his
little
bag
sofya
matveyevna
found
in
it
the
certificate
of
his
having
resigned
his
post
at
the
university
or
something
of
the
kind
which
had
served
him
as
a
passport
all
his
life
the
man
persisted
and
said
that
he
must
be
taken
somewhere
because
their
house
wasnt
a
hospital
and
if
he
were
to
die
there
might
be
a
bother
we
should
have
no
end
of
trouble
sofya
matveyevna
tried
to
speak
to
him
of
the
doctor
but
it
appeared
that
sending
to
the
town
would
cost
so
much
that
she
had
to
give
up
all
idea
of
the
doctor
she
returned
in
distress
to
her
invalid
stepan
trofimovitch
was
getting
weaker
and
weaker
now
read
me
another
passage
about
the
pigs
he
said
suddenly
what
asked
sofya
matveyevna
very
much
alarmed
about
the
pigs
thats
there
too
ces
cochons
i
remember
the
devils
entered
into
swine
and
they
all
were
drowned
you
must
read
me
that
ill
tell
you
why
afterwards
i
want
to
remember
it
word
for

i
want
it
word
for

sofya
matveyevna
knew
the
gospel
well
and
at
once
found
the
passage
in
st
luke
which
i
have
chosen
as
the
motto
of
my
record
i
quote
it
here
again
and
there
was
there
one
herd
of
many
swine
feeding
on
the
mountain
and
they
besought
him
that
he
would
suffer
them
to
enter
into
them
and
he
suffered
them
then
went
the
devils
out
of
the
man
and
entered
into
the
swine
and
the
herd
ran
violently
down
a
steep
place
into
the
lake
and
were
choked
when
they
that
fed
them
saw
what
was
done
they
fled
and
went
and
told
it
in
the
city
and
in
the
country
then
they
went
out
to
see
what
was
done
and
came
to
jesus
and
found
the
man
out
of
whom
the
devils
were
departed
sitting
at
the
feet
of
jesus
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
and
they
were
afraid
my
friend
said
stepan
trofimovitch
in
great
excitement
savezvous
that
wonderful
and
extraordinary
passage
has
been
a
stumblingblock
to
me
all
my
life
dans
ce
livre
so
much
so
that
i
remembered
those
verses
from
childhood
now
an
idea
has
occurred
to
me
une
comparaison
a
great
number
of
ideas
keep
coming
into
my
mind
now
you
see
thats
exactly
like
our
russia
those
devils
that
come
out
of
the
sick
man
and
enter
into
the
swine
they
are
all
the
sores
all
the
foul
contagions
all
the
impurities
all
the
devils
great
and
small
that
have
multiplied
in
that
great
invalid
our
beloved
russia
in
the
course
of
ages
and
ages
oui
cette
russie
que
jaimais
toujours
but
a
great
idea
and
a
great
will
will
encompass
it
from
on
high
as
with
that
lunatic
possessed
of
devils
and
all
those
devils
will
come
forth
all
the
impurity
all
the
rottenness
that
was
putrefying
on
the
surface

and
they
will
beg
of
themselves
to
enter
into
swine
and
indeed
maybe
they
have
entered
into
them
already
they
are
we
we
and
those
and
petrusha
and
les
autres
avec
lui
and
i
perhaps
at
the
head
of
them
and
we
shall
cast
ourselves
down
possessed
and
raving
from
the
rocks
into
the
sea
and
we
shall
all
be
drownedand
a
good
thing
too
for
that
is
all
we
are
fit
for
but
the
sick
man
will
be
healed
and
will
sit
at
the
feet
of
jesus
and
all
will
look
upon
him
with
astonishment

he
sank
into
delirium
and
at
last
lost
consciousness
so
it
went
on
all
the
following
day
sofya
matveyevna
sat
beside
him
crying
she
scarcely
slept
at
all
for
three
nights
and
avoided
seeing
the
people
of
the
house

to
take
some
steps

came
on
the
third
day
in
the
morning
stepan
trofimovitch
returned
to
consciousness

her
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her

crossed
herself

wanted
to
look
out
of
the
window

said
good
heavens
i
had
not
seen
it
before
at
that
moment
there
was
the
rumble
of
a
carriage
at
the
cottage
door
and
a
great
hubbub
in
the
house
followed
iii
it
was
varvara
petrovna
herself
she
had
arrived
with
darya
pavlovna
in
a
closed
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
with
two
footmen
the
marvel
had
happened
in
the
simplest
way
anisim
dying
of
curiosity
went
to
varvara
petrovnas
the
day
after
he
reached
the
town
and
gossiped
to
the
servants
telling
them
he
had
met
stepan
trofimovitch
alone
in
a
village
that
the
latter
had
been
seen
by
peasants
walking
by
himself
on
the
high
road
and
that
he
had
set
off
for
spasov
by
way
of
ustyevo
accompanied
by
sofya
matveyevna
as
varvara
petrovna
was
for
her
part
in
terrible
anxiety
and
had
done
everything
she
could
to
find
her
fugitive
friend
she
was
at
once
told
about
anisim
when
she
had
heard
his
story
especially
the
details
of
the
departure
for
ustyevo
in
a
cart
in
the
company
of
some
sofya
matveyevna
she
instantly
got
ready
and
set
off
posthaste
for
ustyevo
herself
her
stern
and
peremptory
voice
resounded
through
the
cottage
even
the
landlord
and
his
wife
were
intimidated
she
had
only
stopped
to
question
them
and
make
inquiries
being
persuaded
that
stepan
trofimovitch
must
have
reached
spasov
long
before
learning
that
he
was
still
here
and
ill
she
entered
the
cottage
in
great
agitation
well
where
is

cried
seeing
sofya
matveyevna
who
appeared
at
that
very
instant
in
the
doorway
of
the
next
room

the
familiar
sounds
overwhelmed
stepan
trofimovitch
he
began
to
tremble
but
she
had
already
stepped
behind
the
screen
with
flashing
eyes
she
drew
up
a
chair
with
her
foot
and
sinking
back
in
it
she
shouted
to
dasha
go
away
for
a
time
stay
in
the
other
room
why
are
you
so
inquisitive
and
shut
the
door
properly
after
you
for
some
time
she
gazed
in
silence
with
a
sort
of
predatory
look
into
his
frightened
face
well
how
are

disgraced
me

taken

chre
his
voice
failed
him
and
he
could
not
articulate
a
syllable
but
simply
gazed
with
eyes
wide
with
horror

varvara

pushed
back
her
chair
uttering
a
loud
cry
of
alarm
water
water
though
he
returned
to
consciousness
she
was
still
shaking
with
terror
and
with
pale
cheeks
looked
at
his
distorted
face
it
was
only
then
for
the
first
time
that
she
guessed
the
seriousness
of

wideopen
frightened

only
just
going

the
gate
with
her
pack
and
her
bag
she
was
brought
back
she
was
so
panicstricken
that
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
varvara
petrovna
pounced
on
her
like
a
hawk
on
a
chicken
seized
her
by
the
hand
and
dragged
her
impulsively
to

varvara
petrovnas
hand
raised
it
to
his
eyes
and
burst
into
tears
sobbing
violently
and
convulsively

my

trofimovitch
murmured
at
last
addressing
sofya
matveyevna
stay

my
dear
i

to
say
something

sofya
matveyevna
hurried
out
at
once
chrie
chrie
he
gasped

a
bit

trofimovitch

little
till

she
sat
down
on
the
chair
again
stepan
trofimovitch
held
her
hand
tight
for
a
long
while
she
would
not
allow
him
to
speak
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
fell
to
kissing
it
she
set
her
teeth
and
looked
away
into
the
corner
of
the
room
je
vous
aimais
broke
from
him
at
last
she
had
never
heard
such
words
from
him
uttered
in
such
a
voice
hm
she
growled
in
response
je
vous
aimais
toute
ma
vie
vingt
ans
she
remained
silent
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
when
you
were
getting
yourself
up
for
dasha
you
sprinkled
yourself
with
scent
she
said
suddenly
in
a
terrible
whisper
stepan
trofimovitch
was
dumbfounded
you
put
on
a
new
tie
again
silence
for
two
minutes
do
you
remember
the
cigar
my
friend
he
faltered
overcome
with
horror
that
cigar
at
the
window
in
the
evening
the
moon
was
shining
after
the
arbour
at
skvoreshniki
do
you
remember
do
you
remember
she
jumped
up
from
her
place
seized
his
pillow
by
the
corners
and
shook
it
with
his
head
on
it
do
you
remember
you
worthless
worthless
ignoble
cowardly
worthless
man
always
worthless
she
hissed
in
her
furious
whisper
restraining
herself
from
speaking
loudly
at
last
she
left
him
and
sank
on
the
chair
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
enough
she
snapped
out
drawing
herself
up
twenty
years
have
passed
theres
no
calling
them
back
i
am
a
fool

he
clasped
his
hands
again
why
do
you
keep
on
with
your
aimais
and
aimais
enough
she
cried
leaping
up
again
and
if
you
dont
go
to
sleep
at
once
ill
you
need
rest

to

where
is
that
woman
where
is
she
there
was
a
general
bustle
again
but
stepan
trofimovitch
faltered
in
a
weak
voice
that
he
really
would
like
to
go
to
sleep
une
heure
and
then
un
bouillon
un
th
enfin
il
est
si
heureux
he
lay
back
and
really
did
seem
to
go
to
sleep
he
probably
pretended
to
varvara
petrovna
waited
a
little
and
stole
out
on
tiptoe
from
behind
the
partition
she
settled
herself
in
the
landladys
room
turned
out
the
landlady
and
her
husband
and
told
dasha
to
bring
her
that
woman
there
followed
an
examination
in
earnest
tell
me
all
about
it

good
girl

down
beside
me

right
well
i
met
stepan
trofimovitch
stay
hold
your
tongue
i
warn
you
that
if
you
tell
lies
or
conceal
anything
ill
ferret

out
well
stepan
trofimovitch
and
i
as
soon
as
i
came
to
hatovo
sofya
matveyevna
began
almost
breathlessly
stay
hold
your
tongue
wait
a
bit
why
do
you
gabble
like
that
to
begin
with
what
sort
of
creature
are
you
sofya
matveyevna
told
her
after
a
fashion
giving
a
very
brief
account
of
herself
however
beginning
with
sevastopol
varvara
petrovna
listened
in
silence
sitting
up
erect
in
her
chair
looking
sternly
straight
into
the
speakers
eyes
why
are
you
so
frightened
why
do
you
look
at
the
ground
i
like
people
who
look
me
straight
in
the
face
and
hold
their
own
with
me
go
on
she
told
of
their
meeting
of
her
books
of
how
stepan
trofimovitch
had
regaled
the
peasant
woman
with
vodka
thats
right
thats
right
dont
leave
out
the
slightest
detail
varvara
petrovna
encouraged
her
at
last
she
described
how
they
had
set
off
and
how
stepan
trofimovitch
had
gone
on
talking
really
ill
by
that
time
and
here
had
given
an
account
of
his
life
from
the
very
beginning
talking
for
some
hours
tell
me
about
his
life
sofya
matveyevna
suddenly
stopped
and
was
completely
nonplussed
i
cant
tell
you
anything
about
that
madam
she
brought
out
almost
crying
besides
i
could
hardly
understand
a
word
of
it
nonsense
you
must
have
understood
something
he
told
a
long
time
about
a
distinguished
lady
with
black
hair
sofya
matveyevna
flushed
terribly
though
she
noticed
varvara
petrovnas
fair
hair
and
her
complete
dissimilarity
with
the
brunette
of
the
story
blackhaired
what
exactly
come
speak
how
this
grand
lady
was
deeply
in
love
with
his
honour
all
her
life
long
and
for
twenty
years
but
never
dared
to
speak
and
was
shamefaced
before
him
because
she
was
a
very
stout
lady
the
fool
varvara
petrovna
rapped
out
thoughtfully
but
resolutely
sofya
matveyevna
was
in
tears
by
now
i
dont
know
how
to
tell
any
of
it
properly
madam
because
i
was
in
a
great
fright
over
his
honour
and
i
couldnt
understand
as
he
is
such
an
intellectual
gentleman
its
not
for
a
goose
like
you
to
judge
of
his
intellect
did
he
offer
you
his
hand
the
speaker
trembled
did
he
fall
in
love
with
you
speak
did
he
offer
you
his
hand
varvara
petrovna
shouted
peremptorily
that
was
pretty
much
how
it
was
she
murmured
tearfully
but
i
took
it
all
to
mean
nothing
because
of
his
illness
she
added
firmly
raising
her
eyes
what
is
your
name
sofya
matveyevna
madam
well
then
let
me
tell
you
sofya
matveyevna
that
he
is
a
wretched
and
worthless
little
man
good
lord
do
you
look
upon
me
as
a
wicked
woman
sofya
matveyevna
gazed
openeyed
a
wicked
woman
a
tyrant
who
has
ruined
his
life
how
can
that
be
when
you
are
crying
yourself
madam
varvara
petrovna
actually
had
tears
in
her
eyes
well
sit
down
sit
down
dont
be
frightened
look
me
straight
in
the
face
again
why
are
you
blushing
dasha
come
here
look
at
her
what
do
you
think
of
her
her
heart
is
pure
and
to
the
amazement
and
perhaps
still
greater
alarm
of
sofya
matveyevna
she
suddenly
patted
her
on
the
cheek
its
only
a
pity
she
is
a
fool
too
great
a
fool
for
her
age
thats
all
right
my
dear
ill
look
after
you
i
see
that
its
all
nonsense
stay
near
here
for
the
time
a
room
shall
be
taken
for
you
and
you
shall
have
food
and
everything
else
from
me
till
i
ask
for
you
sofya
matveyevna
stammered
in
alarm
that
she
must
hurry
on
youve
no
need
to
hurry
ill
buy
all
your
books
and
meantime
you
stay
here
hold
your
tongue
dont
make
excuses
if
i
hadnt
come
you
would
have
stayed
with
him
all
the
same
wouldnt
you
i
wouldnt
have
left
him
on
any
account
sofya
matveyevna
brought
out
softly
and
firmly
wiping
her
tears
it
was
late
at
night
when
doctor
salzfish
was
brought
he
was
a
very
respectable
old
man
and
a
practitioner
of
fairly
wide
experience
who
had
recently
lost
his
post
in
the
service
in
consequence
of
some
quarrel
on
a
point
of
honour
with
his
superiors
varvara
petrovna
instantly
and
actively
took
him
under
her
protection
he
examined
the
patient
attentively
questioned
him
and
cautiously
pronounced
to
varvara
petrovna
that
the
sufferers
condition
was
highly
dubious
in
consequence
of
complications
and
that
they
must
be
prepared
even
for
the
worst
varvara
petrovna
who
had
during
twenty
years
got
accustomed
to
expecting
nothing
serious
or
decisive
to
come
from
stepan
trofimovitch
was
deeply
moved
and
even
turned
pale
is
there
really
no
hope
can
there
ever
be
said
to
be
absolutely
no
hope
but
she
did
not
go
to
bed
all
night
and
felt
that
the
morning
would
never
come
as
soon
as
the
patient
opened
his
eyes
and
returned
to
consciousness
he
was
conscious
all
the
time
however
though
he
was
growing
weaker
every
hour
she
went
up
to
him
with
a
very
resolute
air
stepan
trofimovitch
one
must
be
prepared
for
anything
ive
sent
for
a
priest
you
must
do
what
is
right
knowing
his
convictions
she
was
terribly
afraid
of
his
refusing
he
looked
at
her
with
surprise
nonsense
nonsense
she
vociferated
thinking
he
was
already
refusing
this
is
no
time
for
whims
you
have
played
the
fool
enough
but
am
i
really
so
ill
then
he
agreed
thoughtfully
and
indeed
i
was
much
surprised
to
learn
from
varvara
petrovna
afterwards
that
he
showed
no
fear
of
death
at
all
possibly
it
was
that
he
simply
did
not
believe
it
and
still
looked
upon
his
illness
as
a
trifling
one
he
confessed
and
took
the
sacrament
very
readily
every
one
sofya
matveyevna
and
even
the
servants
came
to
congratulate
him
on
taking
the
sacrament
they
were
all
moved
to
tears
looking
at
his
sunken
and
exhausted
face
and
his
blanched
and
quivering
lips
oui
mes
amis
and
i
only
wonder
that
you
take
so
much
trouble
i
shall
most
likely
get
up
tomorrow
and
we
will
set
off
toute
cette
crmonie
for
which
of
course
i
feel
every
proper
respect
was
i
beg
you
father
to
remain
with
the
invalid
said
varvara
petrovna
hurriedly
stopping
the
priest
who
had
already
taken
off
his
vestments
as
soon
as
tea
has
been
handed
i
beg
you
to
begin
to
speak
of
religion
to
support
his
faith
the
priest
spoke
every
one
was
standing
or
sitting
round
the
sickbed
in
our
sinful
days
the
priest
began
smoothly
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
hand
faith
in
the
most
high
is
the
sole
refuge
of
the
race
of
man
in
all
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
life
as
well
as
its
hope
for
that
eternal
bliss
promised
to
the
righteous
stepan
trofimovitch
seemed
to
revive
a
subtle
smile
strayed
on
his
lips
mon
pre
je
vous
remercie
et
vous
tes
bien
bon
mais
no
mais
about
it
no
mais
at
all
exclaimed
varvara
petrovna
bounding
up
from
her
chair
father
she
said
addressing
the
priest
he
is
a
man
who
he
is
a
man
who
you
will
have
to
confess
him
again
in
another
hour
thats
the
sort
of
man
he
is
stepan
trofimovitch
smiled
faintly
my
friends
he
said
god
is
necessary
to
me
if
only
because
he
is
the
only
being
whom
one
can
love
eternally
whether
he
was
really
converted
or
whether
the
stately
ceremony
of
the
administration
of
the
sacrament
had
impressed
him
and
stirred
the
artistic
responsiveness
of
his
temperament
or
not
he
firmly
and
i
am
told
with
great
feeling
uttered
some
words
which
were
in
flat
contradiction
with
many
of
his
former
convictions
my
immortality
is
necessary
if
only
because
god
will
not
be
guilty
of
injustice
and
extinguish
altogether
the
flame
of
love
for
him
once
kindled
in
my
heart
and
what
is
more
precious
than
love
love
is
higher
than
existence
love
is
the
crown
of
existence
and
how
is
it
possible
that
existence
should
not
be
under
its
dominance
if
i
have
once
loved
him
and
rejoiced
in
my
love
is
it
possible
that
he
should
extinguish
me
and
my
joy
and
bring
me
to
nothingness
again
if
there
is
a
god
then
i
am
immortal
voil
ma

there
is

i
assure
you
there
is
varvara
petrovna
implored
him
give
it
up
drop
all
your
foolishness
for
once
in
your
life
i
think
she
had
not
quite
understood
his
profession
de
foi
my
friend
he
said
growing
more
and
more
animated
though
his
voice
broke
frequently
as
soon
as
i
understood
that
turning
of
the
cheek
i
understood
something
else
as
well

i
should
like

that
will

will
all
set
out
varvara
petrovna
burst
into
tears
he
was
looking
about
for
someone
here
she
is
she
is
here
she
seized
sofya
matveyevna
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
him
he
smiled
tenderly
oh
i
should
dearly
like
to
live
again
he
exclaimed
with
an
extraordinary
rush
of
energy
every
minute
every
instant
of
life
ought
to
be
a
blessing
to
man
they
ought
to
be
they
certainly
ought
to
be
its
the
duty
of
man
to
make
it
so
thats
the
law
of
his
nature
which
always
exists
even
if
hidden
oh
i
wish
i
could
see
petrusha
and
all
of
them
shatov
i
may
remark
that
as
yet
no
one
had
heard
of
shatovs
fatenot

petrovna
nor
darya

nor
even
salzfish
who
was
the
last
to
come
from
the
town
stepan
trofimovitch
became
more
and
more
excited
feverishly
so
beyond
his
strength
the
mere
fact
of
the
ever
present
idea
that
there
exists
something
infinitely
more
just
and
more
happy
than
i
am

me
through
and
through
with
tender
ecstasyand
glorifies
meoh
whoever
i
may
be
whatever
i
have
done
what
is
far
more
essential
for
man
than
personal
happiness
is
to
know
and
to
believe
at
every
instant
that
there
is
somewhere
a
perfect
and
serene
happiness
for
all
men
and
for
everything
the
one
essential
condition
of
human
existence
is
that
man
should
always
be
able
to
bow
down
before
something
infinitely
great
if
men
are
deprived
of
the
infinitely
great
they
will
not
go
on
living
and
will
die
of
despair
the
infinite
and
the
eternal
are
as
essential
for
man
as
the
little
planet
on
which
he
dwells
my
friends
all
all
hail
to
the
great
idea
the
eternal
infinite
idea
it
is
essential
to
every
man
whoever
he
may
be
to
bow
down
before
what
is
the
great
idea
even
the
stupidest
man
needs
something
great
petrusha
oh
how
i
want
to
see
them
all
again
they
dont
know
they
dont
know
that
that
same
eternal
grand
idea
lies
in
them
all
doctor
salzfish
was
not
present
at
the
ceremony
coming
in
suddenly
he
was
horrified
and
cleared
the
room
insisting
that
the
patient
must
not
be
excited
stepan
trofimovitch
died
three
days
later
but
by
that
time
he
was
completely
unconscious
he
quietly
went
out
like
a
candle
that
is
burnt
down
after
having
the
funeral
service
performed
varvara
petrovna
took
the
body
of
her
poor
friend
to
skvoreshniki
his
grave
is
in
the
precincts
of
the
church
and
is
already
covered
with
a
marble
slab
the
inscription
and
the
railing
will
be
added
in
the
spring
varvara
petrovnas
absence
from
town
had
lasted
eight
days
sofya
matveyevna
arrived
in
the
carriage
with
her
and
seems
to
have
settled
with
her
for
good
i
may
mention
that
as
soon
as
stepan
trofimovitch
lost
consciousness
the
morning
that
he
received
the
sacrament
varvara
petrovna
promptly
asked
sofya
matveyevna
to
leave
the
cottage
again
and
waited
on
the
invalid
herself
unassisted
to
the
end
but
she
sent
for
her
at
once
when
he
had
breathed
his
last
sofya
matveyevna
was
terribly
alarmed
by
varvara
petrovnas
proposition
or
rather
command
that
she
should
settle
for
good
at
skvoreshniki
but
the
latter
refused
to
listen
to
her
protests
thats
all
nonsense
i
will
go
with
you
to
sell
the
gospel
i
have
no
one
in
the
world
now
you
have
a
son
however
salzfish
observed
i
have
no
son
varvara
petrovna
snapped
outand
it
was
like
a
prophecy
chapter
viii
conclusion
all
the
crimes
and
villainies
that
had
been
perpetrated
were
discovered
with
extraordinary
rapidity
much
more
quickly
than
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
expected
to
begin
with
the
luckless
marya
ignatyevna
waked
up
before
daybreak
on
the
night
of
her
husbands
murder
missed
him
and
flew
into
indescribable
agitation
not
seeing
him
beside
her
the
woman
who
had
been
hired
by
anna
prohorovna
and
was
there
for
the
night
could
not
succeed
in
calming
her
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
ran
to
fetch
arina
prohorovna
herself
assuring
the
invalid
that
the
latter
knew
where
her
husband
was
and
when
he
would
be
back
meantime
arina
prohorovna
was
in
some
anxiety
too
she
had
already
heard
from
her
husband
of
the
deed
perpetrated
that
night
at
skvoreshniki
he
had
returned
home
about
eleven
oclock
in
a
terrible
state
of
mind
and
body
wringing
his
hands
he
flung
himself
face
downwards
on
his
bed
and
shaking
with
convulsive
sobs
kept
repeating
its
not
right
its
not
right
its
not
right
at
all
he
ended
of
course
by
confessing
it
all
to
arina
prohorovnabut
to
no
one
else
in
the
house
she
left
him
on
his
bed
sternly
impressing
upon
him
that
if
he
must
blubber
he
must
do
it
in
his
pillow
so
as
not
to
be
overheard
and
that
he
would
be
a
fool
if
he
showed
any
traces
of
it
next
day
she
felt
somewhat
anxious
however
and
began
at
once
to
clear
things
up
in
case
of
emergency
she
succeeded
in
hiding
or
completely
destroying
all
suspicious
papers
books
manifestoes
perhaps
at
the
same
time
she
reflected
that
she
her
sister
her
aunt
her
sisterinlaw
the
student
and
perhaps
even
her
longeared
brother
had
really
nothing
much
to
be
afraid
of
when
the
nurse
ran
to
her
in
the
morning
she
went
without
a
second
thought
to
marya
ignatyevnas
she
was
desperately
anxious
moreover
to
find
out
whether
what
her
husband
had
told
her
that
night
in
a
terrified
and
frantic
whisper
that
was
almost
like
delirium
was
truethat
is
whether
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
been
right
in
his
reckoning
that
kirillov
would
sacrifice
himself
for
the
general
benefit
but
she
arrived
at
marya
ignatyevnas
too
late
when
the
latter
had
sent
off
the
woman
and
was
left
alone
she
was
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
she
got
out
of
bed
and
throwing
round
her
the
first
garment
she
could
find
something
very
light
and
unsuitable
for
the
weather
i
believe
she
ran
down
to
kirillovs
lodge
herself
thinking
that
he
perhaps
would
be
better
able
than
anyone
to
tell
her
something
about
her
husband
the
terrible
effect
on
her
of
what
she
saw
there
may
well
be
imagined
it
is
remarkable
that
she
did
not
read
kirillovs
last
letter
which
lay
conspicuously
on
the
table
overlooking
it
of
course
in
her
fright
she
ran
back
to
her
room
snatched
up
her
baby
and
went
with
it
out
of
the
house
into
the
street
it
was
a
damp
morning
there
was
a
fog
she
met
no
passersby
in
such
an
outoftheway
street
she
ran
on
breathless
through
the
wet
cold
mud
and
at
last
began
knocking
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
in
the
first
house
no
one
came
to
the
door
in
the
second
they
were
so
long
in
coming
that
she
gave
it
up
impatiently
and
began
knocking
at
a
third
door
this
was
the
house
of
a
merchant
called
titov
here
she
wailed
and
kept
declaring
incoherently
that
her
husband
was
murdered
causing
a
great
flutter
in
the
house
something
was
known
about
shatov
and
his
story
in
the
titov
household
they
were
horrorstricken
that
she
should
be
running
about
the
streets
in
such
attire
and
in
such
cold
with
the
baby
scarcely
covered
in
her
arms
when
according
to
her
story
she
had
only
been
confined
the
day
before
they
thought
at
first
that
she
was
delirious
especially
as
they
could
not
make
out
whether
it
was
kirillov
who
was
murdered
or
her
husband
seeing
that
they
did
not
believe
her
she
would
have
run
on
farther
but
they
kept
her
by
force
and
i
am
told
she
screamed
and
struggled
terribly
they
went
to
filipovs
and
within
two
hours
kirillovs
suicide
and
the
letter
he
had
left
were
known
to
the
whole
town
the
police
came
to
question
marya
ignatyevna
who
was
still
conscious
and
it
appeared
at
once
that
she
had
not
read
kirillovs
letter
and
they
could
not
find
out
from
her
what
had
led
her
to
conclude
that
her
husband
had
been
murdered
she
only
screamed
that
if
kirillov
was
murdered
then
her
husband
was
murdered
they
were
together
towards
midday
she
sank
into
a
state
of
unconsciousness
from
which
she
never
recovered
and
she
died
three
days
later
the
baby
had
caught
cold
and
died
before
her
arina
prohorovna
not
finding
marya
ignatyevna
and
the
baby
and
guessing
something
was
wrong
was
about
to
run
home
but
she
checked
herself
at
the
gate
and
sent
the
nurse
to
inquire
of
the
gentleman
at
the
lodge
whether
marya
ignatyevna
was
not
there
and
whether
he
knew
anything
about
her
the
woman
came
back
screaming
frantically
persuading
her
not
to
scream
and
not
to
tell
anyone
by
the
timehonoured
argument
that
she
would
get
into
trouble
she
stole
out
of
the
yard
it
goes
without
saying
that
she
was
questioned
the
same
morning
as
having
acted
as
midwife
to
marya
ignatyevna
but
they
did
not
get
much
out
of
her
she
gave
a
very
cool
and
sensible
account
of
all
she
had
herself
heard
and
seen
at
shatovs
but
as
to
what
had
happened
she
declared
that
she
knew
nothing
and
could
not
understand
it
it
may
well
be
imagined
what
an
uproar
there
was
in
the
town
a
new
sensation
another
murder
but
there
was
another
element
in
this
case
it
was
clear
that
a
secret
society
of
murderers
incendiaries
and
revolutionists
did
exist
did
actually
exist
lizas
terrible
death
the
murder
of
stavrogins
wife
stavrogin
himself
the
fire
the
ball
for
the
benefit
of
the
governesses
the
laxity
of
manners
and
morals
in
yulia
mihailovnas
circle
even
in
the
disappearance
of
stepan
trofimovitch
people
insisted
on
scenting
a
mystery
all
sorts
of
things
were
whispered
about
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
by
the
end
of
the
day
people
knew
of
pyotr
stepanovitchs
absence
too
and
strange
to
say
less
was
said
of
him
than
of
anyone
what
was
talked
of
most
all
that
day
was
the
senator
there
was
a
crowd
almost
all
day
at
filipovs
house
the
police
certainly
were
led
astray
by
kirillovs
letter
they
believed
that
kirillov
had
murdered
shatov
and
had
himself
committed
suicide
yet
though
the
authorities
were
thrown
into
perplexity
they
were
not
altogether
hoodwinked
the
word
park
for
instance
so
vaguely
inserted
in
kirillovs
letter
did
not
puzzle
anyone
as
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
expected
it
would
the
police
at
once
made
a
rush
for
skvoreshniki
not
simply
because
it
was
the
only
park
in
the
neighbourhood
but
also
led
thither
by
a
sort
of
instinct
because
all
the
horrors
of
the
last
few
days
were
connected
directly
or
indirectly
with
skvoreshniki
that
at
least
is
my
theory
i
may
remark
that
varvara
petrovna
had
driven
off
early
that
morning
in
chase
of
stepan
trofimovitch
and
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
in
the
town
the
body
was
found
in
the
pond
that
evening
what
led
to
the
discovery
of
it
was
the
finding
of
shatovs
cap
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
where
it
had
been
with
extraordinary
carelessness
overlooked
by
the
murderers
the
appearance
of
the
body
the
medical
examination
and
certain
deductions
from
it
roused
immediate
suspicions
that
kirillov
must
have
had
accomplices
it
became
evident
that
a
secret
society
really
did
exist
of
which
shatov
and
kirillov
were
members
and
which
was
connected
with
the
manifestoes
who
were
these
accomplices
no
one
even
thought
of
any
member
of
the
quintet
that
day
it
was
ascertained
that
kirillov
had
lived
like
a
hermit
and
in
so
complete
a
seclusion
that
it
had
been
possible
as
stated
in
the
letter
for
fedka
to
lodge
with
him
for
so
many
days
even
while
an
active
search
was
being
made
for
him
the
chief
thing
that
worried
every
one
was
the
impossibility
of
discovering
a
connectinglink
in
this
chaos
there
is
no
saying
what
conclusions
and
what
disconnected
theories
our
panicstricken
townspeople
would
have
reached
if
the
whole
mystery
had
not
been
suddenly
solved
next
day
thanks
to
lyamshin
he
broke
down
he
behaved
as
even
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
towards
the
end
begun
to
fear
he
would
left
in
charge
of
tolkatchenko
and
afterwards
of
erkel
he
spent
all
the
following
day
lying
in
his
bed
with
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
apparently
calm
not
uttering
a
word
and
scarcely
answering
when
he
was
spoken
to
this
is
how
it
was
that
he
heard
nothing
all
day
of
what
was
happening
in
the
town
but
tolkatchenko
who
was
very
well
informed
about
everything
took
into
his
head
by
the
evening
to
throw
up
the
task
of
watching
lyamshin
which
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
laid
upon
him
and
left
the
town
that
is
to
put
it
plainly
made
his
escape
the
fact
is
they
lost
their
heads
as
erkel
had
predicted
they
would
i
may
mention
by
the
way
that
liputin
had
disappeared
the
same
day
before
twelve
oclock
but
things
fell
out
so
that
his
disappearance
did
not
become
known
to
the
authorities
till
the
evening
of
the
following
day
when
the
police
went
to
question
his
family
who
were
panicstricken
at
his
absence
but
kept
quiet
from
fear
of
consequences
but
to
return
to
lyamshin
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
erkel
had
gone
home
earlier
relying
on
tolkatchenko
he
ran
out
of
his
house
and
of
course
very
soon
learned
the
position
of
affairs
without
even
returning
home
he
too
tried
to
run
away
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
but
the
night
was
so
dark
and
to
escape
was
so
terrible
and
difficult
that
after
going
through
two
or
three
streets
he
returned
home
and
locked
himself
up
for
the
whole
night
i
believe
that
towards
morning
he
attempted
to
commit
suicide
but
did
not
succeed
he
remained
locked
up
till
middayand
then
suddenly
he
ran
to
the
authorities
he
is
said
to
have
crawled
on
his
knees
to
have
sobbed
and
shrieked
to
have
kissed
the
floor
crying
out
that
he
was
not
worthy
to
kiss
the
boots
of
the
officials
standing
before
him
they
soothed
him
were
positively
affable
to
him
his
examination
lasted
i
am
told
for
three
hours
he
confessed
everything
everything
told
every
detail
everything
he
knew
every
point
anticipating
their
questions
hurried
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
all
volunteering
unnecessary
information
without
being
asked
it
turned
out
that
he
knew
enough
and
presented
things
in
a
fairly
true
light
the
tragedy
of
shatov
and
kirillov
the
fire
the
death
of
the
lebyadkins
and
the
rest
of
it
were
relegated
to
the
background
pyotr
stepanovitch
the
secret
society
the
organisation
and
the
network
were
put
in
the
first
place
when
asked
what
was
the
object
of
so
many
murders
and
scandals
and
dastardly
outrages
he
answered
with
feverish
haste
that
it
was
with
the
idea
of
systematically
undermining
the
foundations
systematically
destroying
society
and
all
principles
with
the
idea
of
nonplussing
every
one
and
making
hay
of
everything
and
then
when
society
was
tottering
sick
and
out
of
joint
cynical
and
sceptical
though
filled
with
an
intense
eagerness
for
selfpreservation
and
for
some
guiding
idea
suddenly
to
seize
it
in
their
hands
raising
the
standard
of
revolt
and
relying
on
a
complete
network
of
quintets
which
were
actively
meanwhile
gathering
recruits
and
seeking
out
the
weak
spots
which
could
be
attacked
in
conclusion
he
said
that
here
in
our
town
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
organised
only
the
first
experiment
in
such
systematic
disorder
so
to
speak
as
a
programme
for
further
activity
and
for
all
the
quintetsand
that
this
was
his
own
lyamshins
idea
his
own
theory
and
that
he
hoped
they
would
remember
it
and
bear
in
mind
how
openly
and
properly
he
had
given
his
information
and
therefore
might
be
of
use
hereafter
being
asked
definitely
how
many
quintets
there
were
he
answered
that
there
were
immense
numbers
of
them
that
all
russia
was
overspread
with
a
network
and
although
he
brought
forward
no
proofs
i
believe
his
answer
was
perfectly
sincere
he
produced
only
the
programme
of
the
society
printed
abroad
and
the
plan
for
developing
a
system
of
future
activity
roughly
sketched
in
pyotr
stepanovitchs
own
handwriting
it
appeared
that
lyamshin
had
quoted
the
phrase
about
undermining
the
foundation
word
for
word
from
this
document
not
omitting
a
single
stop
or
comma
though
he
had
declared
that
it
was
all
his
own
theory
of
yulia
mihailovna
he
very
funnily
and
quite
without
provocation
volunteered
the
remark
that
she
was
innocent
and
had
been
made
a
fool
of
but
strange
to
say
he
exonerated
nikolay
stavrogin
from
all
share
in
the
secret
society
from
any
collaboration
with
pyotr
stepanovitch
lyamshin
had
no
conception
of
the
secret
and
very
absurd
hopes
that
pyotr
stepanovitch
was
resting
on
stavrogin
according
to
his
story
nikolay
stavrogin
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
death
of
the
lebyadkins
which
had
been
planned
by
pyotr
stepanovitch
alone
and
with
the
subtle
aim
of
implicating
the
former
in
the
crime
and
therefore
making
him
dependent
on
pyotr
stepanovitch
but
instead
of
the
gratitude
on
which
pyotr
stepanovitch
had
reckoned
with
shallow
confidence
he
had
roused
nothing
but
indignation
and
even
despair
in
the
generous
heart
of
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
he
wound
up
by
a
hint
evidently
intentional
volunteered
hastily
that
stavrogin
was
perhaps
a
very
important
personage
but
that
there
was
some
secret
about
that
that
he
had
been
living
among
us
so
to
say
incognito
that
he
had
some
commission
and
that
very
possibly
he
would
come
back
to
us
again
from
petersburg
lyamshin
was
convinced
that
stavrogin
had
gone
to
petersburg
but
in
quite
a
different
capacity
and
in
different
surroundings
in
the
suite
of
persons
of
whom
perhaps
we
should
soon
hear
and
that
all
this
he
had
heard
from
pyotr
stepanovitch
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
secret
enemy
here
i
will
note
that
two
months
later
lyamshin
admitted
that
he
had
exonerated
stavrogin
on
purpose
hoping
that
he
would
protect
him
and
would
obtain
for
him
a
mitigation
in
the
second
degree
of
his
sentence
and
that
he
would
provide
him
with
money
and
letters
of
introduction
in
siberia
from
this
confession
it
is
evident
that
he
had
an
extraordinarily
exaggerated
conception
of
stavrogins
powers
on
the
same
day
of
course
the
police
arrested
virginsky
and
in
their
zeal
took
his
whole
family
too
arina
prohorovna
her
sister
aunt
and
even
the
girl
student
were
released
long
ago
they
say
that
shigalov
too
will
be
set
free
very
shortly
because
he
cannot
be
classed
with
any
of
the
other
prisoners
but
all
that
is
so
far
only
gossip
virginsky
at
once
pleaded
guilty
he
was
lying
ill
with
fever
when
he
was
arrested
i
am
told
that
he
seemed
almost
relieved
it
was
a
load
off
his
heart
he
is
reported
to
have
said
it
is
rumoured
that
he
is
giving
his
evidence
without
reservation
but
with
a
certain
dignity
and
has
not
given
up
any
of
his
bright
hopes
though
at
the
same
time
he
curses
the
political
method
as
opposed
to
the
socialist
one
in
which
he
had
been
unwittingly
and
heedlessly
carried
by
the
vortex
of
combined
circumstances
his
conduct
at
the
time
of
the
murder
has
been
put
in
a
favourable
light
and
i
imagine
that
he
too
may
reckon
on
some
mitigation
of
his
sentence
that
at
least
is
what
is
asserted
in
the
town
but
i
doubt
whether
there
is
any
hope
for
mercy
in
erkels
case
ever
since
his
arrest
he
has
been
obstinately
silent
or
has
misrepresented
the
facts
as
far
as
he
could
not
one
word
of
regret
has
been
wrung
from
him
so
far
yet
even
the
sternest
of
the
judges
trying
him
has
been
moved
to
some
compassion
by
his
youth
by
his
helplessness
by
the
unmistakable
evidence
that
he
is
nothing
but
a
fanatical
victim
of
a
political
impostor
and
most
of
all
by
his
conduct
to
his
mother
to
whom
as
it
appears
he
used
to
send
almost
the
half
of
his
small
salary
his
mother
is
now
in
the
town
she
is
a
delicate
and
ailing
woman
aged
beyond
her
years
she
weeps
and
positively
grovels
on
the
ground
imploring
mercy
for
her
son
whatever
may
happen
many
among
us
feel
sorry
for
erkel
liputin
was
arrested
in
petersburg
where
he
had
been
living
for
a
fortnight
his
conduct
there
sounds
almost
incredible
and
is
difficult
to
explain
he
is
said
to
have
had
a
passport
in
a
forged
name
and
quite
a
large
sum
of
money
upon
him
and
had
every
possibility
of
escaping
abroad
yet
instead
of
going
he
remained
in
petersburg
he
spent
some
time
hunting
for
stavrogin
and
pyotr
stepanovitch
suddenly
he
took
to
drinking
and
gave
himself
up
to
a
debauchery
that
exceeded
all
bounds
like
a
man
who
had
lost
all
reason
and
understanding
of
his
position
he
was
arrested
in
petersburg
drunk
in
a
brothel
there
is
a
rumour
that
he
has
not
by
any
means
lost
heart
that
he
tells
lies
in
his
evidence
and
is
preparing
for
the
approaching
trial
hopefully

and
as
it
were
triumphantly
he
even
intends
to
make
a
speech
at
the
trial
tolkatchenko
who
was
arrested
in
the
neighbourhood
ten
days
after
his
flight
behaves
with
incomparably
more
decorum
he
does
not
shuffle
or
tell
lies
he
tells
all
he
knows
does
not
justify
himself
blames
himself
with
all
modesty
though
he
too
has
a
weakness
for
rhetoric
he
tells
readily
what
he
knows
and
when
knowledge
of
the
peasantry
and
the
revolutionary
elements
among
them
is
touched
upon
he
positively
attitudinises
and
is
eager
to
produce
an
effect
he
too
is
meaning
i
am
told
to
make
a
speech
at
the
trial
neither
he
nor
liputin
seem
very
much
afraid
curious
as
it
seems
i
repeat
that
the
case
is
not
yet
over
now
three
months
afterwards
local
society
has
had
time
to
rest
has
recovered
has
got
over
it
has
an
opinion
of
its
own
so
much
so
that
some
people
positively
look
upon
pyotr
stepanovitch
as
a
genius
or
at
least
as
possessed
of
some
characteristics
of
a
genius
organisation
they
say
at
the
club
holding
up
a
finger
but
all
this
is
very
innocent
and
there
are
not
many
people
who
talk
like
that
others
on
the
other
hand
do
not
deny
his
acuteness
but
point
out
that
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
real
life
that
he
was
terribly
theoretical
grotesquely
and
stupidly
onesided
and
consequently
shallow
in
the
extreme
as
for
his
moral
qualities
all
are
agreed
about
that
there
are
no
two
opinions
i
do
not
know
whom
to
mention
next
so
as
not
to
forget
anyone
mavriky
nikolaevitch
has
gone
away
for
good
i
dont
know
where
old
madame
drozdov
has
sunk
into
dotage
i
have
still
one
very
gloomy
story
to
tell
however
i
will
confine
myself
to
the
bare
facts
on
her
return
from
ustyevo
varvara
petrovna
stayed
at
her
town
house
all
the
accumulated
news
broke
upon
her
at
once
and
gave
her
a
terrible
shock
she
shut
herself
up
alone
it
was
evening
every
one
was
tired
and
went
to
bed
early
in
the
morning
a
maid
with
a
mysterious
air
handed
a
note
to
darya
pavlovna
the
note
had
so
she
said
arrived
the
evening
before
but
late
when
all
had
gone
to
bed
so
that
she
had
not
ventured
to
wake
her
it
had
not
come
by
post
but
had
been
put
in
alexey
yegorytchs
hand
in
skvoreshniki
by
some
unknown
person
and
alexey
yegorytch
had
immediately
set
off
and
put
it
into
her
hands
himself
and
had
then
returned
to
skvoreshniki
for
a
long
while
darya
pavlovna
gazed
at
the
letter
with
a
beating
heart
and
dared
not
open
it
she
knew
from
whom
it
came
the
writer
was
nikolay
stavrogin
she
read
what
was
written
on
the
envelope
to
alexey
yegorytch
to
be
given
secretly
to
darya
pavlovna
here
is
the
letter
word
for
word
without
the
slightest
correction
of
the
defects
in
style
of
a
russian
aristocrat
who
had
never
mastered
the
russian
grammar
in
spite
of
his
european
education
dear
darya
pavlovnaat
one
time
you
expressed
a
wish
to
be
my
nurse
and
made
me
promise
to
send
for
you
when
i
wanted
you
i
am
going
away
in
two
days
and
shall
not
come
back
will
you
go
with
me
last
year
like
herzen
i
was
naturalised
as
a
citizen
of
the
canton
of
uri
and
that
nobody
knows
there
ive
already
bought
a
little
house
ive
still
twelve
thousand
roubles
left
well
go
and
live
there
for
ever
i
dont
want
to
go
anywhere
else
ever
its
a
very
dull
place
a
narrow
valley
the
mountains
restrict
both
vision
and
thought
its
very
gloomy
i
chose
the
place
because
there
was
a
little
house
to
be
sold
if
you
dont
like
it
ill
sell
it
and
buy
another
in
some
other
place
i
am
not
well
but
i
hope
to
get
rid
of
hallucinations
in
that
air
its
physical
and
as
for
the
moral
you
know
everything
but
do
you
know
all
ive
told
you
a
great
deal
of
my
life
but
not
all
even
to
you
not
all
by
the
way
i
repeat
that
in
my
conscience
i
feel
myself
responsible
for
my
wifes
death
i
havent
seen
you
since
then
thats
why
i
repeat
it
i
feel
guilty
about
lizaveta
nikolaevna
too
but
you
know
about
that
you
foretold
almost
all
that
better
not
come
to
me
my
asking
you
to
is
a
horrible
meanness
and
why
should
you
bury
your
life
with
me
you
are
dear
to
me
and
when
i
was
miserable
it
was
good
to
be
beside
you
only
with
you
i
could
speak
of
myself
aloud
but
that
proves
nothing
you
defined
it
yourself
a
nurseits
your
own
expression
why
sacrifice
so
much
grasp
this
too
that
i
have
no
pity
for
you
since
i
ask
you
and
no
respect
for
you
since
i
reckon
on
you
and
yet
i
ask
you
and
i
reckon
on
you
in
any
case
i
need
your
answer
for
i
must
set
off
very
soon
in
that
case
i
shall
go
alone
i
expect
nothing
of
uri
i
am
simply
going
i
have
not
chosen
a
gloomy
place
on
purpose
i
have
no
ties
in
russiaeverything
is
as
alien
to
me
there
as
everywhere
its
true
that
i
dislike
living
there
more
than
anywhere
but
i
cant
hate
anything
even
there
ive
tried
my
strength
everywhere
you
advised
me
to
do
this
that
i
might
learn
to
know
myself
as
long
as
i
was
experimenting
for
myself
and
for
others
it
seemed
infinite
as
it
has
all
my
life
before
your
eyes
i
endured
a
blow
from
your
brother
i
acknowledged
my
marriage
in
public
but
to
what
to
apply
my
strength
that
is
what
ive
never
seen
and
do
not
see
now
in
spite
of
all
your
praises
in
switzerland
which
i
believed
in
i
am
still
capable
as
i
always
was
of
desiring
to
do
something
good
and
of
feeling
pleasure
from
it
at
the
same
time
i
desire
evil
and
feel
pleasure
from
that
too
but
both
feelings
are
always
too
petty
and
are
never
very
strong
my
desires
are
too
weak
they
are
not
enough
to
guide
me
on
a
log
one
may
cross
a
river
but
not
on
a
chip
i
say
this
that
you
may
not
believe
that
i
am
going
to
uri
with
hopes
of
any
sort
as
always
i
blame
no
one
ive
tried
the
depths
of
debauchery
and
wasted
my
strength
over
it
but
i
dont
like
vice
and
i
didnt
want
it
you
have
been
watching
me
of
late
do
you
know
that
i
looked
upon
our
iconoclasts
with
spite
from
envy
of
their
hopes
but
you
had
no
need
to
be
afraid
i
could
not
have
been
one
of
them
for
i
never
shared
anything
with
them
and
to
do
it
for
fun
from
spite
i
could
not
either
not
because
i
am
afraid
of
the
ridiculousi
cannot
be
afraid
of
the
ridiculousbut
because
i
have
after
all
the
habits
of
a
gentleman
and
it
disgusted
me
but
if
i
had
felt
more
spite
and
envy
of
them
i
might
perhaps
have
joined
them
you
can
judge
how
hard
it
has
been
for
me
and
how
ive
struggled
from
one
thing
to
another
dear
friend
great
and
tender
heart
which
i
divined
perhaps
you
dream
of
giving
me
so
much
love
and
lavishing
on
me
so
much
that
is
beautiful
from
your
beautiful
soul
that
you
hope
to
set
up
some
aim
for
me
at
last
by
it
no
its
better
for
you
to
be
more
cautious
my
love
will
be
as
petty
as
i
am
myself
and
you
will
be
unhappy
your
brother
told
me
that
the
man
who
loses
connection
with
his
country
loses
his
gods
that
is
all
his
aims
one
may
argue
about
everything
endlessly
but
from
me
nothing
has
come
but
negation
with
no
greatness
of
soul
no
force
even
negation
has
not
come
from
me
everything
has
always
been
petty
and
spiritless
kirillov
in
the
greatness
of
his
soul
could
not
compromise
with
an
idea
and
shot
himself
but
i
see
of
course
that
he
was
greatsouled
because
he
had
lost
his
reason
i
can
never
lose
my
reason
and
i
can
never
believe
in
an
idea
to
such
a
degree
as
he
did
i
cannot
even
be
interested
in
an
idea
to
such
a
degree
i
can
never
never
shoot
myself
i
know
i
ought
to
kill
myself
to
brush
myself
off
the
earth
like
a
nasty
insect
but
i
am
afraid
of
suicide
for
i
am
afraid
of
showing
greatness
of
soul
i
know
that
it
will
be
another
sham
againthe
last
deception
in
an
endless
series
of
deceptions
what
good
is
there
in
deceiving
oneself
simply
to
play
at
greatness
of
soul
indignation
and
shame
i
can
never
feel
therefore
not
despair
forgive
me
for
writing
so
much
i
wrote
without
noticing
a
hundred
pages
would
be
too
little
and
ten
lines
would
be
enough
ten
lines
would
be
enough
to
ask
you
to
be
a
nurse
since
i
left
skvoreshniki
ive
been
living
at
the
sixth
station
on
the
line
at
the
stationmasters
i
got
to
know
him
in
the
time
of
debauchery
five
years
ago
in
petersburg
no
one
knows
i
am
living
there
write
to
him
i
enclose
the
address
nikolay
stavrogin
darya
pavlovna
went
at
once
and
showed
the
letter
to
varvara
petrovna
she
read
it
and
asked
dasha
to
go
out
of
the
room
so
that
she
might
read
it
again
alone
but
she
called
her
back
very
quickly
are
you
going
she
asked
almost
timidly
i
am
going
answered
dasha
get
ready
well
go
together
dasha
looked
at
her
inquiringly
what
is
there
left
for
me
to
do
here
what
difficulty
will
it
make
ill
be
naturalised
in
uri
too
and
live
in
the
valley
dont
be
uneasy
i
wont
be
in
the
way
they
began
packing
quickly
to
be
in
time
to
catch
the
midday
train
but
in
less
than
half
an
hours
time
alexey
yegorytch
arrived
from
skvoreshniki
he
announced
that
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
suddenly
arrived
that
morning
by
the
early
train
and
was
now
at
skvoreshniki
but
in
such
a
state
that
his
honour
did
not
answer
any
questions
walked
through
all
the
rooms
and
shut
himself
up
in
his
own
wing
though
i
received
no
orders
i
thought
it
best
to
come
and
inform
you
alexey
yegorytch
concluded
with
a
very
significant
expression
varvara
petrovna
looked
at
him
searchingly
and
did
not
question
him
the
carriage
was
got
ready
instantly
varvara
petrovna
set
off
with
dasha
they
say
that
she
kept
crossing
herself
on
the
journey
in
nikolay
vsyevolodovitchs
wing
of
the
house
all
the
doors
were
open
and
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
wouldnt
he
be
upstairs
fomushka
ventured
it
was
remarkable
that
several
servants
followed
varvara
petrovna
while
the
others
all
stood
waiting
in
the
drawingroom
they
would
never
have
dared
to
commit
such
a
breach
of
etiquette
before
varvara
petrovna
saw
it
and
said
nothing
they
went
upstairs
there
there
were
three
rooms
but
they
found
no
one
there
wouldnt
his
honour
have
gone
up
there
someone
suggested
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
loft
and
in
fact
the
door
of
the
loft
which
was
always
closed
had
been
opened
and
was
standing
ajar
the
loft
was
right
under
the
roof
and
was
reached
by
a
long
very
steep
and
narrow
wooden
ladder
there
was
a
sort
of
little
room
up
there
too
i
am
not
going
up
there
why
should
he
go
up
there
said
varvara
petrovna
turning
terribly
pale
as
she
looked
at
the
servants
they
gazed
back
at
her
and
said
nothing
dasha
was
trembling
varvara
petrovna
rushed
up
the
ladder
dasha
followed
but
she
had
hardly
entered
the
loft
when
she
uttered
a
scream
and
fell
senseless
the
citizen
of
the
canton
of
uri
was
hanging
there
behind
the
door
on
the
table
lay
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
words
in
pencil
no
one
is
to
blame
i
did
it
myself
beside
it
on
the
table
lay
a
hammer
a
piece
of
soap
and
a
large
nailobviously
an
extra
one
in
case
of
need
the
strong
silk
cord
upon
which
nikolay
vsyevolodovitch
had
hanged
himself
had
evidently
been
chosen
and
prepared
beforehand
and
was
thickly
smeared
with
soap
everything
proved
that
there
had
been
premeditation
and
consciousness
up
to
the
last
moment
at
the
inquest
our
doctors
absolutely
and
emphatically
rejected
all
idea
of
insanity
the
end
