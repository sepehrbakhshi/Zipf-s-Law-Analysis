here
offer
a

of
the
third
or
last
part
of

encyclopaedic
sketch
of
philosophythe
philosophy
of
mind
the
volume
like
its
subject
stands
complete
in
itself
but
it
may
also
be
regarded
as
a
supplement
or
continuation
of
the
work
begun
in
my
version
of
his
logic
i
have
not
ventured
upon
the
philosophy
of
nature
which
lies
between
these
two
that
is
a
province
to
penetrate
into
which
would
require
an
equipment
of
learning
i
make
no
claim
toa
province
also
of
which
the
presentday
interest
would
be
largely
historical
or
at
least
bound
up
with
historical
circumstances
the
translation
is
made
from
the
german
text
given
in
the
second
part
of
the
seventh
volume
of
hegels
collected
works
occasionally
corrected
by
comparison
with
that
found
in
the
second
and
third
editions
of
1827
and
1830
published
by
the
author
i
have
reproduced
only
hegels
own
paragraphs
and
entirely
omitted
the
zustze
of
the
editors
these
addendawhich
are
in
origin
lecturenotesto
the
paragraphs
are
in
the
text
of
the
collected
works
given
for
the
first
section
only
the
psychological
part
which
they
accompany
has
been
barely
treated
elsewhere
by
hegel
but
a
good
popular
exposition
of
it
will
be
found
in
erdmanns
psychologische
briefe
the
second
section
was
dealt
with
at
greater
length
by
hegel
himself
in
his
philosophy
of
law
1820
the
topics
of
the
third
section
are
largely
covered
by
his
lectures
on
art
religion
and
history
of
philosophy
i
do
not
conceal
from
myself
that
the
text
offers
a
hard
nut
to
crack
yet
here
and
there
even
through
the
medium
of
the
translation
i
think
some
light
cannot
fail
to
come
to
an
earnest
student
occasionally
too
as
for
instance
in

406
459
549
and
still
more
in

552
573
at
the
close
of
which
might
stand
the
words
liberavi
animam
meam
the
writer
really
lets
himself
go
and
gives
his
mind
freely
on
questions
where
speculation
comes
closely
in
touch
with
life
in
the
five
introductory
essays
i
have
tried
sometimes
to
put
together
and
sometimes
to
provide
with
collateral
elucidation
some
points
in
the
mental
philosophy
i
shall
not
attempt
to
justify
the
selection
of
subjects
for
special
treatment
further
than
to
hope
that
they
form
a
more
or
less
connected
group
and
to
refer
for
a
study
of
some
general
questions
of
system
and
method
to
my
prolegomena
to
the

almost
simultaneously

five
introductory
essays
in

and

essay
i
on
the
scope
of
a
philosophy
of
mind
the
art
of
finding
titles
and
of
striking
out
headings
which
catch
the
eye
or
ear
and
lead
the
mind
by
easy
paths
of
association
to
the
subject
under
exposition
was
not
one
of
hegels
gifts
a
stirring
phrase
a
vivid
or
picturesque
turn
of
words
he
often
has
but
his
lists
of
contents
when
they
cease
to
be
commonplace
are
apt
to
run
into
the
bizarre
and
the
grotesque
generally
indeed
his
rubrics
are
the
old
and
as
we
may
be
tempted
to
call
them
insignificant
terms
of
the
textbooks
but
in
hegels
use
of
them
these
conventional
designations
are
charged
with
a
highly
individualised
meaning
they
may
mean
morethey
may
mean
lessthan
they
habitually
pass
for
but
they
unquestionably
specify
their
meaning
with
a
unique
and
almost
personal
flavour
and
this
can
hardly
fail
to
create
and
to
disappoint
undue
expectations
i
philosophy
and
its
parts
even
the
main
divisions
of
his
system
show
this
conservatism
in
terminology
the
names
of
the
three
parts
of
the
encyclopaedia
are
we
may
say
nonsignificant
of
their
peculiar
contents
and
that
for
a
good
reason
what
hegel
proposes
to
give
is
no
novel
or
special
doctrine
but
the
universal
philosophy
which
has
passed
on
from
age
to
age
here
narrowed
and
there
widened
but
still
essentially
the
same
it
is
conscious
of
its
continuity
and
proud
of
its
identity
with
the
teachings
of
plato
and
aristotle
the
earliest
attempts
of
the
greek
philosophers
to
present
philosophy
in
a
complete
and
articulated
orderattempts
generally
attributed
to
the
stoics
the
schoolmen
of
antiquitymade
it
a
tripartite
whole
these
three
parts
were
logic
physics
and
ethics
in
their
entirety
they
were
meant
to
form
a
cycle
of
unified
knowledge
satisfying
the
needs
of
theory
as
well
as
practice
as
time
went
on
however
the
situation
changed
and
if
the
old
names
remained
their
scope
and
value
suffered
many
changes
new
interests
and
curiosities
due
to
altered
circumstances
brought
other
departments
of
reality
under
the
focus
of
investigation
besides
those
which
had
been
primarily
discussed
under
the
old
names
inquiries
became
more
specialised
and
each
tended
to
segregate
itself
from
the
rest
as
an
independent
field
of
science
the
result
was
that
in
modern
times
the
territory
still
marked
by
the
ancient
titles
had
shrunk
to
a
mere
phantom
of
its
former
bulk
almost
indeed
things
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
timehonoured
figures
had
sunk
into
the
misery
of
rois
fainants
while
the
real
business
of
knowledge
was
discharged
by
the
younger
and
less
conventional
lines
of
research
which
the
needs
and
fashions
of
the
time
had
called
up
thus
logic
in
the
narrow
formal
sense
was
turned
into
an
art
of
argumentation
and
a
system
of
technical
rules
for
the
analysis
and
synthesis
of
academical
discussion
physics
or
natural
philosophy
restricted
itself
to
the
elaboration
of
some
metaphysical
postulates
or
hypotheses
regarding
the
general
modes
of
physical
operation
and
ethics
came
to
be
a
very
unpractical
discussion
of
subtleties
regarding
moral
faculty
and
moral
standard
meanwhile
a
theory
of
scientific
method
and
of
the
laws
governing
the
growth
of
intelligence
and
formation
of
ideas
grew
up
and
left
the
older
logic
to
perish
of
formality
and
inanition
the
successive
departments
of
physical
science
each
in
turn
asserting
its
independence
finally
left
natural
philosophy
no
alternative
between
clinging
to
its
outworn
hypotheses
and
abstract
generalities
or
identifying
itself
as
newton
in
his
great
book
put
it
with
the
principia
mathematica
of
the
physical
sciences
ethics
in
its
turn
saw
itself
on
one
hand
replaced
by
psychological
inquiries
into
the
relations
between
the
feelings
and
the
will
and
the
intelligence
while
on
the
other
hand
a
host
of
social
historical
economical
and
other
researches
cut
it
off
from
the
real
facts
of
human
life
and
left
it
no
more
than
the
endless
debates
on
the
logical
and
metaphysical
issues
involved
in
freewill
and
conscience
duty
and
merit
it
has
sometimes
been
said
that
kant
settled
this
controversy
between
the
old
departments
of
philosophy
and
the
new
branches
of
science
and
the
settlement
it
is
implied
consisted
in
assigning
to
the
philosopher
a
sort
of
police
and
patrol
duty
in
the
commonwealth
of
science
he
was
to
see
that
boundaries
were
duly
respected
and
that
each
science
kept
strictly
to
its
own
business
for
this
purpose
each
branch
of
philosophy
was
bound
to
convert
itself
into
a
department
of
criticisman
examination
of
first
principles
in
the
several
provinces
of
reality
or
experiencewith
a
view
to
get
a
distinct
conception
of
what
they
were
and
thus
define
exactly
the
lines
on
which
the
structures
of
more
detailed
science
could
be
put
up
solidly
and
safely
this
plan
offered
tempting
lines
to
research
and
sounded
well
but
on
further
reflection
there
emerge
one
or
two
difficulties
hard
to
get
over
paradoxical
though
it
may
seem
one
cannot
rightly
estimate
the
capacity
and
range
of
foundations
before
one
has
had
some
familiarity
with
the
buildings
erected
upon
them
thus
you
are
involved
in
a
circle
a
circle
which
is
probably
inevitable
but
which
for
that
reason
it
is
well
to
recognise
at
once
thenwhat
is
only
another
way
of
saying
the
same
thingit
is
impossible
to
draw
an
inflexible
line
between
premises
of
principle
and
conclusions
of
detail
there
is
no
spot
at
which
criticism
can
stop
and
having
done
its
business
well
hand
on
the
remaining
task
to
dogmatic
system
it
was
an
instinctive
feeling
of
this
implication
of
system
in
what
professed
only
to
be
criticism
which
led
the
aged
kant
to
ignore
his
own
previous
professions
that
he
offered
as
yet
no
system
and
when
fichte
maintained
himself
to
be
erecting
the
fabric
for
which
kant
had
prepared
the
ground
to
reply
by
the
counterdeclaration
that
the
criticism
was
the
systemthat
the
curtain
was
the
picture
the
hegelian
philosophy
is
an
attempt
to
combine
criticism
with
system
and
thus
realise
what
kant
had
at
least
foretold
it
is
a
system
which
is
selfcritical
and
systematic
only
through
the
absoluteness
of
its
criticism
in
hegels
own
phrase
it
is
an
immanent
and
an
incessant
dialectic
which
from
first
to
last
allows
finality
to
no
dogmatic
rest
but
carries
out
kants
description
of
an
age
of
criticism
in
which
nothing
however
majestic
and
sacred
its
authority
can
plead
for
exception
from
the
alltesting
elenchus
then
on
the
other
hand
hegel
refuses
to
restrict
philosophy
and
its
branches
to
anything
short
of
the
totality
he
takes
in
its
full
sense
that
oftenused
phrasethe
unity
of
knowledge
logic
becomes
the
allembracing

principles
which

and

old
divisions

logic
and
metaphysic

induction
and
deduction
between
theory
of
reasoning
and
theory
of
knowledgedivisions
which
those
who
most
employed
them
were
never
able
to
show
the
reason
and
purpose
ofbecause
indeed
they
had
grown
up
at
various
times
and
by
natural
selection
through
a
vast
mass
of
incidents
these
are
superseded
and
merged
in
one
continuous
theory
of
real
knowledge
considered
under
its
abstract
or
formal
aspectof
organised
and
known

in
its
underlying

but
these
first
principles
were
only
an
abstraction
from
complete
realitythe
reality
which
nature
has
when
unified
by
mindand
they
presuppose
the
total
from
which
they
are
derived
the
realm
of
pure
thought
is
only
the
ghost
of
the
ideaof
the
unity
and
reality
of
knowledge
and
it
must
be
reindued
with
its
flesh
and
blood
the
logical
world
is
in
kantian
phrase
only
the
possibility
of
nature
and
mind
it
comes
firstbecause
it
is
a
system
of
first
principles
but
these
first
principles
could
only
be
elicited
by
a
philosophy
which
has
realised
the
meaning
of
a
mental
experience
gathered
by
interpreting
the
facts
of
nature
natural
philosophy
is
no
longeraccording
to
hegels
view
of
itmerely
a
scheme
of
mathematical
groundwork
that
may
be
its
first
step
but
its
scope
is
a
complete
unity
which
is
not
a
mere
aggregate
of
the
branches
of
natural
knowledge
exploring
both
the
inorganic
and
the
organic
world
in
dealing
with
this
endless
problem
philosophy
seems
to
be
baulked
by
an
impregnable
obstacle
to
its
progress
every
day
the
advance
of
specialisation
renders
any
comprehensive
or
synoptic
view
of
the
totality
of
science
more
and
more
impossible
no
doubt
we
talk
readily
enough
of
science
but
here
if
anywhere
we
may
say
there
is
no
science
but
only
sciences
the
generality
of
science
is
a
proud
fiction
or
a
gorgeous
dream
variously
told
and
interpreted
according
to
the
varying
interest
and
proclivity
of
the
scientist
the
sciences
or
those
who
specially
expound
them
know
of
no
unity
no
philosophy
of
science
they
are
content
to
remark
that
in
these
days
the
thing
is
impossible
and
to
pick
out
the
faults
in
any
attempts
in
that
direction
that
are
made
outside
their
pale
unfortunately
for
this
contention
the
thing
is
done
by
us
all
and
indeed
has
to
be
done
if
not
as
men
of
science
yet
as
menas
human
beingswe
have
to
put
together
things
and
form
some
total
estimate
of
the
drift
of
development
of
the
unity
of
nature
to
get
a
notion
not
merely
of
the
general
methods
and
principles
of
the
sciences
but
of
their
results
and
teachings
and
to
get
this
not
as
a
mere
lot
of
fragments
but
with
a
systematic
unity
is
indispensable
in
some
degree
for
all
rational
life
the
life
not
founded
on
science
is
not
the
life
of
man
but
he
will
not
find
what
he
wants
in
the
textbooks
of
the
specialist
who
is
obliged
to
treat
his
subject
as
plato
says
under
the
pressure
of
necessity
and
who
dare
not
look
on
it
in
its
quality
to
draw
the
soul
towards
truth
and
to
form
the
philosophic
intellect
so
as
to
uplift
what
we
now
unduly
keep
down1
if
the
philosopher
in
this
province
does
his
work
but
badly
he
may
plead
the
novelty
of
the
task
to
which
he
comes
as
a
pioneer
or
even
an
architect
he
finds
little
that
he
can
directly
utilise
the
materials

been
gathered
and
prepared
for
very
special
aims
and
the

aim
of

be

hardly
been
kept
in
view
at
all
except
in
its
more
materialistic
aspects
to
the
philosopher
the
supreme
interest
of
the
physical
sciences
is
that
man
also
belongs
to
the
physical
universe
or
that
mind
and
matter
as
we
know
them
are
in
mr
spencers
language
at
once
antithetical
and
inseparable
he
wants
to
find
the
place
of

of
man
as

if
the
scope
of
natural
philosophy
be
thus
expanded
to

it
the
unity
and
more
than
the

of
the
several

make
it
the
whole
which
surpasses
the
addition
of
all
their
fragments
the
purpose
of
ethics
has
not
less
to
be
deepened
and
widened
ethics
under
that
title
hegel
knows
not
and
for
those
who
cannot
recognise
anything
unless
it
be
clearly
labelled
it
comes
natural
to
record
their
censure
of
hegelianism
for
ignoring
or
disparaging
ethical
studies
but
if
we
take
the
word
in
that
wide
sense
which
common
usage
rather
justifies
than
adopts
we
may
say
that
the
whole
philosophy
of
mind
is
a
moral
philosophy
its
subject
is
the
moral
as
opposed
to
the
physical
aspect
of
reality
the
inner
and
ideal
life
as
opposed
to
the
merely
external
and
real
materials
of
it
the
world
of
intelligence
and
of
humanity
it
displays
man
in
the
several
stages
of
that
process
by
which
he
expresses
the
full
meaning
of
nature
or
discharges
the
burden
of
that
task
which
is
implicit
in
him
from
the
first
it
traces
the
steps
of
that
growth
by
which
what
was
no
better
than
a
fragment
of
naturean
intelligence
located
as
it
seemed
in
one
piece
of
mattercomes
to
realise
the
truth
of
it
and
of
himself
that
truth
is
his
ideal
and
his
obligation
but
it
is
alsosuch
is
the
mystery
of
his
birthrighthis
idea
and
possession
helike
the
natural
universeis
as
the
logic
has
shown
a
principle
of
unification
organisation
idealisation
and
his
history
in
its
ideal
completeness
is
the
history
of
the
process
by
which
he
the
typical
man
works
the
fragments
of
reality
and
such
mere
reality
must
be
always
a
collection
of
fragments
into
the
perfect
unity
of
a
manysided
character
thus
the
philosophy
of
mind
beginning
with
man
as
a
sentient
organism
the
focus
in
which
the
universe
gets
its
first
dim
confused
expression
through
mere
feeling
shows
how
he
erects
himself
above
himself
and
realises
what
ancient
thinkers
called
his
kindred
with
the
divine
in
that
total
process
of
the
minds
liberation
and
selfrealisation
the
portion
specially
called
morals
is
but
one
though
a
necessary
stage
there
are
said
porphyry
and
the
later
platonists
four
degrees
in
the
path
of
perfection
and
selfaccomplishment
and
first
there
is
the
career
of
honesty
and
worldly
prudence
which
makes
the
duty
of
the
citizen
secondly
there
is
the
progress
in
purity
which
casts
earthly
things
behind
and
reaches
the
angelic
height
of
passionless
serenity
and
the
third
step
is
the
divine
life
which
by
intellectual
energy
is
turned
to
behold
the
truth
of
things
lastly
in
the
fourth
grade
the
mind
free
and
sublime
in
selfsustaining
wisdom
makes
itself
an
exemplar
of
virtue
and
is
even
a
father
of
gods
even
so
it
may
be
said
the
human
mind
is
the
subject
of
a
complicated
teleologythe
field
ruled
by
a
multifarious
ought
psychological
aesthetical
social
and
religious
to
adjust
their
several
claims
cannot
be
the
object
of
any
science
if
adjustment
means
to
supply
a
guide
in
practice
but
it
is
the
purpose
of
such
a
teleology
to
show
that
social
requirements
and
moral
duty
as
ordinarily
conceived
do
not
exhaust
the
range
of
obligationof
the
supreme
ethical
ought
how
that
can
best
be
done
is
however
a
question
of
some
difficulty
for
the
ends
under
examination
do
not
fall
completely
into
a
serial
order
nor
does
one
involve
others
in
such
a
way
as
to
destroy
their
independence
you
cannot
absolve
psychology
as
if
it
stood
independent
of
ethics
or
religion
nor
can
aesthetic
considerations
merely
supervene
on
moral
still
it
may
be
said
the
order
followed
by
hegel
seems
on
the
whole
liable
to
fewer
objections
than
others
mr
herbert
spencer
the
only
english
philosopher
who
has
even
attempted
a
system
of
philosophy
may
in
this
point
be
compared
with
hegel
he
also
begins
with
a
first
principlesa
work
which
like
hegels
logic
starts
by
presenting
philosophy
as
the
supreme
arbiter
between
the
subordinate
principles
of
religion
and
science
which
are
in
it
necessary
correlatives
the
positive
task
of
philosophy
is
with
some
inconsistency
or
vagueness
presented
in
the
next
place
as
a
unification
of
knowledge
such
a
unification
has
to
make
explicit
the
implicit
unity
of
known
reality
because
every
thought
involves
a
whole
system
of
thoughts
and
such
a
programme
might
again
suggest
the
logic
but
unfortunately
mr
spencer
does
not
and
he
has
francis
bacon
to
justify
him
here
think
it
worth
his
while
to
toil
up
the
weary
but
necessary
mount
of
purgatory
which
is
known
to
us
as
logic
with
a
nave
realism
he
builds
on
cause
and
power
and
above
all
on
force
that
ultimate
of
ultimates
which
seems
to
be
however
marvellously
a
denizen
both
of
the
known
and
the
unknowable
world
in
the
known
world
this
ultimate
appears
under
two
forms
matter
and
motion
and
the
problem
of
science
and
philosophy
is
to
lay
down
in
detail
and
in
general
the
law
of
their
continuous
redistribution
of
the
segregation
of
motion
from
matter
and
the
inclusion
of
motion
into
matter
of
this
process
which
has
no
beginning
and
no
endthe
rhythm
of
generation
and
corruption
attraction
and
repulsion
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
properly
not
a
first
principle
of
all
knowledge
but
the
general
or
fundamental
portion
of
natural
philosophy
to
which
mr
spencer
next
proceeds
such
a
philosophy
however
he
gives
only
in
part
viz
as
a
biology
dealing
with
organic
and
at
a
further
stage
and
under
other
names
with
supraorganic
life
and
that
the
philosophy
of
nature
should
take
this
form
and
carry
both
the
first
principles
and
the
later
portions
of
the
system
with
it
as
parts
of
a
philosophy
of
evolution
is
what
we
should
have
expected
from
the
contemporaneous
interests
of
science2
even
a
onesided
attempt
to
give
speculative
unity
to
those
researches
which
getfor
reasons
the
scientific
specialist
seldom
asksthe
title
of
biological
is
however
worth
noting
as
a
recognition
of
the
necessity
of
a
naturphilosophiea
speculative
science
of
nature
the
third
part
of
the
hegelian
system
corresponds
to
what
in
the
synthetic
philosophy
is
known
as
psychology
ethics
and
sociology
and
here
mr
spencer
recognises
that
something
new
has
turned
up
psychology
is
unique
as
a
science
it
is
a
double
science
and
as
a
whole
quite
sui
generis
whether
perhaps
all
these
epithets
would
not
mutatis
mutandis
have
to
be
applied
also
to
ethics
and
sociology
if
these
are
to
do
their
full
work
he
does
not
say
in
what
this
doubleness
consists
he
even
finds
it
somewhat
difficult
to
show
for
as
his
fundamental
philosophy
does
not
on
this
point
go
beyond
noting
some
pairs
of
verbal
antitheses
and
has
no
sense
of
unity
except
in
the
imperfect
shape
of
a
relation3
between
two
things
which
are
antithetical
and
inseparable
he
is
perplexed
by
phrases
such
as
in
and
out
of
consciousness
and
stumbles
over
the
equivocal
use
of
inner
to
denote
both
mental
or
nonspatial
in
general
and
locally
subcuticular
in
special
still
he
gets
so
far
as
to
see
that
the
law
of
consciousness
is
that
in
it
neither
feelings
nor
relations
have
independent
subsistence
and
that
the
unit
of
mind
does
not
begin
till
what
he
calls
two
feelings
are
made
one
the
phraseology
may
be
faulty
but
it
shows
an
inkling
of
the
a
priori
unfortunately
it
is
apparently
forgotten
and
the
language
too
often
reverts
into
the
habit
of
what
he
calls
the
objective
ie
purely
physical
sciences
mr
spencers
conception
of
psychology
restricts
it
to
the
more
general
physics
of
the
mind
for
its
more
concrete
life
he
refers
us
to
sociology
but
his
sociology
is
yet
unfinished
and
from
the
plan
of
its
inception
and
the
imperfect
conception
of
the
ends
and
means
of
its
investigation
hardly
admits
of
completion
in
any
systematic
sense
to
that
incipiency
is
no
doubt
due
its
excess
in
historical
or
anecdotal
detaildetail
however
too
much
segregated
from
its
social
context
and
in
general
its
tendency
to
neglect
normal
and
central
theory
for
incidental
and
peripheral
facts
here
too
there
is
a
weakness
in
first
principles
and
a
love
of
catchwords
which
goes
along
with
the
fallacy
that
illustration
is
proof
above
all
it
is
evident
that
the
great
fact
of
religion
overhangs
mr
spencer
with
the
attraction
of
an
unsolved
and
unacceptable
problem
he
cannot
get
the
religious
ideas
of
men
into
coordination
with
their
scientific
aesthetic
and
moral
doctrines
and
only
betrays
his
sense
of
the
high
importance
of
the
former
by
placing
them
in
the
forefront
of
inquiry
as
due
to
the
inexperience
and
limitations
of
the
socalled
primitive
man
that
is
hardly
adequate
recognition
of
the
religious
principle
and
the
defect
will
make
itself
seriously
felt
should
he
ever
come
to
carry
out
the
further
stage
of
his
prospectus
dealing
with
the
growth
and
correlation
of
language

morals
and
aesthetics
ii

and
morals
a
mental
philosophyif
we
so
put
what
might
also
be
rendered
a
spiritual
philosophy
or
philosophy
of
spiritmay
to
an
english
reader
suggest
something
much
narrower
than
it
actually
contains
a
philosophy
of
the
human
mindif
we
consult
english
specimenswould
not
imply
much
more
than
a
psychology
and
probably
what
is
called
an
inductive
psychology
but
as
hegel
understands
it
it
covers
an
unexpectedly
wide
range
of
topics
the
whole
range
from
nature
to
spirit
besides
subjective
mind
which
would
seem
on
first
thoughts
to
exhaust
the
topics
of
psychology
it
goes
on
to
mind
as
objective
and
finally
to
absolute
mind
and
such
combinations
of
words
may
sound
either
selfcontradictory
or
meaningless
the
first
section
deals
with
the
range
of
what
is
usually
termed
psychology
that
term
indeed
is
employed
by
hegel
in
a
restricted
sense
to
denote
the
last
of
the
three
subsections
in
the
discussion
of
subjective
mind
the
mind
which
is
the
topic
of
psychology
proper
cannot
be
assumed
as
a
readymade
object
or
datum

emerges
from
the

is
the
crowning

of

preliminary

the

the
subject
of

as

understands
it
is
the
soulthe
raw
material
of
consciousness
the
basis
of
all
higher
mental
life
this
is
a
borderland
where
the
ground
is
still
debateable
between
nature
and
mind
it
is
the
region
of
feeling
where
the
sensibility
has
not
yet
been
differentiated
to
intelligence
soul
and
body
are
here
as
the
phrase
goes
in
communion
the
inward
life
is
still
imperfectly
disengaged
from
its
natural
cophysical
setting
still

it

master
of

but
the
halfpassive
receptacle
of
a
foreign
life
of
a
general
vitality
of
a
common
soul
not
yet
fully
differentiated
into
individuality
but
it
is
awaking
to

it

hegel
in
the
second
subsection
of
his
first
part
takes
us
to
the
phenomenology
of
mindto
consciousness
the
sentient
soul
is
also
consciousbut
in
a
looser
sense
of
that
word4
it
has
feelings
but
can
scarcely
be
said
itself
to
know
that
it
has
them
as
consciousness
the
soul
has
come
to
separate
what
it
is
from
what
it
feels
the
distinction
emerges
of
a
subject
which
is
conscious
and
an
object
of
which
it
is
conscious
and
the
main
thing
is
obviously
the
relationship
between
the
two
or
the
consciousness
itself
as
tending
to
distinguish
itself
alike
from
its
subject
and
its
object
hence
perhaps
may
be
gathered
why
it
is
called
phenomenology
of
mind
mind
as
yet
is
not
yet
more
than
emergent
or
apparent
nor
yet
selfpossessed
and
selfcertified
no
longer
however
one
with
the
circumambient
nature
which
it
feels
it
sees
itself
set
against
it
but
only
as
a
passive
recipient
of
it
a
tabula
rasa
on
which
external
nature
is
reflected
or
to
which
phenomena
are
presented
no
longer
on
the
other
hand
a
mere
passive
instrument
of
suggestion
from
without
its
instinct
of
life
its
nisus
of
selfassertion
is
developed
through
antagonism
to
a
like
nisus
into
the
consciousness
of
selfhood
of
a
me
and
mine
as
set
against
a
thee
and
thine
but
just
in
proportion
as
it
is
so
developed
in
opposition
to
and
recognition
of
other
equally
selfcentred
selves
it
has
passed
beyond
the
narrower
characteristic
of
consciousness
proper
it
is
no
longer
mere
intelligent
perception
or
reproduction
of
a
world
but
it
is
life
with
perception
or
apperception
of
that
life
it
has
returned
in
a
way
to
its
original
unity
with
nature
but
it
is
now
the
sense
of
its
selfhoodthe
consciousness
of
itself
as
the
focus
in
which
subjective
and
objective
are
at
one
or
to
put
it
in
the
language
of
the
great
champion
of

the

no

dwells
in

there
are

the

of
the

are
no
representations

not

adds
hegel6
is
just
this
elevation
above

physical
modes
and
above
the
complication
with
an
external
object
nothing
is
external
to
it
it
is
rather
the
internalising
of
all
externality
in
this
psychology
proper
we
are
out
of
any
immediate
connexion
with
physiology
psychology
as
such
remarks
herbart
has
its
questions
common
to
it
with
idealismwith
the
doctrine
that
all
reality
is
mental
reality
it
traces
in
hegels
exposition
of
it
the
steps
of
the
way
by
which
mind
realises
that
independence
which
is
its
characteristic
standpoint
on
the
intellectual
side
that
independence
is
assured
in
languagethe
system
of
signs
by
which
the
intelligence
stamps
external
objects
as
its
own
made
part
of
its
inner
world
a
science
some
one
has
said
is
after
all
only
une
langue
bien
faite
so
reversing
the
saying
we
may
note
that
a
language
is
an
inwardised
and
mindappropriated
world
on
the
active
side
the
independence
of
mind
is
seen
in
selfenjoyment
in
happiness
or
selfcontent
where
impulse
and
volition
have
attained
satisfaction
in
equilibrium
and
the
soul
possesses
itself
in
fullness
such
a
mind7
which
has
made
the
world
its
certified
possession
in
language
and
which
enjoys
itself
in
selfpossession
of
soul
called
happiness
is
a
free
mind
and
that
is
the
highest
which
subjective
mind
can
reach
at
this
point
perhaps
having
rounded
off
by
a
liberal
sweep
the
scope
of
psychology
the
ordinary
mental
philosophy
would
stop
hegel
instead
of
finishing
now
goes
on
to
the
field
of
what
he
calls
objective
mind
for
as
yet
it
has
been
only
the
story
of
a
preparation
an
inward
adorning
and
equipment
and
we
have
yet
to
see
what
is
to
come
of
it
in
actuality
or
rather
we
have
yet
to
consider
the
social
forms
on
which
this
preparation
rests
the
mind
selfpossessed
and
sure
of
itself
or
free
is
so
only
through
the
objective
shape
which
its
main
development
runs
parallel
with
an
intelligent
will
or
a
practical
reason
was
the
last
word
of
the
psychological
development
but
a
reason
which
is
practical
or
a
volition
which
is
intelligent
is
realised
by
action
which
takes
regular
shapes
and
by
practice
which
transforms
the
world
the
theory
of
objective
mind
delineates
the
new
form
which
nature
assumes
under
the
sway
of
intelligence
and
will
that
intellectual
world
realises
itself
by
transforming
the
physical
into
a
social
and
political
world
the
given
natural
conditions
of
existence
into
a
freelyinstituted
system
of
life
the
primitive
struggle
of
kinds
for
subsistence

the
ordinances
of
the

state

a

of

this
inward
faculty
whatever
be
its
degree

try
to
impress
itself
on

and
to
reproduce
itself
in
a
legal
a
moral
and
social
world
the
kingdom
of
deed
replaces
or
rises
on
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
of

and
instead
of
the
equilibrium
of
a
welladjusted
soul
comes
the
harmonious
life
of
a

we
are
in
short
in
the
sphere
of
ethics
and
politics

hereas
always
in

is
a
triad
of
steps
first
the
province
of
law
or
right
but
if
we
call
it
law
we
must
keep
out
of
sight
the
idea
of
a
special
lawgiver
of
a
conscious
imposition
of
laws
above
all
by
a
political
superior
and
if
we
call
it
right
we
must
remember
that
it
is
neutral
inhuman
abstract
right
the
right
whose
principle
is
impartial
and
impassive
uniformity

ordernot
moral
right
or
the
equity
which
takes
cognisance
of
circumstances
of
personal
claims
and
provides
against
its
own
hardness
the
intelligent
will
of
man
throwing
itself
upon
the
mere
gifts
of
nature
as
their
appointed
master
creates
the
world
of
propertyof
things
instrumental
and
regarded
as
adjectival
to
the
human
personality
but
the
autonomy
of
reason
which
is
latent
in
the
will
carries
with
it
certain
consequences
as
it
acts
it
also
by
its
inherent
quality
of
uniformity
or
universality
enacts
for
itself
a
law
and
laws
and
creates
the
realm
of
formal
equality
or
ordergiving
law
but
this
is
a
mere
equality
which
is
not
inconsistent
with
what
in
other
respects
may
be
excess
of
inequality
what
one
does
if
it
is
really
to
be
treated
as
done
others
may
or
even
must

an
expectation

the

perhaps
rather
the

framework
of

or
it
is
the

skeleton
which
is
to
be
clothed
upon
by
the
softer
and
fuller
outlines
of
the

and
the

organs
and
thus
the
first
range
of
objective
mind
postulates
the
second
which
hegel
calls
morality
the
word
is
to
be
taken
in
its
strict
sense
as
a
protest
against
the
quasiphysical
order
of
law
it
is
the
morality
of
conscience
and
of
the
good
will
of
the
inner
rectitude
of
soul
and
purpose
as
allsufficient
and
supreme
here
is
brought
out
the
complementary
factor
in
social
life
the
element
of
liberty
spontaneity
selfconsciousness
the
motto
of
mere
inward
morality
as
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
legality
is
in
kants
words
there
is
nothing
without
qualification
good
in
heaven
or
earth
but
only
a
good
will
the
essential
condition
of
goodness
is
that
the
action
be
done
with
purpose
and
intelligence
and
in
full
persuasion
of
its
goodness
by
the
conscience
of
the
agent
the
characteristic
of
morality
thus
described
is
its
essential
inwardness
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
conscience
over
all
heteronomy
its
justification
is
that
it
protests
against
the
authority
of
a
mere
external
or
objective
order
subsisting
and
ruling
in
separation
from
the
subjectivity
its
defect
is
the
turn
it
gives
to
this
assertion
of
the
rights
of
subjective
conscience
briefly
in
the
circumstance
that
it
tends
to
set
up
a
mere
individualism
against
a
mere
universalism
instead
of
realising
the
unity
and
essential
interdependence
of
the
two
the
third
subsection
of
the
theory
of
objective
mind
describes
a
state
of
affairs
in
which
this
antithesis
is
explicitly
overcome
this
is
the
moral
life
in
a
social
community
here
law
and
usage
prevail
and
provide
the
fixed
permanent
scheme
of
life
but
the
law
and
the
usage
are
in
their
true
or
ideal
conception
only
the
unforced
expression
of
the
mind
and
will
of
those
who
live
under
them
and
on
the
other
hand
the
mind
and
will
of
the
individual
members
of
such
a

pervaded

animated
by
its
universal
spirit
in
such
a
community
and
so
constituting
it
the
individual
is
at
once
free
and
equal
and
that
because
of
the
spirit
of
fraternity
which
forms
its
spiritual
link
in
the
world
supposed
to
be
governed
by
mere
legality
the
idea
of
right
is
exclusively
prominent
and
when
that
is
the
case
it
may
often
happen
that
summum
jus
summa
injuria
in
mere
morality
the
stress
falls
exclusively
on
the
idea
of
inward
freedom
or
the
necessity
of
the
harmony
of
the
judgment
and
the
will
or
the
dependence
of
conduct
upon
conscience
in
the
union
of
the
two
in
the
moral
community
as
normally
constituted
the
mere
idea
of
right
is
replaced
or
controlled
and
modified
by
the
idea
of
equitya
balance
as
it
were
between
the
two
preceding
inasmuch
as
motive
and
purpose
are
employed
to
modify
and
interpret
strict
right
but
this
effectthis
harmonisationis
brought
about
by
the
predominance
of

benevolencea
principle
however
which
is
itself
modified
by
the
fundamental
idea
of
right
or
law8
into
a
wise
or
regulated
kindliness
but
what
hegel
chiefly
deals
with
under
this
head
is
the
interdependence
of
form
and
content
of
social
order
and
personal
progress
in
the
picture
of
an
ethical
organisation
or
harmoniouslyalive
moral
community
he
shows
us
partly
the
underlying
idea
which
gave
room
for
the
antithesis
between
law
and
conscience
and
partly
the
outlines
of
the
ideal
in
which
that
conflict
becomes
only
the
instrument
of
progress
this
organisation
has
three
grades
or
three
typical
aspects
these
are
the
family
civil
society
and
the
state
the
first
of
these
the
family
must
be
taken
to
include
those
primary
unities
of
human
life
where
the
natural
affinity
of
sex
and
the
natural
ties
of
parentage
are
the
preponderant
influence
in
forming
and
maintaining
the
social
group
this
as
it
were
is
the
soulnucleus
of
social
organisation
where
the
principle
of
unity
is
an
instinct
a
feeling
an
absorbing
solidarity
next
comes
what
hegel
has
called
civil
societymeaning
however
by
civil
the
antithesis
to
political
the
society
of
those
who
may
be
styled
bourgeois
not
citoyensand
meaning
by
society
the
antithesis
to
community
there
are
other
natural
influences

also
in
a
way
much
less

and

civil

is
the
more

aggregate
of
such
associations
which
if

they

more
sharply
the
tendency

in

the
synthesis
of
family
and
society

the
family

as
the

on
the
basis
of
a
predominant

in
so

as
the

the

such
a

hegel
describes
is
essentially
the
idea

ideal
of
the
modern

a
certain
artificial

it
must

the
several

the

the

this
circumstance

to
intensify

even

to

religion
and
philosophy
it
may
be
well
at
this
point
to
guard
against
a
misconception
of
this
serial
order
of
exposition14
as
stage
is
seen
to
follow
stage
the
historical
imagination
which
governs
our
ordinary
current
of
ideas
turns
the
logical
dependence
into
a
timesequence
but
it
is
of
course
not
meant
that
the
later
stage
follows
the
earlier
in
history
the
later
is
the
more
real
and
therefore
the
more
fundamental
but
we
can
only
understand
by
abstracting
and
then
transcending
our
abstractions
or
rather
by
showing
how
the
abstraction
implies
relations
which
force
us
to
go
further
and
beyond
our
arbitrary
arrest
each
stage
therefore
either
stands
to
that
preceding
it
as
an
antithesis
which
inevitably
dogs
its
steps
as
an
accusing
spirit
or
it
is
the
conjunction
of
the
original
thesis
with
the
antithesis
in
a
union
which
should
not
be
called
synthesis
because
it
is
a
closer
fusion
and
true
marriage
of
minds
a
truth
and
reality
though
fundamental
is
only
appreciated
at
its
true
value
and
seen
in
all
its
force
where
it
appears
as
the
reconciliation
and
reunion
of
partial
and
opposing
points
of
view
thus
eg
the
full
significance
of
the
state
does
not
emerge
so
long
as
we
view
it
in
isolation
as
a
supposed
single
state
but
only
as
it
is
seen
in
the
conflict
of
history
in
its
actual
energy
as
a
worldpower
among
powers
always
pointing
beyond
itself
to
a
something
universal
which
it
fain
would
be
and
yet
cannot
be
or
again
there
never
was
a
civil
or
economic
society
which
existed
save
under
the
wing
of
a
state
or
in
onesided
assumption
of
state
powers
to
itself
and
a
family
is
no
isolated
and
independent
unit
belonging
to
a
supposed
patriarchal
age
but
was
always
mixed
up
with
and
in
manifold
dependence
upon
political
and
civil
combinations
the
true
family
indeed
far
from
preceding
the
state
in
time
presupposes
the
political
power
to
give
it
its
precise
sphere
and
its
social
stability
as
is
well
illustrated
by
that
typical
form
of
it
presented
in
the
roman
state
so
again
religion
does
not
supervene
upon
an
already
existing
political
and
moral
system
and
invest
it
with
an
additional
sanction
the
true
order
would
be
better
described
as
the
reverse
the
real
basis
of
social
life
and
even
of
intelligence
is
religion
as
some
thinkers
quaintly
put
it
the
known
rests
and
lives
on
the
bosom
of
the
unknowable
but
when
we
say
that
we
must
at
once
guard
against
a
misconception
there
are
religions
of
all
sorts
and
some
of
them
which
are
most
heard
of
in
the
modern
world
only
exist
or
survive
in
the
shape
of
a
traditional
name
and
venerated
creed
which
has
lost
its
power
nor
is
a
religion
necessarily
committed
to
a
definite
conception
of
a
supernaturalof
a
personal
power
outside
the
order
of
nature
but
in
all
cases
religion
is
a
faith
and
a
theory
which
gives
unity
to
the
facts
of
life
and
gives
it
not
because
the
unity
is
in
detail
proved
or
detected
but
because
life
and
experience
in
their
deepest
reality
inexorably
demand
and
evince
such
a
unity
to
the
heart
the
religion
of
a
time
is
not
its
nominal
creed
but
its
dominant
conviction
of
the
meaning
of
reality
the
principle
which
animates
all
its
being
and
all
its
striving
the
faith
it
has
in
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
purpose
of
life
dimly
or
clearly
felt
and
perceived
religion
has
for
its
principle
one
cannot
well
say
its
object
not
the
unknowable
but
the
inner
unity
of
life
and
knowledge
of
act
and
consciousness
a
unity
which
is
certified
in
its
every
knowledge
but
is
never
fully
demonstrable
by
the
summation
of
all
its
ascertained
items
as
such
a
felt
and
believed
synthesis
of
the
world
and
life
religion
is
the
unity
which
gives
stability
and
harmony
to
the
social
sphere
just
as
morality
in
its
turn
gives
a
partial
and
practical
realisation
to
the
ideal
of
religion
but
religion
does
not
merely
establish
and
sanction
morality
it
also
frees
it
from
a
certain
narrowness
it
always
has
as
of
the
earth
or
otherwise
put
morality
has
to
the
keener
inspection
something
in
it
which
is
more
than
the
mere
moral
injunction
at
first
indicates
beyond
the
moral
in
its
stricter
sense
as
the
obligatory
duty
and
the
obedience
to
law
rises
and
expands
the
beautiful
and
the
good
a
beautiful
which
is
disinterestedly
loved
and
a
goodness
which
has
thrown
off
all
utilitarian
relativity
and
become
a
free
selfenhancing
joy
the
true
spirit
of
religion
sees
in
the
divine
judgment
not
a
mere
final
sanction
to
human
morality
which
has
failed
of
its
earthly
close
not
the
readjustment
of
social
and
political
judgments
in
accordance
with
our
more
conscientious
inner
standards
but
a
certain
though
for
our
partbypart
vision
incalculable
proportion
between
what
is
done
and
suffered
and
in
this
liberation
of
the
moral
from
its
restrictions
art
renders
no
slight
aid
thus
in
different
ways
religion
presupposes
morality
to
fill
up
its
vacant
form
and
morality
presupposes
religion
to
give
its
laws
an
ultimate

much
they
rise
in
the
heights
of
the
ideal
world
they
never
leave
the
reality
of
life
and
circumstance
behind
and
float
in
the
free
empyrean
yet
there
are
degrees
of
universality
degrees
in
which
they
reach
what
they
promised
as
the
various
psychical
nuclei
of
an
individual
consciousness
tend
through
the
course
of
experience
to
gather
round
a
central
idea
and
by
fusion
and
assimilation
form
a
complete
mental
organisation
so
through
the
march
of
history
there
grows
up
a
complication
and
a
fusion
of
national
ideas
and
aspirations
which
though
still
retaining
the
individuality
and
restriction
of
a
concrete
national
life
ultimately
present
an
organisation
social
aesthetic
and
religious
which
is
a
type
of
humanity
in
its
universality
and
completeness
always
moving
in
the
measure

on
the
lines
of
the
real
development
of
its
social
organisation
the

imperfectly

the
keynote
to
the

is
to
be
found
in

or
religion
is
the
generic
description
of
that
phase
of
mind
which
has
found
rest
in
the
fullness
of
attainment
and
is
no
longer
a
struggle
and
a
warfare

a
fruition
it
is
the
conviction
of
all
nations
he
says16
that
in
the
religious
consciousness
they
hold
their
truth
and
they
have
always
regarded
religion
as
their
dignity
and
as
the
sunday
of
their
life
whatever
excites
our
doubts
and
alarms
all
grief
and
all
anxiety
all
that
the
petty
fields
of
finitude
can
offer
to
attract
us
we
leave
behind
on
the
shoals
of

as
the
traveller
on
the
highest
peak
of
a
mountain
range
removed
from
every
distinct
view
of
the
earths
surface
quietly
lets
his
vision
neglect
all
the
restrictions
of
the
landscape
and
the
world
so
in
this
pure
region
of
faith
man
lifted
above
the
hard

inflexible
reality
sees
it
with
his
minds

reflected
in
the
rays
of
the
mental
sun
to
an
image

its
discords
its
lights
and
shades
are
softened
to
eternal
calm
in
this
region
of
mind
flow
the
waters
of
forgetfulness
from
which
psyche
drinks

in
which
she
drowns
all
her
pain
and
the
darknesses
of
this
life
are
here
softened
to
a
dreamimage
and
transfigured
into
a
mere
setting
for
the
splendours
of
the
eternal
if
we
take
religion
in
this
extended
sense
we
find
it
is
the
sense
the
vision
the
faith
the
certainty
of
the
eternal
in
the
changeable
of
the
infinite
in
the
finite
of
the
reality

it
is
freedom
from
the
distractions
and
preoccupations

of

it
is
the
sense
of
permanence
repose
certainty
rounding
off
toning
down
and
absorbing
the
vicissitude
the
restlessness

phases
of

which
have
been
already

religion
will
vary
enormously
according
to
the
grade
of
national
mood
of
mind
and
social
development
in
which
it
emerges
but
whatever
be
the
peculiarities
of
its
original
swaddlingclothes
its
cardinal
note
will
be
a
sense
of
dependence
on
and
independence
in
something
more
permanent
more
august
more
of
a
surety
and
stay
than
visible
and
variable
nature
and
mansomething
also
which
whether

both
in
one
holds
the
keys
of
life

death
of
weal

holds
them
from
some
safe
vantageground

this
central
being
the
outward
and
the
inward
past
and
present
and
to
come
are
made
one
and
as
already
indicated
religion
emerging
as
it
does
from
social
man
from
mind
ethical
will
retain
traces
of
the
two
foci
in
society
the
individual
subjectivity
and
the
objective
community
retain
them
however
only
as
traces
which
still
show
in
the
actually
envisaged
reconciliation
for
that
is
what
religion
does
to
morality
it
carries
a
step
higher
the
unity
or
rather
combination
gained
in
the
state
it
is
the
fuller
harmony
of
the
individual
and
the
collectivity
the
moral
conscience
rests
in
certainty
and
fixity
on
the
religious
but
religion
thus
widely
understood
as
the
faith
in
sempiternal
and
allexplaining
reality
at
first
appears
under
a
guise
of
art
the
poem
and
the
pyramid
the
templeimage
and
the
painting
the
drama
and
the
fairy
legend
these
are
religion
but
they
are
perhaps
religion
as
art
and
that
means
that
they
present
the
eternal
under
sensible
representations
the
work
of
an
artist
and
in
a
perishable
material
of
limited
range
yet
even
the
carvers
of
a
longpast
day
whose
works
have
been
disinterred
from
the
plateaux
of
auvergne
knew
that
they
gave
to
the
perishable
life
around
them
a
quasiimmortality
and
the
mythteller
of
a
savage
tribe
elevated
the
incident
of
a
season
into
a
perennial
power
of
love
and
fear
the
cynic
may
remind
us
that
from
the
finest
picture
of
the
artist
readily
we
turn
to
yonder
girl
that
fords
the
burn
and
yet
it
may
be
said
in
reply
to
the
cynic
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
deepimprinted
lesson
of
the
artist
it
would
have
been
but
a
brutal
instinct
that
would
have
drawn
our
eyes
the
artist
the
poet
the
musician
reveal
the
meaning
the
truth
the
reality
of
the
world
they
teach
us
they
help
us
backward
younger
brothers
to
see
to
hear
to
feel
what
our
rude
senses
had
failed
to
detect
they
enact
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
again
and
again
out
of
the
common
limited
things
of
every
day
they
produce
a
bread
of
life
in
which
the
generations
continue
to
find
nourishment
but
if
art
embodies
for
us
the
unseen
and
the
eternal
it
embodies
it
in
the
stone
the
colour
the
tone
and
the
word
and
these
are
by
themselves
only
dead
matter
to
the
untutored
eye
and
taste
the
finest
picturegallery
is
only
a
weariness
when
the
national
life
has
drifted
away
the
sacred
book
and
the
image
are
but
idols
and
enigmas
the
statues
are
now
corpses
from
which
the
vivifying
soul
has
fled
and
the
hymns
are
words
whence
faith
has
departed
the
tables
of
the
gods
are
without
spiritual
meat
and
drink
and
games
and
feasts
no
longer
afford
the
mind
its
joyful
union
with
the
being

being
the
works
of
the
muse

that
intellectual
force
which
knew
itself

broken
from
the

us

the

is
like
the
fruits
which
the
girl
in
the
picture
presents
she
does
not
give
the
real
life
of
their
existence
not
the
tree
which
bore
them
not
the
earth
and
the
elements
which
entered
into
their
substance
nor
the
climate
which
formed
their
quality
nor
the
change
of
seasons
which
governed
the
process
of
their
growth
like
her
destiny
in
giving
us
the
works
of
ancient
art
does
not
give
us
their
world
not
the
spring
and
summer
of
the
ethical
life
in
which
they
blossomed
and
ripened
but
solely
a
memory
and
a
suggestion
of
this
actuality
our
act
in
enjoying
them
therefore
is
not
a
divine
service
were
it
so
our
mind
would
achieve
its
perfect
and
satisfying
truth
all
that
we
do
is
a
mere
externalism
which
from
these
fruits
wipes
off
some
raindrop
some
speck
of
dust
and
which
in
place
of
the
inward
elements
of
moral
actuality
that
created
and
inspired
them
tries
from
the
dead
elements
of
their
external
reality
such
as
language
and
historical
allusion
to
set
up
a
tedious
mass
of
scaffolding
not
in
order
to
live
ourselves
into
them
but
only
to
form
a
picture
of
them
in
our
minds
but
as
the
girl
who
proffers
the
plucked
fruits
is
more
and
nobler
than
the
natural
element
with
all
its
details
of
tree
air
light
c
which
first
yielded
them
because
she
gathers
all
this
together
in
a
nobler
way
into
the
glance
of
the
conscious
eye
and
the
gesture
which
proffers
them
so
the
spirit
of
destiny
which
offers
us
those
works
of
art
is
more
than
the
ethical
life
and
actuality
of
the
ancient
people
for
it
is
the
inwardising
of
that
mind
which
in
them
was
still
selfestranged
and
selfdispossessedit
is
the
spirit
of
tragic
destiny
the
destiny
which
collects
all
those
individualised
gods
and
attributes
of
substance
into
the
one
pantheon

religion
enters
into
its
more
adequate
form
when
it
ceases
to
appear
in
the
guise
of
art
and
realises
that
the
kingdom
of

with

the

caught
up
in
the
effusion
of
the
spirit
can
in
all
assurance
and
all
humility
claim
that
he
is
divinified
here
apparently
absolute
mind
is
reached
the
soul
knows
no
limitation
no
struggle
in
time
it
is
already
eternal
yet
there
is
according
to
hegel
a
flawnot
in
the
essence
and
the
matter
but
in
the
manner
and
mode
in
which
the
ordinary
religious
consciousness
represents
to
itself
or
pictures
that
unification
which
it
feels
and
experiences
in
religion
then
this
unification
of
ultimate
being
with
the
self
is
implicitly
reached
but
the
religious
consciousness
if
it
has
this
symbolic
idea
of
its
reconciliation
still
has
it
as
a
mere
symbol
or
representation
it
attains
the
satisfaction
by
tacking
on
to
its
pure
negativity
and
that
externally
the
positive
signification
of
its
unity
with
the
ultimate
being
its
satisfaction
remains
therefore
tainted
by
the
antithesis
of
another
world
its
own
reconciliation
therefore
is
presented
to
its
consciousness
as
something
far
away
something
far
away
in
the
future
just
as
the
reconciliation
which
the
other
self
accomplished
appears
as
a
faraway
thing
in
the
past
the
one
divine
man
had
but
an
implicit
father
and
only
an
actual
mother
conversely
the
universal
divine
man
the
community
has
its
own
deed
and
knowledge
for
its
father
but
for
its
mother
only
the
eternal
love
which
it
only
feels
but
does
not
behold
in
its
consciousness
as
an
actual
immediate
object
its
reconciliation
therefore
is
in
its
heart
but
still
at
variance
with
its
consciousness
and
its
actuality
still
has
a
flaw
in
its
field
of
consciousness
the
place
of
implicit

religion
therefore
which
as
it
first
appeared
in
artworship
had
yet
to
realise
its
essential
inwardness

so
has
now
to
overcome
the
antithesis
in
which
its
the
religious
consciousness
stands
to
the
secular
for
the
peculiarly
religious
type
of

distinguished
by
an
indifference
and
even
hostility
more

and
the

in
the

of

it
resents
too
curious
inquiry
into
the
central
mystery
of
its
union
and
in
its
distincter
consciousness
sets
the
foundation
of
faith
on
the
evidence
of
a
fact
which
however
it
in
the
same
breath
declares
to
be
unique

miraculous
the
central
event
of

pointing
back
in
its

the
windingup
of

life
philosophy
according
to
hegels
conception
of
it
does
but
draw
the
conclusion
supplied
by
the
premisses
of
religion
it
supplements
and
rounds
off
into
coherence
the
religious
implications
the
unique
events
in
judea
nearly
nineteen
centuries
ago
are
for
it
also
the
first
step
in
a
new
revelation
of
mans
relationship
to
god
but
while
it
acknowledges
the
transcendent
interest
of
that
age
it
lays
main
stress
on
the
permanent
truth
then
revealed
and
it
insists
on
the
duty
of
carrying
out
the
principle
there
awakened
to
all
the
depth
and
breadth
of
its
explication
its
taskits
supreme
taskis
to
explicate
religion
but
to
do
so
is
to
show
that
religion
is
no
exotic
and
no
mere
revelation
from
an
external
source
it
is
to
show
that
religion
is
the
truth
the
complete
reality
of
the
mind
that
lived
in
art
that
founded
the
state
and
sought
to
be
dutiful
and
upright
the
truth
the
crowning
fruit
of
all
scientific
knowledge
of
all
human
affections
of
all
secular
consciousness
its
lesson
ultimately
is
that
there
is
nothing
essentially
common
or
unclean
that
the
holy
is
not
parted
off
from
the
true
and
the
good
and
the
beautiful
religion
thus
expanded
descends
from
its
abstract
or
intelligible
world
to
which
it
had
retired
from
art
and
science
and
the
affairs
of
ordinary
life
its
godas
a
true
godis
not
of
the
dead
alone
but
also
of
the
living
not
a
faroff
supreme
and
ultimate
being
but
also
a
man
among
men
philosophy
thus
has
to
break
down
the
middle
partitionwall
of
life
the
fence
between
secular
and
sacred
it
is
but
religion
come
to
its
maturity
made
at
home
in
the
world
and
no
longer
a
stranger
and
a
wonder
religion
has
pronounced
in
its
inmost
heart
and
faith
of
faith
that
the
earth
is
the
lords
and
that
day
unto
day
shows
forth
the
divine
handiwork
but
the
heart
of
unbelief
of
little
faith
has
hardly
uttered
the
word
than
it
forgets
its
assurance
and
leans
to
the
conviction
that
the
prince
of
this
world
is
the
spirit
of
evil
the
mood
of
thodice
is
alsobut
with
a
differencethe
mood
of
philosophy
it
asserts
the
ways
of
providence
but
its
providence
is
not
the
god
of
the
moralist
or
the
ideal
of
the
artist
or
rather
is
not
these
only
but
also
the
law
of
nature
and
more
than
that
its
aim
is
the
unity
of
history
the
words
have
sometimes
been
lightly
used
to
mean
that
events
run
on
in
one
continuous
flow
and
that
there
are
no
abrupt
no
ultimate
beginnings
parting
age
from
age
but
the
unity
of
history
in
its
full
sense
is
beyond
history
it
is
history
reduced
from
the
expanses
of
time
to
the
eternal
present

of

the
full
depth
of
unity
and
the
full
expanse
of
historyis
the
theme
of
hegelian
philosophy
it
traces
the
process
in
which
mind
has
to
be
allinclusive
selfupholding
one
with
the
eternal
reality
that
process
of
the
minds
selfrealisation
says
hegel
in
the
close
of
his
phenomenology
exhibits
a
lingering
movement
and
succession
of
minds
a
gallery
of
images
each
of
which
equipped
with
the
complete
wealth
of
mind
only
seems
to
linger
because
the
self
has
to
penetrate
and
to
digest
this
wealth
of
its
substance
as
its
perfection
consists
in
coming
completely
to
know
what
it
is
its
substance
this
knowledge
is
its
selfinvolution
in
which
it
deserts
its
outward
existence
and
surrenders
its
shape
to
recollection
thus
selfinvolved
it
is
sunk
in
the
night
of
its
selfconsciousness
but
in
that
night
its
vanished
being
is
preserved
and
that
being
thus
in
idea
preservedold
but
now
newborn
of
the
spiritis
the
new
sphere
of
being
a
new
world
a
new
phase
of
mind
in
this
new
phase
it
has
again
to
begin
afresh
and
from
the
beginning
and
again
nurture
itself
to
maturity
from
its
own
resources
as
if
for
it
all
that
preceded
were
lost
and
it
had
learned
nothing
from
the
experience
of
the
earlier
minds
yet
is
that
recollection
a
preservation
of
experience
it
is
the
quintessence
and
in
fact
a
higher
form
of
the
substance
if
therefore
this
new
mind
appears
only
to
count
on
its
own
resources
and
to
start
quite
fresh
and
blank
it
is
at
the
same
time
on
a
higher
grade
that
it
starts
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
realm
which
is
thus
constructed
in
actuality
forms
a
succession
in
time
where
one
mind
relieved
another
of
its
watch
and
each
took
over
the
kingdom
of
the
world
from
the
preceding
the
purpose
of
that
succession
is
to
reveal
the
depth
and
that
depth
is
the
absolute
comprehension
of
mind
this
revelation
is
therefore
to
uplift
its
depth
to
spread
it
out
in
breadth
so
negativing
this
selfinvolved
ego
wherein
it
is
selfdispossessed
or
reduced
to
substance
but
it
is
also
its
time
the
course
of
time
shows
this
dispossession
itself
dispossessed
and
thus
in
its
extension

the
crown
of

the
ripest
growth
of
actuality
and
shown
to
be
so
by
philosophy
whilst
it
is
made
clear
that
religion
is
the
basis
of
philosophy
or
that
a
philosophy
can
only
go
as
far
as
the
religious
standpoint
allows
the
hierarchy
if
so

the
truth
of
egoism
is
the
truth
of

it
may
be
said
however
that
for
such
a
range
of
subjects
the
term
mind
is
wretchedly
inadequate
and
commonplace
and
that
the
better
rendering
of
the
title
would
be
philosophy
of
spirit
it
may
be
admitted
that
mind
is
not
all
that
could
be
wished
but
neither
is
spirit
blameless
and
it
may
be
added
hegels
own
term
geist
has
to
be
unduly
strained
to
cover
so
wide
a
region
it
servesand
was
no
doubt
meant
to
serveas
a
sign
of
the
conformity
of
his
system
with
the
religion
which
sees
in
god
no
otherworld
being
but
our
very
self
and
mind
and
which
worships
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
if
the
use
of
a
word
like
this
could
allay
the
ancient
variance
between
the
religious
and
the
philosophic
mood
it
would
be
but
churlish
perhaps
to
refuse
the
sign
of
compliance
and
compromise
but
whatever
may
be
the
case
in
germanand
even
there
the
new
wine
was
dangerous
to
the
old
wineskinit
is
certain
that
to
average
english
ears
the
word
spiritual
would
carry
us
over
the
medium
line
into
the
proper
land
of
religiosity
and
to
do
that
as
we
have
seen
is
to
sin
against
the
central
idea
the
idea
that
religion
is
of
one
blood
with
the
whole
mental
family
though
the
most
graciously
complete
of
all
the
sisters
yet
however
the
word
may
be
chosen
the
philosophy
of
hegel
like
the
august
lady
who
appeared
in
vision
to
the
emprisoned
bothius
has
on
her
garment
a
sign
which
signifies
the
life
which
is
on
earth
as
also
a
sign
which
signifies
the
right
law
of
heaven
if
her
righthand
holds
the
book
of
the
justice
of
the

the

there
is
indeed
no
sufficient
reason
for
contemning
the
term
mind
if
inductive
philosophy
of
the
human
mind
hasperhaps
to
a
dainty
tastemade
the
word
unsavoury
that

no

refusing
to
give
it
all
the
wealth
of
soul

heart
of
intellect

the
mens

which
if
we
hear
tacitus
expressed
the
hebrew
conception
of
the
spirituality
of

and
the

which
aristotelianism
set
supreme
in
the
soul
are
not
the
mere
or
abstract
intelligence
which
lateacquired
habits
of
abstraction
have
made
out
of

the
reader
will
adopt
the

in
want
of
a
better
in
its

scope
we
may
shelter
ourselves
under
the

of
wordsworth

how
exquisitely
too
the

fitted
to
the

the

no

it
be
called
which
they

of

ii
aims
and
methods
of
psychology
it
is
not
going
too
far
to
say
that
in
common
estimation
psychology
has
as
yet
hardly
reached
what
kant
has
called
the
steady
walk
of
scienceder

to
assert
this
is
not
of
course
to
throw
any
doubts
on
the
importance
of
the
problems
or
on
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
results
in
the
studies
which
have
been
prosecuted
under
that
name
it
is
only
to
note
the
obvious
fact
that
a
number
of
inquiries
of
somewhat
discrepant
tone
method
and
tendency
have
all
at
different
times
covered
themselves
under
the
common
title
of
psychological
and
that
the
work
of
orientation
is
as
yet
incomplete
such
a
destiny
seems
inevitable
when
a
name
is
coined
rather
as
the
title
of
an
unexplored
territory
than
fixed
on
to
describe
an
accomplished
fact
i
psychology
as
a
science
and
as
a
part
of
philosophy
the
de
anima
of
aristotle
gathering
up
into
one
the
work
of
plato
and
his
predecessors
may
be
said
to
lay
the
foundation
of
psychology
but
even
in
it
we
can
already
see
that
there
are
two
elements
or
aspects
struggling
for
mastery
two
elements
not
unrelated
or
independent
but
hard
to
keep
fairly
and
fully
in
unity
on
one
hand
there
is
the
conception
of
soul
as
a
part
of
nature
as
a
grade
of
existence
in
the
physical
or
natural
universein
the
universe
of
things
which
suffer
growth
and
change
which
are
never
entirely
without
matter
and
are
always
attached
to
or
present
in
body
from
this
point
of
view
aristotle
urged
that
a
sound
and
realistic
psychology
must
eg
in
its
definition
of
a
passion
give
the
prominent
place
to
its
physical
or
material
expression
and
not
to
its
mental
form
or
significance
it
must
remember
he
said
that
the
phenomena
or
accidents
are
what
really
throw
light
on
the
nature
or
the
substance
of
the
soul
on
the
other
hand
there
are
two
points
to
be
considered
there
is
first
of
all
the
counterpoising
remark
that
the
conception
of
soul
as
such
as
a
unity
and
common
characteristic
will
be
determinative
of
the
phenomena
or
accidentswill
settle
as
it
were
what
we
are
to
observe
and
look
for
and
how
we
are
to
describe
our
observations
and
by
the
conception
of
soul
is
meant
not
a
soul
as
a
thing
or
agent
subject
which
has
properties
attaching
to
it
but
soul
as
the
generic
feature
the
universal
which
is
set
as
a
stamp
on
everything
that
claims
to
be
psychical
in
other
words
soul
is
one
not
as
a
single
thing
contrasted
with
its
attributes
activities
or
exercises
of
force
such
single
thing
will
be
shown
by
logic
to
be
a
metaphysical
fiction
but
as
the
unity
of
form
and
character
the
comprehensive
and
identical
feature
which
is
present
in
all
its
manifestations
and
exercises
but
there
is
a
second
consideration
the
question
is
asked
by
aristotle
whether
it
is
completely
and
strictly
accurate
to
put
soul
under
the
category
of
natural
objects
there
is
in
it
or
of
it
perhaps
something
and
something
essential
to
it
which
belongs
to
the
order
of
the
eternal
and
selfactive
something
which
is
form
and
energy
quite
unaffected
by
and
separate
from
matter
how
this
is
related
to
the
realm
of
the
perishable
and
changeable
is
a
problem
on
which
aristotle
has
been
often
and
with
some
reason
believed
to
be
obscure
if
not
even
inconsistent21
in
these
divergent
elements
which
come
to
the
fore
in
aristotles
treatment
we
have
the
appearance
of
a
radical
difference
of
conception
and
purpose
as
to
psychology
he
himself
does
a
good
deal
to
keep
them
both
in
view
but
it
is
evident
that
here
already
we
have
the
contrast
between
a
purely
physical
or
in
the
narrower
sense
scientific
psychology
empirical
and
realistic
in
treatment
and
a
more
philosophicalwhat
in
certain
quarters
would
be
called
a
speculative
or
metaphysicalconception
of
the
problem
there
is
also
in
aristotle
the
antithesis
of
a
popular
or
superficial
and
an
accurate
or
analytic
psychology
the
former
is
of
a
certain
use
in
dealing
say
with
questions
of
practical
ethics
and
education
the
latter
is
of
more
strictly
scientific
interest
both
of
these
distinctionsthat
between
a
speculative
and
an
empirical
and
that
between
a
scientific
and
a
popular
treatmentaffect
the
subsequent
history
of
the
study
psychology
is
sometimes
understood
to
mean
the
results
of
casual
observation
of
our
own
minds
by
what
is
termed
introspection
and
by
the
interpretation
of
what
we
may
observe
in
others
such
observations
are
in
the
first
place
carried
on
under
the
guidance
of
distinctions
or
points
of
view
supplied
by
the
names
in
common
use
we
interrogate
our
own
consciousness
as
to
what
facts
or
relations
of
facts
correspond
to
the
terms
of
our
national
language
or
we
attemptwhat
is
really
an
inexhaustible
questto
get
definite
divisions
between
them
and
clearcut
definitions
inquiries
like
these
which
start
from
popular
distinctions
fall
a
long
way
short
of
science
and
the
inquirer
will
find
that
accidental
and
essential
properties
are
given
in
the
same
handful
of
conclusions
yet
there
is
always
much
value
in
these
attempts
to
get
our
minds
cleared
and
it
is
indispensable
for
all
inquiries
that
all
alleged
or
reported
facts
of
mind
should
be
realised
and
reproduced
in
our
own
mental
experience
and
this
is
especially
the
case
in
psychology
just
because
here
we
cannot
get
the
object
outside
us
we
cannot
get
or
make
a
diagram
and
unless
we
give
it
reality
by
reconstructing
itby
reinterrogating
our
own
experience
our
knowledge
of
it
will
be
but
wooden
and
mechanical
and
the
term
introspection
need
not
be
too
seriously
taken
it
means
much
more
than
watching
passively
an
internal
drama
and
is
quite
as
well
describable
as
mental
projection
setting
out
what
was
within
and
so
as
it
were
hidden
and
involved
before
ourselves
in
the
field
of
mental
vision
here
as
always
the
essential
point
is
to
get
ourselves
well
out
of
the
way
of
the
object
observed
and
to
stand
figuratively
speaking
quite
on
one
side
but
even
at
the
best
such
a
popular
or
empirical
psychology
has
no
special
claim
to
be
ranked
as
science
it
may
no
doubt
be
said
that
at
least
it
collects
describes
or
notes
down
facts
but
even
this
is
not
so
certain
as
it
seems
its
socalled
facts
are
very
largely
fictions
or
so
largely
interpolated
with
error
that
they
cannot
be
safely
used
for
construction
if
psychology
is
to
accomplish
anything
valuable
it
must
go
more
radically
to
work
it
mustat
least
in
a
measurediscard
from
its
preliminary
view
the
data
of
common
and
current
distinctions
and
try
to
get
at
something
more
primary
or
ultimate
as
its
startingpoint
and
this
it
may
do
in
two
ways
it
may
in
the
one
case
follow
the
example
of
the
physical
sciences
in
these
it
is
the
universal
practice
to
assume
that
the
explanation
of
complex
and
concrete
facts
is
to
be
attained
by
a
postulating
certain
simple
elements
which
we
may
call
atoms
molecules
and
perhaps
units
or
monads
which
are
supposed
to
be
clearly
conceivable
and
to
justify
themselves
by
intrinsic
intelligibility
and
by
b
assuming
that
these
elements
are
compounded
and
combined
according
to
laws
which
again
are
in
the
last
resort
selfevident
or
such
that
they
seem
to
have
an
obvious
and
palpable
lucidity
further
such
laws
being
always
axioms
or
plain
postulates
of
mechanics
for
these
alone
possess
this
feature
of
selfevident
intelligibility
they
are
subject
to
and
invite
all
the
aids
and
refinements
of
the
higher
mathematical
calculus
what
the
primary
and
selfexplicative
bits
of
psychical
reality
may
be
is
a
further
question
on
which
there
may
be
some
dispute
they
may
be
so
to
say
taken
in
a
more
physical
or
in
a
more
metaphysical
way
ie
more
as
units
of
nervefunction
or
more
as
elements
of
ideativefunction
and
there
may
be
differences
as
to
how
far
and
in
what
provinces
the
mathematical
calculus
may
be
applicable
but
in
any
case
there
will
be
a
strong
tendency
in
psychology
worked
on
this
plan
to
follow
mutatis
mutandis
and
at
some
distance
perhaps
the
analogy
of
material
physics
in
both
the
justification
of
the
postulated
units
and
laws
will
be
their
ability
to
describe
and
systematise
the
observed
phenomena
in
a
uniform
and
consistent
way
the
other
way
in
which
psychology
gets
a
foundation
and
ulterior
certainty
is
different
and
goes
deeper
after
all
the
scientific
method
is
only
a
way
in
which
the
facts
of
a
given
sphere
are
presented
in
thoroughgoing
interconnexion
each
reduced
to
an
exact
multiple
or
fraction
of
some
other
by
an
inimitably
continued
subtraction
and
addition
of
an
assumed
homogeneous
element
found
or
assumed
to
be
perfectly
imaginable
conceivable
but
we
may
also
consider
the
province
in
relation
to
the
whole
sphere
of
reality
may
ask
what
is
its
place
and
meaning
in
the
whole
what
reality
is
in
the
end
driving
at
or
coming
to
be
and
how
far
this
special
province
contributes
to
that
end
if
we
do
this
we
attach
psychology
to
philosophy
or
if
we
prefer
so
to
call
it
to
metaphysics
as
in
the
former
way
we
established
it
on
the
principles
generally
received
as
governing
the
method
of
the
physical
sciences
thisthe
relation
of
psychology
to
fundamental
philosophyis
a
question
which
also
turns
up
in
dealing
with
ethics
there
is
on
the
part
of
those
engaged
in
either
of
these
inquiries
a
certain
impatience
against
the
intermeddling
which
is
held
to
be
only
muddling
of
metaphysics
with
them
it
is
clear
that
in
a
very
decided
way
both
psychology
and
ethics
can
up
to
some
extent
at
least
be
treated
as
what
is
called
empirical
or
to
use
the
more
english
phrase
inductive
sciences
on
many
hands
they
are
actually
so
treated
and
not
without
result
considering
the
tendency
of
metaphysical
inquiries
it
may
be
urged
that
it
is
well
to
avoid
preliminary
criticism
of
the
current
conceptions
and
beliefs
about
reality
which
these
sciences
imply
yet
such
beliefs
are
undoubtedly
present
and
effective
schopenhauer
has
popularised
the
principle
that
the
pure
empiricist
is
a
fiction
that
man
is
a
radically
metaphysical
animal
and
that
he
inevitably
turns
what
he
receives
into
a
part
of
a
dogmatic
creeda
conviction
how
things
ought
to
be
almost
without
effort
there
grows
up
in
him
or
flows
in
upon
him
a
belief
and
a
system
of
beliefs
as
to
the
order
and
values
of
things
every
judgment
even
in
logic
rests
on
such
an
order
of
truth
he
need
not
be
able
to
formulate
his
creed
it
will
influence
him
none
the
less
nay
his
faith
will
probably
seem
more
a
part
of
the
solid
earth
and
common
reality
the
less
it
has
been
reduced
to
a
determinate
creed
or
to
a
code
of
principles
for
such
formulation
presupposes
doubt
and
scepticism
which
it
beats
back
by
mere
assertion
each
human
being
has
such
a
background
of
convictions
which
govern
his
actions
and
conceptions
and
of
which
it
so
startles
him
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
that
he
turns
away
in
dogmatic
horror
such
ruling
ideas

from
man
to
man
and
from
man
to
womanif
we
consider
them
in
all
their
minuteness

themselves

organised

in

sure

that
a

of
this

unconscious

is
incoherent
contradictory
even
bad
that
it
requires
correction

by

to
be
made
one
and
harmonious
that
readjustment
or
criticism
which
shall
eliminate
contradiction
and
produce

is
the
aim
of
the
science
of

science
of
the
metaphysical
element
in
physical
knowledge
what
hegel
has
chosen
to
call
the
science
of
logic
in
the
wide
sense
of
the
term
this
higher
logic
this
science
of
metaphysic
is
the
process
to
revise
and
harmonise
in
systematic
completeness
the
imperfect
or
misleading
and
partial
estimates
of
reality
which
are
to
be
found
in
popular
and
scientific
thought
in
the
case
of
the
run
of
physical
sciences
this
revision
is
less
necessary
and
for
no
very
recondite
reason
every
science
by
its
very
nature
deals
with
a
special
a
limited
topic
it
is
confined
to
a
part
or
aspect
of
reality
its
propositions
are
not
complete
truths
they
apply
to
an
artificial
world
to
a
part
expressly
cut
off
from
the
concrete
reality
its
principles
are
generally
cut
according
to
their
clothaccording
to
the
range
in
which
they
apply
the
only
danger
that
can
well
arise
is
if
these
categories
are
transplanted
without
due
reservations
and
made
of
universal
application
ie
if
the
scientist
elects
on
his
speciality
to
pronounce
de
omnibus
rebus
but
in
the
case
of
psychology
and
ethics
the
harmlessness
of
natural
metaphysics
will
be
less
certain
here
a
general
human
or
universal
interest
is
almost
an
inevitable
coefficient
especially
if
they
really
rise
to
the
full
sweep
of
the
subject
for
as
such
they
both
seem
to
deal
not
with
a
part
of
reality
but
with
the
very
centre
and
purpose
of
all
reality
in
them
we
are
not
dealing
with
topics
of
secondary
interest
but
with
the
very
heart
of
the
human
problem
here
the
questions
of
reality
and
ideals
of
unity
and
diversity
and
of
the
evaluation
of
existence
come
distinctly
to
the
fore

is
to
answer
the
question

the

ii
herbart
the
german
thinker
who
has
given
perhaps
the
most
fruitful
stimulus
to
the
scientific
study
of

that
is
stands
in
intimate
connexion
with
the
last
questions
of
all
intelligence
with
metaphysics
and

the
business
of

says
herbart
is
to
touch
up
and
finish
off
conceptions

it
finds
as
it
supervenes
upon
the
unphilosophical
world
that
mere
and
pure
facts
if
there
ever
are
or
were
such
purisms
have
been
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
theory
have
been
construed
into
some
form
of
unity
but
have
been
imperfectly
inadequately
construed
and
that
the
existing
concepts
in
current
use
need
to
be
corrected
supplemented

readjusted
it
has
accordingly
for
its
work
to
reconcile
experience
with
itself23
and
to
elicit
the
hidden
presuppositions
without
which
the
fact
of
experience
is
unthinkable
psychology
then
as
a
branch
of
this
philosophic
enterprise
has
to
readjust
the
facts
discovered
in
inner
experience
for
mere
uncritical
experience
or
merely
empirical
knowledge
only
offers
problems
it
suggests
gaps
which
indeed
further
reflection
serves
at
first
only
to
deepen
into
contradictions
such
a
psychology
is
speculative
ie
it
is
not
content
to
accept
the
mere
given
but
goes
forward
and
backward
to
find
something
that
will
make
the
fact
intelligible
it
employs
totally
different
methods
from
the
classification
induction
analogy
familiar
to
the
logic
of
the
empirical
sciences
its
principles
therefore
are
not
given
facts
but
facts
which
have
been
manipulated
and
adjusted
so
as
to
lose
their
selfcontradictory
quality
they
are
facts
reduced
by
introducing
the
omitted
relationships
which
they
postulate
if
they
are
to
be
true
and
selfconsistent24
while
it
is
far
from
rejecting
or
ignoring
experience
therefore
psychology
cannot
strictly
be
said
to
build
upon
it
alone
it
uses
experimental
fact
as
an
unfinished
datumor
it
sees
in
experience
a
torso
which
betrays
its
imperfection
and
suggests
completing
the
startingpoint
it
may
be
said
of
herbarts
psychology
is
a
question
which
to
the
ordinary
psychologist
and
to
the
socalled
scientific
psychologist
has
a
secondary
if
it
have
any
interest
it
was
he
says
the
problem
of
personality
the
problem
of
the
self
or
ego
which
first
led
to
his
characteristic
conception
of
psychological
method
my
first
discovery
he
tells
us25
was
that
the
self
was
neither
primitive
nor
independent
but
must
be
the
most
dependent
and
most
conditioned
thing
one
can
imagine
the
second
was
that
the
elementary
ideas
of
an
intelligent
being
if
they
were
ever
to
reach
the
pitch
of
selfconsciousness
must
be
either
all
or
at
least
in
part
opposed
to
each
other
and
that
they
must
check
or
block
one
another
in
consequence
of
this
opposition
though
held
in
check
however
these
ideas
were
not
to
be
supposed
lost
they
subsist
as
endeavours
or
tendencies
to
return
into
the
position
of
actual
idea
as
soon
as
the
check
became
for
any
reason
either
in
whole
or
in
part
inoperative
this
check
could
and
must
be
calculated
and
thus
it
was
clear
that
psychology
required
a
mathematical
as
well
as
a
metaphysical
foundation

the

very
much
more
than
this

abstract
and
differs
widely
from

apparently
from

to

even
in

it
not
rather
seem
to

with
this

the

concerned
that
the

as
an

the

a
product

what
herbart
soon
became
convinced
of
the
unity
of
self

even
as
given
in
mature
experience
an
imperfect
fact
it
is
a
fact
that
is
which
does
not
come
up
to
what
it
promised
and
which
requires
to
be
supplemented
or
philosophically
justified
here
and
everywhere
the
custom
of
life
carries
us
over
gaps
which
yawn
deep
to
the
eye
of
philosophic
reflection
even
though
accident
and
illness
force
them
not
unfrequently
even
upon
the
blindest
to
trace
the
process
of
unification
towards
this
unityto
trace
if
you
like
even
the
formation
of
the
concept
of
such
unity
as
a
governing
and
guiding
principle
in
life
and
conduct
comes
to
be
the
problem
of
the
psychologist
in
the
largest
sense
of
that
problem
from
soul
seele
to
mind
or
spirit
geist
is
for
herbart
as
for
hegel
the
course
of
psychology27
the
growth
and
development
of
mind
the
formation
of
a
self
the
realisation
of
a
personality
is
for
both
the
theme
which
psychology
has
to
expound
and
herbart
not
less
than
hegel
had
to
bear
the
censure
that
such
a
conception
of
mental
reality
as
a
growth
would
destroy
personality28
but
with
so
much
common
in
the
general
plan
the
two
thinkers
differ
profoundly
in
their
special
mode
of
carrying
out
the
task
or
rather
they
turn
their
strength
on
different
departments

turns

does
to

microcosm

even
in

approach
to

of

hegel
seems
to
hurry
away
from
the
field
of
moral
sense
or
conscience
to
throw
himself
on
the
social
and
political
organisation
of
the
moral
life
the
general
paedagogic
of
herbart
has
its
pendant
in
hegels
philosophy
of
law
and
of
history
at
an
early
period
herbart
had
become
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
applying
mathematics
to
psychology29
to
the
usual
objection
that
psychical
facts
do
not
admit
of
measurement
he
had
a
ready
reply
we
can
calculate
even
on
hypothetical
assumptions
indeed
could
we
measure
we
should
scarcely
take
the
trouble
to
calculate30
to
calculate
ie
to
deduce
mathematically
is
to
perform
a
general
experiment
and
to
perform
it
in
the
medium
where
there
is
least
likelihood
of
error
or
disturbance
there
may
be
anomalies
enough
apparent
in
the
mental
life
there
may
be
the
great
anomalies
of
genius
and
of
freedom
of
will
but
the
newton
and
the
kepler
of
psychology
will
show
by
calculation
on
assumed
conditions
of
psychic
nature
that
these
aberrations
can
be
explained
by
mechanical
laws
the
human
soul
is
no
puppettheatre
our
wishes
and
resolutions
are
no
marionettes
no
juggler
stands
behind
but
our
true
and
proper
life
lies
in
our
volition
and
this
life
has
its
rule
not
outside
but
in
itself
it
has
its
own
purely
mental
rule
by
no
means
borrowed
from
the
material
world
but
this
rule
is
in
it
sure
and
fixed
and
on
account
of
this
its
fixed
quality
it
has
more
similarity
to
what
is
otherwise
heterogeneous

to
the

psychology
then
deals
with
a
real
which
exhibits
phenomena
analogous
in
several
respects
to
those
discussed
by
statics
and

its
foundation
is
a

and

soulas
this

is
called
we
begin
by
presupposing
as
the
ultimate
reality
underlying
the
factitious
and
generally
imperfect
unity
of
selfconsciousness
and
mind
an
essential
and
primary
unitythe
unity
of
an
absolutely
simple
or
individual
point
of
beinga
real
point
which
amongst
other
points
asserts
itself
maintains
itself
it
has
a
character
of
its
own
but
that
character
it
only
shows
in
and
through
a
development
conditioned
by
external
influences
the
specific
nature
of
the
soulreality
is
to
be
representative
to
produce
or
manifest
itself
in
ideas
vorstellungen
but
the
character
only
emerges
into
actuality
in
the
conflict
of
the
soulatom
with
other
ultimate
realities
in
the
congregation
of
things
a
soul
per
se
or
isolated
is
not
possessed
of
ideas
it
is
merely
blank
undeveloped
formal
unity
of
which
nothing
can
be
said
but
like
other
realities
it
defines
and
characterises
itself
by
antithesis
by
resistance
it
shows
what
it
is
by
its
behaviour
in
the
struggle
for
existence
it
acts
in
selfdefence
and
its
peculiar
style
or
weapon
of
selfdefence
is
an
idea
or
representation
the
way
the
soul
maintains
itself
is
by
turning
the
assailant
into
an
idea32
and
each
idea
is
therefore
a
selbsterhaltung
of
the
soul
the
soul
is
thus
enrichedto
appearance
or
incidentally
and
the
assailant
is
annexed
in
this
way
the
one
soul
may
develop
or
evolve
or
express
an
innumerable
variety
of
ideas
for
in
response
to
whatever
it
meets
the
living
and
active
soul
ideates
or
gives
rise
to
a
representation
thus
while
the
soul
is
one
its
ideas
or
representations
are
many
taken
separately
they
each
express
the
psychic
selfconservation
but
brought
in
relation
with
each
other
as
so
many
acts
or
selfaffirmations
of
the
one
soul
they
behave
as
forces
and
tend
to
thwart
or
check
each
other
it
is
as
forces
as
reciprocally
arresting
or
fostering
each
other
that
ideas
are
objects
of
science
when
a
representation
is
thus
held
in
check
it
is
reduced
to
a
mere
endeavour
or
active
tendency
to
represent
thus
there
arises
a
distinction
between
representations
proper
and
those
imperfect
states
or
acts
which
are
partly
or
wholly
held
in
abeyance
but
the
latent
phase
of
an
idea
is
as
essential
to
a
thorough
understanding
of
it
as
what
appears
it
is
the
great
blunder
of
empirical
psychology
to
ignore
what
is
sunk
below
the
surface
of
consciousness
and
to
herbart
consciousness
is
not
the
condition
but
rather
the
product
of
ideas
which
are
primarily
forces
but
representations
are
not
merely
in
oppositionimpinging
and
resisting
the
same
reason
which
makes
them
resist
viz
that
they
are
or
would
fain
be
acts
of
the
one
soul
but
are
more
or
less
incompatible
leads
them
in
other
circumstances
to
form
combinations
with
each
other
these
combinations
are
of
two
sorts
they
are
first
complications
or
complexions
a
number
of
ideas
combine
by
quasiaddition
and
juxtaposition

into
a
union
where
the
parts
are
no
longer
separately
perceptible
it
is
easy
to
see
how
the
problems
of
psychology
now
assume
the
form
of
a

are
to
be

in
the

the

in
which
two

the

of

a

to

may
call

the
ultimate
degree

strength

the
conditions

their
permanent

fusion
a

on
the

c
it
is
fortunately
unnecessary
here
to
go
further
into
details
what
herbart
proposes
is
not
a
method
for
the
mathematical
measurement
of
psychic
facts
it
is
a
theory
of
mechanics
and
statics
specially
adapted
to
the
peculiarities
of
psychical
phenomena
where
the
forces
are
given
with
no
sine
or
cosine
where
instead
of
gravitation
we
have
the
constant
effort

it

david
hume
who
goes
beyond

make

science
follow
the

of

and
a
main
argument
in
favour
of
his
enterprise
is
the
declaration
of
kant
that
no
body
of
knowledge
can
claim
to
be
a
science
except
in
such
proportion
as
it
is
mathematical
and
the
peculiarity
of
this
enterprise
is
that
selfconsciousness
the
ego

not
allowed
to
interfere

the
free
play

the

the

is
no
doubt
a
unity
but
its
unity
lies
not
in
the
synthesis
of
consciousness
but
in
the
essential
unity
of
soul
and
soul
is
in
its
essence
neither
consciousness
nor
selfconsciousness
nor

something
on
the
basis
of
whose
unity
these
are
built
up
and
developed33
the
mere
representation
does
not
include
the
further
supervenience
of
consciousness
it
represents
but
it
is
not
as
yet
necessary
that
we
should
also
be
conscious
that
there
is

it

the

now
taken
a

but
in
proportion
as
it
has
done
so
psychology
has
lost
its
native
character

thrown
itself
into
the
arms
of
physiology

give

truth
looks
so

put
in

the

and
its
critics
what
herbart
as
well
as
hegel
finds
perpetual
ground
for
objecting
to
is
the
talk
about
mental
faculties
this
objection
is
part
of
a
general
characteristic
of
all
the
higher
philosophy
and
the
recurrence
of
it
gives
an
illustration
of
how
hard
it
is
for
any
class
of
men
to
see
themselves
as
others
see
them
if
there
be
anything
the
vulgar
believe
to
be
true
of
philosophy
it
is
that
it
deals
in
distant
and
abstruse
generalities
that
it
neglects
the
shades
of
individuality
and
reality
and
launches
out
into
unsubstantial
general
ideas
but
it
would
be
easy
to
gather
from
the
great
thinkers
an
anthology
of
passages
in
which
they
hold
it
forth
as
the
great
work
of
philosophy
to
rescue
our
conceptions
from
the
indefiniteness
and
generality
of
popular
conception
and
to
give
them
real
as
opposed
to
a
merely
nominal
individuality
the
wolffian
school

herbart
not
less
than
kant
found
in
possession
of
the

and
which
in
germany
may
be
taken
to
represent
only
a

in

of

get

in

way
and
that
when
this
question
is
disposed
of
it
still
remains
to
fix
on
the
metaphysical
bases
of
these
facts
that
a
doctrine
of
faculties
should
fix
itself
in
psychology
is
not
so
wonderful
in
the
nonpsychical
world
objects
are
easily
discriminated
in
space
and
the
individual
thing
lasts
through
a
time
but
a
phase
of
mind
is
as
such
fleeting
and
indeterminate
its
individual
features
which
come
from
its
object
tend
soon
to
vanish
in
memory
all
freshness
of
definite
characters
wears
off
and
there
is
left
behind
only
a
vague
recept
of
the
one
and
same
in
many
a
sort
of
hypostatised
representative
faint
but
persistent
of
what
in
experience
was
an
evervarying
succession
we
generalise
here
as
elsewhere
but
elsewhere
the
many
singulars
remain
to
confront
us
more
effectually
but
in
mind
the
immense
variety
of
real
imagination
memory
judgment
is
forgotten
and
the
name
in
each
case
reduced
to
a
meagre
abstract
thus
the
identity
in
character
and
operation
having
been
cut
off
from
the
changing
elements
in
its
real
action
is
transmuted
into
a
substantial
somewhat
a
subsistent
faculty
the
relationship
of
one
to
another
of
the
powers
thus
by
abstraction
and
fancy
created
becomes
a
problem
of
considerable
moment
their
causal
relations
in
particular
till
in
the
end
they
stand
outside
and
independent
of
each
other
engaged
as
herbart
says
in
a
veritable
bellum
omnium
contra
omnes
but
this
hypostatising
of
faculties
becomes
a
source
of
still
further
difficulties
when
it
is
taken
in
connexion
with
the
hypostasis
of
the
soul
or
self
or
ego
to
aristotle
the
soul
in
its
general
aspect
is
energy
or
essence
and
its
individual
phases
are
energies
but
in
the
hands
of
the
untrained
these
conceptions
came
to
be
considerably
displaced
essence
or
substance
came
to
be
understood
as
may
be
seen
in
locke
and
still
more
in
loose
talk
as
a
somethinga
substratumor
peculiar
natureof
which
in
itself
nothing
further
could
be
said36
but
which
notwithstanding
was
permanent
and
perhaps
imperishable
this
something
subsistent
exhibited
certain
properties
or
activities
there
thus
arose
on
one
hand
the
soulthinga
substance
misunderstood
and
sensualised
with
a
supernatural
sensuousnessa
denizen
of
the
transcendental
or
even
of
the
transcendent
world
and
on
the
other
hand
stood
the
actual
manifestations
the
several
exhibitions
of
this
force
the
assignable
and
describable
psychic
facts
we
are
accordingly
brought
before
the
problem
of
how
this
one
substance
or
essence
stands
to
the
several
entities
or
hypostases
known
as
faculties
and
we
still
have
in
the
rear
the
further
problem
of
how
these
abstract
entities
stand
to
the
real
and
concrete
single
acts
and
states
of
soul
and
mind
this
hypostatising
of
faculties
and
this
distinction
of
the
substantial
soul
from
its
accidentia
or
phenomena
had
grownthrough
the
materialistic
proclivities
of
popular
conceptionfrom
the
indications
found
in
aristotle
it
attained
its
climax
perhaps
in
the
wolffian
school
in
germany
but
it
has
been
the
resort
of
superficial
psychology
in
all
ages
for
while
it
on
one
hand
seemed
to
save
the
substantial
soul
on
whose
incorruptibility
great
issues
were
believed
to
hinge
it
held
out
on
the
other
an
open
hand
to
the
experimental
inquirer
whom
it
bade
freely
to
search
amongst
the
phenomena
but
if
it
was
the
refuge
of
pusillanimity
it
was
also
the
perpetual
object
of
censure
from
all
the
greater
and
bolder
spirits
thus
the
psychology
of
hobbes
may
be
hasty
and
crude
but
it
is
at
least
animated
by
a
belief
that
the
mental
life
is
continuous
and
not
cut
off
by
abrupt
divisions
severing
the
mental
faculties
the
image
according
to
his
materialistically
coloured
psychology
which
when
it
is
a
strong
motion
is
called
sense
passes
as
it
becomes
weaker
or
decays
into
imagination
and
gives
rise
by
its
various
complications
and
associations
with
others
to
reminiscence
experience
expectation
similarly
the
voluntary
motion
which
is
an
effect
or
a
phase
of
imagination

at
first
in

and
in

either
utterly

in
the
habit

thus
supposed

way
as
stoniness
to
this

or
as

to
peter
or
paul
they
are
supposed
to
be
a
general
something
which
gets
defined
and
detached
but
in
the
mind
or
in
the
cogitant
soul
there
are
no
such
things
there
are
only
ideas
and
by
an
idea
we
are
to
understand
not
an

on
the
retina
or
in
the
brain
not
a
dumb
something
like
a
painting
on
a
panel39
but
a
mode
of
thinking
or
even
the
act
of
intellection
itself
the

concludes
the

of

and
intellect
are
one
and
the

in

are
no

than

ie

leibniz
speaks
no
less
distinctly
and
sanely
in
this
direction
true
powers
are
never
mere
possibilities
they
are

and
action
the
monadthat

ie
tendencies
to
pass
from
one
perceptive
state
or

to
another
it
is
out
of
the
variety
the
complication
and
relations
of
these
miniature
or
little
perceptions
and
appetitions
that
the
conspicuous
phenomena
of
consciousness
are
to
be
explained
and
not
by
supposing
them
due
to
one
or
other
faculty
the
soul
is
a
unity
a
selfdeveloping
unity
a
unity
which
at
each
stage
of
its
existence
shows
itself
in
a
perception

perception

to
repeat
the
oft
quoted
phrase
plein

in
other
words
is
not
stationary
but
active
and
urgent
a
progressive
force
as
well
as
a
representative
element
above
all
leibniz
has
the
view
that
the
soul
gives
rise
to
all
its
ideas
from
itself
that
its
life
is
its
own
production
not
a
mere
inheritance
of
ideas
which
it
has
from
birth
and
nature
nor
a
mere
importation
into
an
empty
room
from
without
but
a
necessary
result
of
its
own
constitution
acting
in
necessary
predetermined
reciprocity
and
harmony
with
the
rest
of
the
universe
but
hobbes
spinoza
and
leibniz
were
most
attentively
heard
in
the
passages
where
they
favoured
or
combatted
the
dominant
social
and
theological
prepossessions
their
glimpses
of
truer
insight
and
even
their
palpable
contributions
in
the
line
of
a
true
psychology
were
ignored
or
forgotten
more
attention
perhaps
was
attracted
by
an
attempt
of
a
very
different
style
this
was
the
system
of
condillac
who
as
hegel
says
p
61
made
an
unmistakable
attempt
to
show
the
necessary
interconnexion
of
the
several
modes
of
mental
activity
in
his
trait
des
sensations
1754
following
on
his
essai
sur
lorigine
des
connaissances
humaines
1746
he
tried
to
carry
out
systematically
the
deduction
or
derivation
of
all
our
ideas
from
sense
or
to
trace
the
filiation
of
all
our
faculties
from
sensation
given
a
mind
with
no
other
power
than
sensibility
the
problem
is
to
show
how
it
acquires
all
its
other
faculties
let
us
then
suppose
a
sentient
animal
to
which
is
offered
a
single
sensation
or
one
sensation
standing
out
above
the
others
in
such
circumstances
the
sensation
becomes
devient
attention
or
a
sensation
is
est
attention
either
because
it
is
alone
or
because
it
is
more
lively
than
all
the
rest
again
before
such
a
being
let
us
set
two
sensations
to
perceive
or
feel
apercevoir
ou
sentir
the
two
sensations
is
the
same
thing
cest
la
mme
chose
if
one
of
the
sensations
is
not
present
but
a
sensation
made
already
then
to
perceive
it
is
memory
memory
then
is
only
transformed
sensation
sensation
transforme
further
suppose
we
attend
to
both
ideas
this
is
the
same
thing
as
to
compare
them
and
to
compare
them
we
must
see
difference
or
resemblance
this
is
judgment
thus
sensation
becomes
successively
attention
comparison
judgment
andby
further
steps
of
the
equating
processit
appears
that
sensation
again
becomes
an
act
of
reflection
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
imagination
and
reasoning
all
are
transformed
sensations
if
this
is
so
with
the
intelligence
it
is
equally
the
case
with
the
will
to
feel
and
not
feel
well
or
ill
is
impossible
coupling
then
this
feeling
of
pleasure
or
pain
with
the
sensation
and
its
transformations
we
get
the
series
of
phases
ranging
from
desire
to
passion
hope
will
desire
is
only
the
action
of
the
same
faculties
as
are
attributed
to
the
understanding
a
lively
desire
is
a
passion
a
desire
accompanied
with
a
belief
that
nothing
stands
in
its
way
is
a
volition
but
combine
these
affective
with
the
intellectual
processes
already
noticed
and
you
have
thinking
penser40
thus
thought
in
its
entirety
is
only
and
always
transformed
sensation
something
not
unlike
this
though
scarcely
so
simply
and
directly
doctrinaire
is
familiar
to
us
in
some
english
psychology
notably
james
mills41
taken
in
their
literal
baldness
these
identifications
may
sound
strainedor
trifling
but
if
we
look
beyond
the
words
we
can
detect
a
genuine
instinct
for
maintaining
and
displaying
the
unity
and
continuity
of
mental
life
through
all
its
modificationscoupled
unfortunately
with
a
bias
sometimes
in
favour
of
reducing
higher
or
more
complex
states
of
mind
to
a
mere
prolongation
of
lower
and
beggarly
rudiments
but
otherwise
such
analyses
are
useful
as
aids
against
the
tendency
of
inert
thought
to
take
every
name
in
this
department
as
a
distinguishable
reality
the
tendency
to
part
will
from
thoughtideas
from
emotionand
even
imagination
from
reason
as
if
either
could
be
what
it
professed
without
the
other
iv
methods
and
problems
of
psychology
the
difficulties
of
modern
psychology
perhaps
lie
in
other
directions
but
they
are
not
less
worth
guarding
against
they
proceed
mainly
from
failure
or
inability
to
grasp
the
central
problem
of
psychology
and
a
disposition
to
let
the
pen
if
it
be
a
book
on
the
subject
wander
freely

it

can
wander
into

aesthetic
and

into

it
cannot
be

with
any

that

supposed
to
develop
his
socalled

including
some
dictionarylike
verbal
distinctions
may
make
a
not
uninteresting
and
possibly
bulky
work
entitled
psychology
it
is
partly
a
desire
of
keeping
up
to
date
which
is
responsible
for
the
copious
extracts
or
abstracts
from
treatises
on
the
anatomy
and
functions
of
the
nervesystem
which
accompanied
perhaps
by
a
diagram
of
the
brain
often
form
the
opening
chapter
of
a
work
on
psychology
even
if
these
researches
had
achieved
a
larger
number
of
authenticated
results
than
they
as
yet
have
they
would
only
form
an
appendix
and
an
illustration
to
the
proper
subject42
as
they
stand
and
so
long
as
they
remain
largely
hypothetical
the
use
of
them
in
psychology
only
fosters
the
common
delusion
that
when
we
can
picture
out
in
material
outlines
a
theory
otherwise
unsupported
it
has
gained
some
further
witness
in
its
favour
it
is
quite
arguable
indeed
that
it
may
be
useful
to
cut
out
a
section
from
general
human
biology
which
should
include
the
parts
of
it
that
were
specially
interesting
in
connexion
with
the
expression
or
generation
of
thought
emotion
and
desire
but
in
that
case
there
is
a
blunder
in
singling
out
the
brain
alone
and
especially
the
organs
of
sense
and
voluntary
motionexcept
for
the
reason
that
this
province
of
psychophysics
alone
has
been
fairly
mapped
out
the
preponderant
half
of
the
souls
life
is
linked
to
other
parts
of
the
physical
system
emotion
and
volition
and
the
general
tone
of
the
train
of
ideas
if
they
are
to
be
connected
with
their
expression
and
physical
accompaniment
or
aspect
would
require
a
sketch
of
the
heart
and
lungs
as
well
as
the
digestive
system
in
general
nor
these
alone
nerve
analysis
especially
confined
to
the
larger
system
though
most
modern
is
not
alone
important
as
plato
and
aristotle
well
saw
so
that
if
biology
is
to
be
adapted
for
psychological
use
and
if
psychology
deals
with
more
than
cognitive
processes
a
liberal
amount
of
physiological
information
seems
required
experimental
psychology
is
a
term
used
with
a
considerable
laxity
of
content
and
so
too
is
that
of
physiological
psychology
or
psychophysics
and
the
laxity
mainly
arises
because
there
is
an
uncertainty
as
to
what
is
principal
and
what
secondary
in
the
inquiry
experiment
is
obviously
a
help
to
observation
and
so
far
as
the
latter
is
practicable
the
former
would
seem
to
have
a
chance
of
introduction
but
in
any
case
experiment
is
only
a
means
to
an
end
and
only
practicable
under
the
guidance
of
hypothesis
and
theory
its
main
value
would
be
in
case
the
sphere
of
psychology
were
completely
paralleled
with
one
province
of
physiology
it
was
long
ago
maintained
by
spinoza
and
in
a
way
by
leibniz
that
there
is
no
mental
phenomenon
without
its
bodily
equivalent
pendant
or
correspondent
the
ordo
rerum
the
molecular
system
of
movements
is
he
held
the
same
as
the
order
of
ideas
but
it
is
only
at
intervals
under
special
conditions
or
when
they
reach
a
certain
magnitude
that
ideas
emerge
into
full
consciousness
as
consciousness
presents
them
they
are
often
discontinuous
and
abrupt
and
they
do
not
always
carry
with
them
their
own
explanation
hence
if
we
are
confined
to
the
larger
phenomena
of
consciousness
alone
our
science
is
imperfect
many
things
seem
anomalous
above
all
perhaps
will
attention
and
the
like
we
have
seen
how
herbart
partly
following
the
hints
of
leibniz
attempted
to
get
over
this
difficulty
by
the
hypothesis
of
ideaforces
which
generate
the
forms
and
matter
of
consciousness
by
their
mutual
impact
and
resistance
physiological
psychology
substitutes
for
herbarts
reals
and
his
ideaforces
a
more
materialistic
sort
of
reality
perhaps
functions
of
nervecells
or
other
analogous
entities
there
it
hopes
one
day
to
discover
the
underlying
continuity
of
event
which
in
the
upper
range
of
consciousness
is
often
obscured
and
then
the
process
would
be
as
the
phrase
goes
explained
we
should
be
able
to
picture
it
out
without
a
gap
these
large
hopes
may
have
a
certain
fulfilment
they
may
lead
to
the
withdrawal
of
some
of
the
fictitious
mental
processes
which
are
still
described
in
works
of
psychology
but
on
the
whole
they
can
only
have
a
negative
and
auxiliary
value
the
value
that
is
of
helping
to
confute
feigned
connexions
and
to
suggest
truer
they
will
be
valid
against
the
mode
of
thought
which
when
psych
fails
us
for
an
explanation
turns
to
body
and
interpolates
soul
between
the
states
of
body
the
mode
which
in
an
older
phraseology
jumps
from
final
causes
to
physical
and
from
physical
or
efficient
to
final
here
as
elsewhere
the
physical
has
its
place
and
here
more
than
in
many
places
the
physical
has
been
unfairly
treated
but
the
whole
subject
requires
a
discussion
of
the
socalled
relations
of
soul
and
body
a
subject
on
which
popular
conceptions
and
socalled
science
are
radically
obscure
but
the
danger
which
threatens
experimental
psychology
says
mnsterberg
is
that
in
investigating
details
the
connexion
with
questions
of
principle
may
be
so
lost
sight
of
that
the
investigation
finally
lands
at
objects
scientifically
quite
worthless43
psychology
forgets
only
too
easily
that
all
those
numerical
statistics
which
experiment
allows
us
to
form
are
only
means
for
psychological
analysis
and
interpretation
not
ends
in
themselves
it
piles
up
numbers
and
numbers
and
fails
to
ask
whether
the
results
so
formed
have
any
theoretical
value
whatever
it
seeks
answers
before
a
question
has
been
clearly
and
distinctly
framed
whereas
the
value
of
experimental
answers
always
depends
on
the
exactitude
with
which
the
question
is
put
let
me
remind
the
reader
how
one
inquirer
after
another
made
many
thousand
experiments
on
the
estimation
of
small
intervals
of
time
without
a
single
one
of
them
raising
the
question
what
the
precise
point
was
which
these
experiments
sought
to
measure
what
was
the
psychological
occurrence
in
the
case
or
what
psychological
phenomena
were
employed
as
the
standard
of
timeintervals
and
so
each
had
his
own
arbitrary
standard
of
measurement
each
of
them
piled
up
mountains
of
numbers
each
demonstrated
that
his
predecessor
was
wrong
but
neither
estel
nor
mehner
have
carried
the
problem
of
the
timesense
a
single
step
further
this
must
be
all
changed
if
we
are
not
to
drift
into
the
barrenest
scholastic
everywhere
out
of
the
correct
perception
that
problems
of
principle
demand
the
investigation
of
detailed
phenomena
and
that
the
latter
investigation
must
proceed
in
comparative
independence
of
the
question
of
principles
there
has
grown
the
false
belief
that
the
description
of
detail
phenomena
is
the
ultimate
aim
of
science
and
so
side
by
side
with
details
which
are
of
importance
to
principles
we
have
others
utterly
indifferent
and
theoretically
worthless
treated
with
the
same
zeal
to
the
solution
of
their
barren
problems
the
old
schoolmen
applied
a
certain
acuteness
but
in
order
to
turn
out
masses
of
numbers
from
barren
experiments
all
that
is
needed
is
a
certain
insensibility
to
fits
of
ennui
let
numbers
be
less
collected
for
their
own
sake
and
instead
let
the
problems
be
so
brought
to
a
point
that
the
answers
may
possess
the
character
of
principles
let
each
experiment
be
founded
on
far
more
theoretical
considerations
then
the
number
of
the
experiments
may
be
largely
diminished44
what
is
thus
said
of
a
special
group
of
inquiries
by
one
of
the
foremost
of
the
younger
psychologists
is
not
without
its
bearings
on
all
the
departments
in
which
psychology
can
learn
for
physiological
or
what
is
technically
called
psychological
experiment
is
coordinate
with
many
other
sources
of
information
much
for
instance
is
to
be
learnt
by
a
careful
study
of
language
by
those
who
combine
sound
linguistic
knowledge
with
psychological
training
it
is
in
language
spoken
and
written
that
we
find
at
once
the
great
instrument
and
the
great
document
of
the
distinctively
human
progress
from
a
mere
psyche
to
a
mature
nous
from
soul
to
mind
whether
we
look
at
the
varieties
of
its
structure
under
different
ethnological
influences
or
at
the
stages
of
its
growth
in
a
nation
and
an
individual
we
get
light
from
language
on
the
differentiation
and
consolidation
of
ideas
but
here
again
it
is
easy
to
lose
oneself
in
the
world
of
etymology
or
to
be
carried
away
into
the
enticing
questions
of
real
and
ideal
philology
the
human
being
of
the
psychologist
says
herbart45
is
the
social
and
civilised
human
being
who
stands
on
the
apex
of
the
whole
history
through
which
his
race
has
passed
in
him
is
found
visibly
together
all
the
multiplicity
of
elements
which
under
the
name
of
mental
faculties
are
regarded
as
a
universal
inheritance
of
humanity
whether
they
are
originally
in
conjunction
whether
they
are
originally
a
multiplicity
is
a
point
on
which
the
facts
are
silent
the
savage
and
the
newborn
child
give
us
far
less
occasion
to
admire
the
range
of
their
mind
than
do
the
nobler
animals
but
the
psychologists
get
out
of
this
difficulty
by
the
unwarranted
assumption
that
all
the
higher
mental
activities
exist
potentially
in
children
and
savagesthough
not
in
the
animalsas
a
rudimentary
predisposition
or
psychical
endowment
of
such
a
nascent
intellect
a
nascent
reason
and
nascent
moral
sense
they
find
recognisable
traces
in
the
scanty
similarities
which
the
behaviour
of
child
or
savage
offers
to
those
of
civilised
man
we
cannot
fail
to
note
that
in
their
descriptions
they
have
before
them
a
special
state
of
man
and
one
which
far
from
accurately
defined
merely
follows
the
general
impression
made
upon
us
by
those
beings
we
name
civilised
an
extremely
fluctuating
character
inevitably
marks
this
total
impression
for
there
are
no
general
factsthe
genuine
psychological
documents
lie
in
the
momentary
states
of
individuals
and
there
is
an
immeasurably
long
way
from
these
to
the
height
of
the
universal
concept

of
man
and
of

which
shall
give
its
proper
place
to
each
of
the
elements
that
in
the
several
examples
open
to
detailed
observation

with
unfair

an

identifies
himself

that

invites
confidence

breaks
down
the
reserve
which
our
poor

whether
human

offer
to
the
first
approaches

strange

it
is
probable
that
in
that
case
we
should
have
less
occasion
to
wonder
at
their
oddities
or
to
admire
their
sagacity

a
higher
and
more
philosophical
wonder
might
as
in
other
cases
when
we
get
inside
the
heart
of
our
subject
take
the
place
of
the
cheap
and
childish
love
of

of
the
vulgar
straining
after
comic
traits
of
all
this
mass
of

the

proper
can
directly
make

a
sparing
use

as

not
be

this
theory
of

progress
from
the
animate
soul
to
the

of

science
deals
solely
with
the
universal
process
of
education
the
education
of
humanity
we
may
call
it
the
way
in
which
mind
is
made
true
and
real46
it
is
therefore
a
question
of
intricacy
and
of
time
how
to
carry
over
this
general
theory
into
the
arena
of
education
as
artificially
directed
and
planned
to
try
to
do
so
at
a
single
step
would
be
to
repeat
the
mistake
of
plato
if
plato
may
be
taken
to
suppose
which
seems
incredible
that
a
theoretical
study
of
the
dialectics
of
truth
and
goodness
would
enable
his
rulers
without
the
training
of
special
experience
to
undertake
the
supreme
tasks
of
legislation
or
administration
all
politics
like
all
education
rests
on
these
principles
of
the
means
and
conditions
of
mental
growth
but
the
schooling
of
concrete
life
though
it
may
not
develop
the
faculty
of
formulating
general
laws
will
often
train
better
for
the
management
of
the
relative
than
a
mere
logical
scholastic
in
first
or
absolute
principles
in
conclusion
there
are
one
or
two
points
which
seem
of
cardinal
importance
for
the
progress
of
psychology
1
its
difference
from
the
physical
sciences
has
to
be
set
out
in
other
words
the
peculiarity
of
psychical
fact
it
will
not
do
merely
to
say
that
experience
marks
out
these
boundaries
with
sufficient
clearness
on
the
contrary
the
terms
consciousness
feeling
mind
c
are
evidently
to
many
psychologists
mere
names
in
particular
the
habits
of
physical
research
when
introduced
into
mental
study
lead
to
a
good
deal
of
what
can
only
be
called
mythology
2
there
should
be
a
clearer
recognition
of
the
problem
of
the
relations
of
mental
unity
to
mental
elements
but
to
get
that
a
more
thorough
logical
and
metaphysical
preparation
is
needed
than
is
usually
supposed
necessary
the
doctrine
of
identity
and
necessity
of
universal
and
individual
has
to
be
faced
however
tedious
3
the
distinction
between
firstgrade
and
secondgrade
elements
and
factors
in
the
mental
life
has
to
be
realised
the
mere
idea
as
presentative
or
immediate
has
to
be
kept
clear
of
the
more
logicoreflective
or
normative
ideas
which
belong
to
judgment
and
reasoning
and
the
number
of
these
grades
in
mental
development
seems
endless
4
but
also
a
separation
is
requiredwere
it
but
temporarybetween
what
may
be
called
principles
and
what
is
detail
at
present
in
psychology
principles
is
a
word
almost
without
meaning
a
complete
allexplaining
system
is
of
course
impossible
at
present
and
may
always
be
so
yet
if
an
effort
of
thought
could
be
concentrated
on
cardinal
issues
and
less
padding
of
conventional
and
traditional
detail
were
foisted
in
much
might
thereby
be
done
to
make
detailed
research
fruitful
5
and
finally
perhaps
if
psychology
be
a
philosophical
study
some
hint
as
to
its
purpose
and
problem
would
be
desirable
if
it
is
only
an
abstract
branch
of
science
of
course
no
such
hint
is
in
place

the

of
the
boundaries

and

of

to

ground
that
seems
more
appropriate

logic
is
sometimes
restricted
to
denote
the
study
of
the

of

knowledge
of
the
canons
of

and
the
modes
of

if
taken
more
widely
as
the
science

thoughtform
it
is
supposed
to
imply
a
world
of
fixed
or
stereotyped
relations
between
ideas
a
system
of
stable
thoughts
governed
by
inflexible
laws
in
an
absolute
order
of
immemorial
or
eternal
truth
as
against
such
fixity
psychology
is
supposed
to
deal
with
these
same
ideas
as
productsas
growing
out
of
a
living
process
of
thoughthaving
a
history
behind
them
and
perhaps
a
prospect
of
further
change
the
genesis
so
given
may
be
either
a
mere
chroniclehistory
or
it
may
be
a
philosophical
development
in
the
former
case
it
would
note
the
occasions
of
incident
and
circumstance
the
reactions
of
mind
and
environment
under
which
the
ideas
were
formed
such
a
psychological
genesis
of
several
ideas
is
found
in
the
second
book
of
lockes
essay
in
the
latter
case
the
account
would
be
more
concerned
with
the
inner
movement
the
action
and
reaction
in
ideas
themselves
considered
not
as
due
to
casual
occurrences
but
as
selfdeveloping
by
an
organic
growth
but
in
either
case
ideas
would
be
shown
not
to
be
readymade
and
independently
existing
kinds
in
a
world
of
ideathings
and
not
to
form
an
unchanging
diagram
or
framework
but
to
be
a
growth
to
have
a
history
and
a
development
psychology
in
this
sense
would
be
a
dynamical
as
opposed
to
the
supposed
statical
treatment
of
ideas
and
concepts
in
logic
but
it
may
be
doubted
how
far
it
is
well
to
call
this
psychology
unless
psychology
deals
with
the
contents
of
the
mental
life
in
their
meaning
and
purpose
instead
of
as
seems
proper
merely
in
their
character
of
psychic
events
such
psychology
is
rather
an
evolutionist
logica
dialectic
process
more
than
an
analytic
of
a
datum
in
the
same
way
ethics
may
be
brought
into
one
kind
of
contact
with
psychology
ethics
like
logic
may
be
supposed
to
presuppose
and
to
deal
with
a
certain
inflexible
scheme
of
requirements
a
world
of
moral
order
governed
by
invariable
or
universal
law
an
eternal
kingdom
of
right
existing
independently
of
human
wills
but
to
be
learned
and
followed
out
in
uncompromising
obedience
as
against
this
supposed
absolute
order
psychology
may
be
said
to
show
the
genesis
of
the
idea
of
obligation
and
duty
the
growth
of
the
authority
of
conscience
the
formation
of
ideals
the
relativity
of
moral
ideas
here
also
it
may
reach
this
conclusion
by
a
more
external
or
a
more
internal
mode
of
argument
it
may
try
to
show
in
other
words
that
circumstances
give
rise
to
these
forms
of
estimating
conduct
or
it
may
argue
that
they
are
a
necessary
development
in
the
human
being
constituted
as
he
is
it
may
again
be
doubted
whether
this
is
properly
called
psychology
yet
its
purport
seems
ultimately
to
be
that
the
objective
order
is
misconceived
when
it
is
regarded
as
an
external
or
quasiphysical
order
as
a
law
written
up
and
sanctioned
with
an
external
authorityas
in
kants
words
a
heteronomy
if
that
order
is
objective
it
is
so
because
it
is
also
in
a
sense
subjective
if
it
is
above
the
mere
individuality
of
the
individual
it
is
still
in
a
way
identical
with
his
true
or
universal
selfhood
thus
psychological
here
means
the
recognition
that
the
logical
and
the
moral
law
is
an
autonomy
that
it
is
not
given
but
though
necessary
necessary
by
the
inward
movement
of
the
mind
the
metaphor
of
law
is
in
brief
misleading
for
according
to
a
common
though
probably
an
erroneous
analysis
of
that
term
the
essence
of
a
law
in
the
political
sphere
is
to
be
a
species
of
command
and
that
is
rather
a
onesidedly
practical
or
aesthetic
way
of
looking
at
it
the
essence
of
law
in
general
and
the
precondition
of
every
law
in
special
is
rather
uniformity
and
universality
selfconsistency
and
absence
of
contradiction
or
in
other
words
rationality
its
essential
oppositeor
its
contradiction
in
essenceis
a
privilege
an
attempt
at
isolating
a
case
from
others
it
need
not
indeed
always
require
bare
uniformityrequire
ie
the
same
act
to
be
done
by
different
people
but
it
must
always
require
that
every
thing
within
its
operation
shall
be
treated
on
principles
of
utter
and
thorough
harmony
and
consistency
it
requires
each
thing
to
be
treated
on
public
principles
and
with
publicity
nothing
apart
and
mere
singular
as
a
mere
incident
or
as
a
world
by
itself
differently
it
may
be
treated
but
always
on
grounds
of
common
wellbeing
as
part
of
an
embracing
system
there
is
probably
another
sense
however
in
which
psychology
comes
into
close
relation
with
ethics
if
we
look
on
man
as
a
microcosm
his
inner
system
will
more
or
less
reproduce
the
system
of
the
larger
world
the
older
psychology
used
to
distinguish
an
upper
or
superior
order
of
faculties
from
a
lower
or
inferior
thus
in
the
intellectual
sphere
the
intellect
judgment
and
reason
were
set
above
the
senses
imagination
and
memory
among
the
active
powers
reasonable
will
practical
reason
and
conscience
were
ranked
as
paramount
over
the
appetites
and
desires
and
emotions
and
this
use
of
the
word
faculty
is
as
old
as
plato
who
regards
science
as
a
superior
faculty
to
opinion
or
imagination
but
this
applicationwhich
seems
a
perfectly
legitimate
onedoes
not
in
the
first
instance
belong
to
psychology
at
all
no
doubt
it
is
psychically
presented
but
it
has
an
other
source
it
springs
from
an
appreciation
a
judgment
of
the
comparative
truth
or
reality
of
what
the
socalled
psychical
act
means
or
expresses
such
faculties
are
powers
in
a
hierarchy
of
means
and
ends
and
presuppose
a
normative
or
critical
function
which
has
classified
reality
psychically
the
elements
which
enter
into
knowledge
are
not
other
than
those
which
belong
to
opinion
but
they
are
nearer
an
adequate
rendering
of
reality
they
are
truer
or
nearer
the
idea
and
in
the
main
we
may
say
that
is
truer
or
more
real
which
succeeds
in
more
completely
organising
and
unifying
elementswhich
rises
more
and
more
above
the
selfish
or
isolated
part
into
the
thorough
unity
of
all
parts
the
superior
faculty
is
therefore
the
more
thorough
organisation
of
that
which
is
elsewhere
less
harmoniously
systematised
opinion
is
fragmentary
and
partial
it
begins
abruptly
and
casually
from
the
unknown
and
runs
off
no
less
abruptly
into
the
unknown
knowledge
on
the
contrary
is
unified
and
its
unity
gives
it
its
strength
and
superiority
the
powers
which
thus
exist
are
the
subjective
counterparts
of
objectively
valuable
products
thus
reason
is
the
subjective
counterpart
of
a
world
in
which
all
the
constituents
are
harmonised
and
fall
into
due
relationship
it
is
a
product
or
result
which
is
not
psychologically
but
logically
or
morally
important
it
is
a
faculty
because
it
means
that
actually
its
possessor
has
ordered
and
systematised
his
life
or
his
ideas
of
things
psychologically
it
like
unreason
is
a
compound
of
elements
but
in
the
case
of
reason
the
composition
is
unendingly
and
infinitely
consistent
it
is
knowledge
completely
unified
the
distinction
then
is
not
in
the
strictest
sense
psychological
for
it
has
an
aesthetic
or
normative
character
it
is
logical
or
ethical
it
denotes
that
the
idea
or
the
act
is
an
approach
to
truth
or
goodness
and
so
when
butler
or
plato
distinguishes
reason
or
reflection
from
appetites
and
affections
and
even
from
selflove
or
from
the
heart
which
loves
and
hates
this
is
not
exactly
a
psychological
division
in
the
narrower
sense
that
is
to
say
these
are
in
platos
words
not
merely
parts
but
quite
as
much
kinds
and
forms
of
soul
they
denote
degrees
in
that
harmonisation
of
mind
and
soul
which
reproduces
the
permanent
and
complete
truth
of
things
for
example
selflove
as
butler
describes
it
has
but
a
partial
and
narrowed
view
of
the
worth
of
acts
it
is
engrossing
and
selfinvolved
it
cannot
take
in
the
full
dependence
of
the
narrower
interest
on
the
larger
and
eternal
self
so
in
plato
the
man
of
heart
is
but
a
nature
which
by
fits
and
starts
or
with
steady
but
limited
vision
realises
the
larger
life
these
parts
or
kinds
are
not
separate
and
coexistent
faculties
but
grades
in
the
coordination
and
unification
of
the
same
one
human
nature
i
psychology
and
epistemology
psychology
however
in
the
strict
sense
is
extremely
difficult
to
define
those
who
describe
it
as
the
science
of
mind
the
phenomenology
of
consciousness
seem
to
give
it
a
wider
scope
than
they
really
mean
the
psychologist
of
the
straiter
sect
tends
on
the
other
hand
to
carry
us
beyond
mind
and
consciousness
altogether
his

has
been

without
a

for
him
mind
soul
and
consciousness
are
only
current
and
convenient
names
to
designate
the
field
the
ground
on
which
the
phenomena
he
observes
are
supposed
to
transact
themselves
but
they
must
not
on
any
account
interfere
with
the
operations
any
more
than

in
general
may
interfere
with
strictly
physical
inquiries
or
life
and
vital
force
with
the
theories
of
biology
the
socalled
mind
is
only
to
be
regarded
as
a
stage
on
which
certain
events
represent
themselves
in
this
field
or
on
this
stage
there
are
certain
relatively
ultimate
elements
variously
called
ideas
presentations
feelings
or
states
of
consciousness
but
these
elements
though
called
ideas
must
not
be
supposed
more
than
mechanical
or
dynamical
elements
consciousness
is
rather
their
product
a
product
which
presupposes
certain
operations
and
relations
between
them
if
we
are
to
be
strictly
scientific
we
must
it
is
urged
treat
the
factors
of
consciousness
as
not
themselves
conscious
we
must
regard
them
as
quasiobjective
or
in
abstraction
from
the
consciousness
which
surveys
them
the
ego
must
sink
into
a
mere
receptacle
or
arena
of
psychic
event
its
independent
meaning
or
purport
is
to
be
ignored
as
beside
the
question
when
this
line
is
once
fixed
upon
it
seems
inevitable
to
go
farther
comte
was
inclined
to
treat
psychology
as
falling
between
two
stools
it
must
he
thought
draw
all
its
content
either
from
physiology
on
the
one
hand
or
from
social
factors
on
the
other
the
dominant
or
experimental
psychology
of
the
present
day
seems
inclined
without
however
formulating
any
very
definite
statement
to
pronounce
for
the
former
alternative
it
does
not
indeed
adopt
the
materialistic
view
that
mind
is
only
a
function
of
matter
its
standpoint
rather
is
that
the
psychical
presents
itself
even
to
unskilled
observation
as
dependent
on
ie
not
independent
of
or
as
concomitant
with
certain
physical
or
corporeal
facts
it
adds
that
the
more
accurately
trained
the
observer
becomes
the
more
he
comes
to
discover
a
corporeal
aspect
even
where
originally
he
had
not
surmised
its
existence
and
to
conclude
that
the
two
cycles
of
psychical
and
physical
event
never
interfere
with
each
other
that
soul
does
not
intervene
in
bodily
process
nor
body
take
up
and
carry
on
psychical
if
it
is
said
that
the
will
moves
the
limbs
he
replies
that
the
will
which
moves
is
really
certain
formerly
unnoticed
movements
of
nerve
and
muscle
which
are
felt
or
interpreted
as
a
discharge
of
power
if
the
ocular
impression
is
said
to
cause
an
impression
on
the
mind
he
replies
that
any
fact
hidden
under
that
phrase
refers
to
a
change
in
the
molecules
of
the
brain
he
will
therefore
conclude
that
for
the
study
of
psychical
phenomena
the
physical
basis
as
it
may
be
called
is
all
important
only
so
can
observation
really
deal
with
fact
capable
of
description
and
measurement
thus
psychology
it
may
be
said
tends
to
become
a
department
of
physiology
from
another
standpoint
biology
may
be
said
to
receive
its
completion
in
psychology
how
much
either
phrase
means
however
will
depend
on
the
estimate
we
form
of
biology
if
biology
is
only
the
study
of
mechanical
and
chemical
phenomena
on
the
peculiar
field
known
as
an
organism
and
if
that
organism
is
only
treated
as
an
environment
which
may
be
ignored
then
psychology
put
on
the
same
level
is
not
the
full
science
of
mind
any
more
than
the

suit
the

of
the

the

the

which
mechanical

instrumental
psychology
may
even
take
part
with
physiology
without
losing
its
essential
rank
but
in
that
case
we
must
as
spinoza
said47
think
less
mechanically
of
the
animal
frame
and
recognise
after
the
example
of
schelling
something
truly
inward
ie
not
merely
locally
inside
the
skin
as
the
supreme
phase
or
characteristic
of
life
we
must
in
short
recognise
sensibility
as
the
culmination
of
the
physiological
and
the
beginning
of
the
psychological
to
the
strictly
scientific
psychologist
as
has
been
notedor
to
the
psychology
which
imitates

and
electrical

are
only
psychical
events
they
are
not
ideas
of
anything
relative
ie
to
something
else
they
have
no
meaning
and
no
reference
to
a
reality
beyond
themselves
they
are
presentationsnot
representations
of
something
outside
consciousness
they
are
appearances
but
not
appearances
of
something
they
do
not
reveal
anything
beyond
themselves
they
are
we
may
almost
say
a
unique
kind
of
physical
phenomena
if
we
say
they
are
presentations
of
something
we
only
mean
that
in
the
presented
something
in
the
felt
something
the
wished
something
we
separate
the
quality
or
form
or
aspect
of
presentativeness
of
feltness
of
wishedness
and
consider
this
aspect
by
itself
there
are
grades

of
such

in
such

the

its

its

its

may
be

in

or
in
a
consciousness
all
esse
in
its
widest
sense
is
percipi
and
yet
it
seems
but
the
commonest
of
experiences
to
say
that
all
that
is
presented
is
not
reality
it
is
it
has
a
sort
of
beingis
somehow
presumed
to
exist
but
it
is
not
reality
and
this
reference
and
antithesis
to
what
is
presented
is
implied
in
all
such
terms
as
ideas
feelings
states
of
consciousness
they
are
distinguished
from
and
related
to
objects
of
sense
or
external
facts
to
something
as
it
is
called
outside
consciousness
thoughts
and
ideas
are
set
against
things
and
realities
in
their
primitive
stage
both
the
child
and
the
savage
seem
to
recognise
no
such
difference
what
they
imagine
is
as
we
might
say
on
the
same
plane
with
what
they
touch
and
feel
they
do
not
as
we
reproachfully
remark
recognise
the
difference
between
fact
and
fiction
all
of
us
indeed
are
liable
to
lapses
into
the
same
condition
a
strong
passion
a
keen
hope
or
fear
as
we
say
invests
its
objects
with
reality
even
a
sanguine
moment
presents
as
fact
what
calmer
reflection
disallows
as
fancy
with
natural
and
sane
intelligences
however
the
recrudescence
of
barbarous
imagination
is
soon
dispelled
and
the
difference
between
hallucinations
and
realities
is
established
with
the
utterly
wrecked
in
mind
the
reality
of
hallucinations
becomes
a
permanent
or
habitual
state
with
the
child
and
the
untrained
it
is
a
recurrent
and
a
disturbing
influence
and
it
need
hardly
be
added
that
the
circle
of
these
decepti
deceptorespeople
with
the
lie
in
the
soulis
a
large
one
there
thus
emerges
a
distinction
of
vast
importance
that
of
truth
and
falsehood
of
reality
and
unreality
or
between
representation
and
reality
there
arise
two
worlds
the
world
of
ideas
and
the
world
of
reality
which
it
is
supposed
to
represent
and
in
many
cases
to
represent
badly
with
this
distinction
we
are
brought
across
the
problem
sometimes
called
epistemological
strictly
speaking
it
is
really
part
of
a
larger
problem
the
problem
of
whatif
greek
compounds
must
be
usedmay
be
styled
aletheiologythe
theory
of
truth
and
reality
what
hegel
called
logic
and
what
many
others
have
called
metaphysics
as
it
is
ordinarily
taken
up
ideas
are
believed
to
be
something
in
us
which
is
representative
or
symbolical
of
something
truly
real
outside
us
this
inward
something
is
said
to
be
the
first
and
immediate
object
of
knowledge48
and
gives
usin
a
mysterious
way
we
need
not
here
discussthe
mediate

is
sometimes
said
to
cause

the

in
this
parallelism
is
evidently
in
some
way
identified
with
our
corporeal
organism
perhaps
even
located
and
provided
with
a
seat
in
some
defined
space
of
that
organism
it
is
however
the
startingpoint
of
the
whole
distinction
that
ideas
do
not
no
less
than
they
do
conform
or
correspond
to
this
supraconscious
or
extraconscious
world
of
real
things
truth
or
falsehood
arises
according
to
these
assumptions
according
as
psychical
image
or
idea
corresponds
or
not
to
physical
fact
but
how
unless
by
some
miraculous
secondsight
where
the
supreme
consciousness
directly
contemplating
by
intuition
the
true
and
independent
reality
turns
to
compare
with
this
immediate
vision
the
results
of
the
mediate
processes
conducted
along
the
organs
of
sensehow
this
agreement
or
disagreement
of
copy
and
original
of
idea
and
reality
can
be
detected
it
is
impossible
to
say
as
has
been
already
noted
the
mischief
lies
in
the
hypostatisation
of
ideas
as
something
existing
in
abstraction
from
thingsand
of
things
in
abstraction
from
ideas
they
are
two
abstractions
the
first
by
the
realist
the
second
by
the
idealist
called
subjective
and
psychological
to
the
realist
things
exist
by
themselves
and
they
manage
to
produce
a
copy
of
themselves
more
or
less
exact
or
symbolical
in
our
mind
ie
in
a
materialisticallyspiritual
or
a
spiritualisticallymaterial
locus
which
holds
images
and
ideas
to
the
psychological
idealist
ideas
have
a
substantive
and
primary
right
to
existence
them
alone
do
we
really
know
and
from
them
we
more
or
less
legitimately
are
said
but
probably
no
one
takes
this
seriously
to
infer
or
postulate
a
world
of
permanent
things
now
ideas
have
no
substantive
existence
as
a
sort
of
things
or
even
images
of
things
anywhere
all
this
is
pure
mythology
it
is
said
by
comparative
mythologists
that
in
some
cases
the
epithet
or
quality
of
some
deity
has
been
substantialised
hypostatised
into
a
separate
god
who
however
so
still
to
keep
up
the
unity
is
regarded
as
a
relative
a
son
or
daughter
of
the
original
so
the
phrase
ideas
of
things
has
been
taken
literally
as
if
it
was
double
but
to
have
an
idea
of
a
thing
merely
means
that
we
know
it
or
think
it
an
idea
is
not
given
it
is
a
thing
which
is
given
in
the
idea
an
idea
is
not
an
additional
and
intervening
object
of
our
knowledge
or
supposed
knowledge
that
a
thing
is
our
object
of
thought
is
another
word
for
its
being
our
idea
and
that
means
we
know
it
the
distinction
between
truth
and
falsehood
between
reality
and
appearance
is
not
arrived
at
by
comparing
what
we
have
before
us
in
our
mind
with
some
inaccessible
reality
beyond
it
is
a
distinction
that
grows
up
with
the
growth
and
organisation
of
our
presentationswith
their
gradual
systematisation
and
unification
in
one
consciousness
but
this
consciousness
which
thinks
ie
judges
and
reasons
is
something
superior
to
the
contrast
of
physical
and
psychical
superior
ie
in
so
far
as
it
includes
and
surveys
the
antithesis
without
superseding
it
it
is
the
transcendental
unity
of
consciousness
of
kanthis
synthetic
unity
of
apperception
it
means
that
all
ideas
ultimately
derive
their
reality
from
their
coherence
with
each
other
in
an
allembracing
or
infinite
idea
real
in
a
sense
ideas
always
are
but
with
an
imperfect
reality

education
to
truth

be
meaninglessended
by
a
rough
and
ready
recommendation
to
compare
our
ideas
with
facts
it
must
teach
the
art
which
discovers
facts
and
the
teaching
may
have
to
go
through
many
grades

provinces
in
each
of
which
it
is
possible
to
acquire
a
certain
virtuosoship

the
common
feature
of
all
of
these
is
so
to
say
their
superiority
to
the
psychological
mechanism
not
in
the

working
without

the

and
hegel
this
was
the
idealism
which
kant
taught
and
fichte
promoted
of
the
other
idealism
there
are
no
doubt
abundant
traces
in
the
language
of
kant
and
they
were
greedily
fastened
on
by
schopenhauer
to
him
the
doctrine
that
the
world
is
my
idea
is
adequately
represented
when
it
is
translated
into
the
phrase
that
the
world
is
a
phantasmagoria
of
my
brain
and
escape
from
the
subjective
idealism
thus
initiated
is
found
by
him
only
through
a
supposed
revelation
of
immediate
being
communicated
in
the
experience
of
will
but
according
to
the
more
consistently
interpreted
kant
the
problem
of
philosophy
consists
in
laying
bare
the
supreme
law
or
conditions
of
consciousness
on
which
depend
the
validity
of
our
knowledge
our
estimates
of
conduct
and
our
aesthetic
standards
and
these
roots
of
reality
are
for
kant
in
the
mindor
should
we
rather
sayin
mindin
consciousness
in
general
in
the
criticism
of
pure
reason
the
general
drift
of
his
examination
is
to
show
that
the
great
things
or
final
realities
which
are
popularly
supposed
to
stand
in
selfsubsistent
being
as
ultimate
and
allcomprehensive
objects
set
up
for
knowledge
are
not
things
as
popularly
supposed
but
imperative
and
inevitable
ideas
they
are
not
objects
to
be
knownthese
are
always
finite
but
rather
the
unification
the
basis
or
condition
and
the
completion
of
all
knowledge
to
know
themin
the
ordinary
petty
sense
of
knowledgeis
as
absurd
and
impossible
as
it
would
be
in
the
platonic
scheme
of
reality
to
know
the
idea
of
good
which
is
on
the
further
side
of
knowledge
and
being
god
and
the
souland
the
same
would
be
true
of
the
world
though
modern
speculators
sometimes
talk
as
if
they
had
it
at
least
within
their
graspare
not
mere
objects
of
knowledge
it
would
be
truer
to
say
they
are
that
by
which
we
know
and
they
are
what
in
us
knows
they
make
knowledge
possible
and
actual
kant
has
sometimes
spoken
of
them
as
the
objects
of
a
faith
of
reason
what
he
means
is
that
reason
only
issues
in
knowledge
because
of
and
through
this
inevitable
law
of
reason
bidding
us
go
on
for
ever
in
our
search
because
there
can
be
nothing
isolated
and
nowhere
any
ne
plus
ultra
in
science
which
is
infinite
and
yet
only
justified
as
it
postulates
or
commands
unity
kants
central
idea
is
that
truth
beauty
goodness
are
not
dependent
on
some
qualities
of
the
object
but
on
the
universal
nature
or
law
of
consciousness
beauty
is
not
an
attribute
of
things
in
their
abstractness
but
of
things
as
ideas
of
a
subject
and
depends
on
the
proportion
and
symmetry
in
the
play
of
human
faculty
goodness
is
not
conformity
to
an
outward
law
but
is
obligatory
on
us
through
that
higher
nature
which
is
our
truer
being
truth
is
not
conformity
of

it

so
both
in

in

it

every

to
get
its

the

is
always
partial

it

the

a

unity
of

which
is
so
to
say
a

a

and
an
order
which
imposes
upon
it
the
condition
of

a

fichte
has
called
his
system
a
wissenschaftslehrea
theory
of
knowledge
modern
german
used
the
word
wissenschaft
as
modern
english
uses
the
word
science
to
denote
the
certified
knowledge
of
piecemeal
fact
the
partial
unification
of
elements
still
kept
asunder
but
by
wissen
as
opposed
to

is
meant
the
i
know
am
aware
and
sure
am
in

with
reality
as
opposed
to
the
derivative
and
conditional
reference
of
something
to
something
else
which
explains
it
the
former
is
a
wider
term
it
denotes
all
consciousness
of
objective
truth
the
certainty
which
claims
to
be
necessary
and
universal
which
pledges
its
whole
self
for
its
assertion
fichte
thus
unifies
and
accentuates
the
common
element
in
the
kantian
criticisms
in
the
first
of
these
kant
had
begun
by
explaining
the
nature
and
limitation
of
empirical
science
it
was
essentially
conditioned
by
the
given
sensationdependent
ie
on
an
unexplained
and
preliminary
element
this
is
what
makes
it
science
in
the
strict
or
narrow
sense
of
the
term
its
being
set
as
it
were
in
the
unknown

the
sensedatum
the
side
of
reality
is
thus
the
side
of
limitation
and
of
presupposition
but
what
makes
it
truth
and
knowledge
in
general
on
the
other
handas
distinct
from
a
truth

the
logical
the
rational
lawor
in
one
word
the
universal
and
formal
character
so
too
every
real
action
is
on
one
hand
the
product
of
an
impulse
a
dark
merely
given
immediate
tendency
to
be
and
without
that
would
be
nothing
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
only
an
intelligent
and
moral
action
in
so
far
as
it
has
its
constitution
from
an
intelligence
a

of

what
he
and
still
more
fichte
considers
the
prime
question
of
fundamental
philosophy
his
philosophy
is
an
attempt
to
get
at
the
organism
of
our
fundamental
beliefthe
construction
from
the
very
base
of
our
conception
of
reality
of
our
primary
certainty
in
technical
language
he
describes
our
essential
nature
as
a
subjectobject
it
is
the
unity
of
an
i
am
which
is
also
i
know
that
i
am
an
i
will
which
is
also
i
am
conscious
of
my
will49
here
there
is
a
radical
disunion
and
a
supersession
of
that
disunion
action
and
contemplation
are
continually
outrunning
each
other
the
i

rests
upon
one
i

and
works
up
to
another
the
i

reflects
upon
an
i
will
and
includes
it
as
an
element
in
its
idea
kant
had
brought
into
use
the
term
deduction
and
fichte
follows
him
the
term
leads
to
some
confusion
for
in
english
by
its
modern
antithesis
to
induction
it
suggests
a
priori
methods
in
all
their
iniquity
it
means
a
kind
of
jugglery
which
brings
an
endless
series
out
of
one
small
term
kant
has
explained
that
he
uses
it
in
the
lawyers
sense
in
which
a
claim
is
justified
by
being
traced
step
by
step
back
to
some
acknowledged
and
accepted
right50
it
is
a
regressive
method
which
shows
us
that
if
the
original
datum
is
to
be
accepted
it
carries
along
with
it
the
legitimation
of
the
consequence
this
method
fichte
applies
to
psychology
begin
he
says
like
condillac
with
the
barest
nucleus
of
soullife
the
mere
sentiency
or
feeling
the
contact
as
it
were
with
being
at
a
single
point
but
such
a
mere
point
is
unthinkable
you
find
as
mr
spencer
says
that
thought
or
consciousness
cannot
be
framed
out
of
one
term
only
every
sensation
to
be
known
as
one
must
be
perceived
such
is
the
nature
of
the
egoa
subject
which
insists
on
each
part
being
qualified
by
the
whole
and
so
transformed
as
mr
spencer
again
puts
it
the
mind
not
merely
tends
to
revive
to
associate
to
assimilate
to
represent
its
own
presentations
but
it
carries
on
this
process
infinitely
and
in
ever
higher
multiples
ideas
as
it
were
are
growing
in
complexity
by
representing
ie
by
embracing
and
enveloping
elements
which
cannot
be
found
existing
in
separation
in
the
mind
there
is
no
mere
presentation
no
bare
sensation
such
a
unit
is
a
fiction
or
hypothesis
we
employ
like
the
atom
for
purposes
of
explanation
the
pure
sensation
thereforewhich
you
admit
because
you
must
have
something
to
begin
with
not
a
mere
nothing
but
something
so
simple
that
it
seems
to
stand
out
clear
and
indisputablethis
pure
sensation
when
you
think
of
it
forces
you
to
go
a
good
deal
further
even
to
be
itself
it
must
be
more
than
itself
it
is
like
the
pure
or
mere
being
of
the
logicians
admit
the
simple
sensationand
you
have
admitted
everything
which
is
required
to
make
sensation
a
possible
reality
but
you
do
notin
the
sense
of
vulgar
logicdeduce
what
follows
out
of
the
beginning
from
that
taken
by
itself
you
will
get
only
itself
mere
being
will
give
you
only
nothing
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
but
as
the
phrase
is
sensation
is
an
element
in
a
consciousness
it
is
when
you
think
of
it
always
more
than
you
called
it
there
is
a
curious
continuity
about
the
phenomena
which
makes
real
isolation
impossible
of
course
this
deduction
is
not
history
it
is
logic
it
says
if
you
posit
sensation
then
in
doing
so
you
posit
a
good
deal
more
you
have
imagination
reason
and
many
more
all
involved
in
your
original
assumption
and
there
is
a
further
point
to
be
noted
you
cannot
really
stop
even
at
reason
at
intelligence
and
will
if
you
take
these
in
the
full
sense
you
must
realise
that
these
only
exist
as
part
and
parcel
of
a
reasonable
world
an
individual
intelligence
presupposes
a
society
of
intelligences
the
successive
steps
in
this
argument
are
presented
by
fichte
in
the
chief
works
of
his
earlier
period
179498
the
works
of
that
period
form
a
kind
of
trilogy
of
philosophy
by
which
the
faint
outlines
of
the
absolute
selfhood
is
shown
acquiring
definite
consistency
in
the
moral
organisation
of
society
first
comes
the
foundation
for
the
collective
philosophy
it
shows
how
our
conception
of
reality
and
our
psychical
organisation
are
inevitably
presupposed
in
the
barest
function
of
intelligence
in
the
abstractest
forms
of
logical
law
begin
where
you
like
with
the
most
abstract
and
formal
point
of
consciousness
you
are
forced
as
you
dwell
upon
it
you
identifying
yourself
with
the
thought
you
realise
to
go
step
by
step
on
till
you
accept
as
a
selfconsistent
and
selfexplanatory
unity
all
that
your
cognitive
and
volitional
nature
claims
to
own
as
its
birthright
only
in
such
an
intelligent
will
is
perception
and
sensation
possible
next
came
the
foundation
of
natural
law
on
the
principles
of
the
general
theory
here
the
process
of
deduction
is
carried
a
step
further
if
man
is
to
realise
himself
as
an
intelligence
with
an
inherent
bent
to
action
then
he
must
be
conceived
as
a
person
among
persons
as
possessed
of
rights
as
incapable
of
acting
without
at
the
same
moment
claiming
for
his
acts
recognition
generality
and
logical
consecution
the
reference
which
in
the
conception
of
a
practical
intelligence
was
implicitthe
reference
to
fellowagents
to
a
world
in
which
law
rulesis
thus
by
the
explicit
recognition
of
these
references
made
a
fact
patent
and
positivegesetztexpressly
instituted
in
the
way
that
the
nature
and
condition
of
things
postulates
but
this
is
not
all
we
step
from
the
formal
and
absolute
into
the
material
and
relative
if
man
is
to
be
a
real
intelligence
he
must
be
an
intelligence
served
by
organs
the
rational
being
cannot
realise
its
efficient
individuality
unless
it
ascribes
to
itself
a
material
body
a
body
moreover
in
which
fichte
believes
he
can
show
that
the
details
of
structure
and
organs
are
equally
with
the
general
corporeity
predetermined
by
reason51
in
the
same
way
it
is
shown
that
the
social
and
political
organisation
is
required
for
the
realisationthe
making
positive
and
yet
coherentof
the
rights
of
all
individuals
you
deduce
society
by
showing
it
is
required
to
make
a
genuine
individual
man
thirdly
came
the
system
of
ethics
here
it
is
further
argued
that
at
least
in
a
certain
respect52
in
spite
of
my
absolute
reason
and
my
absolute
freedom
i
can
only
be
fully
real
as
a
part
of
nature
that
my
reason
is
realised
in
a
creature
of
appetite
and
impulse
from
first
to
last
this
deduction
is
one
process
which
may
be
said
to
have
for
its
object
to
determine
the
conditions
of
selfhood
or
egoity
it
is
the
deduction
of
the
concrete
and
empirical
moral
agentthe
actual
ego
of
actual
lifefrom
the
abstract
unconditioned
ego
which
in
order
to
be
actual
must
condescend
to
be
at
once
determining
and
determined
in
all
of
this
fichte
makesespecially
formallya
decided
advance
upon
kant
in
ethics
kant
in
particular
especially
for
readers
who
never
got
beyond
the
beginning
of
his
moral
treatise
and
were
overpowered
by
the
categorical
imperative
of
duty
had
found
the
moral
initiative
or
dynamic
apparently
in
the
other
world
the
voice
of
duty
seemed
to
speak
from
a
region
outside
and
beyond
the
individual
conscience
in
a
sense
it
must
do
so
but
it
comes
from
a
consciousness
which
is
and
yet
is
more
than
the
individual
it
is
indeed
true
that
appearances
here
are
deceptive
and
that
the
idea
of
autonomy
the
selflegislation
of
reason
is
trying
to
become
the
central
conception
of
kants
ethics
still
it
is
fichtes
merit
to
have
seen
this
clearly
to
have
held
it
in
view
unfalteringly
and
to
have
carried
it

still
more
decidedly
for

both

breathe
an

and

air
than
they
often
enjoy
psychology
ceases
to
be
a
mere
description
of

and
becomes
the
history
of
the
selforganising
process
of
human
reason
ethics
loses
its
cloistered
negative
unnatural
aspect
and
becomes
a
name
for
some
further
conditions

the

essentially
postulated
to
complete
or
supplement
its
shortcomings
psychologytaken
in
this
high
philosophical
acceptationthus
leads
on
to

and
ethics
is
parted
by
no
impassable
line
from
psychology
that
at
least
is
what
must
happen
if
they
are
still
to
retain
a
place
in
philosophy
for
as
kant
says55
under
the
government
of
reason
our
cognitions
cannot
form
a
rhapsody
but
must
constitute
a
system
in
which
alone
can
they
support
and
further
its
essential
aims
as
parts
of
such
a
system
they
carry
out
their
special
work
in
subordination
to
and
in
the
realisation
of
a
single
ideaand
therefore
in
essential
interconnexion
from
that
interconnecting
band
we
may
however
in
detailenquiry
dispense
ourselves
and
then
we
have
the
empirical
or
inductive
sciences
of
psychology
and
ethics
but
even
with
these
the
necessity
of
the
situation
is
such
that
it
is
only
a
question
of
degree
how
far
we
lose
sight
of
the
philosophical
horizon
and
entrench
ourselves
in
special
enquiry
something
of
the
philosophic
largeness
must
always
guide
us
even
when
to
further
the
interests
of
the
whole
it
is
necessary
for
the
special
enquirer
to
bury
himself
entirely
in
his
part
so
long
as
each
part
is
sincerely
and
thoroughly
pursued
and
no
part
is
neglected
there
is
an
indwelling
reason
in
the
parts
which
will
in
the
long
run
tend
to
constitute
the
total
a
philosophical
psychology
will
show
us
how
the
sane
intelligence
and
the
rational
will
are
at
least
approximately
built
up
out
of
elements
and
through
stages
and
processes
which
modify
and
complement
as
they
may
also
arrest
and
perplex
each
other
the
unity
coherence
and
completeness
of
the
intelligent
self
is
not
as
vulgar
irreflectiveness
supposes
and
somewhat
angrily
maintains
a
fullgrown
thing
or
agent
of
whose
actions
and
modes
of
behaviour
the
psychologist
has
to
narrate
the
historya
history
which
is
too
apt
to
degenerate
into
the
anecdotal
and
the
merely
interesting
this
unity
of
self
has
to
be
deduced
as
fichte
would
say
it
has
to
be
shown
as
the
necessary
result
which
certain
elements
in
a
certain
order
will
lead
to56
a
normal
mind
selfpossessed
developed
and
articulated
yet
thoroughly
one
a
real
microcosm
or
true
and
full
monad
which
under
the
mode
of
its
individuality
still
represents
the
universe
that
is
what
psychology
has
to
show
as
the
product
of
factors
and
processes
and
it
is
clearly
something
great
and
good
something
valuable
and
already
possessing
by
implication
we
may
say
an
ethical
character
in
philosophy
at
least
it
is
difficult
or
rather
impossible
to
draw
a
hard
and
fast
line
which
shall
demarcate
ethical
from
nonethical
charactersto
separate
them
from
other
intellectual
and
reasonable
motives
kant
as
we
know
attempted
to
do
so
but
with
the
result
that
he
was
forced
to
add
a
doubt
whether
a
purely
moral
act
could
ever
be
said
to
exist57
or
rather
to
express
the
certainty
that
if
it
did
it
was
for
ever
inaccessible
to
observation
all
such
designations
of
the
several
factors
or
moments
in
reality
as
has
been
hinted
are
only
a
potiori
but
they
are
misused
when
it
is
supposed
that
they
connote
abrupt
and
total
discontinuity
and
kant
after
all
only
repeated
in
his
own
terminology
an
old
and
inveterate
habit
of
thoughtthe
habit
which
in
stoicism
seemed
to
see
sage
and
foolish
utterly
separated
and
which
in
the
straiter
sects
of
christendom
fenced
off
saint
absolutely
from
sinner
it
is
a
habit
to
which
hegel
and
even
his
immediate
predecessors
are
radically
opposed
with
herder
he
might
say
ethics
is
only
a
higher
physics
of
the
mind58
thisthe
truth
in
spinozismno
doubt
demands
some
emphasis
on
the
word
higher
and
it
requires
us
to
read
ethics
or
something
like
it
into
physics
but
it
is
a
step
on
the
right
roadthe
step
which
utilitarianism
and
evolutionism
had
however
awkwardly
got
their
foot
upon
and
which
transcendent
ethics
seems
unduly
afraid
of
committing
itself
to
let
us
say
if
we
like
that
the
mind
is
more
than
mere
nature
and
that
it
is
no
proper
object
of
a
merely
natural
science
but
let
us
remember
that
a
merely
natural
science
is
only
a
fragment
of
science
let
us
add
that
the
merely
natural
is
an
abstraction
which
in
part
denaturalises
and
mutilates
the
larger
naturea
nature
which
includes
the
natural
mind
and
cannot
altogether
exclude
the
ethical
what
have
been
called
formal
duties59
seem
to
fall
under
this
rangethe
province
of
a
philosophical
psychology
which
unveils
the
conditions
of
personality
under
that
heading
may
be
put
selfcontrol
consistency

and
the
like
the
due
proportion
of
faculty
the
correspondence
of
head
and
heart
the
vivacity
and
quickness
of
sympathy
the
ease
and
simplicity
of
mental
tone
the

vigour
of
memory
and
the
grace
of

sweetness
of

and
the

are
parts
of
the
same
group60
they
are
lovely
and
of
good
report
they
are
praise
and
virtue
if
it
be
urged
that
they
are
only
natural
gifts
and
graces
that
objection
cuts
two
ways
the
objector
may
of
course
be
reminded
that
religion
tones
down
the
selfcomplacency
of
morality
yet
first
even
apart
from
that
it
may
be
said
that
of
virtues
which
stand
independent
of
natural
conditionsof
external
supply
of
means
as
aristotle
would
saynothing
can
be
known
and
nothing
need
be
said
and
secondly
none
of
these
qualities
are
mere
giftsall
require
exercise
habituation
energising
to
get
and
keep
them
how
much
and
how
little
in
each
case
is
natures
and
how
much
ours
is
a
problem
which
has
some
personal
interestdue
perhaps
to
a
rather
selfish
and
envious
curiosity
but
on
the
broad
field
of
experience
and
history
we
may
perhaps
accept
theapparently
onesidedproverb
that
each
man
is
the
architect
of
his
own
fortune
be
this
as
it
may
it
will
not
do
to
deny
the
ethical
character
of
these
formal
duties
on
the
ground
eg
that
selfcontrol
prudence
and
even
sweetness
of
temper
may
be
used
for
evil
endsthat
one
may
smile
and
smile
and
yet
be
a
villain
thatlet
us
replyon
one
hand
is
a
fault
if
fault
it
be
incidental
to
all
virtues
in
detail
for
every
single
quality
has
its
defect
nay
it
may
be
a
limitation
attaching
to
the
whole
ethical
sphere
and
secondly
its
inevitable
limitation
does
not
render
the
virtue
in
any
case
one
whit
less
genuine
so
far
as
it
goes
and
yet
of
such
virtues
it
may
be
said
as
hume61
would
say
who
calls
them
natural
as
opposed
to
the
more
artificial
merits
of
justice
and
its
kin
that
they
please
in
themselves
or
in
the
mere
contemplation
and
without
any
regard
to
their
social
effects
but
they
please
as
entering
into
our
idea
of
complete
human
nature
of
mind
and
spirit
as
will
and
intellect
the
moralists
of
last
century
sometimes
divided
the
field
of
ethics
by
assigning
to
man
three
grades
or
kinds
of
duty
duties
to
himself
duties
to
society
and
duties
to
god
for
the
distinction
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
there
are
also
faults
to
be
found
with
it
it
may
be
said
amongst
other
things
that
to
speak
of
duties
to
self
is
a
metaphorical
way
of
talking
and
that
god
lies
out
of
the
range
of
human
duty
altogether
except
in
so
far
as
religious
service
forms
a
part
of
social
obligation
it
may
be
urged
that
man
is
essentially
a
social
being
and
that
it
is
only
in
his
relations
to
other
such
beings
that
his
morality
can
find
a
sphere
the
sphere
of
morality
according
to
dr
bain
embraces
whatever
society
has
seen
fit
to
enforce
with
all
the
rigour
of
positive
inflictions
positive
good
deeds
and
selfsacrifice

transcend
the
region
of
morality
proper
and
occupy
a
sphere
of
their
own62
and
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
restriction
is
in
accordance
with
a
main
current
of
usage
it
may
even
be
said
that
there
are
tendencies
towards
a
narrower
usage
still
which
would
restrict
the
term
to
questions
affecting
the
relations
of
the
sexes
but
without
going
so
far
we
may
accept
the
standpoint
which
finds
in
the
phrase
popular
or
social
sanction
as
equivalent
to
the
moral
sanction
a
description
of
the
average
level
of
common
opinion
on
the
topic
the
morality
of
an
age
or
country
thus
denotes
first
the
average
requirement
in
act
and
behaviour
imposed
by
general
consent
on
the
members
of
a
community
and
secondly
the
average
performance
of
the
members
in
response
to
these
requirements
generally
speaking
the
two
will
be
pretty
much
the
same
if
the
society
is
in
a
state
of
equilibrium
there
will
be
a
palpable
agreement
between
what
all
severally
expect
and
what
all
severally
perform
on
the
other
hand
as
no
society
is
ever
in
complete
equilibrium
this
harmony
will
never
be
perfect
and
may
often
be
widely
departed
from
in
what
is
called
a
single
community
if
it
reach
a
considerable
bulk
there
are
in
other
words
often
a
number
of
minor
societies
more
or
less
thwarting
and
modifying
each
other
and
different
observers
who
belong
in
the
main
to
one
or
other
of
these
subordinate
groups
may
elicit
from
the
facts
before
them
a
somewhat
different
social
code
and
a
different
grade
of
social
observance
still
with
whatever
diversity
of
detail
the
important
feature
of
such
social
ethics
is
that
the
stress
is
laid
on
the
performance
of
certain
acts
in
accordance
with
the
organisation
of
society
so
long
as
the
required
compliance
is
given
public
opinion
is
satisfied
and
morality
has
got
its
due
but
in
two
directions
this
conception
of
morality
needs
to
be
supplementing
there
is
on
one
hand
what
is
called
duty
to
god
the
phrase
is
not
altogether
appropriate
for
it
follows
too
closely
the
analogy
of
social
requirement
and
treats
deity
as
an
additional
and
social
authoritya
lord
paramount
over
merely
human
sovereigns
but
though
there
may
be
some
use
in
the
analogy
to
press
the
conception
is
seriously
to
narrow
the
divine
character
and
the
scope
of
religion
as
in
similar
cases
we
cannot
change
one
term
without
altering
its
correlative
and
therefore
to
describe
our
relation
to
god
under
the
name
of
duty
is
to
narrow
and
falsify
that
relation
the
word
is
no
longer
applicable
in
this
connexion
without
a
strain
and
where
it
exists
it
indicates
the
survival
of
a
conception
of
theocracy
of
god
regarded
as
a
glorification
of
the
magistrate
as
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
it
is
the
social
worldand
indeed
we
may
say
the
outside
of
the
social
worldthat
is
the
sphere
of
duties
duty
is
still
with
these
reductions
a
great
august
name
but
in
literal
strictness
it
only
rules
over
the
medial
sphere
of
life
the
sphere
which
lies
between
the
individual
as
such
and
his
universal
humanity63
beyond
duty
lies
the
sphere
of
conscience
and
of
religion
and
that
is
not
the
mere
insistence
by
the
individual
to
have
a
voice
and
a
vote
in
determining
the
social
order
it
is
the
sense
that
the
social
order
however
omnipotent
it
may
seem
is
limited
and
finite
and
that
man
has
in
him
a
kindred
with
the
eternal
it
is
not
very
satisfactory
either
as
aristotle
and
others
have
pointed
out
to
speak
of
mans
duties
to
himself
the
phrase
is
analogical
like
the
other
but
it
has
the
merit
like
that
of
duty
to
god
of
reminding
us
that
the
ordinary
latitude
occupied
by
morality
is
not
all
that
comes
under
the
larger
scope
of
ethics
the
ethics
of
individual
life
is
a
subject
which
mr
spencer
has
touched
upon
and
by
this
title
he
means
that
besides
his
general
relationship
to
others
a
human
being
has
to
mind
his
own
health
food
and
amusement
and
has
duties
as
husband
and
parent
but
after
all
these
are
not
matters
of
peculiarly
individual
interest
they
rather
refer
to
points
which
society
at
certain
epochs
leaves
to
the
common
sense
of
the
agentapparently
on
an
assumption
that
he
is
the
person
chiefly
interested
and
these
pointsas
the
greeks
taught
long
agoare
of
fundamental
importance
they
are
the
very
bases
of
life
yet
the
comparative
neglect
in
which
socalled
civilised
societies64
hold
the
precepts
of
wisdom
in
relation
to
bodily
health
and
vigour
in
regard
to
marriage
and
progeny
serve
to
illustrate
the
doctrine
of
the
ancient
stoics
that


or
the
modern
idealist
utterance
that
the
world
is
my
idea
more
and
more
as
civilisation
succeeds
in
its
disruption
of
man
from
nature
it
shows
him
governed
not
by
bare
facts
and
isolated
experiences
but
by
the
systematic
idea
under
which
all
things
are
subsumed
he
loses
the
navet
of
the
natural
man
which
takes
each
fact
as
it
came
all
alike
good
he
becomes
sentimental
and
artificial
sees
things
under
a
conventional
point
of
view
and
would
rather
die
than
not
be
in
the
fashion
and
this
tendency
is
apparently
irresistible
yet
the
mistake
lies
in
the
onesidedness
of
sentiment
and
convention
not
the
domination
of
the
idea
is
evil
but
the
domination
of
a
partial
and
fragmentary
idea
and
this
is
what
constitutes
the
evil
of
artificiality
and
the
correction
must
lie
not
in
a
return
to
nature
but
in
the
reconstruction
of
a
wider
and
more
comprehensive
idea
an
idea
which
shall
be
the
unity
and
system
of
all
nature
not
a
fantastic
idealism
but
an
attempt
to
do
justice
to
the
more
realist
as
well
as
the
idealist
sides
of
life
there
is
however
another
side
of
individualist
ethics
which
needs
even
more
especial
enforcement
it
is
the
formation
of
the
reason
firm
the
temperate
will
endurance
foresight
strength
and
skill
the
healthy
mind
in
a
healthy
body
ethics
is
only
too
apt
to
suppose
that
will
and
intelligence
are
assumptions
which
need
no
special
justification
but
the
truth
is
that
they
vary
from
individual
to
individual
in
degree
and
structure
it
is
the
business
of
ethical
psychology
to
give
to
these
vague
attributions
the
definiteness
of
a
normal
standard
to
show
what
proportions
are
required
to
justify
the
proper
title
of
reason
and
willto
show
what
reason
and
will
really
are
if
they
do
what
they
are
encouraged
or
expected
to
do
it
talks
of
the
diseases
of
will
and
personality
it
must
also
set
forth
their
educational
ideal
the
first
problem
of
ethics
it
may
be
said
is
the
question
of
the
will
and
its
freedom
but
to
say
this
is
of
course
not
to
say
that
unless
freedom
of
will
be
understood
in
some
special
sense
ethics
becomes
impossible
if
the
moral
law
is
the
ratio
cognoscendi
of
freedom
then
must
our
conception
of
morality
and
of
freedom
hang
together
and
it
will
clearly
be
indispensable
to
begin
by
some
attempt
to
discover
in
what
sense
man
may
be
in
the
most
general
way
described
as
a
moral
agentas
an
intelligent
will
or
more
briefly
yet
synonymously
as
a
will
the
soil
of
law
and
morality
says
hegel65
is
the
intelligent
life
and
its
more
precise
place
and
startingpoint
the
will
which
is
free
in
the
sense
that
freedom
is
its
substance
and
characteristic
and
the
system
of
law
the
realm
of
freedom
realised
the
world
of
intelligence
produced
out
of
itself
as
a
second
nature
such
a
freedom
is
a
freedom
made
and
acquired
the
work
of
the
minds
selfrealisation
not
to
be
taken
as
a
given
fact
of
consciousness
which
must
be
believed66
to
have
a
willin
other
words
to
have
freedom
is
the
consummationand
let
us
add
only
the
formal
or
ideal
consummationof
a
process
by
which
man
raises
himself
out
of
his
absorption
in
sensation
and
impulse
establishes
within
himself
a
mental
realm
an
organism
of
ideas
a
selfconsciousness
and
a
self
the
vulgar
apprehension
of
these
things
seems
to
assume
that
we
have
by
nature
or
are
born
with
a
general
faculty
or
set
of
general
faculties
which
we
subsequently
fill
up
and
embody
by
the
aid
of
experience
we
possessthey
seem
to
implyso
many
forms
and
categories
latent
in
our
minds
ready
to
hold
and
contain
the
raw
materials
supplied
from
without
according
to
this
view
we
have
all
a
will
and
an
intelligence
the
difference
only
is
that
some
put
more
into
them
and
some
put
less
but
such
a
separation
of
the
general
form
from
its
contents
is
a
piece
of
pure
mythology
it
is
perhaps
true
and
safe
to
say
that
the
human
being
is
of
such
a
character
that
will
and
intelligence
are
in
the
ordinary
course
inevitably
produced
but
the
forms
which
grow
up
are
the
more
and
more
definite
and
systematic
organisation
of
a
graded
experience
of
series
of
ideas
working
themselves
up
again
and
again
in
representative
and
rerepresentative
degree
till
they
constitute
a
mental
or
inner
world
of
their
own
the
will
is
thus
the
title
appropriate
to
the
final
stage
of
a
process
by
which
sensation
and
impulse
have
polished
and
perfected
themselves
by
union
and
opposition
by
differentiation
and
accompanying
redintegration
till
they
assume
characters
quite
unsurmised
in
their
earliest
aspects
and
yet
only
the
consolidation
or
selfrealisation
of
implications
thus
the
mental
faculties
are
essentially
acquired
powersacquired
not
from
without
but
by
action
which
generates
the
faculties
it
seems
to
imply
the
process
of
mind
is
a
process
which
creates
individual
centres
raises
them
to
completer
independencewhich
produces
an
inner
life
more
and
more
selfcentered
and
also
more
and
more
equal
to
the
universe
which
it
has
embodied
and
will
and
intelligence
are
an
important
stage
in
that
process
herbart
as
was
briefly
hinted
at
in
the
first
essay
has
analysed
ethical
appreciation
which
may
or
may
not
be
accompanied
by
approbation
into
five
distinct
standard
ideas
these
are
the
ideas
of
inward
liberty
of
perfection
of
right
benevolence
and
equity
like
hume
he
regards
the
moral
judgment
as
in
its
purity
a
kind
of
aesthetic
pronouncement
on
the
agreement
or
proportion
of
certain
activities
in
relations
to
each
other
two
of
these
standard
ideasthat
of
inward
liberty
and
of
perfectionseem
to
belong
to
the
sphere
at
present
under
review
they
emerge
as
conditions
determining
the
normal
development
of
human
nature
to
an
intelligent
and
matured
personality
by
inward
freedom
herbart
means
the
harmony
between
the
will
and
the
intellect
what
aristotle
has
named
practical
truth
or
reality
and
what
he
describes
in
his
conception
of
wisdom
or
moral
intelligencethe
power
of
discerning
the
right
path
and
of
pursuing
it
with
will
and
temper
the
unity
clear
but
indissoluble
of
will
and
discernment
by
the
idea
of
perfection
herbart
means
the
sense
of
proportion
and
of
propriety
which
is
awakened
by
comparing
a
progress
in
development
or
an
increase
in
strength
with
its
earlier
stages
of
promise
and
imperfection
the
pleasure
such
perception
affords
works
in
two
ways
it
is
a
satisfaction
in
achievement
past
and
a
stimulus
to
achievement
yet
to
come
such
ideas
of
inward
liberty
and
of
growth
in
ability
or
in
performance
govern
at
least
in
part
our
judgment
of
the
individual
and
have
an
ethical
significance
indeed
if
the
cardinal
feature
of
the
ethical
sentiment
be
the
inwardness
and
independence
of
its
approbation
and
obligation
these
ideas
lie
at
the
root
of
all
true
morality
inward
harmony
and
inward
progress
lucidity
of
conscience
and
the
resolution
which
knows
no
finality
of
effort
are
the
very
essence
of
moral
life
yet
if
ethics
is
to
include
in
the
first
instance
social
relationships
and
external
utilities
and
sanctions
these
conditions
of
true
life
must
rather
be
described
as
preethical
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
here
we
get
to
a
range
of
ethics
which
is
far
wider
than
what
is
ordinarily
called
practice
and
conduct
at
this
stage
logic
aesthetic
and
ethic
are
yet
one
the
true
the
good
and
the
beautiful
are
still
held
in
their
fundamental
unity
an
ethics
of
wide
principle
precedes
its
narrower
social
application
and
whereas
in
ordinary
usage
the
social

and
though
it
is
easy
to
step
into
exaggeration
it
is
still
well
to
emphasise
this
larger
conception
of

the
moral

of
the
maximising
of

be

so
unfortunately
are
all
moral
principles
when
stated
in
the
effrontery
of
isolation
but
it
has
its
truth
in
the
conviction
that
all
moral
evil
is
marked
by
a
tendency

it

good
advice
for
all
that
even
though
it
may
be
difficult
to
define
in
a
general
formula
wherein
distinction
consists
to
mark
the
boundary

kant
has
laid
it
down
as
the
principle
of
duty
to
ask
ourselves
if
in
our
act
we
are
prepared
to
universalise
the
maxim
implied
by
our
conduct

that
thiswhich

bids
us
look
at
an

the
whole
of
its
relations

a
safeguard
against
some
forms
of
moral
evil
is
certain
but
there
is
an
oppositeor
rather
an
apparently
oppositeprinciple
which
bids
us
be

be
true
to
our
own
selves
and
never
allow
ourselves
to
be
dismayed
from
our

responsibility
perhaps
the
two
principles
are
not
so

they
seem
in
any

true

the
last

the

it

down
his

its
province
in
performance
of
certain
single
and
external
actsin
business
honesty
and
commercial
straightforwardness
there
is
the
view
that
it
is
rendering
to
each
what
is
due
to
him
that
it
consists
in
the
proper
reciprocity
of
services
in
the
balance
of
social
give
and
take
there
is
the
critical
or
hypercritical
view
which
from
seeing
so
much
that
is
called
justice
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
interest
of
the
predominant
social
order
bluntly
identifies
mere
force
or
strength
as
the
ground
of
right
and
there
are
views
which
regard
it
as
due
to
social
conventions
and
artifices
to
the
influence
of
education
to
political

the

said
scornful

if
it
be
far

still
farther

the
noble

it

possible
to

aristotle

him
such

the
florentine
poet

the
greek
world
in

thus
conceived

the
philosophers
had
a
further
point
to

that
was

this
is
the
common
theme
the
supremacy
of
knowledge
its
central
and
essential
relation
to
virtue
they
may
differperhaps
not
so
widely
as
current
prejudice
would
supposeas
to
how
this
knowledge
is
to
be
defined
what
kind
of
knowledge
it
is
how
acquired

maintained

so

in
essentials
they
are

none
of
them

that
in

to
right
conduct
nothing
more
is
needed
than
to
learn
and
remember
what
is
right
the
precepts
and
commandments
of
ordinary
morality
memory
is
not
knowledge
especially
when
it
is
out
of
mind
even
an
ancient
philosopher
was
not
wholly
devoid
of
common
sense
they
heldwhat
they
supposed
was
a
fact
of
observation
and
reflectionthat
all
action
was
prompted
by
feelings
of
the
values
of
things
by
a
desire
of
something
good
or
pleasing
to
self
and
aimed
at
selfsatisfaction
and
selfrealisation
but
that
there
was
great
mistake
in
what
thus
afforded
satisfaction
people
chose
to
act
wrongly
or
erroneously
because
they
were
first
mistaken
about
themselves
and
what
they
wanted
and
secondly
mistaken
in
the
means
which
would
give
them
satisfaction
but
this
second
point
was
secondary
the
main
thing
was
to
know
yourself
what
you
really
were
in
platos
words
to
see
the
soul
as
it
is
and
know
whether
it
have
one
form

or
what

to

this
mental
confusion
this
blindness
of
will
and
judgment
is
the
task
set
for
philosophy
to
give
inward
light
to
teach
true
selfmeasurement
in
one
passage
much
misunderstood
plato
has
called
this
philosophic
art
the
due
measurement
of
pleasures
and
pains
it
should
scarcely
have
been
possible
to
mistake
the
meaning
but
with
the
catchwords
of
utilitarianism
ringing
in
their
ears
the
commentators
ran
straight
contrary
to
the
true
teaching
of
the
protagoras
consentient
as
it
is
with
that
of
the
phaedo
and
the
philebus
to
measure
one
must
have
a
standard
and
if
plato
has
one
lesson
always
for
us
it
is
that
a
sure
standard
the
multitude
have
not
but
only
confusion
the
socalled
pleasures
and
pains
of
the
worlds
experiences
are
so
entitled
for
different
reasons
for
contrary
aims
and
with
no
unity
or
harmony
of
judgment
they
arenot
a
fact
to
be
accepted
buta
problem
for
investigation
their
reality
is
in
question
their
genuineness
solidity
and
purity
and
till
you
have
settled
that
you
cannot
measure
for
you
may
be
measuring
vacuity
under
the
idea
that
there
is
substance
you
have
still
to
get
at
the
unitie
the
reality
of
pleasure
it
was
not
platos
view
that
pleasure
was
a
separate
and
independent
entity
that
it
was
exactly
as
it
was
felt
each
pleasure
is
dependent
for
its
pleasurable
quality
on
the
consciousness
it
belongs
to
and
has
only
a
relative
truth
and
reality
bentham
has
written
about
computing
the
value
of
a
lot
of
pleasures
and
pains
but
plato
had
his
mind
on
an
earlier
and
more
fundamental
problem
what
is
the
truth
and
reality
of
pleasure
and
his
fullest
but
not
his
only
essay
towards
determining
the
value
or
estimating
the
meaning
of
pleasure
in
the
scale
of
being
is
that
given
in
the
philebus
this
then
is
the
knowledge
which
greek
philosophy
meant
not
mere
intellectthough
of
course
there
is
always
a
danger
of
theoretical
inquiry
degenerating
into
abstract
and
formal
dogma
but
of
the
meaning
there
can
be
no
serious
doubt
it
is
a
knowledge
says
plato
to
which
the
method
of
mathematical
sciencethe
most
perfect
he
can
find
acknowledgedis
only
an
ouverture
or
perhaps
only
the
preliminary
tuning
of
the
strings
it
is
a
knowledge
not
eternally
hypotheticala
system
of
sequences
which
have
no
sure
foundation
it
is
a
knowledge
which
rests
upon
the
conviction
and
belief
of
the
idea
of
good
a
kind
of
knowledge
which
does
not
come
by
direct
teaching
which
is
not
mere
theory
but
implies
a
lively
conviction
a
personal
apprehension
a
crisis
which
is
a
kind
of
conversion
or
inspiration
it
is
as
it
were
the
prize
of
a
great
contest
in
which
the
sword
that
conquers
is
the
sword
of
dialectic
a
sword
whereof
the
property
is
like
that
of
ithuriels
spear
to
lay
bare
all
deceptions
and
illusions
of
life
or
to
vary
the
metaphor
the
son
of
man
is
like
the
prince
in
the
fairy
tale
who
goes
forth
to
win
the
true
queen
but
there
are
many
false
pretenders
decked
out
to
deceive
his
unwary
eyes
and
foolish
heart
yet
in
himself
there
is
a
power
of
discernment
there
is
something
kindred
with
the
truththe
witness
of
the
spiritand
all
that
education
and
discipline
can
do
is
to
remove
obstacles
especially
the
obstacles
within
the
self
which
perturb
the
sight
and
mislead
the
judgment
were
not
the
soul
originally
possessed
of
and
dominated
by
the
idea
of
good
it
could
never
discern
it
elsewhere
on
this
original
kindred
depends
all
the
process
of
education
the
influence
of
which
therefore
is
primarily
negative
or
auxiliary
thus
the
process
of
history
and
experiencewhich
the
work
of
education
only
reproduces
in
an
accelerated
temposerves
but
to
bring
out
the
implicit
reason
within
into
explicit
conformity
with
the
rationality
of
the
world
knowledge
then
in
this
ethical
sphere
means
the
harmony
of
will
emotion
intellect
it
means
the
clear
light
which
has
no
illusions
and
no
deceptions
and
to
those
who
feel
that
much
of
their
life
and
of
the
common
life
is
founded
on
prejudice
and
illusion
such
white
light
will
occasionally
seem
hard
and
steely
at
its
approach
they
fear
the
loss
of
the
charm
of
that
twilight
hour
ere
the
day
has
yet
begun
or
before
the
darkness
has
fully
settled
down
thus
the
heart
and
feelings
look
upon
the
intellect
as
an
enemy
of
sentiment
and
plato
himself
is
not
without
anticipations
of
such
an
issue
yet
perhaps
we
may
add
that
the
danger
is
in
part
an
imaginary
one
and
only
arises
because
intelligence
takes
its
task
too
lightly
and
encroaches
beyond
its
proper
ground
philosophy
in
other
words
mistakes
its
place
when
it
sets
itself
up
as
a
dogmatic
system
of
life
its
function
is
to
comprehend
and
from
comprehension
to
criticise
and
through
criticising
to
unify
it
has
no
positive
and
additional
teaching
of
its
own
no
addition
to
the
burden
of
life
and
experience
and
experience
it
must
respect
its
work
is
to
maintain
the
organic
or
superorganic
interconnexion
between
all
the
spheres
of
life
and
all
the
forms
of
reality
it
has
to
prevent
stagnation
and
absorption
of
departmentsto
keep
each
in
its
proper
place
but
not
more
than
its
place
and
yet
to
show
how
each
is
not
independent
of
the
others
and
this
is
what
the
philosopher
or
ancient
sage
would
be
if
he
is
passionless
it
is
not
that
he
has
no
passions
but
that
they
no
longer
perturb
and
mislead
if
his
controlling
spirit
be
reason
it
is
not
the
reason
of
the
socalled
rationalist
but
the
reason
which
seeks
in
patience
to
comprehend
and
to
be
at
home
in
a
world
it
at
first
finds
strange
and
if
he
is
critical
of
others
he
is
still
more
critical
of
himself
critical
however
not
for
criticisms
sake
which
is
but
a
poor
thing
but
because
through
criticism
the
faith
of
reason
may
be
more
fully
justified
to
the
last
if
he
is
true
to
his
mission
and
faithful
to
his
loyalty
to
reality
he
will
have
the
simplicity
of
the
child
whether
therefore
we
agree
or
not
with
platos
reduction
of
right
and
duty
to
selfactualisation
we
may
at
least
admit
that
in
the
idea
of
perfection
or
excellence
combined
with
the
idea
of
knowledge
or
inward
lucidity
he
has
got
the
fundamental
ideas
on
which
further
ethical
development
must
build
selfcontrol
selfknowledge
internal
harmony
are
good
and
so
are
the
development
of
our
several
faculties
and
of
the
totality
of
them
to
the
fullest
pitch
of
excellence
but
their
value
does
not
lie
entirely
in
themselves
or
rather
there
is
implicit
in
them
a
reference
to
something
beyond
themselves
they
take
for
granted
something
which
because
it
is
so
taken
may
also
be
ignored
and
neglected
just
because
it
seems
so
obvious
and
that
implication
is
the
social
humanity
in
which
they
are
the
spirits
of
light
and
leading
to
lay
the
stress
on

or
excellence
tends
to
leave
out
of
sight
the
force
of
duty
and
to
emphasise
knowledge
is
allowed
to
disparage
the
heart
and
feelings
the
mindeven
of
a
philosopherfinds
a
difficulty
in
holding
very
different
points
of
view
in
one
and
where
it
is
forced
from
one
to
another
tends
to
forget
the
earlier
altogether
thus
when
the
ethical
philosopher
presupposing
as
an
absolute
or
unquestionable
fact
that
man
the
individual
was
rooted
in
the
community
proceeded
to
discuss
the
problem
of
the
best
and
completest
individual
estate
he
was
easily
led
to
lose
sight
of
the
fundamental
and
governing
condition
altogether
from
the
moment
that
aristotle
lays
down
the
thesis
that
man
is
naturally
social
to
the
moment
when
he
asks
how
the
bare
ideal
of
excellence
in
character
and
life
can
become
an
actuality
the
community
in
which
man
lives
has
retired
out
of
sight
away
into
the
background
and
it
only
comes
in
as
it
first
appears
as
the
paedagogue
to
bring
us
to
morality
and
plato
though
professedly
he
is
speaking
of
the
community
and
is
well
aware
that
the
individual
can
only
be
saved
by
the
salvation
of
the
community
is
constantly
falling
back
into
another
problemthe
development
of
an
individual
soul
he
feels
the
strength
of
the
egoistic
effort
after
perfection
and
his
essay
in
the
end
tends
to
lose
sight
altogether
of
its
second
theme
instead
of
a
man
he
gives
us
a
mere
philosopher
a
man
that
is
not
living
with
his
countrys
life
instinct
with
the
heart
and
feeling
of
humanity
inspired
by
art
and
religion
but
a
being
set
apart
and
exalted
above
his
fellowscharged
no
doubt
in
theory
with
the
duty
of
saving
them
of
acting
vicariously
as
the
mediator
between
them
and
the
absolute
truthbut
really
tending
more
and
more
to
seclude
himself
on
the
edita
templa
of
the
world
on
the
hightowers
of
speculation
and
what
plato
and
aristotle
did
so
to
speak
against
their
express
purpose
and
effort
yet
did
because
the
force
of
contemporary
tendency
was
irresistiblethat
the
stoa
and
epicurus
did
more
openly
and
professedly
with
a
difference
in
theory
it
is
true
owing
to
the
difference
in
the
surroundings
virtue
in
the
older
day
of
the
free
and
glorious
commonwealth

meant

achievement
acts
done
in
the
public
eye
and
of
course
for
the
public
gooda
good
with
which
the
agent
was
identified
at
least
in
heart
and
soul
if
not
in
his
explicit
consciousness
in
later
and
worse
days
when
the
political
world
with
the
world
divine
had
withdrawn
from
actual
identity
with
the
central
heart
of
the
individual
and
stood
overagainst
him
as
a
strange
power
and
little
better
than
a
nuisance
virtue
came
to
be
counted
as
endurance
indifference
negative
independence
against
a
cold
and
a
perplexing
world
but
even
still
virtue
is

perhaps
it
is
to
note
the
misconception
of

and
knowledge

grew
up

came
more
and
more
to
be
identified
with
the
reflective
and
critical
consciousness
which
is
outside
reality
and
life
and
judges
it
from
a
standpoint
of
its
own
it
came
to
be
esteemed
only
in
its
formal
and
abstract
shape
and
at
the
expense
of
the
heart
and
feelings
the
antithesis
of
philosophy
or
knowledge
strictly
so
called
according
to
plato
was
mere
opinion
accidental
and
imperfect
knowledge
the
knowledge
which
is
truly
valuable
is
a
knowledge
which
presupposes
the
full
reality
of
life
and
is
the
more
and
more
completely
articulated
theory
of
it
as
a
whole

we

in

perfect

of
thought
appetite
and
emotion
or
putting
it
otherwise
the
philosopher
is
one
who
is
not
merely
a
creature
of
appetite
and
production
not
merely
a
creature
of
feeling
and
practical
energy
but
a
creature
who
to
both
of
these
superadds
an
intelligence
which
sets
eyes
in
the
blind
forehead
of
these
other
powers
and
thus
far
from
superseding
them
altogether
only
raises
them
into
completeness

all
that
is
worthy
in
their
implicit
natures

these
two
impulsive
tendencies
of
our
nature
are
guided
by
some
sort
of
ideas
and
intelligence
by
beliefs
and
opinions
but
they
like
their
guides
are
sporadically
emergent
unconnected
and
therefore
apt
to
be
contradictory
it
is
to
such
erratic
and
occasional
ideas

and
deceptions
that

is
opposed

for
all
parties

intimacy

in

often
go
along

that
one

is
the
sacrifice
of

generally

that
all
is

to

that
whatever
presents
discrepancies
with

ruthlessly

a

its

towards
the
path
of

treats
the

the

nature
in
the
former
may
from
time
to
time
offer
the
truth
which
philosophy
should
have
taught
was
that
mind
or
intelligence
was
the
element
where
the
inner
life
culminated
and
expanded
and
flourished
the
error
which
it
often
tended
to
spread
was
that
intelligence
was
the
higher
life
of
which
all
other
was
a
degenerate
shortcoming
and
something
valuable
on
its
own
account
it
may
be
that
thus
to
interpret
plato
is
to
do
him
an
injustice
it
has
been
sometimes
said
that
his
division
of
parts
or
kinds
of
soulor
his
distinction
between
its
fighting
horsestends
to
destroy
the
unity
of
mental
life
but
perhaps
this
was
exactly
what
he
wanted
to
convey
there
arewe
may
paraphrase
his
meaningthree
kinds
of
human
being
three
types
of
human
life
there
is
the
man
or
the
life
of
appetite
and
the
flesh
there
is
the
man
of
noble
emotion
and
energetic
depth
of
soul
there
is
the
life
of
reasonable
pursuits
and
organised
principle
or
we
may
take
his
meaning
to
be
that
there
are
three
elements
or
provinces
of
mental
life
which
in
all
except
a
few
are
but
imperfectly
coherent
and
do
not
reach
a
true
or
complete
unity
some
unity
there
always
is
but
in
the
life
of
mere
appetite
and
impulse
even
when
these
impulses
are
our
nobler
sentiments
of
love
and
hatred
the
unity
falls
very
far
short
or
as
he
puts
the
theme
elsewhere
the
soul
has
a
passion
for
selfcompletion
a
love
of
beauty
which
in
most
is
but
a
misleading
lust
it
is
the
business
of
the
philosophic
life
to
recreate
or
to
foster
this
unity
or
philosophy
is
the
persistent
search
of
the
soul
for
its
lost
unity
the
search
to
see
that
unity
which
is
always
its
animating
principle
its
inner
faith
when
the
soul
has
reached
this
idealif
it
can
be
supposed
to
attain
it
and
of
this
the
strongsouled
ancient
philosophers
feel
no
doubtthen
a
change
must
take
place
the
love
of
beauty
is
not
suppressed
it
is
only
made
selfassured
and
its
object
freed
from
all
imperfection
it
is
not
that
passion
has
ceased
but
its
nature
is
so
transfigured
that
it
seems
worthy
of
a
nobler
name
which
yet
we
cannot
give
to
such
a
life
where
battle
and
conflict
are
as
such
unknown
we
cannot
longer
give
the
title
of
life
and
we
say
that
philosophy
is
in
life
a
rehearsal
of
death70
and
yet
if
there
be
no
battle
there
is
not
for
that
reason
mere
inaction
hence
as
the
republic
concludes
the
true
philosopher
is
the
complete
man
he
is
the
truth
and
reality
which
the
appetitive
and
emotional
man
were
seeking
after
and
failed
to
realise
it
is
true
they
at
first
will
not
see
this
but
the
whole
long
process
of
philosophy
is
the
means
to
induce
this
conviction
and
for
plato
it
remains
clear
that
through
experience
through
wisdom
and
through
abstract
deduction
the
philosopher
will
justify
his
claim
to
him
who
hath
ears
to
hear
and
heart
to
understand
if
that
be
so
the
asceticism
of
plato
is
not
a
mere
war
upon
flesh
and
sense
as
such
but
upon
flesh
and
sense
as
imperfect
truth
fragmentary
reality
which
suppose
themselves
complete
though
they
are
again
and
again
confuted
by
experience
by
wisdom
and
by
mere
calculationa

the
key
says
carus
for
the
ascertainment
of
the
nature
of
the
conscious
psychical
life
lies
in
the
region
of
the
unconscious71
the
view
which
these
words
take
is
at
least
as
old
as
the
days
of
leibniz
it
means
that
the
mental
world
does
not
abruptly
emerge
a
fullgrown
intelligence
but
has
a
genesis
and
follows
a
law
of
development
that
its
life
may
be
described
as
the
differentiation

integration

the
door
wide

misconception
but
they
may
serve
to
mark
that
the
mind
is
to
be
understood
only
in
a
certain
relation
partly
of

indefinite
life
of

which
in
its
turn
fades
away
by
immeasurable
gradations
into
something
irresponsive
to

ordinary
tests
for

the
temptation
of
seeing
things

almost
irresistible
so
in
psychology
we
are
apt
to
import
into
the
life
of
sensation

feeling
the
distinctions
and
relations
of
subsequent
intellection

we
further
go
on
to

that
the

an
addition

real
variety
separation
and
discontinuity
of
parts
must
be
reduced
to
unity
and
identity
or
as
hegel
would
say
to
ideality
to
live
is
thus
to
keep
all
differences
fluid
and
permeable
in
the
fire
of
the
lifeprocess
or
to
use
a
familiar
term
of
logic
the
soul
is
the
concept
or
intelligible
unity
of
the
organic
body
but
to
call
it
a
concept
might
suggest
that
it
is
only
the
conception
through
which
we
represent
to
ourselves
the
variety
in
unity
of
the
organism
the
soul
however
is
more
than
a
mere
concept
and
life
is
more
than
a
mere
mode
of
description
for
a
group
of
movements
forming
an
objective
unity
it
is
a
unity
subjective
and
objective
the
organism
is
one
life
controlling
difference
and
it
is
also
one
by
our
effort
to
comprehend
it
the
soul
therefore
is
in
hegelian
language
described
as
the
idea
rather
than
the
concept
of
the
organic
body
life
is
the
generic
title
for
this
subjectobject
but
the
life
may
be
merely
physical
or
it
may
be
intellectual
and
practical
or
it
may
be
absolute
ie
will
and
know
all
that
it
is
and
be
all
that
it
knows
and
wills
up
to
this
point
the
world
is
what
is
called
an
external
which
is
here
taken
to
mean
not
a
world
external
to
the
individual
but
a
selfexternalised
world
that
is
to
say
it
is
the
observer
who
has
hitherto
by
his
interpretation
of
his
perceptions
supplied
the
spirit
in
nature
in
itself
the
external
world
has
no
inside
no
centre
it
is
we
who
read
into
it
the
conception
of
a
lifehistory
we
are
led
to
believe
that
a
principle
of
unity
is
always
at
work
throughout
the
physical
worldeven
in
the
mathematical
laws
of
natural
operation
it
is
only
intelligible
and
credible
to
us
as
a
system
a
continuous
and
regular
development
but
that
system
is
only
a
hypothetical
idea
though
it
is
held
to
be
a
conclusion
to
which
all
the
evidence
seems
unequivocally
to
point
and
even
in
organic
life
the
unity
though
more
perfect
and
palpable
than
in
the
mechanical
and
inorganic
world
is
only
a
perception
a
visiona
necessary
mode
of
realising
the
unity
of
the
facts
the
phenomenon
of
life
reveals
as
in
a
picture
and
an
ocular
demonstration
the
conformity
of
inward
and
outward
the
identity
of
whole
and
parts
of
power
and
utterance
but
it
is
still
outside
the
observer
in
the
function
of
sensibility
and
sentiency
however
we
stand
as
it
were
on
the
borderline
between
biology
and
psychology
at
one
step
we
have
been
brought
within
the
harmony
and
are
no
longer
mere
observers
and
reflecters
the
sentient
not
merely
is
but
is
aware
that
it
is
hitherto
as
life
it
only
is
the
unity
in
diversity
and
diversity
in
unity
for
the
outsider
ie
only
implicitly
now
it
is
so
for
itself
or
consciously
and
in
the
first
stage
it
does
not
know
but
feels
or
is
sentient
here
for
the
first
time
is
created
the
distinction
of
inward
and
outward
loosely
indeed
we
may
like
mr
spencer
speak
of
outward
and
inward
in
physiology
but
strictly
speaking
what
goethe
says
is
true
natur
hat
weder
kern
noch
schaale73
nature
in
the
narrower
sense
knows
no
distinction
of
the
inward
and
outward
in
its
phenomena
it
is
a
purely
superficial
order
and
succession
of
appearance
and
event
the
idea
which
has
been
visible
to
an
intelligent
percipient
in
the
types
and
laws
of
the
natural
world
now
is
actually
isis
in
and
for
itselfbut
at
first
in
a
minimum
of
content
a
mere
point
of
light
or
rather
the
dawn
which
has
yet
to
expand
into
the
full
day
spinoza
has
asserted
that
all
individual
bodies
are
animate
though
in
different
degrees74
now
it
is
to
a
great
extent
this
diversity
of
degree
on
which
the
main
interest
turns
yet
it
is
well
to
remember
that
the
abrupt
and
trenchant
separations
which
popular
practice
loves
are
overridden
to
a
deeper
view
by
an
essential
unity
of
idea
reducing
them
to
indifference
if
that
is
we
take
seriously
the
spinozist
unity
of
substance
and
the
continual
correlation
to
call
it
no
more
of
extension
and
consciousness
therein
we
cannot
avoid
the
conclusion
which
even
bacon
would
admit
of
something
describable
as
attraction
and
perception
something
subduing
diversity
to
unity
but
whether
it
be
well
to
name
this
soul
or
life
is
a
different
matter
it
may
indeed
only
be
taken
to
mean
that
all
true
being
must
be
looked
on
as
a
real
unity
and
individuality
must
that
is
be
conceived
as
manifesting
itself
in
organisation
must
be
referred
to
a
selfcentred
and
selfdeveloping
activity
but
thiswhich
is
the
fundamental
thesis
of
idealismis
hardly
all
that
is
meant
rather
spinoza
would
imply
that
all
things
which
form
a
real
unity
must
have
lifemust
have
inner
principle
and
unifying
reality
and
what
he
teaches
is
closely
akin
to
the
leibnitian
doctrine
that
every
substantial
existence
reposes
upon
a
monad
a
unity
which
is
at
once
both
a
force
and
a
cognition
a
representation
and
an
appetite
or
nisus
to
act
when
fechner
in
a
series
of
works75
expounds
and
defends
the
hypothesis
that
plants
and
planets
are
not
destitute
of
soul
any
more
than
man
and
animals
he
only
gives
a
more
pronounced
expression
to
this
idealisation
or
spiritualisation
of
the
natural
world
but
for
the
moment
the
point
to
be
noted
is
that
all
of
this
idealistic
doctrine
is
an
inference
or
a
development
which
finds
its
point
dappui
in
the
fact
of
sensation
and
the
problem
of
the
philosophy
of
mind
is
just
to
trace
the
process
whereby
a
mere
shock
of
sensation
has
grown
into
a
conception
and
a
faith
in
the
goodness
beauty
and
intelligence
of
the
world
schopenhauer
has
put
the
point
with
his
usual
picturesqueness
outward
nature
presents
nothing
but
a
play
of
forces
at
first
however
this
force
shows
merely
the
mechanical
phenomena
of
pressure
and
impact
and
its
theory
is
sufficiently
described
by
mathematical
physics
but
in
the
process
of
nature
force
assumes
higher
types
types
where
it
loses
a
certain
amount
of
its
externality76
till
in
the
organic
world
it
acquires
a
peculiar
phase
which
schopenhauer
calls
will
meaning
by
that
however
an
organising
and
controlling
power
a
tendency
or
nisus
to
be
and
live
which
is
persistent
and
potent
but
without
consciousness
this
blind
force
which
however
has
a
certain
coherence
and
purposiveness
is
in
the
animal
organism
endowed
with
a
new
character
in
consequence
of
the
emergence
of
a
new
organ
this
organ
the
brain
and
nervous
system
causes
the
evolution
into
clear
day
of
an
element
which
has
been
growing
more
and
more
urgent
the
gathering
tendency
of
force
to
return
into
itself
is
now
complete
the
cycle
of
operation
is
formed
and
the
junction
of
the
two
currents
issues
in
the
spark
of
sensation
the
blind
force
now
becomes
seeing
but
at
firstand
this
is
the
point
we
have
to
emphasiseits
powers
of
vision
are
limited
sensibility
is
either
a
local
and
restricted
phenomenon
or
in
so
far
as
it
is
not
local
it
is
vague
and
indefinite
and
hardly
entitled
to
the
name
of
sensibility
either
it
is
a
dim
but
farreaching
sympathy
with
environing
existence
and
in
that
case
only
socalled
blind
will
or
feeling
or
if
it
is
clear
is
locally
confined
and
at
first
within
very
narrow
limits
neither
of
these
points
must
be
lost
sight
of
on
the
one
hand
feeling
has
to
be
regarded
as
the
dull
and
confused
stirring
of
an
almost
infinite
sympathy
with
the
worlda
pulse
which
has
come
from
the
fardistant
movements
of
the
universe
and
bears
with
it
if
but
as
a
possibility
the
wealth
of
an
infinite
message
on
the
other
hand
feeling
at
first
only
becomes
real
in
this
boundless
ideality
to
which
its
possibilities
extend
by
restricting
itself
to
one
little
point
and
from
several
points
organising
itself
to
a
unity
of
bodily
feeling
till
it
can
go
on
from
thence
to
embrace
the
universe

distinct
and
articulate
comprehension

life77
there
were
ancient
philosophers
who
spoke
of
the
soul
as
a
selfadjusting
numberas
a
harmony
or
equilibrium78and
the
moderns
have
added
considerably
to
the
list
of
these
analogical
definitions
as
definitions
they
obviously
fall
short
yet
these
things
give
as
it
were
by
anticipation
an
image
of
soul
as
the
ideality
which
reduces
the
manifold
to
unity
the
adhesions
and
cohesions
of
matter
its
gravitating
attractions
its
chemical
affinities
and
electrical
polarities
the
intricate
outandin
of
organic
structure
are
all
preludes
to
the
true
incorporating
unity
which
is
the
everimmanent
supersession
of
the
endless
selfexternalism
and
successionalism
of
physical
reality
but
in
sentiency
feeling
or
sensibility
the
unity
which
all
of
these
imply
without
reaching
is
explicitly
present
it
is
implicitly
an
allembracing
unity
an
infinitewhich
has
no
doors
and
no
windows
for
the
good
reason
that
it
needs
none
because
it
has
nothing
outside
it
because
it
expresses
and
envelopes
however
confusedly
at
first
the
whole
universe
thus
even
if
with
localising
phraseology
we
may
describe
mind
where
it
appears
emerging
in
the
natural
world
as
a
mere
feeble

realmwe
are
in
so
speaking
taking
only
an
external
standpoint
but
with
the
rise
of
mind
in
nature
the
bond
of
externalism

implicitly
overcome

it

where
it
really

it
is
easy
no
doubt
to
ignore
or
forget
them
easy
to
remark
how
indefinable
and
incalculable
they
are
but
that
does
not
lessen
their
radical
and
inevitable
impress
in
the
determination
of
the
whole
character
the
sum
of
our
existence
divided
by
reason
never
comes
out
exact
but
always
leaves
a
marvellous
remainder80
irrational
this
residue
is
in
the
sense
that
it
is
inexplicable
and
incommensurable
with
the
wellknown
quantities
of
conscious
and
voluntarily
organised
life
but
a
scientific
psychology
which
is
adequate
to
the
real
and
concrete
mind
should
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
every
one
of
its
propositions
in
regard
to
the
more
advanced
phases
of
intellectual
development
is
thoroughly
and
in
indefinable
ways
modified
by
these
preconditions
when
that
is
remembered
it
will
be
obvious
how
complicated
is
the
problem
of
adapting
psychology
for
the
application
to
education
and
how
dependent
the
solution
of
that
problem
is
upon
an
experiential
familiarity
with
the
data
of
individual
and
national
temperament
and
character
the
first
stage
in
mental
development
is
the
establishment
of
regular
and
uniform
relations
between
soul
and
body
it
is
the
differentiation
of
organs
and
the
integration
of
function
the
balance
between
sensation
and
movement
between
the
afferent
and
efferent
processes
of
sensitivity
given
a
potential
soul
the
problem
is
to
make
it
actual
in
an
individual
body
it
is
the
business
of
a
physical
psychology
to
describe
in
detail
the
steps
by
which
the
body
we
are
attached
to
is
made
inward
as
our
idea
through
the
several
organs
and
their
nervous
appurtenances
whereas
a
psychical
physiology
would
conversely
explain
the
corresponding
processes
for
the
expression
of
the
emotions
and
for
the
objectification
of
the
volitions
thus
soul
inwardises
erinnert
or
envelops
body
which
body
expresses
or
develops
soul
the
actual
soul
is
the
unity
of
both
is
the
percipient
individual
the
solidarity
or
communion
of
body
and
soul
is
here
the
dominant
fact
the
soul
sentient
of
changes
in
its
peripheral
organs
and
transmitting
emotion
and
volition
into
physical
effect
it
is
on
this
psychical
unitythe
unity
which
is
the
soul
of
the
diversity
of
bodythat
all
the
subsequent
developments
of
mind
rest
sensation
is
thus
the
priusor
basisof
all
mental
life
the
organisation
of
soul
in
body
and
of
body
in
soul
it
is
the
process
which
historically
has
been
prepared
in
the
evolution
of
animal
life
from
those
undifferentiated
forms
where
specialised
organs
are
yet
unknown
and
which
each
individual
has
further
to
realise
and
complete
for
himself
by
learning
to
see
and
hear
and
use
his
limbs
at
first
moreover
it
begins
from
many
separate
centres
and
only
through
much
collision
and
mutual
compliance
arrives
at
comparative
uniformity
and
centralisation
the
common
basis
of
united
sensibility
supplied
by
the
one
organism
has
to
be
made
real
and
effective
and
it
is
so
at
first
by
sporadic
and
comparatively
independent
developments
if
selfhood
means
reference
to
self
of
what
is
prima
facie
not
self
and
projection
of
self
therein
there
is
in
primitive
sensibility
only
the
germ
or
possibility
of
selfhood
in
the
early
phases
of
psychic
development
the
centre
is
fluctuating
and
illdefined
and
it
takes
time
and
trouble
to
coordinate
or
unify
the
various
startingpoints
of
sensibility81
this
consolidation
of
inward
life
may
be
looked
at
either
formally
or
concretely
under
the
first
head
it
means
the
growth
of
a
central
unity
of
apperception
in
the
second
case
it
means
a
peculiar
aggregate
of
ideas
and
sentiments
there
is
growing
up
within
him
what
we
may
call
the
individuality
of
the
individualan
irrational
ie
not
consciously
intelligent
netherself
or
inner
soul
a
firm
aggregation
of
hopes
and
wishes
of
views
and
feelings
or
rather
of
tendencies
and
temperament
of
character
hereditary
and
acquired
it
is
the
law
of
the
natural
will
or
character
which
from
an
inaccessible
background
dominates
our
actionwhich
because
it
is
not
realised
and
formulated
in
consciousness
behaves
like
a
guardian
spirit
or
genius
or
destiny
within
us
this
genius
is
the
subconscious
unity
of
the
sensitive
lifethe
manner
of
man
which
unknown
to
ourselves
we
areand
which
influences
us
against
our
nominal

formal
purposes
so

as
this
predominates
our
ends

given
by
a
force
which
is
not

with
full
consciousness
ours
by
a
mass
of
ingrained
prejudice
and
unreasoned
sympathies
of
instincts
and
passions
of
fancies
and
feelings
which
have
condensed
and
organised
themselves
into
a
natural
power
as
the
child
in
the
mothers
womb
is
responsive
to
her
psychic
influences
so
the
development
of
a
mans
psychic

is
guided
by
feelings
centred
in
objects
and
agents

the

what

customary
and
familiar
an
identification
which
takes
place
by

repetition
if
it
circumscribes
us
to
one
little
province

us
from
the
vague
indeterminateness
where
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
every
passing
mood
it

thus
much
of
our
potential
selves
our
very
own
our
acquisition
and
permanent
possession
it
above
all
makes
us
free
and
at
one
with
our
bodily
part
so
that
henceforth
we
start
as
a
subjective
unit
of
body
and
soul
we
have
now
as
the
result
of
the
anthropological
process
a
self
or
ego
an
individual
consciousness
able
to
reflect

setting
itself

side
a

organisation
and
on
the
other
setting
an
object
of
consciousness
or
external
world
a
world
of
other
things
all
this
presupposes
that
the
soul
has
actualised
itself
by
appropriating
and
acquiring
as
its
expression
and
organ
the
physical
sensibility
which
is
its
body
by
restricting
and
establishing
itself
it
has
gained
a
fixed
standpoint
no
doubt
it
has
localised
and
confined
itself
but
it
is
no
longer
at
the
disposal
of
externals
and

it

anomalies
of

psychology
as
we
have
seen
goes
for
information
regarding
the
earlier
stages
of
mental
growth
to
the
child
and
the
animalperhaps
also
to
the
savage
so
too
sociology
founds
certain
conclusions
upon
the
observations
of
savage
customs
and
institutions
or
on
the
earlier
records
of
the
race
in
both
cases
with
a
limitation
caused
by
the
externality
and
fragmentariness
of
the
facts
and
the
need
of
interpreting
them
through
our
own
conscious
experiences
there
is
however
another
direction
in
which
corresponding
inquiries
may
be
pursued
and
where
the
danger
of
the
conclusions
arrived
at
though
not
perhaps
less
real
is
certainly
of
a
different
kind
in
sociology
we
can
observeand
almost
experiment
uponthe
phenomena
of
the
lapsed
degenerate
and
criminal
classes
the
advantage
of
such
observation
is
that
the
object
of
study
can
be
made
to
throw
greater
light
on
his
own
inner
states
he
is
a
little
of
the
child
and
a
little
of
the
savage
but
these
aspects
coexist
with
other
features
which
put
him
more
on
a
level
with
the
intelligent
observer
similar
pathological
regions
are
open
to
us
in
the
case
of
psychology
there
the
anomalous
and
morbid
conditions
of
mind
coexist
with
a
certain
amount
of
mature
consciousness
so

they
are
thrown
out
into

they
form

even
amongst

could
cure

that
baffled
the

because
of
the

mesmer
actually
employed
a
magnet
in
the
manipulation
by
which
he
induced
the
peculiar
condition
in
his
patients
the
accompaniments
of
his
procedure
were
in
many
respects
those
of
the
quackdoctor
and
with
the
quack
indeed
he
was
often
classed
a
french
commission
of
inquiry
appointed
to
examine
into
his
performances
reported
in
1784
that
while
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
reality
of
many
of
the
phenomena
and
even
of
the
cures
there
was
no
evidence
for
the
alleged
new
physical
force
and
declared
the
effects
to
be
mainly
attributable
to
the
influence
of
imagination

with

supposed

in

political
excitement
allowed
the
mesmeric
theory
and
practice
to
drop
out
of
notice
till
the
fall
of
the
first
empire
but
in
germany
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
investigations
and
hypotheses
into
these
mystical
phenomena
though
rarely
by
the
ordinary
routine
workers
in
the
scientific
field
the
phenomena
where
they
were
discussed
were
studied
and
interpreted
in
two
directions
some
theorists
like
jungstilling
eschenmayer
schubert
and
kerner
took
the
more
metaphysicist
and
spiritualistic
view
they
saw
in
them
the
witness
to
a
higher
truth
to
the
presence
and
operation
in
this
lower
world
of
a
higher
and
spiritual
matter
a
socalled
ether
thus
animal
magnetism
supplied
a
sort
of
physical
theory
of
the
other
world
and
the
other
life
jungstilling
eg
in
his
theory
of
spiritlore
1808
regarded
the
spiritualistic
phenomena
as
a
justification
ofwhat
he
believed
to
bethe
kantian
doctrine
that
in
the
truly
real
and
persistent
world
space
and
time
are
no
more
the
other
direction
of
inquiry
kept
more
to
the
physical
field
ritter
whose
researches
interested
both
schelling
and
hegel
supposed
he
had
detected
the
new
force
underlying
mesmerism
and
the
like
and
gave
to
it
the
name
of
siderism

kieser85
again
1826
spoke
of
tellurism
and
connected
animal
magnetism
with
the
play
of
general
terrestrial
forces

of

around
which
revolves

gathers
the

the

has
its
feelers

which
set

in

with

however
distant
exerted
by
the
whole

through
this

serves
to
concentrate
in

in

phenomena

into
the

of

there
is
the
feeling
of
a
double
personality
or
of
an
indwelling
genius
familiar
spirit
or
demon
to
the
ordinary
physicist
the
socalled
actio
in
distans
was
a
hopeless
stumblingblock
if
he
did
not
comprehend
the
transmission
as
it
is
called
of
force
where
there
was
immediate
contact
he
was
at
least
perfectly
familiar
with
the
outer
aspect
of
it
as
a
condition
of
his
limited
experience
it
needed
one
beyond
the
mere
hodman
of
science
to
say
with
laplace
we
are
so
far
from
knowing
all
the
agents
of
nature
that
it
would
be
very
unphilosophical
to
deny
the
existence
of
phenomena
solely
because
they
are
inexplicable
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
accordingly
mesmerism
and
its
allied
manifestations
were
generally
abandoned
to
the
bohemians
of
science
and
to
investigators
with
dogmatic
bias
it
was
still
employed
as
a
treatment
for
certain
ailments
and
philosophers
as
different
as
fichte
and
schopenhauer86
watched
its
fate
with
attention
but
the
herd
of
professional
scientists
fought
shy
of
it
the
experiments
of
braid
at
manchester
in
1841
gradually
helped
to
give
research
into
the
subject
a
new
character
under
the
name
of
hypnotism
or
rather
at
first
neurohypnotism
he
described
the
phenomena
of
the
magnetic
sleep
induced
through
prolonged
staring
at
a
bright
object
such
as
abnormal
rigidity
of
body
perverted
sensibility
and
the
remarkable
obedience
of
the
subject
to
the
command
or
suggestions
of
the
operator
thirty
years
afterwards
the
matter
became
an
object
of
considerable
experimental
and
theoretic
work
in
france
at
the
rival
schools
of
paris
and
nancy
and
the
question
mainly
under
the
title
of
hypnotism
though
the
older
name
is
still
occasionally
heard
has
been
for
several
years
brought
prominently
under
public
notice
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
net
results
of
these
observations
and
hypotheses
are
of
a
very
definitive
character
while
a
large
amount
of
controversy
has
been
waged
on
the
comparative
importance
of
the
several
methods
and
instruments
by
which
the
hypnotic
or
mesmeric
trance
may
be
induced
and
a
scarcely
less
wide
range
of
divergence
prevails
with
regard
to
the
physiological
and
pathological
conditions
in
connexion
with
which
it
has
been
most
conspicuously
manifested
there
has
been
less
anxiety
shown
to
determine
its
precise
psychical
nature
or
its
significance
in
mental
development
and
yet
the
better
understanding
of
these
aspects
may
throw
light
on
several
points
connected
with
primitive
religion
and
the
history
of
early
civilisation
indeed
over
the
whole
range
of
what
is
called
vlkerpsychologie
indeed
this
is
one
of
the
points
which
may
be
said
to
emerge
out
of
the
confusion
of
dispute
phenomena
at
least
analogous
to
those
styled
hypnotic
have
a
wide
range
in
the
anthropological
sphere87
and
the
proper
characters
which
belong
to
them
will
only
be
caught
by
an
observer
who
examines
them
in
the
widest
variety
of
examples
another
feature
which
has
been
put
in
prominence
is
what
has
been
called
psychological
automatism
and
in
this
name
two
points
seem
to
deserve
note
the
first
is
the
spontaneous
and
as
it
were
mechanical
consecution
of
mental
states
in
the
soul
whence
the
interfering
effect
of
voluntary
consciousness
has
been
removed
and
the
second
is
the
unfailing
or
accurate
regularity
so
contrary
to
the
hesitating
and
uncertain
procedure
of
our
conscious
and
reasoned
action
which
so
often
is
seen
in
the
unreflecting
and
unreasoned
movements
to
this
invariable
sequence
of
psychical
movement
the
superior
control
and
direction
by
the
intelligent
self
has
to
adapt
itself
just
as
it
respects
the
order
of
physical
laws
but
perhaps
the
chief
conclusion
to
be
derived
from
hypnotic
experience
is
the
value
of
suggestion
or
suggestibility
even
cool
thinkers
like
kant
have
recognised
how
much
mere
mental
control
has
to
do
with
bodily
statehow
each
of
us
in
this
way
is
often
for
good
or
for
ill
his
own
physician
an
idea
is
a
force
and
is
only
inactive
in
so
far
as
it
is
held
in
check
by
other
ideas
there
is
no
such
thing
as
hypnotism
says
one
there
are
only
different
degrees
of
suggestibility
this
may
be
to
exaggerate
yet
it
serves
to
impress
the
comparatively
secondary
character
of
many
of
the
circumstances
on
which
the
specially
mesmeric
or
hypnotic
experimentalist
is
apt
to
lay
exclusive
stress
the
methods
may
probably
vary
according
to
circumstances
but
the
essence
of
them
all
is
to
get
the
patient
out
of
the
general
frame
and
system
of
ideas
and
perceptions
in
which
his
ordinary
individuality
is
encased
considering
how
for
all
of
us
the
reality
of
concrete
life
is
bound
up
with
our
visual
perceptions
how
largely
our
sanity
depends
upon
the
spatial
idea
and
how
that
depends
on
free
ocular
range
we
can
understand
that
darkness
and
temporary
loss
of
vision
are
powerful
auxiliaries
in
the
hypnotic
process
as
in
magical
and
superstitious
rites
but
a
great
deal
short
of
this
may
serve
to
establish
influence
the
mind
of
the
majority
of
human
beings
but
especially
of
the
young
may
be
compared
to
a
vacant
seat
waiting
for
some
one
to
fill
it

kind
of
temporary
and
artificial
atavism

or
chemical
means

may
cause
even
for
the
intelligent
adult
a
relapse
into
states
of
mind
closely
resembling
those
exhibited
by

primitive

the
infantile
sensibility

that
it

that

avails
in
its
subterranean

it
creates
a

of
inner

all
the
unrevealed

chambers
of
the
flesh
but
always
their
vision
seems
confined

that
region

will
fall
short
of

chiefly
sees
in

their
indication
even
on

it

beyond
the
recognised
limits
of
sensation
and

so
far
as
it
implies
lucid
vision
with

is
because
these
things
seem
to
show
the
essential
ideality
of
matter
that
hegel
is
interested
in
them
the
ordinary
conditions
of
consciousness
and
even
of
practical
life
in
society
are
a
derivative
and
secondary
state
a
product
of
processes
of
individualism
which
however
are
never
completed
and
leave
a
large
margin
for
idealising
intelligence
to
fulfil
from
a
state
which
is
not

to

more

the

so
fichte
too
had
regarded
the
power
of
the
somnambulist
as
laying
open
a
world
underlying
the
development
of
egoity
and
selfconsciousness89
the
merely
sensuous
man
is
still
in
somnambulism
only
a
somnambulism
of
waking
hours
the
true
waking
is
the
life
in
god
to
be
free
in
him
all
else
is
sleep
and
dream
egoity
he
adds
is
a
merely
formal
principle
utterly
and
never
qualitative
ie
the
essence
and
universal
force
for
schopenhauer
too
the
experiences
of
animal
magnetism
had
seemed
to
prove
the
absolute
supernatural
power
of
the
radical
will
in
its
superiority
to
the
intellectual
categories
of
space
time
and
causal
sequence
to
prove
the
reality
of
the
metaphysical
which
is
at
the
basis
of
all
conscious
divisions
iii
the
development
of
inner
freedom
the
result
of
the
first
range
in
the
process
of
psychogenesis
was
to
make
the
body
a
sign
and
utterance
of
the
soul
with
a
fixed
and
determinate
type
the
anthropological
process
has
defined
and
settled
the
mere
general
sentiency
of
soul
into
an
individualised
shape
a
localised
and
limited
self
a
bundle
of
habits
it
has
made
the
soul
an
ego
or
self
a
power
which
looks
out
upon
the
world
as
a
spectator
lifted
above
immanence
in
the
general
tide
of
being
but
only
so
lifted
because
it
has
made
itself
one
in
the
world
of
objects
a
thing
among
things
the
mind
has
reached
the
point
of
view
of
reflection
instead
of
a
general
identifiability
with
all
nature
it
has
encased
itself
in
a
limited
range
from
which
it
looks
forth
on
what
is
now
other
than
itself
if
previously
it
was
mere
inward
sensibility
it
is
now
sense
perceptive
of
an
object
here
and
now
of
an
external
world
the
step
has
involved
some
price
and
that
price
is
that
it
has
attained
independence
and
selfhood
at
the
cost
of
surrendering
the
content
it
had
hitherto
held
in
one
with
itself
it
is
now
a
blank
receptivity
open
to
the
impressions
of
an
outside
world
and
the
changes
which
take
place
in
its
process
of
apprehension
seem
to
it
to
be
given
from
outside
the
world
it
perceives
is
a
world
of
isolated
and
independent
objects
and
it
takes
them
as
they
are
given
but
a
closer
insistance
on
the
perception
develops
the
implicit
intelligence
which
makes
it
possible
the
percipient
mind
is
no
mere
recipiency
or
susceptibility
with
its
forms
of
time
and
space
it
is
spontaneously
active
it
is
the
source
of
categories
or
is
an
apperceptive
poweran
understanding
consciousness
thus
discovered
to
be
a
creative
or
constructive
faculty
is
strictly
speaking
selfconsciousness90
selfconsciousness
appears
at
first
in
the
selfish
or
narrowly
egoistic
form
of
appetite
and
impulse
the
intelligence
which
claims
to
mould
and
construe
the
world
of
objectswhich
in
kants
phrase
professes
to
give
us
natureis
implicitly
the
lord
of
that
world
and
that
supremacy
it
carries
out
as
appetiteas
destruction
the
self
is
but
a
bundle
of
wantsits
supremacy
over
things
is
really
subjection
to
them
the
satisfaction
of
appetite
is
baffled
by
a
new
desire
which
leaves
it
as
it
was
before
the
development
of
selfconsciousness
to
a
more
adequate
shape
is
represented
by
hegel
as
taking
place
through
the
social
struggle
for
existence
human
beings
too
are
in
the
first
instance
to
the
uninstructed
appetite
or
the
primitive
selfconsciousness
which
is
simply
a
succession
of
individual
desires
for
satisfaction
of
natural
want
only
thingsadjectival
to
that
selfs

to
them
too
his
primary
relation
is
to
appropriate
and
master
them
might
precedes
right
but
the
social
struggle
for
existence
forces
him
to
recognise
something
other
which
is
kindred
to
himselfa
limiting
principle
another
self
which
has
to
form
an
element
in
his
calculations
not
to
be
neglected
and
gradually
we
may
suppose
the
result
is
the
division
of
humanity
into
two
levels
a
ruling
lordly
class
and
a
class
of
slavesa
state
of
inequality
in
which
each
knows
that
his
appetite
is
in
some
measure
checked
by
a
more
or
less
permanent
other
lastly
perhaps
soonest
in
the
inferior
order
there
is
fashioned
the
perception
that
its
selfseeking
in
its
isolated
appetites
is
subject
to
an
abiding
authority
a
continuing
consciousness
there
grows
up
a
social
selfa
sense
of
general
humanity
and
solidarity
with

thus
man
beginning
as
a

single
objects
in

and
as
an
appetitive
self
bent
upon

gratifications
has
ended
as
a
rational
beinga
consciousness
purged
of
its
selfishness
and
isolation
looking
forward
openly
and
impartially
on
the
universe
of
things
and
beings
he
has
ceased
to
be
a
mere
animal
swallowed
up
in
the
moment
and
the
individual
using
his
intelligence
only
in
selfish
satisfactions
he
is
no
longer
bound
down
by
the
struggle
for
existence
looking
on
everything
as
a
mere
thing
a
mere
means
he
has
erected
himself
above
himself
and
above
his
environment
but
that
because
he
occupies
a
point
of
view
at
which
he
and
his
environment
are
no
longer
purely
antithetical
and
exclusive91
he
has
reached
what
is
really
the
moral
standpoint
the
point
ie
at
which
he
is
inspired
by
a
universal
selfconsciousness
and
lives
in
that
peaceful
world
where
the
antitheses
of
individualities
and
of
outward
and
inward
have
ceased
to
trouble
the
natural
man
says
hegel92
sees
in
the
woman
flesh
of
his
flesh
the
moral
and
spiritual
man
sees
spirit
of
his
spirit
in
the
moral
and
spiritual
being
and
by
its
means
hitherto
we
have
been
dealing
with
something
falling
below
the
full
truth
of
mind
the
region
of
immediate
sensibility
with
its
thorough
immersion
of
mind
in
body
first
of
all
and
secondly
its
gradual
progress
to
a
general
standpoint
it
is
only
in
the
third
part
of
subjective
mind
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
psychology
of
a
being
who
in
the
human
sense
knows
and
wills
ie
apprehends
general
truth
and
carries
out
ideal
purposes
thus
for
the
third
time
but
now
on
a
higher
plane
that
of
intelligence
and
rationality
is
traced
the
process
of
development
or
realisation
by
which
reason
becomes
reasoned
knowledge
and
rational
will
a
free
or
autonomous
intelligence
and
as
before
the
startingpoint
alike
in
theoretical
and
practical
mind
is
feelingor
immediate
knowledge
and
immediate
sense
of
ought
the
basis
of
thought
is
an
immediate
perceptiona
sensuous
affection
or
given
something
and
the
basis
of
the
idea
of
a
general
satisfaction
is
the
natural
claim
to
determine
the
outward
existence
conformably
to
individual
feeling
in
intelligent
perception
or
intuition
the
important
factor
is
attention
which
raises
it
above
mere
passive
acceptance
and
awareness
of
a
given
fact
attention
thus
involves
on
one
hand
the
externality
of
its
object
and
on
the
other
affirms
its
dependence
on
the
act
of
the
subject
it
sets
the
objects
before
and
out
of
itself
in
space
and
time
but
yet
in
so
doing
it
shows
itself
master
of
the
objects
if
perception
presuppose
attention
in
short
they
cease
to
be
wholly
outward
we
make
them
ours
and
the
space
and
time
they
fill
are
projected
by
us
so
attended
to
they
are
appropriated
inwardised
and
recollected
they
take
their
place
in
a
mental
place
and
mental
time
they
receive
a
general
or
deindividualised
character
in
the
memoryimage
these
are
retained
as
mental
property
but
retained
actually
only
in
so
far
they
are
revivable
and
revived
such
revival
is
the
work
of
imagination
working
by
the
socalled
laws
of
association
but
the
possession
of
its
ideas
thus
inwardised
and
recollected
by
the
mind
is
largely
a
matter
of
chance
the
mind
is
not
really
fully
master
of
them
until
it
has
been
able
to
give
them
a
certain
objectivity
by
replacing
the
mental
image
by
a
vocal
ie
a
sensible
sign
by
means
of
words
intelligence
turns
its
ideas
or
representations
into

are

but
they
are

which
completely
lose
themselves
in
their
meaning

they
render
possible
that
verbal
memory
which
is
the
handmaid
of
thought
but
which
also
as
merely
mechanical
can

altogether
out

an

at

only
a

in

the
working
of
that

we
think
in

not
in

in
terms
which
only
serve
as

for

the

what
can
be
called
will
at
first
indeed
its
material
may
be
found
as
immediately
given
and
all
its
volitionality
may
lie
in
the
circumstance
that
the
intelligent
being
sets
this
forward
as
a
governing
and
controlling
ought
its
vehicle
in
short
may
be
mere
impulse
or
inclination
and
even

but
it
is
the
choice
and
the
purposive
adoption
of
means
to
the
given
end
gradually
it
attains
to
the
idea
of
a
general
satisfaction
or
of
happiness
and
this
end
seems
positive
and
definite
it
soon
turns
out
however
to
be
little
but
a
prudent
and
selfdenying
superiority
to
particular
passions
and
inclinations
in
the
interest
of
a
comprehensive
ideal
the
free
will
or
intelligence
has
so
far
only
a
negative
and
formal
value
it
is
the
perfection
of
an
autonomous
and
freely
selfdeveloping
mind
such
a
mind
which
in
language
has
acquired
the

superior

physical

the

all
the

existence
but
as
it
is
easier
to
discover

to

the

easily
fall
into
the
mistake
of
letting
individual

obscure
the

of

itself
the

is
no
ideal
work
of

it
stands
in
the

world
in
the

that
is
of
arbitrary

accident
and
error
and
a
variety
of

may
mar
the
regularity
of

the
ugliest

the

a

a

is
after
all
a
living

the
affirmative
life
subsists
in
spite
of
the
defect
and
this
affirmative
is
here
the
theme93
it
is
the
theme
of
philosophy
he
adds
to
ascertain
the
substance
which
is
immanent
in
the
show
of
the
temporal
and

and
the
eternal
which
is
present
i
hegel
as
a
political
critic
but
if
this
is
true
it
is
also
to
be
remembered
that
the
philosopher
is
like
other
men
the
son
of
his
age
and
estimates
the
value
of
reality
from
preconceptions
and
aspirations
due
to
his
generation
the
historical
circumstances
of
his
nation
as
well
as
the
personal
experiences
of
his
life
help
to
determine
his
horizon
even
in
the
effort
to
discover
the
hidden
pulse
and
movement
of
the
social
organism
this
is
specially
obvious
in
political
philosophy
the
conception
of
ethics
and
politics
which
is
presented
in
the
encyclopaedia
was
in
1820
produced
with
more
detail
as
the
grundlinien
der
philosophie
des
rechts
appearing
as
it
did
two
years
after
his
appointment
to
a
professorship
at
berlin
and
in
the
midst
of
a
political
struggle
between
the
various
revolutionary
and
conservative
powers
and
parties
of
germany
the
book
became
and
long
remained
a
target
for
embittered
criticism
the
socalled
war
of
liberation
or
national
movement
to
shake
off
the
french
yoke
was
due
to
a
coalition
of
parties
and
had
naturally
been
in
part
supported
by
tendencies
and
aims
which
went
far
beyond
the
ostensive
purpose
either
of
leaders
or
of
combatants
aspirations
after
a
freer
state
were
entwined
with
radical
and
socialistic
designs
to
reform
the
political
hierarchy
of
the
fatherland
high
ideals
and
low
vulgarities
were
closely
intermixed
and
the
noble
enthusiasm
of
youth
was
occasionally
played
on
by
criminal
and
anarchic
intriguers
in
a
strong
and
wise
and
united
germany
some
of
these
schemes
might
have
been
tolerated
but
strength
wisdom
and
unity
were
absent
in
the
existing
tension
between
austria
and
prussia
for
the
leadership
in
the
illadapted
and
effete
constitutions
of
the
several
principalities
which
were
yet
expected
to
realise
the
advance
which
had
taken
place
in
society
and
ideas
during
the
last
thirty
years
the
outlook
on
every
hand
seemed
darker
and
more
threatening
than
it
might
have
otherwise
done
governments
which
had
lost
touch
with
their
peoples
suspected
conspiracy
and
treason
and
a
party
in
the
nation
credited
their
rulers
with
gratuitous
designs
against
private
liberty
and
rights
there
was
a
vast
but
illdefined
enthusiasm
in
the
breasts
of
the
younger
world
and
it
was
shared
by
many
of
their
teachers
it
seemed
to
their
immense
aspirations
that
the
war
of
liberation
had
failed
of
its
true
object
and
left
things
much
as
they
were
the
volunteers
had
not
fought
for
the
political
systems
of
austria
or
prussia
or
for
the
threeandthirty
princes
of
germany
but
for
ideas
vague
beautiful
stimulating
to
such
a
mood
the
continuance
of
the
old
system
was
felt
as
a
cruel
deception
and
a
reaction
the
governments
on
their
part
had
not
realised
the
full
importance
of
the
spirit
that
had
been
aroused
and
could
not
at
a
moments
notice
set
their
house
in
order
even
had
there
been
a
clearer
outlook
for
reform
than
was
offered
they
too
had
suffered
and
had
realised
their
insecurity
and
were
hardly
in
a
mood
to
open
their
gates
to
the
enemy
coming
on
such
a
situation
of
affairs
hegels
book
would
have
been
likely
in
any
case
to
provoke
criticism
for
it
took
up
a
line
of
political
theory
which
was
little
in
accord
with
the
temper
of
the
age
the
conception
of
the
state
which
it
expounded
is
not
far
removed
in
essentials
from
the
conception
which
now
dominates
the
political
life
of
the
chief
european
nations
but
in
his
own
time
it
came
upon
ears
which
were
naturally
disposed
to
misconceive
it
it
was
unacceptable
to
the
adherents
of
the
ancien
rgime
as
much
as
to
the
liberals
it
was
declared
by
one
party
to
be
a
glorification
of
the
prussian
state
by
another
to
rationalise
the
sanctities
of
authority
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
new
professor
was
a
favourite
of
the
leading
minister
that
his
influence
was
dominant
in
scholastic
appointments
and
that
occasional
gratuities
from
the
crown
proved
his
acceptability
a
contemporary
professor
fries
remarked
that
hegels
theory
of
the
state
had
grown
not
in
the
gardens
of
science
but
on
the
dunghill
of
servility
hegel
himself
was
aware
that
he
had
planted
a
blow
in
the
face
of
a
shallow
and
pretentious
sect
and
that
his
book
had
given
great
offence
to
the
demagogic
folk
alike
in
religious
and
political
life
he
was
impatient
of
sentimentalism
of
rhetorical
feeling
of
wordy
enthusiasm
a
positive
storm
of
scorn
burst
from
him
at
muchpromising
and
littlecontaining
declamation
that
appealed
to
the
pathos
of
ideas
without
sense
of
the
complex
work
of
construction
and
the
system
of
principles
which
were
needed
to
give
them
reality
his
impatience
of
demagogic
gush
led
him
in
the
preface
into
a
tactless
attack
on
fries
who
was
at
the
moment
in
disgrace
for
his
participation
in
the
demonstration
at
the
wartburg
it
led
him
to
an
attack
on
the
bumptiousness
of
those
who
held
that
conscientious
conviction
was
ample
justification
for
any
proceedingan
attack
which
opponents
were
not
unwilling
to
represent
as
directed
against
the
principle
of
conscience
itself
yet
hegels
views
on
the
nature
of
political
unity
were
not
new
their
nucleus
had
been
formed
nearly
twenty
years
before
in
the
years
that
immediately
followed
the
french
revolution
he
had
gone
through
the
usual
anarchic
stage
of
intelligent
youth
he
had
wondered
whether
humanity
might
not
have
had
a
nobler
destiny
had
fate
given
supremacy
to
some
heresy
rather
than
the
orthodox
creed
of
christendom
he
had
seen
religion
in
the
past
teaching
what
despotism
wishedcontempt
of
the
human
race
its
incapacity
for
anything
good94
but
his
earliest
reflections
on
political
power
belong
to
a
later
date
and
are
inspired
not
so
much
by
the
vague
ideals
of
humanitarianism
as
by
the
spirit
of
national
patriotism
they
are
found
in
a
criticism
of
the
german
constitution
apparently
dating
from
the
year
180295
it
is
written
after
the
peace
of
lunville
had
sealed
for
germany
the
loss
of
her
provinces
west
of
the
rhine
and
subsequent
to
the
disasters
of
the
german
arms
at
hohenlinden
and
marengo
it
is
almost
contemporaneous
with
the
measures
of
1803
and
1804
which
affirmed
the
dissolution
of
the
holy
roman
empire
of
german
name
the
writer
of
this
unpublished
pamphlet
sees
his
country
in
a
situation
almost
identical
with
that
which
macchiavelli
saw
around
him
in
italy
it
is
abused
by
petty
despots
distracted
by
mean
particularist
ambitions
at
the
mercy
of
every
foreign
power
it
was
such
a
scene
which
as
hegel
recalls
had
prompted
and
justified
the
drastic
measures
proposed
in
the
princemeasures
which
have
been
illjudged
by
the
closet
moralist
but
evince
the
high
statesmanship
of
the
florentine
in
the
prince
an
intelligent
reader
can
see
the
enthusiasm
of
patriotism
underlying
the
cold
and
dispassionate
doctrines
macchiavelli
dared
to
declare
that
italy
must
become
a
state
and
to
assert
that
there
is
no
higher
duty
for
a
state
than
to
maintain
itself
and
to
punish
relentlessly
every
author
of
anarchythe
supreme
and
perhaps
sole
political
crime
and
like
teaching
hegel
adds
is
needed
for
germany
only
he
concludes
no
mere
demonstration
of
the
insanity
of
utter
separation
of
the
particular
from
his
kin
will
ever
succeed
in
converting
the
particularists
from
their
conviction
of
the
absoluteness
of
personal
and
private
rights
insight
and
intelligence
always
excite
so
much
distrust
that
force
alone
avails
to
justify
them
then
man
yields
them
obedience96
the
german
political
edifice
says
the
writer
is
nothing
else
but
the
sum
of
the
rights
which
the
single
parts
have
withdrawn
from
the
whole
and
this
justice
which
is
ever
on
the
watch
to
prevent
the
state
having
any
power
left
is
the
essence
of
the
constitution
the
peace
of
westphalia
had
but
served
to
constitute
or
stereotype
anarchy
the
german
empire
had
by
that
instrument
divested
itself
of
all
rights
of
political
unity
and
thrown
itself
on
the
goodwill
of
its
members
what
then
it
may
be
asked
is
in
hegels
view
the
indispensable
minimum
essential
to
a
state
and
the
answer
will
be
organised
strengtha
central
and
united
force
the
strength
of
a
country
lies
neither
in
the
multitude
of
its
inhabitants
and
fighting
men
nor
in
its
fertility
nor
in
its
size
but
solely
in
the
way
its
parts
are
by
reasonable
combination
made
a
single
political
force
enabling
everything
to
be
used
for
the
common
defence
hegel
speaks
scornfully
of
the
philanthropists
and
moralists
who
decry
politics
as
an
endeavour
and
an
art
to
seek
private
utility
at
the
cost
of
right
he
tells
them
that
it
is
foolish
to
oppose
the
interest
or
as
it
is
expressed
by
the
more
morallyobnoxious
word
the
utility
of
the
state
to
its
right
that
the
rights
of
a
state
are
the
utility
of
the
state
as
established
and
recognised
by
compacts
and
that
war
which
they
would
fain
abolish
or
moralise
has
to
decide
not
which
of
the
rights
asserted
by
either
party
is
the
true
right
for
both
parties
have
a
true
right
but
which
right
has
to
give
way
to
the
other
it
is
evident
from
these
propositions
that
hegel
takes
that
view
of
political
supremacy
which
has
been
associated
with
the
name
of
hobbes
but
his
views
also
reproduce
the
platonic
king
of
men
who
can
rule
and
dare
not
lie
all
states
he
declares
are
founded
by
the
sublime
force
of
great
men
not
by
physical
strength
the
great
man
has
something
in
his
features
which
others
would
gladly
call
their
lord
they
obey
him
against
their
will
their
immediate
will
is
his
will
but
their
conscious
will
is
otherwise
this
is
the
prerogative
of
the
great
man
to
ascertain
and
to
express
the
absolute
will
all
gather
round
his
banner
he
is
their
god
the
state
he
says
again
is
the
selfcertain
absolute
mind
which
recognises
no
definite
authority
but
its
own
which
acknowledges
no
abstract
rules
of
good
and
bad
shameful
and
mean
craft
and
deception
so
also
hobbes
describes
the
prerogatives
of
the
sovereign
leviathan
but
the
hegelian
god
immanent
in
the
state
is
a
higher
power
than
hobbes
knows
he
is
no
mortal
but
in
his
truth
an
immortal
god
he
speaks
by
what
in
this
early
essay
is
called
the
absolute

the
true
and

not
literally

but
revealing
them
if
we
ask
where
does
this
public

appear

how
does
it
disengage
itself
from

from

large
sense
hegels
view
is
that
the
real
voice
of
experience
is
elicited
through
those
who
have
attained
indifference
to
the
distorting
influence
of
human
parties
and
who
see
life
steadily
and
whole
if
this
utterance
shows
the
little
belief
hegel
had
in
the
ordinary
methods
of
legislation
through
representative
bodies
and
hints
that
the
real
substance
of
political
life
is
deeper
than
the
overt
machinery
of
political
operation
it
is
evident
that
this
theory
of
divine
right
is
of
a
different
stamp
from
what
used
to
go
under
that
name
and
again
though
the
power
of
the
central
state
is
indispensable
he
is
far
from
agreeing
with
the
socalled
bureaucratic
view
that
a
state
is
a
machine
with
a
single
spring
which
sets
in
motion
all
the
rest
of
the
machinery
everything
he
says
which
is
not
directly
required
to
organise
and
maintain
the
force
for
giving

without

within
must
be
left
by
the
central
government
to
the
freedom
of
the
citizens
nothing
ought
to
be
so
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
a
government
as
to
leave
alone
and
to
protect
without
regard
to
utilities
the
free
action
of
the
citizens

such
matters
as

not

he
is
no

the
system
of

and
counterchecks
which
sometimes
goes

the

came
out
clearly
in
hegels
attitude
in
discussing
the
dispute
between
the
wrtembergers
and
their
sovereign
in
181516
wrtemberg
with
its
complicated
aggregation
of
local
laws
had
always
been
a
paradise

the

all
this
had
however
been
aggravated
by
the
increase
of
territory
received
in
1805
and
the
king
following
the
examples
set
by
france
and
even
by
bavaria
promulgated
of
his
own
grace
a
constitution
remodelling
the
electoral
system
of
the
country
immediately
an
outcry
burst
out
against
the
attempt
to
destroy
the
ancient
liberties
uhland
tuned
his
lyre
to
the
popular
cry
rckert
sang
on
the
kings
side
to
hegel
the
contest
presented
itself
as
a
struggle
between
the
attachment
to
traditional
rights
merely
because
they
are
old
and
the
resolution
to
carry
out
reasonable
reform
whether
it
be
agreeable
to
the
reformed
or
not
or
rather
he
saw
in
it
resistance
of
particularism
of
separation
clinging
to
use
and
wont
and
basing
itself
on
formal
pettifogging
objections
against
the
spirit
of
organisation
anything
more
he
declined
to
see
and
probably
he
was
right
in
ascribing
a
large
part
of
the
opposition
to
inertia
to
vanity
and
selfinterest
combined
with
the
want
of
political
perception
of
the
needs
of
wrtemberg
and
germany
but
on
the
other
hand
he
failed
to
remember
the
insecurity
and
danger
of
such
gifts
of
the
danai
he
forgot
the
sense
of
freeborn
men
that
a
constitution
is
not
something
to
be
granted
octroy
as
a
grace
but
something
that
must
come
by
the
spontaneous
act
of
the
innermost
self
of
the
community
he
dealt
rather
with
the
formal
arguments
which
were
used
to
refuse
progress
than
with
the
underlying
spirit
which
prompted
the
opposition101
the
philosopher
lives
as
plato
has
well
reminded
us
too
exclusively
within
the
ideal
bent
on
the
essential
nucleus
of
institutions
he
attaches
but
slight
importance
to
the
variety
of
externals
and
fails
to
realise
the
practice
of
the
lawcourts
he
forgets
that
what
weighs
lightly
in
logic
may
turn
the
scale
in
real
life
and
experience
for
feeling
and
sentiment
he
has
but
scant
respect
he
is
brusque
and
uncompromising
and
cannot
realise
all
the
difficulties
and
dangers
that
beset
the
idea
in
the
mazes
of
the
world
and
may
ultimately
quite
alter
a
plan
which
at
first
seemed
independent
of
petty
details
better
than
other
men
perhaps
he
recognises
in
theory
how
the
mere
universal
only
exists
complete
in
an
individual
shape
but
more
than
other
men
he
forgets
these
truths
of
insight
when
the
business
of
life
calls
for
action
or
for
judgment
he
cannot
at
a
moments
notice
remember
that
he
is
if
not
as
cicero
says
in
faece
romuli
the
member
of
a
degenerate
commonwealth
at
least
living
in
a
world
where
good
and
evil
are
not
as
logic
presupposes
sharply
divided
but
intricately
intertwined
ii
the
ethics
and
religion
of
the
state
this
idealism
of
political
theory
is
illustrated
by
the
sketch
of
the
ethical
life
which
he
drew
up
about
1802
under
the
name
of
ethical
system
it
presents
in
concentrated
or
undeveloped
shape
the
doctrine
which
subsequently
swelled
into
the
philosophy
of
mind
at
a
later
date
he
worked
out
more
carefully
as
introduction
the
psychological
genesis
of
moral
and
intelligent
man
and
he
separated
out
more
distinctly
as
a
sequel
the
universal
powers
which
give
to
social
life
its
higher
characters
in
the
earlier
sketch
the
ethical
part
stands
by
itself
with
the
consequence
that
ethics
bears
a
meaning
far
exceeding
all
that
had
been
lately
called
moral
the
word
moral
itself
he
avoids102
it
savours
of
excessive
subjectivity
of
struggle
of
duty
and
conscience
it
has
an
ascetic
ring
about
itan
aspect
of
negation
which
seeks
for
abstract
holiness
and
turns
its
back
on
human
nature
kants
words
opposing
duty
to
inclination
and
implying
that
moral
goodness
involves
a
struggle
an
antagonism
a
victory
seem
to
him
and
to
his
time
onesided
that
aspect
of
negation
accordingly
which
kant
certainly
began
with
and
which
schopenhauer
magnified
until
it
became
the
allinall
of
ethics
hegel
entirely
subordinates
equally
little
does
he
like
the
emphasis
on
the
supremacy
of
insight
intention
conscience
they
lead
he
thinks
to
a
view
which
holds
the
mere
fact
of
conviction
to
be
allimportant
as
if
it
mattered
not
what
we
thought
and
believed
and
did
so
long
as
we
were
sincere
in
our
belief
all
this
emphasis
on
the
goodwill
on
the
imperative
of
duty
on
the
rights
of
conscience
has
he
admits
its
justification
in
certain
circumstances
as
against
mere
legality
or
mere
natural
instinctive
goodness
but
it
has
been
overdone
above
all
it
errs
by
an
excess
of
individualism
it
springs
from
an
attitude
of
reflectionin
which
the
individual
isolated
in
his
conscious
and
superficial
individuality
yet
triesbut
probably
tries
in
vainto
get
somewhat
in
touch
with
a
universal
which
he
has
allowed
to
slip
outside
him
forgetting
that
it
is
the
heart
and
substance
of
his
life
kant
indeed
hardly
falls
under
this
condemnation
for
he
aims
at
showing
that
the
rational
will
inevitably
creates
as
rational
a
law
or
universal
that
the
individual
act
becomes
selfregulative
and
takes
its
part
in
constituting
a
system
or
realm
of
duty
still
on
the
whole
morality
in
this
narrower
sense
belongs
to
an
age
of
reflection
and
is
formal
or
nominal
goodness
rather
than
the
genuine
and
full
reality
it
is
the
protest
against
mere
instinctive
or
customary
virtue
which
is
but
compliance
with
traditional
authority
and
compliance
with
it
as
if
it
were
a
sort
of
quasinatural
law
moralising
reflection
is
the
awakening
of
subjectivity
and
of
a
deeper
personality
the
age
which
thus
precedes
morality
is
not
an
age
in
which
kindness
or
love
or
generosity
is
unknown
and
if
hegel
says
that
morality
strictly
so
called
began
with
socrates
he
does
not
thereby
accuse
the
presocratic
greeks
of
inhumanity
but
what
he
does
say
is
that
such
ethical
life
as
existed
was
in
the
main
a
thing
of
custom
and
law
of
law
moreover
which
was
not
set
objectively
forward
but
left
still
in
the
stage
of
uncontradicted
usage
a
custom
which
was
a
second
nature
part
of
the
essential
and
quasiphysical
ordinance
of
life
the
individual
had
not
yet
learned
to
set
his
selfconsciousness
against
these
usages
and
ask
for
their
justification
these
are
like
the
socalled
law
of
the
medes
and
persians
which
alters
not
customs
of
immemorial
antiquity
and
unquestionable
sway
they
are
part
of
a
system
of
things
with
which
for
good
or
evil
the
individual
is
utterly
identified
bound
as
it
were
hand
and
foot
these
are
as
a
traveller
says103
oral
and
unwritten
traditions
which
teach
that
certain
rules
of
conduct
are
to
be
observed
under
certain
penalties
and
without
the
aid
of
fixed
records
or
the
intervention
of
a
succession
of
authorised
depositaries
and
expounders
these
laws
have
been
transmitted
to
father
and
son
through
unknown
generations
and
are
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
people
as
sacred
and
unalterable
the
antithesis
then
in
hegel
as
in
kant
is
between
law
and
morality
or
rather
legality
and
moralitytwo
abstractions
to
which
human
development
is
alternately
prone
to
attach
supreme
importance
the
first
stage
in
the
objectivation
of
intelligence
or
in
the
evolution
of
personality
is
the
constitution
of
mere
abstract
or
strict
right
it
is
the
creation
of
institutions
and
uniformities
ie
of
laws
or
rights
which
express
definite
and
stereotyped
modes
of
behaviour
or
if
we
look
at
it
from
the
individuals
standpoint
we
may
say
his
consciousness
awakes
to
find
the
world
parcelled
out
under
certain
rules
and
divisions
which
have
objective
validity
and
govern
him
with
the
same
absolute
authority
as
do
the
circumstances
of
physical
nature
under
their
influence

by

the

for
it
cannot
be

a

a
selfsubsistent
world
to
which
man
is

peculiarity
of
it
is
its
inequality
if
all
are

this

means
here
that
the

with
their

indifferent

enters
on
his
properly
ethical
function
by
transforming
the
physical

into
his
possession
he
makes
himself

his

his
instruments
of
exchange
and
production
the
fundamental
ethical
act
is
appropriation
by
labour
and
the
first
ethical
world
is
the
creation
of
an
economic
system
the
institution
of
property
for
property
or
at
least
possession
and
appropriation
is
the
dominant
idea
with
its
collateral
and
sequent
principles
and
at

even
human
beings
are
treated
on
the

method
as
other

in
any
sense
as

in

it
is
a
world
in
which
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
dominantwhere
owner
and

the
individual
the

of
his
socalled
property
he
has
become
an
objective
power
by
submitting
himself
to
objectivity
he
has
literally
put
himself
into
the
object
he
has
wrought
and
is
now
a
thing
among
things

what
he
owns

he
has
appropriated

the
real
powers
in
the
world
thus
established
are
the

the
laws
dominate
man
and
he
is
only
freed
from
dependence
on
casual
externals
by
making
himself
thoroughly
the
servant
of
his
possessions
the
only
salvation
and
it
is
but
imperfect
that
can
be
reached
on
this
stage
is
by
the
family
union
the
sexual
tie
is
at
first
entirely
on
a
level
with
the
other
arrangements
of
the
sphere
the
man
or
woman
is
but
a
chattel
and
a
tool
a
casual
appropriation
which
gradually
is
transformed
into
a
permanent
possession
and
a
permanent
bond104
but
as
the
family
constituted
itself
it
helped
to
afford
a

no

they
are

out

in
the
continuity
of

life
there
is
a
certain
analogue
of
immortality
but
says
hegel
though
the
family
be
the
highest
totality
of
which
nature
is
capable
the
absolute
identity
is
in
it
still
inward
and
is
not
instituted
in
absolute
form
and
hence
too
the
reproduction
of
the
totality
is
an
appearance
the
appearance
of
the
children105
the
power
and
the
intelligence
the
difference
of
the
parents
stands
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
youth
and
vigour
of
the
child
and
these
two
sides
of
life
flee
from

are
sequent
on
each
other
and
are
reciprocally
external106
or
as
we
may
put
it
the
god
of
the

a

a
ghost
in
the

in

corrective
influence
they
get
in
the
first
instance
from
deeds
of
violence

here
is
the
negative
unsettling
of
the
narrow
fixities
of
the
determinate
conditions
or
relationships
into
which
the
preceding
processes
of

have
tended
to

harsh
restriction
brings
about
its

man
may
subject
natural
objects

his

power
but
the
wild
rage
of
senseless
devastation
again
and
again
bursts
forth
to
restore
the
original
formlessness
he
may
build
up

the

the
robber
with
the
instincts
of
barbarian
socialism
tread
on
his
steps
and
every
stage
of

has
for
its
sequel
a
crop
of
acts
of
dispossession
he

secure
by

his

quaintly
conceived

out

is
that
of
the
socalled

where
particularism
was
rampant
where
moral
right
was
not

of

of
preoccupation
of
the
stronger

crime
is
thus
the
dialectic
which
shakes
the
fixity
of
practical
arrangements
and
calls
for
something
in
which
the
idea
of
a
higher
unity
a
permanent
substance
of
life
shall
find
realisation
the
positive
supersession107
of
individualism
and
naturalism
in
ethics
is
by
hegel
called
absolute
ethics
under
this
title
he
describes
the
ethics
and
religion
of
the
statea
religion
which
is
immanent
in
the
community
and
an
ethics
which
rises
superior
to
particularity
the
picture
he
draws
is
a
romance
fashioned
upon
the
model
of
the
greek
commonwealth
as
that
had
been
idealised
by
greek
literature
and
by
the
longings
of
later
ages
for
a
freer
life
it
is

of

its

with

hegel
has
reminiscences
from
the
ideals
of
other
nations
than
the
greek
he
recalls
the
israelite
depicted
by
the
lawadoring
psalmist

delight
is
to
do
the

on
in
one
pellucid
stream
with
the
universal
and
eternal
stream
of
divine
commandment
such
a
frame
of
spirit
where
the
empirical
consciousness
with
all
its
soul
and
strength
and
mind
identifies
its
mission
into
conformity
with
the
absolute
order
is
the
mood
of
absolute
ethics
it
is
what
some
have
spoken
of
as
the
true
life
as
the
eternal
life
in
it
says
hegel
the
individual
exists
auf

as
it
were
sub
specie
aeternitatis
his
life
is
hid
with
his
fellows
in
the
common
life
of
his
people
his
every
act
and
thought
and
will
get
their
being
and
significance
from
a
reality
which
is
established
in
him
as
a
permanent
spirit
it
is
there
that
he
in
the
fuller
sense
attains

or
finds
himself
no
longer
a
mere
part
but
an
ideal
totality
this
totality
is
realised
under
the
particular
form
of
a
nation
volk
which
in
the
visible
sphere
represents
or
rather
is
as
a
particular
the
absolute
and
infinite
such
a
unity
is
neither
the
mere
sum
of
isolated
individuals
nor
a
mere
majority
ruling
by
numbers
but
the
fraternal
and
organic
commonwealth
which
brings
all
classes
and
all
rights
from
their
particularistic
independence
into
an
ideal
identity
and
indifference109
here
all
are
not
merely
equal
before
the
laws
but
the
law
itself
is
a
living
and
organic
unity
selfcorrecting
subordinating
and
organising
and
no
longer
merely
defining
individual
privileges
and
socalled
liberties
in
such
conjunction
of
the
universal
with
the
particularity
lies
the
divinity
of
a
nation
or
if
we
give
this
universal
a
separate
place
in
our
ideas
it
is
the
god
of
the
nation
but
in
this
complete
accordance
between
concept
and
intuition
between
visible
and
invisible
where
symbol
and
significate
are
one
religion
and
ethics
are
indistinguishable
it
is
the
old
conception
and
in
its
highest
sense
of
theocracy110
god
is
the
national
head
and
the
national

in
him
all

rendered

such
an
ethical
life
is
absolute
truth
for
untruth
is
only
in
the
fixture
of
a
single
mode

in
the
everlasting

of
the
nation
all

is
superseded
it

in
the

the
real

empirical
annihilation
and
prescription
of
all

it
is
absolute
disinterestedness

is
nothing
private

first
raise

up

it

if
we
compare

we
can
see
how
for
the

hegels

as
we
have
said
a
memory

perhaps
hebrew

rather
it

endeavours
to
guard
against
the
severance
of
morality
and

and
philosophy
which
may
be
rashly
inferred
in
consequence
of
his
serial
order
of
treatment

he
remarks
is
the
very
substance
of
the
moral
life
itself
and
of
the
state
the
ethical
life
is
the
divine
spirit
indwelling
in
consciousness
as
it
is
actually
present
in
a
nation
and
its
individual
members
yet
as
we
see
there
is
a
distinction
the
process
of
history
carries
out
a
judgment
on
nation
after
nation
and
reveals
the
divine
as
not
only
immanent
in
the
ethical
life
but
as
ever
expanding
the
limited
national
spirit
till
it
become
a
spirit
of
universal
humanity
stilland
this
is
perhaps
for
each
time
always
the
more
importantthe
national
unitynot
indeed
as
a
multitude
nor
as
a

the
supreme
real
appearance
of
the
eternal
and
absolute
having
thus
described
the
nation
as
an
organic
totality
he
goes
on
to
point
out
that
the
political
constitution
shows
this
character
by
forming
a
triplicity
of
political
orders
in
one
of
these
there
is
but
a
silent
practical
identity
in
faith
and
trust
with
the
totality
in
the
second
there
is
a
thorough
disruption
of
interest
into
particularity
and
in
the
third
there
is
a
living
and
intellectual
identity
or
indifference
which
combines
the
widest
range
of
individual
development
with
the
completest
unity
of
political
loyalty
this
last
order
is
that
which
lives
in
conscious
identification
of
private
with
public
duty
all
that
it
does
has
a
universal
and
public
function

the

imposes
the
duty
of
exhibiting
in
the
clearest
form
the
supreme
reality
of
absolute
morality
and
of
being
to
the
rest
an
unperturbed
ideal
of

ethical
religious
and
philosophical
completeness
it
is
here
alone
in
this
estate
which
is
absolutely
disinterested
that
the
virtues
appear
in
their
true
light
to
the
ordinary
moralising
standpoint
they
seem
severally
to
be
in
their
separation
charged
with
independent
value
but
from
the
higher
point
of
view
the
existence
and
still
more
the
accentuation
of
single
virtues
is
a
mark
of
incompleteness
even
quality
it
has
been
said

its
defects
it
can
only
shine
by
eclipsing
or
reflecting
something
else
the
completely
moral
is
not
the
sum
of
the
several
virtues
but
the
reduction
of
them
to
indifference
it
is
thus
that
when
plato
tries
to
get
at
the
unity
of
virtue
their
aspect
of
difference
tends
to
be
subordinated
the
movement
of
absolute
morality
runs
through
all
the
virtues
but
settles
fixedly
in
none
it
is
more
than
love
to
fatherland
and

gives
place
to

calmer

and

the
absolute
morality
is
life
in
the
fatherland
and
for
the

in
the
individual
however
it
is
the
process
upward
and
inward
that
we
see
not
the
consummation
then
the
identity
appears
as
an
ideal
as
a
tendency
not
yet
accomplished
to
its
end
a

not

at

the

substance
in

the

is

but
in
the
appearance
we
have
only
the
passage
from
possible
to
actual
a
passage
which
has
the
aspect
of
a
struggle
hence
the
moral
act
appears
as
a
virtue
with
merit
or
desert
it
is
accordingly
the
very
characteristic
of
virtue
to
signalise
its
own
incompleteness
it
emerges
into
actuality
only
through
antagonism
and
with
a
taint
of
imperfection
clinging
to
it
thus
in
the
field
of
absolute
morality
if
the
virtues
appear
it
is
only
in
their
transiency
if
they
were
undisputedly
real
in
morality
they
would
not
separately
show
to
feel
that
you
have
done
well
implies
that
you
have
not
done
wholly
well
selfgratulation
in
meritorious
deed
is
the
reaction
from
the
shudder
at
feeling
that
the
self
was
not
wholly
good
the
essential
unity
of

negative
character
as
regards
all
the
empirical
variety
of
virtuesis
seen
in
the
excellences
required
by
the
needs
of
war
these
military
requirements
demonstrate
the
mere
relativity
and
therefore
nonvirtuousness
of
the
special
virtues
they
equally
protest
against
the
common
beliefs
in
the
supreme
dignity
of
labour
and
its
utilities
but
if
bravery
or
soldierlike
virtue
be
essentially
a
virtue
of
virtues
it
is
only
a
negative
virtue
after
all
it
is
the
blast
of
the
universal
sweeping
away
all
the
habitations
and
fixed
structures
of
particularist
life
if
it
is
a
unity
of

it
is
only

into
a

of
imperfect

contradictory
parts
it
does
so
only
to
present
a
bare
negation
the
soldier
therefore
if
in
potentiality
the
unity
of
all
the
virtues
may
tend
in
practice
to
represent
the
ability

purely
political
function

the
state
hegel
in
this
sketch
says
almost
nothing
but
under
the
head
of
the
general
government
of
the
state
he
deals
with
its
social
functions
for
a
moment
he
refers
to
the
wellknown
distinction
of
the
legislative
judicial
and
executive
powers
but
it
is
only
to
remark
that
in
every
governmental
act
all
three
are
conjoined
they
are
abstractions
none
of
which
can
get
a
reality
of
its
ownwhich
in
other
words
cannot
be
constituted
and
organised
as
powers
legislation
judicature
and
executive
are
something
completely
formal
empty
and
contentless
whether
the
others
are
or
are
not
bare
abstractions
empty
activities
depends
entirely
on
the
executive
power
and
this
is
absolutely
the
government116
treating
government
as
the
organic
movement
by
which
the
universal
and
the
particular
in
the
commonwealth
come
into
relations
he
finds
that
it
presents
three
forms
or
gives
rise
to
three
systems
the
highest
and
last
of
these
is
the
educational
system
by
this
he
understands
all
that
activity
by
which
the
intelligence
of
the
state
tries
directly
to
mould
and
guide
the
character
and
fortunes
of
its
members
all
the
means
of
culture
and
discipline
whether
in
general
or
for
individuals
all
training
to
public
function
to
truthfulness
to
good
manners
under
the
same
head
come
conquest
and
colonisation
as
state
agencies
the
second
system
is
the
judicial
which
instead
of
like
the
former
aiming
at
the
formation
or
reformation
of
its
members
is
satisfied
by
subjecting
individual
transgression
to
a
process
of
rectification
by
the
general
principle
with
regard
to
the
system
of
judicature
hegel
argues
for
a
variety
of
procedure
to
suit
different
ranks
and
for
a
corresponding
modification
of
penalties
formal
rigid
equality
is
just
what
does
not
spare
the
character
the
same
penalty
which
in
one
estate
brings
no
infamy
causes
in
another
a
deep
and
irremediable
hurt
and
with
regard
to
the
after
life
of
the
transgressor
who
has
borne
his
penalty
punishment
is
the
reconciliation
of
the
law
with
itself
no
further
reproach
for
his
crime
can
be
addressed
to
the
person
who
has
undergone
his
punishment
he
is
restored
to
membership
of
his
estate117
in
the
first
of
the
three
systems
the
economic
system
or
system
of
wants
the
state
seems
at
first
hardly
to
appear
in
its
universal
and
controlling
function
at
all
here
the
individual
depends
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
physical
needs
on
a
blind
unconscious
destiny
on
the
obscure
and
incalculable
properties
of
supply
and
demand
in
the
whole
interconnexion
of
commodities
but
even
this
is
not
all
with
the
accumulation
of
wealth
in
inequality
and
the
growth
of
vast
capitals
there
is
substituted
for
the
dependence
of
the
individual
on
the
general
resultant
of
a
vast
number
of
agencies
a
dependence
on
one
enormously
rich
individual
who
can
control
the
physical
destinies
of
a
nation
but
a
nation
truly
speaking
is
there
no
more
the
industrial
order
has
parted
into
a
mere
abstract
workman
on
one
hand
and
the
grande

on
the
other
it

pneumatology
or
as
it
was
also
called
rational
psychology
has
been
already
alluded
to
in
the
introduction
to
the
logic
as
an
abstract
and
generalising
metaphysic
of
the
subject
empirical
or
inductive
psychology
on
the
other
hand
deals
with
the
concrete
mind
and
after
the
revival
of
the
sciences
when
observation
and
experience
had
been
made
the
distinctive
methods
for
the
study
of
concrete
reality
such
psychology
was
worked
on
the
same
lines
as
other
sciences
in
this
way
it
came
about
that
the
metaphysical
theory
was
kept
outside
the
inductive
science
and
so
prevented
from
getting
any
concrete
embodiment
or
detail
whilst
at
the
same
time
the
inductive
science
clung
to
the
conventional
commonsense
metaphysic
with
its
analysis
into
forces
various
activities
c
and
rejected
any
attempt
at
a
speculative
treatment
the
books
of
aristotle
on
the
soul
along
with
his
discussions
on
its
special
aspects
and
states
are
for
this
reason
still
by
far
the
most
admirable
perhaps
even
the
sole
work
of
philosophical
value
on
this
topic
the
main
aim
of
a
philosophy
of
mind
can
only
be
to
reintroduce
unity
of
idea
and
principle
into
the
theory
of
mind
and
so
reinterpret
the
lesson
of
those
aristotelian
books

379
even
our
own
sense
of
the
minds
living
unity
naturally
protests
against
any
attempt
to
break
it
up
into
different
faculties
forces
or
what
comes
to
the
same
thing
activities
conceived
as
independent
of
each
other
but
the
craving
for
a
comprehension
of
the
unity
is
still
further
stimulated
as
we
soon
come
across
distinctions
between
mental
freedom
and
mental
determinism
antitheses
between
free
psychic
agency
and
the
corporeity
that
lies
external
to
it
whilst
we
equally
note
the
intimate
interdependence
of
the
one
upon
the
other
in
modern
times
especially
the
phenomena
of
animal
magnetism
have
given
even
in
experience
a
lively
and
visible
confirmation
of
the
underlying
unity
of
soul
and
of
the
power
of
its
ideality
before
these
facts
the
rigid
distinctions
of
practical
common
sense
were
struck
with
confusion
and
the
necessity
of
a
speculative
examination
with
a
view
to
the
removal
of
difficulties
was
more
directly
forced
upon
the
student

380
the
concrete
nature
of
mind
involves
for
the
observer
the
peculiar
difficulty
that
the
several
grades
and
special
types
which
develop
its
intelligible
unity
in
detail
are
not
left
standing
as
so
many
separate
existences
confronting
its
more
advanced
aspects
it
is
otherwise
in
external
nature
there
matter
and
movement
for
example
have
a
manifestation
all
their
ownit
is
the
solar
system
and
similarly
the
differentiae
of
senseperception
have
a
sort
of
earlier
existence
in
the
properties
of
bodies
and
still
more
independently
in
the
four
elements
the
species
and
grades
of
mental
evolution
on
the
contrary
lose
their
separate
existence
and
become
factors
states
and
features
in
the
higher
grades
of
development
as
a
consequence
of
this
a
lower
and
more
abstract
aspect
of
mind
betrays
the
presence
in
it
even
to
experience
of
a
higher
grade
under
the
guise
of
sensation
eg
we
may
find
the
very
highest
mental
life
as
its
modification
or
its
embodiment
and
so
sensation
which
is
but
a
mere
form
and
vehicle
may
to
the
superficial
glance
seem
to
be
the
proper
seat
and
as
it
were
the
source
of
those
moral
and
religious
principles
with
which
it
is
charged
and
the
moral
and
religious
principles
thus
modified
may
seem
to
call
for
treatment
as
species
of
sensation
but
at
the
same
time
when
lower
grades
of
mental
life
are
under
examination
it
becomes
necessary
if
we
desire
to
point
to
actual
cases
of
them
in
experience
to
direct
attention
to
more
advanced
grades
for
which
they
are
mere
forms
in
this
way
subjects
will
be
treated
of
by
anticipation
which
properly
belong
to
later
stages
of
development
eg
in
dealing
with
natural
awaking
from
sleep
we
speak
by
anticipation
of
consciousness
or
in
dealing
with
mental
derangement
we
must
speak
of
intellect
what
mind
or
spirit
is

381
from
our
point
of
view
mind
has
for
its
presupposition
nature
of
which
it
is
the
truth
and
for
that
reason
its
absolute
prius
in
this
its
truth
nature
is
vanished
and
mind
has
resulted
as
the
idea
entered
on
possession
of
itself
here
the
subject
and
object
of
the
idea
are
oneeither
is
the
intelligent
unity
the
notion
this
identity
is
absolute
negativityfor
whereas
in
nature
the
intelligent
unity
has
its
objectivity
perfect
but
externalised
this
selfexternalisation
has
been
nullified
and
the
unity
in
that
way
been
made
one
and
the
same
with
itself
thus
at
the
same
time
it
is
this
identity
only
so
far
as
it
is
a
return
out
of
nature

382
for
this
reason
the
essential
but
formally
essential
feature
of
mind
is
liberty
ie
it
is
the
notions
absolute
negativity
or
selfidentity
considered
as
this
formal
aspect
it
may
withdraw
itself
from
everything
external
and
from
its
own
externality
its
very
existence
it
can
thus
submit
to
infinite
pain
the
negation
of
its
individual
immediacy
in
other
words
it
can
keep
itself
affirmative
in
this
negativity
and
possess
its
own
identity
all
this
is
possible
so
long
as
it
is
considered
in
its
abstract
selfcontained
universality

383
this
universality
is
also
its
determinate
sphere
of
being
having
a
being
of
its
own
the
universal
is
selfparticularising
whilst
it
still
remains
selfidentical
hence
the
special
mode
of
mental
being
is
manifestation
the
spirit
is
not
some
one
mode
or
meaning
which
finds
utterance
or
externality
only
in
a
form
distinct
from
itself
it
does
not
manifest
or
reveal
something
but
its
very
mode
and
meaning
is
this
revelation
and
thus
in
its
mere
possibility
mind
is
at
the
same
moment
an
infinite
absolute
actuality

384
revelation
taken
to
mean
the
revelation
of
the
abstract
idea
is
an
unmediated
transition
to
nature
which
comes
to
be
as
mind
is
free
its
manifestation
is
to
set
forth
nature
as
its
world
but
because
it
is
reflection
it
in
thus
setting
forth
its
world
at
the
same
time
presupposes
the
world
as
a
nature
independently
existing
in
the
intellectual
sphere
to
reveal
is
thus
to
create
a
world
as
its
beinga
being
in
which
the
mind
procures
the
affirmation
and
truth
of
its
freedom

is
the
supreme
definition
of
the
absolute
to
find
this
definition
and
to
grasp
its
meaning
and
burthen
was
we
may
say
the
ultimate
purpose
of
all
education
and
all
philosophy
it
was
the
point
to
which
turned
the
impulse
of
all
religion
and
science

it
is
this
impulse
that

some
glimpse
of

found
at

early
period
and
the
spirituality
of

is
the
lesson
of
christianity
it
remains
for
philosophy
in
its
own
element
of
intelligible
unity
to
get
hold
of
what
was
thus
given
as
a
mental
image
and
what
implicitly
is
the
ultimate
reality
and
that
problem
is
not
genuinely
and
by
rational
methods
solved

as

is
not
the

subdivision

385
the
development
of
mind
spirit
is
in
three
stages
1
in
the
form
of
selfrelation
within
it
it
has
the
ideal
totality
of
the
ideaie
it
has
before
it
all
that
its
notion
contains
its
being
is
to
be
selfcontained
and
free
this
is
mind
subjective
2
in
the
form
of
reality
realised
ie
in
a
world
produced
and
to
be
produced
by
it
in
this
world
freedom
presents
itself
under
the
shape
of
necessity
this
is
mind
objective
3
in
that
unity
of
mind
as
objectivity
and
of
mind
as
ideality
and
concept
which
essentially
and
actually
is
and
for
ever
produces
itself
mind
in
its
absolute
truth
this
is
mind
absolute

386
the
two
first
parts
of
the
doctrine
of
mind
embrace
the
finite
mind
mind
is
the
infinite
idea
thus
finitude
here
means
the
disproportion
between
the
concept
and
the
realitybut
with
the
qualification
that
it
is
a
shadow
cast
by
the
minds
own
lighta
show
or
illusion
which
the
mind
implicitly
imposes
as
a
barrier
to
itself
in
order
by
its
removal
actually
to
realise
and
become
conscious
of
freedom
as
its
very
being
ie
to
be
fully
manifested
the
several
steps
of
this
activity
on
each
of
which
with
their
semblance
of
being
it
is
the
function
of
the
finite
mind
to
linger
and
through
which
it
has
to
pass
are
steps
in
its
liberation
in
the
full
truth
of
that
liberation
is
given
the
identification
of
the
three
stagesfinding
a
world
presupposed
before
us
generating
a
world
as
our
own
creation
and
gaining
freedom
from
it
and
in
it
to
the
infinite
form
of
this
truth
the
show
purifies
itself
till
it
becomes
a
consciousness
of
it
a
rigid
application
of
the
category
of
finitude
by
the
abstract
logician
is
chiefly
seen
in
dealing
with
mind
and
reason
it
is
held
not
a
mere
matter
of
strict
logic
but
treated
also
as
a
moral
and
religious
concern
to
adhere
to
the
point
of
view
of
finitude
and
the
wish
to
go
further
is
reckoned
a
mark
of
audacity
if
not
of
insanity
of
thought
whereas
in
fact
such
a
modesty
of
thought
as
treats
the
finite
as
something
altogether
fixed
and
absolute
is
the
worst
of
virtues
and
to
stick
to
a
post
which
has
no
sound
ground
in
itself
is
the
most
unsound
sort
of
theory
the
category
of
finitude
was
at
a
much
earlier
period
elucidated
and
explained
at
its
place
in
the
logic
an
elucidation
which
as
in
logic
for
the
more
specific
though
still
simple
thoughtforms
of
finitude
so
in
the
rest
of
philosophy
for
the
concrete
forms
has
merely
to
show
that
the
finite
is
not
ie
is
not
the
truth
but
merely
a

the

however

in

that

the

on

its

and
the

where
on

matter
is
regarded
as
something

and
mind
conceived

but
in
modern
times
even
the
physicists
have
found
matters
grow
thinner
in
their
hands
they
have
come
upon
imponderable
matters
like
heat
light
c
to
which
they
might
perhaps
add
space
and
time
these
imponderables
which
have
lost
the
property
peculiar
to
matter
of
gravity
and
in
a
sense
even
the
capacity
of
offering
resistance
have
still
however
a
sensible
existence

outness

whereas
the
vital
matter
which
may
also
be
found
enumerated
among
them
not
merely
lacks
gravity
but
even
every
other
aspect
of
existence
which
might
lead
us
to
treat
it
as
material
the
fact
is
that
in
the
idea
of
life
the
selfexternalism
of
nature
is
implicitly
at
an
end
subjectivity
is
the
very
substance
and
conception
of
lifewith
this
proviso
however
that
its
existence
or
objectivity
is
still
at
the
same
time
forfeited
to
the
sway
of
selfexternalism
it
is
otherwise
with
mind
there
in
the
intelligible
unity
which
exists
as
freedom
as
absolute
negativity
and
not
as
the
immediate
or
natural
individual
the
object
or
the
reality
of
the
intelligible
unity
is
the
unity
itself
and
so
the
selfexternalism
which
is
the
fundamental
feature
of
matter
has
been
completely
dissipated
and
transmuted
into
universality
or
the
subjective
ideality
of
the
conceptual
unity
mind
is
the
existent
truth
of

truth
that
matter
itself
has
no
truth
a
cognate
question
is
that
of
the
community
of
soul
and
body
this
community
interdependence
was
assumed
as
a
fact
and
the
only
problem
was
how
to
comprehend
it
the
usual
answer
perhaps
was
to
call
it
an
incomprehensible
mystery
and
indeed
if
we
take
them
to
be
absolutely
antithetical
and
absolutely
independent
they
are
as
impenetrable
to
each
other
as
one
piece
of
matter
to
another
each
being
supposed
to
be
found
only
in
the
pores
of
the
other
ie
where
the
other
is
not
whence
epicurus
when
attributing
to
the
gods
a
residence
in
the
pores
was
consistent
in
not
imposing
on
them
any
connexion
with
the
world
a
somewhat
different
answer
has
been
given
by
all
philosophers
since
this
relation
came
to
be
expressly
discussed
descartes
malebranche
spinoza
and
leibnitz
have
all
indicated
god
as
this
nexus
they
meant
that
the
finitude
of
soul
and
matter
were
only
ideal
and
unreal
distinctions
and
so
holding
these
philosophers
took
god
not
as
so
often
is
done
merely
as
another
word
for
the
incomprehensible
but
rather
as
the
sole
true
identity
of
finite
mind
and
matter
but
either
this
identity
as
in
the
case
of
spinoza
is
too
abstract
or
as
in
the
case
of
leibnitz
though
his
monad
of
monads
brings
things
into
being
it
does
so
only
by
an
act
of
judgment
or
choice
hence
with
leibnitz
the
result
is
a
distinction
between
soul
and
the
corporeal
or
material
and
the
identity
is
only
like
the
copula
of
a
judgment
and
does
not
rise
or
develop
into
system
into
the
absolute
syllogism

when
the

from

it
relates

distinguishing

from

still
undifferentiated
universality
the

generally
all
selfconscious
and
rational
activity
in
which
the
mind
realises
its
own

selfsleep
is
an
invigoration
of
this
activitynot
as
a
merely
negative
rest
from
it
but
as
a
return
back
from
the
world
of
specialisation
from
dispersion
into
phases
where
it
has
grown
hard

into
the
general
nature
of
subjectivity

is
the
substance
of
those
specialised
energies
and
their
absolute
master
the
distinction
between
sleep
and
waking
is
one
of
those
posers
as
they
may
be
called
which
are
often
addressed
to
philosophynapoleon
eg
on
a
visit
to
the
university
of
pavia
put
this
question
to
the
class
of
ideology
the
characterisation
given
in
the
section
is
abstract
it
primarily
treats
waking
merely
as
a
natural
fact
containing
the
mental
element
implicite
but
not
yet
as
invested
with
a
special
being
of
its
own
if
we
are
to
speak
more
concretely
of
this
distinction
in
fundamentals
it
remains
the
same
we
must
take
the
selfexistence
of
the
individual
soul
in
its
higher
aspects
as
the
ego
of
consciousness
and
as
intelligent
mind
the
difficulty
raised
anent
the
distinction
of
the
two
states
properly
arises
only
when
we
also
take
into
account
the
dreams
in
sleep
and
describe
these
dreams
as
well
as
the
mental
representations
in
the
sober
waking
consciousness
under
one
and
the
same
title
of
mental
representations
thus
superficially
classified
as
states
of
mental
representation
the
two
coincide
because
we
have
lost
sight
of
the
difference
and
in
the
case
of
any
assignable
distinction
of
waking
consciousness
we
can
always
return
to
the
trivial
remark
that
all
this
is
nothing
more
than
mental
idea
but
the
concrete
theory
of
the
waking
soul
in
its
realised
being
views
it
as
consciousness
and
intellect
and
the
world
of
intelligent
consciousness
is
something
quite
different
from
a
picture
of
mere
ideas
and
images
the
latter
are
in
the
main
only
externally
conjoined
in
an
unintelligent
way
by
the
laws
of
the
socalled
association
of
ideas
though
here
and
there
of
course
logical
principles
may
also
be
operative
but
in
the
waking
state
man
behaves
essentially
as
a
concrete
ego
an
intelligence
and
because
of
this
intelligence
his
senseperception
stands
before
him
as
a
concrete
totality
of
features
in
which
each
member
each
point
takes
up
its
place
as
at
the
same
time
determined
through
and
with
all
the
rest
thus
the
facts
embodied
in
his
sensation
are
authenticated
not
by
his
mere
subjective
representation
and
distinction
of
the
facts
as
something
external
from
the
person
but
by
virtue
of
the
concrete
interconnexion
in
which
each
part
stands
with
all
parts
of
this
complex
the
waking
state
is
the
concrete
consciousness
of
this
mutual
corroboration
of
each
single
factor
of
its
content
by
all
the
others
in
the
picture
as
perceived
the
consciousness
of
this
interdependence
need
not
be
explicit
and
distinct
still
this
general
setting
to
all
sensations
is
implicitly
present
in
the
concrete
feeling
of
selfin
order
to
see
the
difference
of
dreaming
and
waking
we
need
only
keep
in
view
the
kantian
distinction
between
subjectivity
and
objectivity
of
mental
representation
the
latter
depending
upon
determination
through
categories
remembering
as
already
noted
that
what
is
actually
present
in
mind
need
not
be
therefore
explicitly
realised
in
consciousness
just
as
little
as
the
exaltation
of
the
intellectual
sense

stand
before

shape

as
before
explained

sleep

not

alternating

this

their
formal
and
negative

in
it
the
affirmative
relationship

also

in
the

of

its

up

by
the

what
we
call
sensibility

400
sensibility
feeling
is
the
form
of
the
dull
stirring
the
inarticulate
breathing
of
the
spirit
through
its
unconscious
and
unintelligent
individuality
where
every
definite
feature
is
still
immediateneither
specially
developed
in
its
content
nor
set
in
distinction
as
objective
to
subject
but
treated
as
belonging
to
its
most
special
its
natural
peculiarity
the
content
of
sensation
is
thus
limited
and
transient
belonging
as
it
does
to
natural
immediate
beingto
what
is
therefore
qualitative
and
finite
everything
is
in
sensation
feeling
if
you
will
everything
that
emerges
in
conscious
intelligence
and
in
reason
has
its
source
and
origin
in
sensation
for
source
and
origin
just
means
the
first
immediate
manner
in
which
a
thing
appears
let
it
not
be
enough
to
have
principles
and
religion
only
in
the
head
they
must
also
be
in
the
heart
in
the
feeling
what
we
merely
have
in
the
head
is
in
consciousness
in
a
general
way
the
facts
of
it
are
objectiveset
over
against
consciousness
so
that
as
it
is
put
in
me
my
abstract
ego
it
can
also
be
kept
away
and
apart
from
me
from
my
concrete
subjectivity
but
if
put
in
the
feeling
the
fact
is
a
mode
of
my
individuality
however
crude
that
individuality
be
in
such
a
form
it
is
thus
treated
as
my
very
own
my
own
is
something
inseparate
from
the
actual
concrete
self
and
this
immediate
unity
of
the
soul
with
its
underlying
self
in
all
its
definite
content
is
just
this
inseparability
which
however
yet
falls
short
of
the
ego
of
developed
consciousness
and
still
more
of
the
freedom
of
rational
mindlife
it
is
with
a
quite
different
intensity
and
permanency
that
the
will
the
conscience
and
the
character
are
our
very
own
than
can
ever
be
true
of
feeling
and
of
the
group
of
feelings
the
heart
and
this
we
need
no
philosophy
to
tell
us
no
doubt
it
is
correct
to
say
that
above
everything
the
heart
must
be
good
but
feeling
and
heart
is
not
the
form
by
which
anything
is
legitimated
as
religious
moral
true
just
c
and
an
appeal
to
heart
and
feeling
either
means
nothing
or
means
something
bad
this
should
hardly
need
enforcing
can
any
experience
be
more
trite
than
that
feelings
and
hearts
are
also
bad
evil
godless
mean
c
that
the
heart
is
the
source
only
of
such
feelings
is
stated
in
the
words
from
the
heart
proceed
evil
thoughts
murder
adultery
fornication
blasphemy
c
in
such
times
when
scientific
theology
and
philosophy
make
the
heart
and
feeling
the
criterion
of
what
is
good
moral
and
religious
it
is
necessary
to
remind
them
of
these
trite
experiences
just
as
it
is
nowadays
necessary
to
repeat
that
thinking
is
the
characteristic
property
by
which
man
is
distinguished
from
the
beasts
and
that
he
has
feeling
in
common
with
them

401
what
the
sentient
soul
finds
within
it
is
on
one
hand
the
naturally
immediate
as
ideally
in
it
and
made
its
own
on
the
other
hand
and
conversely
what
originally
belongs
to
the
central
individuality
which
as
further
deepened
and
enlarged
is
the
conscious
ego
and
free
mind
get
the
features
of
the
natural
corporeity
and
is
so
felt
in
this
way
we
have
two
spheres
of
feeling
one
where
what
at
first
is
a
corporeal
affection
eg
of
the
eye
or
of
any
bodily
part
whatever
is
made
feeling
sensation
by
being
driven
inward
memorised
in
the
souls
selfcentred
part
another
where
affections
originating
in
the
mind
and
belonging
to
it
are
in
order
to
be
felt
and
to
be
as
if
found
invested
with
corporeity
thus
the
mode
or
affection
gets
a
place
in
the
subject
it
is
felt
in
the
soul
the
detailed
specification
of
the
former
branch
of
sensibility
is
seen
in
the
system
of
the
senses
but
the
other
or
inwardly
originated
modes
of
feeling
no
less
necessarily
systematise
themselves
and
their
corporisation
as
put
in
the
living
and
concretely
developed
natural
being
works
itself
out
following
the
special
character
of
the
mental
mode
in
a
special
system
of
bodily
organs
sensibility
in
general
is
the
healthy
fellowship
of
the
individual
mind
in
the
life
of
its
bodily
part
the
senses
form
the
simple
system
of
corporeity
specified
a
the
ideal
side
of

breaks
up
into

these
specifications
arrange
themselves
more
simply
than
when
they
are
developed
in
the
natural
corporeity
the
system
by
which
the
internal

psychical

somewhat
pointing
to
such
a
system
is
implied
in
the
feeling
of
the
appropriateness
or
inappropriateness
of
an
immediate
sensation
to
the
persistent
tone
of
internal
sensibility

in

underlies
the
symbolical
employment
of
sensations
eg
of
colours
tones
smells
but
the
most
interesting
side
of
a
psychical
physiology
would
lie
in
studying
not
the
mere
sympathy
but
more
definitely
the
bodily
form
adopted
by
certain
mental
modifications
especially
the
passions
or
emotions
we
should
have
eg
to
explain
the
line
of
connexion
by
which
anger
and
courage
are
felt
in
the
breast
the
blood
the
irritable
system
just
as
thinking
and
mental
occupation
are
felt
in
the
head
the
centre
of
the
sensible
system
we
should
want
a
more
satisfactory
explanation
than
hitherto
of
the
most
familiar
connexions
by
which
tears
and
voice
in
general
with
its
varieties
of
language
laughter
sighs
with
many
other
specialisations
lying
in
the
line
of
pathognomy
and
physiognomy
are
formed
from
their
mental
source
in
physiology
the
viscera
and
the
organs
are
treated
merely
as
parts
subservient
to
the
animal
organism
but
they
form
at
the
same
time
a
physical
system
for
the
expression
of
mental
states
and
in
this
way
they
get
quite
another
interpretation

402
sensations
just
because
they
are
immediate
and
are
found

this

is
not

a

therefore
say

emphasises
rather
the
side

fact
that
we
find

the
feeling
or
sentient
individual
is
the
simple
ideality
or
subjective
side
of
sensation
what
it
has
to
do
therefore
is
to
raise
its
substantiality
its
merely
virtual
fillingup
to
the
character
of
subjectivity
to
take
possession
of
it
to
realise
its
mastery
over
its
own
as
sentient
the
soul
is
no
longer
a
mere
natural
but
an
inward
individuality
the
individuality
which
in
the
merely
substantial
totality
was
only
formal
to
it
has
to
be
liberated
and
made
independent
nowhere
so
much
as
in
the
case
of
the
soul
and
still
more
of
the
mind
if
we
are
to
understand
it
must
that
feature
of
ideality
be
kept
in
view
which
represents
it
as
the
negation
of
the
real
but
a
negation
where
the
real
is
put
past
virtually
retained
although
it
does
not
exist
the
feature
is
one
with
which
we
are
familiar
in
regard
to
our
mental
ideas
or
to
memory
every
individual
is
an
infinite
treasury
of
sensations
ideas
acquired
lore
thoughts
c
and
yet
the
ego
is
one
and
uncompounded
a
deep
featureless
characterless
mine
in
which
all
this
is
stored
up
without
existing
it
is
only
when
i
call
to
mind
an
idea
that
i
bring
it
out
of
that
interior
to
existence
before
consciousness
sometimes
in
sickness
ideas
and
information
supposed
to
have
been
forgotten
years
ago
because
for
so
long
they
had
not
been
brought
into
consciousness
once
more
come
to
light
they
were
not
in
our
possession
nor
by
such
reproduction
as
occurs
in
sickness
do
they
for
the
future
come
into
our
possession
and
yet
they
were
in
us
and
continue
to
be
in
us
still
thus
a
person
can
never
know
how
much
of
things
he
once
learned
he
really
has
in
him
should
he
have
once
forgotten
them
they
belong
not
to
his
actuality
or
subjectivity
as
such
but
only
to
his
implicit
self
and
under
all
the
superstructure
of
specialised
and
instrumental
consciousness
that
may
subsequently
be
added
to
it
the
individuality
always
remains
this
singlesouled
inner
life
at
the
present
stage
this
singleness
is
primarily
to
be
defined
as
one
of
feelingas
embracing
the
corporeal
in
itself
thus
denying
the
view
that
this
body
is
something
material
with
parts
outside
parts
and
outside
the
soul
just
as
the
number
and
variety
of
mental
representations
is
no
argument
for
an
extended
and
real
multeity
in
the
ego
so
the
real
outness
of
parts
in
the
body
has
no
truth
for
the
sentient
soul
as
sentient
the
soul
is
characterised
as
immediate
and
so
as
natural
and
corporeal
but
the
outness
of
parts
and
sensible
multiplicity
of
this
corporeal
counts
for
the
soul
as
it
counts
for
the
intelligible
unity
not
as
anything
real
and
therefore
not
as
a
barrier
the
soul
is
this
intelligible
unity
in
existencethe
existent
speculative
principle
thus
in
the
body
it
is
one
simple
omnipresent
unity
as
to
the
representative
faculty
the
body
is
but
one
representation
and
the
infinite
variety
of
its
material
structure
and
organisation
is
reduced
to
the
simplicity
of
one
definite
conception
so
in
the
sentient
soul
the
corporeity
and
all
that
outness
of
parts
to
parts
which
belongs
to
it
is
reduced
to
ideality
the

of
the

the
soul
is
virtually
the
totality
of

up

to
that

it
stands
but
as
to
itself

404
as

the
soul
is
exclusive
and
always
exclusive
any
difference
there
is
it
brings
within
itself
what
is
differentiated
from
it
is
as

no
external
object
as
in
consciousness
but
only
the
aspects
of
its
own
sentient

c
in
this
partition
judgment
of
itself
it
is
always

its
object
is
its
substance
which
is
at
the

its
predicate
this
substance
is
still
the

turned
into

this

the
stage
of
its
darkness
its
features
are
not
developed
to
conscious
and
intelligent
content
so
far
it
is
formal
and
only
formal
it
acquires
a
peculiar
interest
in
cases
where
it
is
as
a
form
and
appears
as
a
special
state
of
mind

350
to
which
the
soul
which
has
already
advanced
to
consciousness
and
intelligence
may
again
sink
down
but
when
a
truer
phase
of
mind
thus
exists
in
a
more
subordinate
and
abstract
one
it
implies
a
want
of
adaptation
which
is
disease
in
the
present
stage
we
must
treat
first
of
the
abstract
psychical
modifications
by
themselves
secondly
as
morbid
states
of
mind
the
latter

only
explicable
by

of
the
former

the

in
its
immediacy

405

though
the
sensitive
individuality
is
undoubtedly
a
monadic
individual
it
is
because
immediate
not
yet
as
its
self
not
a
true
subject
reflected
into
itself
and
is
therefore
passive
hence
the
individuality
of
its
true
self
is
a
different
subject
from
ita
subject
which
may
even
exist
as
another

the
selfhood

two

the
genius
of
the
child

by
genius
we
commonly
mean
the
total
mental
selfhood
as
it
has
existence
of
its
own
and
constitutes
the
subjective
substantiality
of
some
one
else
who
is
only
externally
treated
as
an
individual
and
has
only
a
nominal
independence
the
underlying
essence
of
the
genius
is
the
sum
total
of
existence
of
life
and
of
character
not
as
a
mere
possibility
or
capacity
or
virtuality
but
as
efficiency
and
realised
activity
as
concrete
subjectivity
if
we
look
only
to
the
spatial
and
material
aspects
of
the
childs
existence
as
an
embryo
in
its
special
integuments
and
as
connected
with
the
mother
by
means
of
umbilical
cord
placenta
c
all
that
is
presented
to
the
senses
and
reflection
are
certain
anatomical
and
physiological
factsexternalities
and
instrumentalities
in
the
sensible
and
material
which
are
insignificant
as
regards
the
main
point
the
psychical
relationship
what
ought
to
be
noted
as
regards
this
psychical
tie
are
not
merely
the
striking
effects
communicated
to
and
stamped
upon
the
child
by
violent
emotions
injuries
c
of
the
mother
but
the
whole
psychical
judgment
partition
of
the
underlying
nature
by
which
the
female
like
the
monocotyledons
among
vegetables
can
suffer
disruption
in
twain
so
that
the
child
has
not
merely
got
communicated
to
it
but
has
originally
received
morbid
dispositions
as
well
as
other
predispositions
of
shape
temper
character
talent
idiosyncrasies
c
sporadic
examples
and
traces
of
this
magic
tie
appear
elsewhere
in
the
range
of
selfpossessed
conscious
life
say
between
friends
especially
female
friends
with
delicate
nerves
a
tie
which
may
go
so
far
as
to
show
magnetic
phenomena
between
husband
and
wife
and
between
members
of
the
same
family
the
total
sensitivity
has
its
self
here
in
a
separate
subjectivity
which
in
the
case
cited
of
this
sentient
life
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
is
visibly
present
as
another
and
a
different
individual
but
this
sensitive
totality
is
meant
to
elevate
its
selfhood
out
of
itself
to
subjectivity
in
one
and
the
same
individual
which
is
then
its
indwelling
consciousness
selfpossessed
intelligent
and
reasonable
for
such
a
consciousness
the
merely
sentient
life
serves
as
an
underlying
and
only
implicitly
existent
material
and
the
selfpossessed
subjectivity
is
the
rational
selfconscious
controlling
genius
thereof
but
this
sensitive
nucleus
includes
not
merely
the
purely
unconscious
congenital
disposition
and
temperament
but
within
its
enveloping
simplicity
it
acquires

elaboration

activity
has
most
effectively
participated
the
sensitivity
is
thus
a
soul
in
which
the
whole
mental
life
is
condensed
the
total
individual
under
this

of

secular
ideas

interests

c
as
contrasted
with
this
looser
aggregate
of
means
and
methods
the
more
intensive
form
of
individuality
is
termed
the
genius
whose
decision
is
ultimate

may
be
the
show
of
reasons

means
of
which
the
more
public

so
liberal
this
concentrated

also
reveals
itself
under
the
aspect
of
what
is
called

a
man
is
said
to
be
heartless

unfeeling
when
he
looks
at
things
with
selfpossession
and
acts
according
to
his
permanent
purposes

they
great
substantial
aims

petty
and
unjust

rather
one
who
is
at
the
mercy
of
his
individual
sentiment
even
when
it
is
of
narrow
range
and

wholly
made
up
of
particularities
of
such
good
nature
or
goodness
of
heart
it
may
be

that
it

the
sensitive
life
when
it
becomes
a
form
or
state
of
the
selfconscious
educated
selfpossessed
human
being
is
a
disease
the

stands
in
direct

with
the
concrete

keeps
his
selfpossessed

of
the
causal
order
of
things
apart
as
a
distinct

this

states
in
this
summary
encyclopaedic
account
it
is
impossible
to
supply
a
demonstration
of
what
the

states
as
the
nature
of
the
remarkable
condition

by

the
phenomena
so
complex
in
their
nature

so
very
different

from

would
have
first
of
all
to
be
brought
under
their
general
points
of

the

it
might
seem
first
of
all
call
for
verification
but
such
a
verification
would
it
must
be
added
be
superfluous
for
those
on
whose
account
it
was
called
for
for
they
facilitate
the
inquiry
for
themselves
by
declaring
the

numerous
though
they
be
and
accredited
by
the
education
and
character
of
the

be
mere
deception
and
imposture
the
a
priori
conceptions
of
these
inquirers
are
so
rooted
that
no
testimony
can
avail
against
them
and
they
have
even
denied
what
they
had
seen
with
their
own
eyes
in
order
to
believe
in
this
department
even
what
one
sees
with
these
eyes
and
still
more
to
understand
it
the
first
requisite
is
not
to
be
in
bondage
to
the
hard
and
fast
categories
of
the
practical
intellect
the
chief
points
on
which
the
discussion
turns
may
here
be
given

to
the
concrete
existence
of
the
individual
belongs
the
aggregate
of
his
fundamental
interests
both
the
essential
and
the
particular
empirical
ties
which
connect
him
with
other
men
and
the
world
at
large
this
totality
forms
his
actuality
in
the
sense
that
it
lies
in
fact
immanent
in
him
it
has
already
been
called
his
genius
this
genius
is
not
the
free
mind
which
wills
and
thinks
the
form
of
sensitivity
in
which
the
individual
here
appears
immersed
is
on
the
contrary
a
surrender
of
his
selfpossessed
intelligent
existence
the
first
conclusion
to
which
these
considerations
lead
with
reference
to
the
contents
of
consciousness
in
the
somnambulist
stage
is
that
it
is
only
the
range
of
his
individually
moulded
world
of
his
private
interests
and
narrow
relationships
which
appear
there
scientific
theories
and
philosophic
conceptions
or
general
truths
require
a
different
soilrequire
an
intelligence
which
has
risen
out
of
the
inarticulate
mass
of
mere
sensitivity
to
free
consciousness
it
is
foolish
therefore
to
expect
revelations
about
the
higher
ideas
from
the
somnambulist
state

where
a
human
beings
senses
and
intellect
are
sound
he
is
fully
and
intelligently
alive
to
that
reality
of
his
which
gives
concrete
filling
to
his
individuality
but
he
is
awake
to
it
in
the
form
of
interconnexion
between
himself
and
the
features
of
that
reality
conceived
as
an
external
and
a
separate
world
and
he
is
aware
that
this
world
is
in
itself
also
a
complex
of
interconnexions
of
a
practically
intelligible
kind
in
his
subjective
ideas
and
plans
he
has
also
before
him
this
causally
connected
scheme
of
things
he
calls
his
world
and
the
series
of
means
which
bring
his
ideas
and
his
purposes
into
adjustment
with
the
objective
existences
which
are
also
means
and
ends
to
each
other
at
the
same
time
this
world
which
is
outside
him
has
its
threads
in
him
to
such
a
degree
that
it
is
these
threads
which
make
him
what
he
really
is
he
too
would
become
extinct
if
these
externalities
were
to
disappear
unless
by
the
aid
of
religion
subjective
reason
and
character
he
is
in
a
remarkable
degree
selfsupporting
and
independent
of
them
but
then
in
the
latter
case
he
is
less
susceptible
of
the
psychical
state
here
spoken
ofas
an
illustration
of
that
identity
with
the
surroundings
may
be
noted
the
effect
produced
by
the
death
of
beloved
relatives
friends
c
on
those
left
behind
so
that
the
one
dies
or
pines
away
with
the
loss
of
the
other
thus
cato
after
the
downfall
of
the
roman
republic
could
live
no
longer
his
inner
reality
was
neither
wider
than
higher
than
it
compare
homesickness
and
the
like

but
when
all
that
occupies
the
waking
consciousness
the
world
outside
it
and
its
relationship
to
that
world
is
under
a
veil
and
the
soul
is
thus
sunk
in
sleep
in
magnetic
sleep
in
catalepsy
and
other
diseases
eg
those
connected
with
female
development
or
at
the
approach
of
death
c
then
that
immanent
actuality
of
the
individual
remains
the
same
substantial
total
as
before
but
now
as
a
purely
sensitive
life
with
an
inward
vision
and
an
inward
consciousness
and
because
it
is
the
adult
formed
and
developed
consciousness
which
is
degraded
into
this
state
of
sensitivity
it
retains
along
with
its
content
a
certain
nominal
selfhood
a
formal
vision
and
awareness
which
however
does
not
go
so
far
as
the
conscious
judgment
or
discernment
by
which
its
contents
when
it
is
healthy
and
awake
exist
for
it
as
an
outward
objectivity
the
individual
is
thus
a
monad
which
is
inwardly
aware
of
its
actualitya
genius
which
beholds
itself
the
characteristic
point
in
such
knowledge
is
that
the
very
same
facts
which
for
the
healthy
consciousness
are
an
objective
practical
reality
and
to
know
which
in
its
sober
moods
it
needs
the
intelligent
chain
of
means
and
conditions
in
all
their
real
expansion
are
now
immediately
known
and
perceived
in
this
immanence
this
perception
is
a
sort
of
clairvoyance
for
it
is
a
consciousness
living
in
the
undivided
substantiality
of
the
genius
and
finding
itself
in
the
very
heart
of
the
interconnexion
and
so
can
dispense
with
the
series
of
conditions
external
one
to
another
which
lead
up
to
the
resultconditions
which
cool
reflection
has
in
succession
to
traverse
and
in
so
doing
feels
the
limits
of
its
own
individual
externality
but
such
clairvoyancejust
because
its
dim
and
turbid
vision
does
not
present
the
facts
in
a
rational
interconnexionis
for
that
very
reason
at
the
mercy
of
every
private
contingency
of
feeling
and
fancy
cnot
to
mention
that
foreign
suggestions
see
later
intrude
into
its
vision
it
is
thus
impossible
to
make
out
whether
what
the
clairvoyants
really
see
preponderates
over
what
they
deceive
themselves
inbut
it
is
absurd
to
treat
this
visionary
state
as
a
sublime
mental
phase
and
as
a
truer
state
capable
of
conveying
general
truths123

an
essential
feature
of
this
sensitivity
with
its
absence
of
intelligent
and
volitional
personality
is
this
that
it
is
a
state
of
passivity
like
that
of
the
child
in
the
womb
the
patient
in
this
condition
is
accordingly
made
and
continues
to
be
subject
to
the
power
of
another
person
the
magnetiser
so
that
when
the
two
are
thus
in
psychical
rapport
the
selfless
individual
not
really
a
person
has
for
his
subjective
consciousness
the
consciousness
of
the
other
this
latter
selfpossessed
individual
is
thus
the
effective
subjective
soul
of
the
former
and
the
genius
which
may
even
supply
him
with
a
train
of
ideas
that
the
somnambulist
perceives
in
himself
tastes
and
smells
which
are
present
in
the
person
with
whom
he
stands
en
rapport
and
that
he
is
aware
of
the
other
inner
ideas
and
present
perceptions
of
the
latter
as
if
they
were
his
own
shows
the
substantial
identity
which
the
soul
which
even
in
its
concreteness
is
also
truly
immaterial
is
capable
of
holding
with
another
when
the
substance
of
both
is
thus
made
one
there
is
only
one
subjectivity
of
consciousness
the
patient
has
a
sort
of
individuality
but
it
is
empty
not
on
the
spot
not
actual
and
this
nominal
self
accordingly
derives
its
whole
stock
of
ideas
from
the
sensations
and
ideas
of
the
other
in
whom
it
sees
smells
tastes
reads
and
hears
it
is
further
to
be
noted
on
this
point
that
the
somnambulist
is
thus
brought
into
rapport
with
two
genii
and
a
twofold
set
of
ideas
his
own
and
that
of
the
magnetiser
but
it
is
impossible
to
say
precisely
which
sensations
and
which
visions
he
in
this
nominal
perception
receives
beholds
and
brings
to
knowledge
from
his
own
inward
self
and
which
from
the
suggestions
of
the
person
with
whom
he
stands
in
relation
this
uncertainty
may
be
the
source
of
many
deceptions
and
accounts
among
other
things
for
the
diversity
that
inevitably
shows
itself
among
somnambulists
from
different
countries
and
under
rapport
with
persons
of
different
education
as
regards
their
views
on
morbid
states
and
the
methods
of
cure
or
medicines
for
them
as
well
as
on
scientific
and
intellectual
topics

as
in
this
sensitive
substantiality
there
is
no
contrast
to
external
objectivity
so
within
itself
the
subject
is
so
entirely
one
that
all
varieties
of
sensation
have
disappeared
and
hence
when
the
activity
of
the
senseorgans
is
asleep
the
common
sense
or
general
feeling
specifies
itself
to
several
functions
one
sees
and
hears
with
the
fingers
and
especially
with
the
pit
of
the
stomach
c
to
comprehend
a
thing
means
in
the
language
of
practical
intelligence
to
be
able
to
trace
the
series
of
means
intervening
between
a
phenomenon
and
some
other
existence
on
which
it
dependsto
discover
what
is
called
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
in
compliance
with
the
laws
and
relations
of
the
intellect
eg
causality
reasons
c
the
purely
sensitive
life
on
the
contrary
even
when
it
retains
that
mere
nominal
consciousness
as
in
the
morbid
state
alluded
to
is
just
this
form
of
immediacy
without
any
distinctions
between
subjective
and
objective
between
intelligent
personality
and
objective
world
and
without
the
aforementioned
finite
ties
between
them
hence
to
understand
this
intimate
conjunction
which
though
allembracing
is
without
any
definite
points
of
attachment
is
impossible
so
long
as
we
assume
independent
personalities
independent
one
of
another
and
of
the
objective
world
which
is
their
contentso
long
as
we
assume
the
absolute
spatial
and

externality

selffeeling
sense

407

the
sensitive
totality
is
in
its
capacity
of
individual
essentially
the
tendency
to
distinguish
itself
in
itself
and
to
wake
up
to
the
judgment
in
itself
in
virtue
of
which
it
has
particular
feelings
and
stands
as
a
subject
in
respect
of
these
aspects
of
itself
the
subject
as
such
gives
these
feelings
a
place
as
its
own
in
itself
in
these
private
and
personal
sensations
it
is
immersed
and
at
the
same
time
because
of
the
ideality
of
the
particulars
it
combines
itself
in
them
with
itself
as
a
subjective
unit
in
this
way
it
is
selffeeling
and
is
so
at
the
same
time
only
in
the
particular
feeling

408

in
consequence
of
the
immediacy
which
still
marks
the
selffeeling
ie
in
consequence
of
the
element
of
corporeality
which
is
still
undetached
from
the
mental
life
and
as
the
feeling
too
is
itself
particular
and
bound
up
with
a
special
corporeal
form
it
follows
that
although
the
subject
has
been
brought
to
acquire
intelligent
consciousness
it
is
still
susceptible
of
disease
so
far
as
to
remain
fast
in
a
special
phase
of
its
selffeeling
unable
to
refine
it
to
ideality
and
get
the
better
of
it
the
fullyfurnished
self
of
intelligent
consciousness
is
a
conscious
subject
which
is
consistent
in
itself
according
to
an
order
and
behaviour
which
follows
from
its
individual
position
and
its
connexion
with
the
external
world
which
is
no
less
a
world
of
law
but
when
it
is
engrossed
with
a
single
phase
of
feeling
it
fails
to
assign
that
phase
its
proper
place
and
due
subordination
in
the
individual
system
of
the
world
which
a
conscious
subject
is
in
this
way
the
subject
finds
itself
in
contradiction
between
the
totality
systematised
in
its
consciousness
and
the
single
phase
or
fixed
idea
which
is
not
reduced
to
its
proper
place
and
rank
this
is
insanity
or
mental
derangement
in
considering
insanity
we
must
as
in
other
cases
anticipate
the
fullgrown
and
intelligent
conscious
subject
which
is
at
the
same
time
the
natural
self
of
selffeeling
in
such
a
phase
the
self
can
be
liable
to
the
contradiction
between
its
own
free
subjectivity
and
a
particularity
which
instead
of
being
idealised
in
the
former
remains
as
a
fixed
element
in
selffeeling
mind
as
such
is
free
and
therefore
not
susceptible
of
this
malady
but
in
older
metaphysics
mind
was
treated
as
a
soul
as
a
thing
and
it
is
only
as
a
thing
ie
as
something
natural
and
existent
that
it
is
liable
to
insanitythe
settled
fixture
of
some
finite
element
in
it
insanity
is
therefore
a
psychical
disease
ie
a
disease
of
body
and
mind
alike
the
commencement
may
appear
to
start
from
one
more
than
other
and
so
also
may
the
cure
the
selfpossessed
and
healthy
subject
has
an
active
and
present
consciousness
of
the
ordered
whole
of
his
individual
world
into
the
system
of
which
he
subsumes
each
special
content
of
sensation
idea
desire
inclination
c
as
it
arises
so
as
to
insert
them
in
their
proper
place
he
is
the
dominant
genius
over
these
particularities
between
this
and
insanity
the
difference
is
like
that
between
waking
and
dreaming
only
that
in
insanity
the
dream
falls
within
the
waking
limits
and
so
makes
part
of
the
actual
selffeeling
error
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
a
proposition
consistently
admitted
to
a
place
in
the
objective
interconnexion
of
things
in
the
concrete
however
it
is
often
difficult
to
say
where
it
begins
to
become
derangement
a
violent
but
groundless
and
senseless
outburst
of
hatred
c
may
in
contrast
to
a
presupposed
higher
selfpossession
and
stability
of
character
make
its
victim
seem
to
be
beside
himself
with
frenzy
but
the
main
point
in
derangement
is
the
contradiction
which
a
feeling
with
a
fixed
corporeal
embodiment
sets
up
against
the
whole
mass
of
adjustments
forming
the
concrete
consciousness
the
mind
which
is
in
a
condition
of
mere
being
and
where
such
being
is
not
rendered
fluid
in
its
consciousness
is
diseased
the
contents
which
are
set
free
in
this
reversion
to
mere
nature
are
the
selfseeking
affections
of
the
heart
such
as
vanity
pride
and
the
rest
of
the
passionsfancies
and
hopesmerely
personal
love
and
hatred
when
the
influence
of
selfpossession
and
of
general
principles
moral
and
theoretical
is
relaxed
and
ceases
to
keep
the
natural
temper
under
lock
and
key
the
earthly
elements
are
set
freethat
evil
which
is
always
latent
in
the
heart
because
the
heart
as
immediate
is
natural
and
selfish
it
is
the
evil
genius
of
man
which
gains
the
upper
hand
in
insanity
but
in
distinction
from
and
contrast
to
the
better
and
more
intelligent
part
which
is
there
also
hence
this
state
is
mental
derangement
and
distress
the
right
psychical
treatment
therefore
keeps
in
view
the
truth
that
insanity
is
not
an
abstract
loss
of
reason
neither
in
the
point
of
intelligence
nor
of
will
and
its
responsibility
but
only
derangement
only
a
contradiction
in
a
still
subsisting
reasonjust
as
physical
disease
is
not
an
abstract
ie
mere
and
total
loss
of
health
if
it
were
that
it
would
be
death
but
a
contradiction
in
it
this
humane
treatment
no
less
benevolent
than
reasonable
the
services
of
pinel
towards
which
deserve
the
highest
acknowledgment
presupposes
the
patients
rationality
and
in
that
assumption
has
the
sound
basis
for
dealing
with
him
on
this
sidejust
as
in
the
case
of
bodily
disease
the
physician
bases
his
treatment
on
the
vitality
which
as
such
still
contains

expressly
stated
habit
like
memory
is
a
difficult
point
in

habit
is
the
mechanism
of

as
memory
is
the
mechanism
of
intelligence
the

qualities
and
alterations
of
age
sleep
and
waking
are
immediately
natural

on
the
contrary

the

as

called

nature

it
is
an
immediate

a
second
nature
because
it
is
an
immediacy
created
by
the
soul
impressing
and
moulding
the
corporeality
which
enters
into
the
modes
of

as
such
and
into
the
representations

as
they

taken

mode
of
existence
is
natural
and
for
that
reason
not
free
but
still
free
so
far
as
the
merely
natural
phase
of
feeling
is
by
habit
reduced
to
a
mere
being
of
his
and
he
is
no
longer
involuntarily
attracted
or
repelled
by
it
and
so
no
longer
interested
occupied
or
dependent
in
regard
to
it
the
want
of
freedom
in
habit
is
partly
merely
formal
as
habit
merely
attaches
to
the
being
of
the
soul
partly
only
relative
so
far
as
it
strictly
speaking
arises
only
in
the
case
of
bad
habits
or
so
far
as
a
habit
is
opposed
by
another
purpose
whereas
the
habit
of
right
and
goodness
is
an
embodiment
of
liberty
the
main
point
about
habit
is
that
by
its
means
man
gets
emancipated
from
the
feelings
even
in
being
affected
by
them
the
different
forms
of
this
may
be
described
as
follows

the
immediate
feeling
is
negated
and
treated
as
indifferent
one
who
gets
inured
against
external
sensations
frost
heat
weariness
of
the
limbs
c
sweet
tastes
c
and
who
hardens
the
heart
against
misfortune
acquires
a
strength
which
consists
in
this
that
although
the
frost
cor
the
misfortuneis
felt
the
affection
is
deposed
to
a
mere
externality
and
immediacy
the
universal
psychical
life
keeps
its
own
abstract
independence
in
it
and
the
selffeeling
as
such
consciousness
reflection
and
any
other
purposes
and
activity
are
no
longer
bothered
with
it

there
is
indifference
towards
the
satisfaction
the
desires
and
impulses
are
by
the
habit
of
their
satisfaction
deadened
this
is
the
rational
liberation
from
them
whereas
monastic
renunciation
and
forcible
interference
do
not
free
from
them
nor
are
they
in
conception
rational
of
course
in
all
this
it
is
assumed
that
the
impulses
are
kept
as
the
finite
modes
they
naturally
are
and
that
they
like
their
satisfaction
are
subordinated
as
partial
factors
to
the
reasonable
will

in
habit
regarded
as
aptitude
or
skill
not
merely
has
the
abstract
psychical
life
to
be
kept
intact
per
se
but
it
has
to
be
imposed
as
a
subjective
aim
to
be
made
a
power
in
the
bodily
part
which
is
rendered
subject
and
thoroughly
pervious
to
it
conceived
as
having
the
inward
purpose
of
the
subjective
soul
thus
imposed
upon
it
the
body
is
treated
as
an
immediate
externality
and
a
barrier
thus
comes
out
the
more
decided
rupture
between
the
soul
as
simple
selfconcentration
and
its
earlier
naturalness
and
immediacy
it
has
lost
its
original
and
immediate
identity
with
the
bodily
nature
and
as
external
has
first
to
be
reduced
to
that
position
specific
feelings
can
only
get
bodily
shape
in
a
perfectly
specific
way

401
and
the
immediate
portion
of
body
is
a
particular
possibility
for
a
specific
aim
a
particular
aspect
of
its
differentiated
structure
a
particular
organ
of
its
organic
system
to
mould
such
an
aim
in
the
organic
body
is
to
bring
out
and
express
the
ideality
which
is
implicit
in
matter
always
and
especially
so
in
the
specific
bodily
part
and
thus
to
enable
the
soul
under
its
volitional
and
conceptual
characters
to
exist
as
substance
in
its
corporeity
in
this
way
an
aptitude
shows
the
corporeity
rendered
completely
pervious
made
into
an
instrument
so
that
when
the
conception
eg
a
series
of
musical
notes
is
in
me
then
without
resistance
and
with
ease
the
body
gives
them
correct
utterance
the
form
of
habit
applies
to
all
kinds
and
grades
of
mental
action
the
most
external
of
them

the
man

in
so
far
as
he
wills
to

only
so

as
he
wills
it
without

similarly

eyesight
is
the
concrete

without

habit
is
often
spoken

disparagingly

called
lifeless
casual

it
is
true
that
the

of
habit
like
any
other
is
open
to
anything
we
chance
to
put
into

it
is
habit
of
living
which
brings
on
death

if
quite

is
death

411
the
soul
when
its
corporeity
has
been
moulded
and
made
thoroughly
its
own
finds
itself
there
a
single
subject
and
the
corporeity
is
an
externality
which
stands
as
a
predicate
in
being
related
to
which
it
is
related
to
itself
this
externality
in
other
words
represents
not
itself
but
the
soul
of
which
it
is
the
sign
in
this
identity
of
interior
and
exterior
the
latter
subject
to
the
former
the
soul
is
actual
in
its
corporeity
it
has
its
free
shape
in
which
it
feels
itself
and
makes
itself
felt
and
which
as
the

of

has
human
pathognomic
and
physiognomic
expression
under
the
head
of
human
expression
are
included
eg
the
upright
figure
in
general
and
the
formation
of
the
limbs
especially
the

as

the

the

which
at
once
announces
the

at
the
externality
of
a
higher
nature
this
note
is
so
slight
indefinite
and
inexpressible
a
modification
because
the
figure
in
its
externality
is
something
immediate
and
natural
and
can
therefore
only
be
an
indefinite

the
mind
unable
to
represent
it
in
its
actual
universality
seen
from
the
animal
world
the
human
figure
is
the
supreme
phase
in
which
mind
makes
an
appearance
but
for
the
mind
it
is
only
its
first
appearance
while
language
is
its
perfect
expression
and
the
human
figure
though
its
proximate
phase
of

not

to

it

consequently

differently
modified
according
to
the
difference
of
the

the
kantian
philosophy
may
be
most
accurately
described
as
having
viewed
the
mind
as
consciousness
and
as
containing
the
propositions
only
of
a
phenomenology
not
of
a
philosophy
of
mind
the

kant
regards
as
reference
to
something
away
and
beyond
which
in
its
abstract
description
is
termed
the
thingatitself
and
it
is
only
from
this
finite
point
of
view
that
he
treats
both
intellect
and
will
though
in
the
notion
of
a
power
of
reflective
judgment
he
touches

the
idea
of
minda
subjectobjectivity
an

intellect
c
and
even
the
idea

this

is

an
appearance
ie
to
a
subjective
maxim

58
reinhold
may
therefore
be
said
to
have
correctly
appreciated
kantism
when

it
as

theory
of

under
the
name
of

to
the

his
nonego
is

something
set
over
against
the
ego
only
defined
as
in

it
is
made
no
more
than
an
infinite
shock
ie
a
thinginitself
both
systems
therefore
have
clearly
not
reached
the
intelligible
unity
or
the

as
it
actually
and
essentially
is
but
only
as
it
is
in
reference
to
something
else
as
against
spinozism
again
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
mind
in
the
judgment
by
which
it
constitutes
itself
an
ego
a
free
subject
contrasted
with
its
qualitative
affection
has
emerged
from
substance
and
that
the
philosophy
which
gives
this
judgment
as
the
absolute
characteristic
of
mind
has
emerged
from
spinozism

416
the
aim
of

is
to
make
its
appearance
identical
with
its
essence
to
raise
its
selfcertainty
to
truth
the
existence
of
mind
in
the
stage
of
consciousness
is
finite
because
it
is
merely
a
nominal
selfrelation
or
mere
certainty
the
object
is
only
abstractly
characterised
as
its
in

it
is
only
as
an
abstract
ego
that
the
mind
is
reflected
into
itself
hence
its
existence
there
has

a

417
the

of
this
elevation

in

a

in

with
an
object
set
against
it
b
selfconsciousness
for
which
ego
is
the
object
c
unity
of
consciousness
and
selfconsciousness
where
the
mind
sees
itself
embodied
in
the

and

hence
as
this

the
impulse
to
realise

by
giving

in

free

from

to
set
aside

with

426
selfconsciousness
in
its
immediacy
is
a
singular
and
a
desire
appetitethe
contradiction
implied
in
its
abstraction
which
should
yet
be
objectiveor
in
its
immediacy
which
has
the
shape
of
an
external
object
and
should
be
subjective
the
certitude
of
ones
self
which
issues
from
the
suppression
of
mere
consciousness
pronounces
the
object
null
and
the
outlook
of
selfconsciousness
towards
the
object
equally
qualifies
the
abstract
ideality
of
such
selfconsciousness
as
null

427
selfconsciousness
therefore
knows
itself
implicit
in
the
object
which
in
this
outlook
is
conformable
to
the
appetite
in
the
negation
of
the
two
onesided
moments
by
the
egos
own
activity
this
identity
comes
to
be
for
the
ego
to
this
activity
the
object
which
implicitly
and
for
selfconsciousness
is
selfless
can
make
no
resistance
the
dialectic
implicit
in
it
towards
selfsuppression
exists
in
this
case
as
that
activity
of
the
ego
thus
while
the
given
object
is
rendered
subjective
the
subjectivity
divests
itself
of
its
onesidedness
and
becomes
objective
to
itself

428
the
product
of
this
process
is
the
fast
conjunction
of
the
ego
with
itself
its
satisfaction
realised
and
itself
made
actual
on
the
external
side
it
continues
in
this
return
upon
itself
primarily
describable
as
an
individual
and
maintains
itself
as
such
because
its
bearing
upon
the
selfless
object
is
purely
negative
the
latter
therefore
being
merely
consumed
thus
appetite
in
its
satisfaction
is
always
destructive
and
in
its
content
selfish
and
as
the
satisfaction
has
only
happened
in
the
individual
and
that
is
transient
the
appetite
is
again
generated
in
the
very
act
of
satisfaction

429
but
on
the
inner
side
or
implicitly
the
sense
of
self
which
the
ego
gets
in
the
satisfaction
does
not
remain
in
abstract
selfconcentration
or
in
mere
individuality
on
the
contraryas
negation
of
immediacy
and
individuality
the
result
involves
a
character
of
universality
and
of
the
identity
of
selfconsciousness
with
its
object
the
judgment
or
diremption
of
this
selfconsciousness
is
the
consciousness
of
a
free
object
in
which

the
suppression
of
the
singleness
of
selfconsciousness
was
only
a
first
step
in
the
suppression
and
it
merely
led
to
the
characterisation
of
it
as
particular
this
contradiction
gives
either
selfconsciousness
the
impulse
to
show
itself
as
a
free
self
and
to
exist
as
such
for
the
otherthe
process
of
recognition

431
the
process
is
a
battle
i
cannot
be
aware
of
me
as
myself
in
another
individual
so
long
as
i
see
in
that
other
an
other
and
an
immediate
existence
and
i
am
consequently
bent
upon
the
suppression
of
this
immediacy
of
his
but
in
like
measure
i
cannot
be
recognised
as
immediate
except
so
far
as
i
overcome
the
mere
immediacy
on
my
own
part
and
thus
give
existence
to
my
freedom
but
this
immediacy
is
at
the
same
time
the
corporeity
of
selfconsciousness
in
which
as
in
its
sign
and
tool
the
latter
has
its
own
sense
of
self
and
its
being
for
others
and
the
means
for
entering
into
relation
with
them

432
the
fight
of
recognition
is
a
life
and
death
struggle
either
selfconsciousness
imperils
the
others
like
and
incurs
a
like
peril
for
its
ownbut
only
peril
for
either
is
no
less
bent
on
maintaining
his
life
as
the
existence
of
his
freedom
thus
the
death
of
one
though
by
the
abstract
therefore
rude
negation
of
immediacy
it
from
one
point
of
view
solves
the
contradiction
is
yet
from
the
essential
point
of
view
ie
the
outward
and
visible
recognition
a
new
contradiction
for
that
recognition
is
at
the
same
time
undone
by
the
others
death
and
a
greater
than
the
other

433
but
because
life
is
as
requisite
as
liberty
to
the
solution
the
fight
ends
in
the
first
instance
as
a
onesided
negation
with
inequality
while
the
one
combatant
prefers
life
retains
his
single
selfconsciousness
but
surrenders
his
claim
for
recognition
the
other
holds
fast
to
his
selfassertion
and
is
recognised
by
the
former
as
his
superior
thus
arises
the
status
of
master
and
slave
in
the
battle
for
recognition
and
the
subjugation
under
a
master
we
see
on
their
phenomenal
side
the
emergence
of
mans

life
and
the
commencement
of
political
union
force
which
is
the
basis
of
this
phenomenon
is
not
on
that
account
a
basis
of
right
but
only
the
necessary
and
legitimate
factor
in
the
passage
from
the
state
of
selfconsciousness
sunk
in
appetite
and
selfish
isolation
into
the
state
of
universal
selfconsciousness
force
then
is
the
external
or
phenomenal
commencement
of
states
not
their
underlying
and
essential
principle

434
this
status
in
the
first
place
implies
common
wants
and
common
concern
for
their
satisfactionfor
the
means
of
mastery
the
slave
must
likewise
be
kept
in
life
in
place
of
the
rude
destruction
of
the
immediate
object
there
ensues
acquisition
preservation
and
formation
of
it
as
the
instrumentality
in
which
the
two
extremes
of
independence
and
nonindependence
are
welded
together
the
form
of
universality
thus
arising
in
satisfying
the
want
creates
a
permanent
means
and
a
provision
which
takes
care
for
and
secures
the
future

435
but
secondly
when
we
look
to
the
distinction
of
the
two
the
master
beholds
in
the
slave
and
his
servitude
the
supremacy
of
his
single
selfhood
and
that
by
the
suppression
of
immediate
selfhood
a
suppression
however
which
falls
on
another
this
other
the
slave
however
in
the
service
of
the
master
works
off
his
individualist
selfwill
overcomes
the
inner
immediacy
of
appetite
and
in
this
divestment
of
self
and
in
the
fear
of
his
lord
makes
the
beginning
of

passage
to

the

of

an

as
a

knows

is
aware
of

in
so
far
as

this

that
the

the
special

as
though

no

it
has
a
mode
in
its

ie
it

of
its

or
what
is
the

by
being

only
a

and
it
is
a

of
no

as
the

of
that

that

the
progress
of
mind
is
development
in
so
far
as
its
existent
phase
viz
knowledge
involves
as
its
intrinsic
purpose
and
burden
that
utter
and
complete
autonomy
which
is
rationality
in
which
case
the
action
of
translating
this
purpose
into
reality
is
strictly
only
a
nominal
passage
over
into
manifestation
and
is
even
there
a
return
into
itself
so
far
as
knowledge
which
has
not
shaken
off
its
original
quality
of
mere
knowledge
is
only
abstract
or
formal
the
goal
of
mind
is
to
give
it
objective
fulfilment
and
thus
at
the
same
time
produce
its
freedom
the
development
here
meant
is
not
that
of
the
individual
which
has
a
certain
anthropological
character
where
faculties
and
forces
are
regarded
as
successively
emerging
and
presenting
themselves
in
external
existencea
series
of
steps
on
the
ascertainment
on
which
there
was
for
a
long
time
great
stress
laid
by
the
system
of
condillac
as
if
a
conjectural
natural
emergence
could
exhibit
the
origin
of
these
faculties
and
explain
them
in
condillacs
method
there
is
an
unmistakable
intention
to
show
how
the
several
modes
of
mental
activity
could
be
made
intelligible
without
losing
sight
of
mental
unity
and
to
exhibit
their
necessary
interconnexion
but
the
categories
employed
in
doing
so
are
of
a
wretched
sort
their
ruling
principle
is
that
the
sensible
is
taken
and
with
justice
as
the
prius
or
the
initial
basis
but
that
the
later
phases
that
follow
this
startingpoint
present
themselves
as
emerging
in
a
solely
affirmative
manner
and
the
negative
aspect
of
mental
activity
by
which
this
material
is
transmuted
into
mind
and
destroyed
as
a
sensible
is
misconceived
and
overlooked
as
the
theory
of
condillac
states
it
the
sensible
is
not
merely
the
empirical
first
but
is
left
as
if
it
were
the
true
and
essential
foundation
similarly
if
the
activities
of
mind
are
treated
as
mere
manifestations
forces
perhaps
in
terms
stating
their
utility
or
suitability
for
some
other
interest
of
head
or
heart
there
is
no
indication
of
the
true
final
aim
of
the
whole
business
that
can
only
be
the
intelligible
unity
of
mind
and
its
activity
can
only
have
itself
as
aim
ie
its
aim
can
only
be
to
get
rid
of
the
form
of
immediacy
or
subjectivity
to
reach
and
get
hold
of
itself
and
to
liberate
itself
to
itself
in
this
way
the
socalled
faculties
of
mind
as
thus
distinguished
are
only
to
be
treated
as
steps
of
this
liberation
and
this
is
the
only
rational
mode
of
studying
the
mind
and
its
various
activities

443
as
consciousness
has
for
its
object
the
stage
which
preceded
it
viz
the
natural
soul

413
so
mind
has
or
rather
makes
consciousness
its
object
ie
whereas
consciousness
is
only
the
virtual
identity
of
the
ego
with
its
other

415
the
mind
realises
that
identity
as
the
concrete
unity
which
it
and
it
only
knows
its
productions
are
governed
by
the
principle
of
all
reason
that
the
contents
are
at
once
potentially
existent
and
are
the
minds
own
in
freedom
thus
if
we
consider
the
initial
aspect
of
mind
that
aspect
is
twofoldas
being
and
as
its
own
by
the
one
the
mind
finds
in
itself
something
which
is
by
the
other
it
affirms
it
to
be
only
its
own
the
way
of
mind
is
therefore
a
to
be
theoretical
it
has
to
do
with
the
rational
as
its
immediate
affection
which
it
must
render
its
own
or
it
has
to
free
knowledge
from
its
presupposedness
and
therefore
from
its
abstractness
and
make
the
affection
subjective
when
the
affection
has
been
rendered
its
own
and
the
knowledge
consequently
characterised
as
free
intelligence
ie
as
having
its
full
and
free
characterisation

itself

in

its
own
and
is
immediately
willed
and
it
proceeds
next
to
liberate
its
volition
from
its
subjectivity
which
is
the
onesided
form
of
its
contents
so
that
it
c
confronts
itself
as
free
mind
and
thus
gets
rid
of
both
its
defects
of
onesidedness

444
the

out

therefore
the

follows
from

that
it

absurd
to
speak

at

of
the

it

makes
the

the

to
an

which
as
intelligence
finds
itself
so
characterisedis
1
an
inarticulate
embryonic
life
in
which
it
is
to
itself
as
it
were
palpable
and
has
the
whole
material
of
its
knowledge
in
consequence
of
the
immediacy
in
which
it
is
thus
originally
it
is
in
this
stage
only
as
an
individual
and
possesses
a
vulgar
subjectivity
it
thus
appears
as
mind
in
the
guise
of
feeling
if
feeling
formerly
turned
up

399
as
a
mode
of
the
souls
existence
the
finding
of
it
or
its
immediacy
was
in
that
case
essentially
to
be
conceived
as
a
congenital
or
corporeal
condition
whereas
at
present
it
is
only
to
be
taken
abstractly
in
the
general
sense
of
immediacy

447
the
characteristic
form
of
feeling
is
that
though
it
is
a
mode
of
some
affection
this
mode
is
simple
hence
feeling
even
should
its
import
be
most
sterling
and
true
has
the
form
of
casual
particularitynot
to
mention
that
its
import
may
also
be
the
most
scanty
and
most
untrue
it
is
commonly
enough
assumed
that
mind
has
in
its
feeling
the
material
of
its
ideas
but
the
statement
is
more
usually
understood
in
a
sense
the
opposite
of
that
which
it
has
here
in
contrast
with
the
simplicity
of
feeling
it
is
usual
rather
to
assume
that
the
primary
mental
phase
is
judgment
generally
or
the
distinction
of
consciousness
into
subject
and
object
and
the
special
quality
of
sensation
is
derived
from
an
independent
object
external
or
internal
with
us
in
the
truth
of
mind
the
mere
consciousness
point
of
view
as
opposed
to
true
mental
idealism
is
swallowed
up
and
the
matter
of
feeling
has
rather
been
supposed
already
as
immanent
in
the
mindit
is
commonly
taken
for
granted
that
as
regards
content
there
is
more
in
feeling
than
in
thought
this
being
specially
affirmed
of
moral
and
religious
feelings
now
the
material
which
the
mind
as
it
feels
is
to
itself
is
here
the
result
and
the
mature
result
of
a
fully
organised
reason
hence
under
the
head
of
feeling
is
comprised
all
rational
and
indeed
all
spiritual
content
whatever
but
the
form
of
selfish
singleness
to
which
feeling
reduces
the
mind
is
the
lowest
and
worst
vehicle
it
can
haveone
in
which
it
is
not
found
as
a
free
and
infinitely
universal
principle
but
rather
as
subjective
and
private
in
content
and
value
entirely
contingent
trained
and
sterling
feeling
is
the
feeling
of
an
educated
mind
which
has
acquired
the
consciousness
of
the
true
differences
of
things
of
their
essential
relationships
and
real
characters
and
it
is
with
such
a
mind
that
this
rectified
material
enters
into
its
feeling
and
receives
this
form
feeling
is
the
immediate
as
it
were
the
closest
contact
in
which
the
thinking
subject
can
stand
to
a
given
content
against
that
content
the
subject
reacts
first
of
all
with
its
particular
selffeeling
which
though
it
may
be
of
more
sterling
value
and
of
wider
range
than
a
onesided
intellectual
standpoint
may
just
as
likely
be
narrow
and
poor
and
in
any
case
is
the
form
of
the
particular
and
subjective
if
a
man
on
any
topic
appeals
not
to
the
nature
and
notion
of
the
thing
or
at
least
to
reasonsto
the
generalities
of
common
sensebut
to
his
feeling
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
let
him
alone
because
by
his
behaviour
he
refuses
to
have
any
lot
or
part
in
common
rationality
and
shuts
himself
up
in
his
own
isolated
subjectivityhis
private
and
particular
self

448
2
as
this
immediate
finding
is
broken
up
into
elements
we
have
the
one
factor
in
attentionthe
abstract
identical
direction
of
mind
in
feeling
as
also
in
all
other
more
advanced
developments

itan
active
selfcollectionthe
factor
of
fixing
it
as
our
own
but
with
an
as
yet
only
nominal
autonomy
of
intelligence
apart
from
such
attention
there
is
nothing
for
the
mind
the
other
factor
is
to
invest
the
special
quality
of
feeling
as
contrasted
with
this
inwardness
of
mind
with
the
character
of
something
existent
but
as
a
negative
or
as
the
abstract
otherness
of
itself
intelligence
thus
defines
the
content
of
sensation
as
something
that
is
out
of
itself
projects
it
into
time
and
space
which
are
the
forms
in
which
it
is
intuitive
to
the
view
of
consciousness
the

is
only
an
object

when
intelligence
reaches
a
concrete
unity
of
the
two
factors
that
is
to
say
when
it
is
at
once
selfcollected
in
this
externally
existing
material
and
yet
in
this
selfcollectedness
sunk
in
the
outofselfness
it
is

or
mental
vision

450
at
and
towards
this

intelligence
no
less
essentially
directs
its
attention
in
this
its
immediacy
it
is
an
awaking
to
itself
a
recollection
of
itself
thus
intuition
becomes
a
concretion
of
the
material

its

representation
is
this
recollected

inwardised
intuition
and
as
such
is
the
middle
between
that
stage
of
intelligence
where
it
finds
itself
immediately
subject
to
modification
and
that
where
intelligence
is
in
its
freedom
or
as
thought
the
representation
is
the
property
of
intelligence
with
a
preponderating
subjectivity
however
as
its
right
of
property
is
still
conditioned
by
contrast
with
the
immediacy
and
the
representation
cannot
as
it
stands
be
said
to
be
the
path
of
intelligence
in
representations
is
to
render
the
immediacy
inward
to
invest
itself
with
intuitive
action
in
itself
and
at
the
same
time
to
get
rid
of
the
subjectivity
of
the
inwardness
and
inwardly
divest
itself
of
it
so
as
to
be
in
itself
in
an
externality
of
its
own
but
as
representation
begins
from
intuition
and
the
readyfound
material
of
intuition
the
intuitional
contrast
still
continues
to
affect
its
activity
and
makes
its
concrete
products
still
syntheses
which
do
not
grow
to
the
concrete

loses
the
full
complement

we
may

the

a

of
infinitely
many

without

from
the
one
point
of
view
the
universal
postulate
which
bids
us
treat
the
notion
as
concrete
in
the
way
we
treat
eg
the
germ
as
affirmatively
containing
in
virtual
possibility
all
the
qualities
that
come
into
existence
in
the
subsequent
development
of
the
tree
inability
to
grasp
a
universal
like
this
which
though
intrinsically
concrete
still
continues
simple
is
what
has
led
people
to
talk
about
special
fibres
and
areas
as
receptacles
of
particular
ideas
it
was
felt
that
what
was
diverse
should
in
the
nature
of
things
have
a
local
habitation
peculiar
to
itself
but
whereas
the
reversion
of
the
germ
from
its
existing
specialisations
to
its
simplicity
in
a
purely
potential
existence
takes
place
only
in
another

the
fruit

qu
intelligence
shows
the
potential
coming
to
free
existence
in
its
development
and
yet
at
the
same
time
collecting
itself
in
its
inwardness
hence
from
the
other
point
of
view
intelligence
is
to
be
conceived
as
this
subconscious
mine
ie
as
the
existent
universal
in
which
the
different
has
not
yet
been
realised
in
its
separations
and
it
is
indeed
this
potentiality
which
is
the
first
form
of
universality
offered
in
mental
representation

454
3
an
image
thus
abstractly
treasured
up
needs
if
it
is
to
exist
an
actual
intuition
and
what
is
strictly
called
remembrance
is
the
reference
of
the
image
to
an
intuitionand
that
as
a
subsumption
of
the
immediate
single
intuition
impression
under
what
is
in
point
of
form
universal
under
the
representation
idea
with
the
same
content
thus
intelligence
recognises
the
specific
sensation
and
the
intuition
of
it
as
what
is
already
its
ownin
them
it
is
still
within
itself
at
the
same
time
it
is
aware
that
what
is
only
its
primarily
internal
image
is
also
an
immediate
object
of
intuition
by
which
it
is
authenticated
the
image
which
in
the
mine
of
intelligence
was
only
its
property
now
that
it
has
been
endued
with
externality
comes
actually
into
its
possession
and
so
the
image
is
at
once
rendered
distinguishable
from
the
intuition
and
separable
from
the
blank
night
in
which
it
was
originally
submerged
intelligence
is
thus
the
force
which
can
give
forth
its
property
and
dispense
with
external
intuition
for
its
existence
in
it
this
synthesis
of
the
internal
image
with
the
recollected
existence
is
representation
proper
by
this
synthesis
the
internal
now
has
the
qualification
of
being
able
to
be
presented

the
intelligence
which
is

the

it
is
solely
in
the

subject
where

treasured
up
that
the
image
has
the
individuality
in
which
the
features
composing
it
are
conjoined
whereas
their
original
concretion
ie
at
first
only
in
space
and
time
as
a
unit
of
intuition
has
been
broken
up
the

reproduced
belonging
as
it
does
to
the

of

and
an
output
from
its
universal

a

supply
the

for
the
images
which
according
to

are
more
abstract
or
more
concrete
ideas
the
socalled
laws
of
the
association
of
ideas
were
objects
of
great
interest
especially
during
that
outburst
of
empirical
psychology
which
was
contemporaneous
with
the
decline
of
philosophy
in
the
first
place
it

not
ideas
properly
so
called
which
are
associated
secondly
these
modes
of
relation
are
not
laws
just
for
the
reason
that
there
are
so
many
laws
about
the

thing
as
to
suggest
a
caprice
and
a
contingency
opposed
to
the
very
nature
of

it
is
a
matter
of
chance
whether
the

of

is
something
pictorial

and
consequence
the

images

it

true
of

that
it
finds
its

and
the
universality
which
the

qu

the

frequently
explained
as
the
incidence
of
many
similar
images
one
upon
another
and
is
supposed
to
be
thus
made
intelligible
if
this
superimposing
is
to
be
no
mere
accident
and
without

a

something

at

the

this

by

gives

under
the
already
internalised
image

453

thus
even
the
association
of
ideas
is
to
be
treated
as
a
subsumption
of
the
individual
under
the

their

here
intelligence

more
than
merely
a

form
its
inwardness

an
internally

with
a

from
some

some

concept
or

principle
so
far
as
we
may
by
anticipation
speak
of
such
intelligence
is
the
power
which
wields
the

of
images

it

till
creative
imagination
that
intelligence
ceases
to
be
the
vague
mine
and
the
universal
and
becomes
an
individuality
a
concrete
subjectivity
in
which
the
selfreference
is
defined
both
to
being
and
to

the

of

are
on

recognised
as
such

of
the
minds

with
the

of

what
further
and
more

they
have
is
a
matter
for
other
departments
for
the

this
internal

of

is
only
to
be
looked
at
in
these
abstract
aspectsimagination
when
regarded
as
the
agency
of
this
unification
is
reason
but
only
a
nominal
reason
because
the
matter
or
theme
it
embodies
is
to
imagination
qu
imagination
a
matter
of
indifference
whilst
reason
qu
reason
also
insists
upon
the
truth
of
its
content
another
point
calling
for
special
notice
is
that
when
imagination
elevates
the
internal
meaning
to
an
image
and
intuition
and
this
is
expressed
by
saying
that
it
gives
the
former
the
character
of
an
existent
the
phrase
must
not
seem
surprising
that
intelligence
makes
itself
be
as
a
thing
for
its
ideal
import
is
itself
and
so
is
the
aspect
which
it
imposes
upon
it
the
image
produced
by
imagination
of
an
object
is
a
bare
mental
or
subjective
intuition

the
sign
or
symbol

adds

and
in

completes
so
far
as
it
is
concerned
this
form
of
being

458
in
this
unity
initiated
by
intelligence
of
an
independent
representation
with
an
intuition
the
matter
of
the
latter
is
in
the
first
instance
something
accepted
somewhat
immediate
or
given
eg
the
colour
of
the
cockade
c
but
in
the
fusion
of
the
two
elements
the
intuition
does
not
count
positively
or
as
representing
itself
but
as
representative
of
something
else
it
is
an
image
which
has
received
as
its
soul
and
meaning
an
independent
mental
representation
this
intuition
is
the
sign
the
sign
is
some
immediate
intuition
representing
a
totally
different
import
from
what
naturally
belongs
to
it
it
is
the
pyramid
into
which
a
foreign
soul
has
been
conveyed
and
where
it
is
conserved
the
sign
is
different
from
the
symbol
for
in
the
symbol
the
original
characters
in
essence
and
conception
of
the
visible
object
are
more
or
less
identical
with
the
import
which
it
bears
as
symbol
whereas
in
the
sign
strictly
socalled
the
natural
attributes
of
the
intuition
and
the
connotation
of
which
it
is
a
sign
have
nothing
to
do
with
each
other
intelligence
therefore
gives
proof
of
wider
choice
and
ampler
authority
in
the
use
of
intuitions
when
it
treats
them
as
designatory
significative
rather
than
as
symbolical

shown
on
this
point
that
they
contain
a

elaborate

are
lost

have
been
largely
obliterated
in

it
seems
as
if
the
language
of
the
most
civilised

has
the
most
imperfect
grammar
and

we

the

in

a

impracticable
sensible
objects
no

admit
of

as
regards
signs
for
mental
objects
the
progress
of
thought
and
the
continual
development
of
logic
lead
to
changes
in
the
views
of
their
internal
relations
and
thus
also
of
their
nature
and
this
would
involve
the
rise
of
a
new
hieroglyphical
denotation
even
in
the
case
of

it
happens
that
their
names
ie
their
signs
in
vocal
language
are
frequently
changed
as
eg
in
chemistry
and
mineralogy
now
that
it
has
been
forgotten
what
names
properly
are
viz
externalities
which
of
themselves
have
no
sense
and
only
get
signification
as
signs
and
now
that
instead
of
names
proper
people
ask
for
terms
expressing
a
sort
of
definition
which
is
frequently
changed
capriciously
and
fortuitously
the
denomination

the
composite
name

of

with

to
the

or
other
supposed
specific
property
it
is
only
a
stationary
civilisation
like
the
chinese
which
admits
of
the
hieroglyphic

of
that
nation
and
its
method
of
writing
moreover
can
only
be
the
lot
of
that
small
part
of
a
nation
which
is
in
exclusive
possession
of
mental
culturethe
progress
of
the
vocal
language
depends
most
closely
on
the
habit
of
alphabetical
writing
by
means
of
which
only
does
vocal
language
acquire
the
precision
and
purity
of
its
articulation
the
imperfection
of
the
chinese
vocal
language
is
notorious
numbers
of
its
words
possess
several
utterly
different
meanings
as
many
as
ten
and
twenty
so
that
in
speaking
the
distinction
is
made
perceptible
merely
by
accent
and
intensity
by
speaking
low
and
soft
or
crying
out
the
european
learning
to
speak
chinese
falls
into
the
most
ridiculous
blunders
before
he
has
mastered
these
absurd
refinements
of
accentuation
perfection
here
consists
in
the
opposite
of
that
parler
sans
accent
which
in
europe
is
justly
required
of
an
educated
speaker
the
hieroglyphic
mode
of
writing
keeps
the
chinese
vocal
language
from
reaching
that
objective
precision
which
is
gained
in
articulation
by
alphabetic

it

analysed
the

its

primary

which
the

at
the

time
that
in
this
elementary
phase
it
acquires
complete
precision

thus
alphabetic
writing
retains
at
the

advantage
of

the

an

analysis
of

thus
a
theory
readily
arises
that
all
ideas
may
be
reduced
to
their
elements
or
simple
logical
terms
so
that
from
the
elementary
signs
chosen
to
express
these
as
in
the
case
of
the
chinese
koua
the
simple
straight
stroke
and
the

be
generated
by
their

of

misled
leibnitz
to
regard
it
as

to

rather
in
antagonism
with
the
fundamental
desideratum
of
languagethe

to
want
a
name
means
that
for
the
immediate
idea
which
however
ample
a
connotation
it
may
include
is
still
for
the
mind
simple
in
the
name
we
require
a
simple
immediate
sign
which
for
its
own
sake
does
not
suggest
anything
and
has
for
its
sole
function
to
signify
and
represent
sensibly
the
simple
idea
as
such
it
is
not
merely
the
imageloving
and
imagelimited
intelligence
that
lingers
over
the
simplicity
of
ideas

redintegrates
them
from
the
more
abstract
factors
into
which
they
have
been

too
reduces
to
the
form
of
a

both
alike

such

simple
in

signs
which
though
consisting
of
several
letters
or
syllables
and
even
decomposed
into
such
yet
do
not
exhibit
a
combination
of
several
ideaswhat
has
been
stated
is
the
principle
for
settling
the
value
of
these
written
languages
it
also
follows
that
in
hieroglyphics
the
relations
of
concrete
mental
ideas
to
one
another
must
necessarily
be
tangled
and
perplexed
and
that
the
analysis
of
these
and
the
proximate
results
of
such
analysis
must
again
be
analysed
appears
to
be
possible
in
the
most
various
and
divergent
ways
every
divergence
in
analysis
would
give
rise
to
another
formation
of
the
written
name
just
as
in
modern
times
as
already
noted
even
in
the
region
of

muriatic
acid

a

require
a
philosophy
as
stationary
as
is
the
civilisation
of
the
chinese
what
has
been
said
shows
the
inestimable
and
not
sufficiently
appreciated
educational
value
of
learning
to
read
and
write
an
alphabetic
character
it
leads
the
mind
from
the
sensibly
concrete
image
to
attend
to
the
more
formal
structure
of
the
vocal
word
and
its
abstract
elements
and
contributes
much
to
give
stability
and
independence
to
the
inward
realm
of
mental
life
acquired
habit
subsequently
effaces
the
peculiarity
by
which
alphabetic
writing
appears
in
the
interest
of
vision
as
a
roundabout
way
to
ideas
by
means
of
audibility
it
makes
them
a
sort
of
hieroglyphic
to
us
so
that
in
using
them
we
need
not
consciously
realise
them
by
means
of
tones
whereas
people
unpractised
in
reading
utter
aloud
what
they
read
in
order
to
catch
its
meaning
in
the
sound
thus
while
with
the
faculty
which
transformed
alphabetic
writing
into
hieroglyphics
the
capacity
of
abstraction
gained
by
the
first
practice
remains
hieroglyphic
reading
is
of
itself
a
deaf
reading
and
a
dumb
writing
it
is
true
that
the
audible
which
is
in
time
and
the
visible
which
is
in
space
each
have
their
own
basis
one
no
less
authoritative
than
the
other
but
in
the
case
of
alphabetic

there
is
only
a
single
basis
the
two
aspects

the

not
made
a
complete
and
simple
return

intelligence

the

single
plain
truth
of
its
particular
selfdivestments
and
its
consummated
appropriation
of
them
abolishes
that
distinction
between
meaning
and

this
extreme
inwardising
of
representation
is
the
supreme
selfdivestment
of
intelligence
in
which
it
renders
itself
the
mere

the
universal

of

so

as

a
composition
is
as
we
know
not
thoroughly
conned
by
rote
until
one
attaches
no
meaning
to
the
words
the
recitation
of
what
has
been
thus
got
by
heart
is
therefore
of
course
accentless
the
correct
accent
if
it
is
introduced
suggests
the
meaning
but
this
introduction
of
the
signification
of
an
idea
disturbs
the
mechanical
nexus
and
therefore
easily
throws
out
the
reciter
the
faculty
of
conning
by
rote
series
of
words
with
no
principle
governing
their
succession
or
which
are
separately
meaningless
eg
a
series
of
proper
names
is
so
supremely
marvellous
because
it
is
the
very
essence
of
mind
to
have
its
wits
about
it
whereas
in
this
case
the
mind
is
estranged
in
itself
and
its
action
is
like
machinery
but
it
is
only
as
uniting
subjectivity
with
objectivity
that
the
mind
has
its
wits
about
it
whereas
in
the
case
before
us
after
it
has
in
intuition
been
at
first
so
external
as
to
pick
up
its
facts
readymade
and
in
representation
inwardises
or
recollects
this
datum
and
makes
it
its
ownit
proceeds
as
memory
to
make
itself
external
in
itself
so
that
what
is
its
own
assumes
the
guise
of
something
found
thus
one
of
the
two
dynamic
factors
of
thought
viz
objectivity
is
here
put
in
intelligence
itself
as
a
quality
of
itit
is
only
a
step
further
to
treat
memory
as
mechanicalthe
act
implying
no
intelligencein
which
case
it
is
only
justified
by
its
uses
its
indispensability
perhaps
for
other
purposes
and
functions
of
mind
but
by
so
doing
we
overlook
the
proper
signification
it
has
in
the
mind

it
is
to

at

that

in
this
manner
the
passage
into

which
no
longer
has
a
meaning
ie
its
objectivity
is
no
longer
severed
from
the

and
its

not

not

of

that
the

is
their

exercised

the

empirical
statements
of

help
little
towards
a
knowledge
of
what

intrinsically
is
to

the

of

and
to
understand
its
organic
interconnexion
with

one
of
the
hardest
points
and
hitherto
one
quite
unregarded
in
the
theory
of

memory
qu
memory
is
itself
the

external

merely

thus

a
complementary
element
the

from

is
to
our
view
and
implicitly
the
identity
of
reason
with
this
existential
mode
an
identity
from
which
it
follows
that

recognitive
it
cognises
an
intuition

only
because
that

already
its
own

454
and
in
the
name
it
rediscovers
the

462

now
it
finds
its
universal

intelligence
which

appropriates

that
it

completed
taking
possession
in
its

the
last
negation
of

has
implicitly

thus
thought
as
free
notion
is
now
also
free
in
point
of

when
intelligence
is

determinative
of
the

steps

it

on
the

generality
supplying
its
own

the

is
selfpossessed
and
in
the
widest
sense
free
this
is
its
characteristic
trait
its
finitude
lies
in
the
formalism
that
the
spontaneity
of
its
selffulfilment
means
no
more
than
a
general
and
abstract
ownness
not

it
is
the
function
of
the
essential
will
to
bring
liberty
to
exist
in
the
formal
will
and
it
is
therefore
the
aim
of
that
formal
will
to
fill
itself
with
its
essential
nature
ie
to
make
liberty
its
pervading
character

as

as
its
sphere
of

the
essential
freedom
of

is

must
always
be
a
thought
hence
the
way
by
which
will
can
make
itself
objective
mind
is
to
rise
to
be
a

only
have
as
it

itself
true
liberty
in
the
shape
of

in
the
will
finding
its
purpose
in
a
universal
content
not
in
subjective
or
selfish
interests
but
such
a
content
is
only
possible
in

through

it

nothing

in
the

the

by
the

offers
to
the

that

selfdetermination
being
itself
immediate
is
not
at

elevated
into
a

the

therefore
virtually
constitutes

the
autonomy
of
the
practical
mind
at
first
is
immediate
and
therefore
formal
ie
it
finds
itself
as
an
individuality
determined
in
its
inward
nature
it
is
thus
practical
feeling
or
instinct
of
action
in
this
phase
as
it
is
at
bottom
a
subjectivity
simply
identical
with
reason
it
has
no
doubt
a
rational
content
but
a
content
which
as
it
stands
is
individual
and
for
that
reason
also
natural
contingent
and
subjectivea
content
which
may
be
determined
quite
as
much
by
mere
personalities
of
want
and
opinion
c
and
by
the
subjectivity
which
selfishly
sets
itself
against
the
universal
as
it
may
be
virtually
in
conformity
with
reason
an
appeal
is
sometimes
made
to
the
sense
feeling
of
right
and
morality
as
well
as
of
religion
which
man
is
alleged
to
possessto
his
benevolent
dispositionsand
even
to
his
heart
generallyie
to
the
subject
so
far
as
the
various
practical
feelings
are
in
it
all
combined
so
far
as
this
appeal
implies
1
that
these
ideas
are
immanent
in
his
own
self
and
2
that
when
feeling
is
opposed
to
the
logical
understanding
it
and
not
the
partial
abstractions
of
the
latter
may
be
the
totalitythe
appeal
has
a
legitimate
meaning
but
on
the
other
hand
feeling
too
may
be
onesided
unessential
and
bad
the
rational
which
exists
in
the
shape
of
rationality
when
it
is
apprehended
by
thought
is
the
same
content
as
the
good
practical
feeling
has
but
presented
in
its
universality
and
necessity
in
its
objectivity
and
truth
thus
it
is
on
the
one
hand
silly
to
suppose
that
in
the
passage
from
feeling
to
law
and
duty
there
is
any
loss
of
import
and
excellence
it
is
this
passage
which
lets
feeling
first
reach
its
truth
it
is
equally
silly
to
consider
intellect
as
superfluous
or
even
harmful
to
feeling
heart
and
will
the
truth
and
what
is
the
same
thing
the
actual
rationality
of
the
heart
and
will
can
only
be
at
home
in
the
universality
of
intellect
and
not
in
the
singleness
of
feeling
as
feeling
if
feelings
are
of
the
right
sort
it
is
because
of
their
quality
or
contentwhich
is
right
only
so
far
as
it
is
intrinsically
universal
or
has
its
source
in
the
thinking
mind
the
difficulty
for
the
logical
intellect
consists
in
throwing
off
the
separation
it
has
arbitrarily
imposed
between
the
several
faculties
of
feeling
and
thinking
mind
and
coming
to
see
that
in
the
human
being
there
is
only
one
reason
in
feeling
volition
and
thought
another
difficulty
connected
with
this
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
ideas
which
are
the
special
property
of
the
thinking
mind
viz
god
law
and
morality
can
also
be
felt
but
feeling
is
only
the
form
of
the
immediate
and
peculiar
individuality
of
the
subject
in
which
these
facts
like
any
other
objective
facts
which
consciousness
also
sets
over
against
itself
may
be
placed
on
the
other
hand
it
is
suspicious
or
even
worse
to
cling
to
feeling
and
heart
in
place
of
the
intelligent
rationality
of
law
right
and
duty
because
all
that
the
former
holds
more
than
the
latter
is
only
the
particular
subjectivity
with
its
vanity
and
caprice
for
the
same
reason
it
is
out
of
place
in
a
scientific
treatment
of
the
feelings
to
deal
with
anything
beyond
their
form
and
to
discuss
their
content
for
the
latter
when
thought
is
precisely
what
constitutes
in
their
universality
and
necessity
the
rights
and
duties
which
are
the
true
works
of
mental
autonomy
so
long
as
we
study
practical
feelings
and
dispositions
specially
we
have
only
to
deal
with
the
selfish
bad
and
evil
it
is
these
alone
which
belong
to
the
individuality
which
retains
its
opposition
to
the
universal
their
content
is
the
reverse
of
rights
and
duties
and
precisely
in
that
way

the
ought
of
practical
feeling
is
the
claim
of
its
essential
autonomy
to
control
some
existing
mode
of
factwhich
is
assumed
to
be
worth
nothing
save
as
adapted
to
that
claim
but
as
both
in
their
immediacy
lack
objective
determination
this
relation
of
the
requirement
to
existent
fact
is

the
celebrated
question
as
to
the
origin
of
evil
in
the
world
so
far
at
least
as
evil
is
understood
to
mean
what
is
disagreeable
and
painful
merely
arises
on
this
stage
of
the
formal
practical

evil
is
nothing

the
incompatibility
between
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
ought
is
an
ambiguous
termindeed
infinitely
so
considering
that
casual
aims
may
also
come
under
the
form
of
ought
but
where
the
objects
sought
are
thus
casual
evil
only
executes
what
is
rightfully
due
to
the
vanity
and
nullity
of
their
planning
for
they
themselves

which
is
separated
from

they
also
have

a

and
thus
they
are
the
contradiction

in

still
a

identical
with

modenatural

should
however
the
totality
of
the

throw
itself
into
a
single
one
of
the
many
restricted
forms
of
impulse
each
being
always
in
conflict
to

it
is
passion

474
inclinations
and
passions
embody
the
same
constituent
features
as
the
practical
feeling
thus
while
on
one
hand
they
are
based
on
the
rational
nature
of
the
mind
they
on
the
other
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
still
subjective
and
single
will
are
infected
with
contingency
and
appear
as
particular
to
stand
to
the
individual
and
to
each
other
in
an
external
relation
and
with
a
necessity
which
creates
bondage
the
special
note
in
passion
is
its
restriction
to
one
special
mode
of
volition
in
which
the
whole
subjectivity
of
the
individual
is

the
value
of

it

in

passion

aim
and

nothing
great
has
been
and
nothing

can
be
accomplished
without
passion
it
is
only
a
dead
too
often
indeed
a
hypocritical
moralising
which
inveighs
against
the
form
of
passion
as
such
but
with
regard
to
the
inclinations
the
question
is
directly
raised
which
are
good
and
badup
to
what
degree
the
good
continue
goodand
as
there
are
many
each
with
its
private
range
in
what
way
have
they
being
all
in
one
subject
and
hardly
all
as
experience
shows
admitting
of
gratification
to
suffer
at
least
reciprocal
restriction
and
first
of
all
as
regards
the
numbers
of
these
impulses
and
propensities
the
case
is
much
the
same
as
with
the
psychical
powers
whose
aggregate
is
to
form
the
mind
theoreticalan
aggregate
which
is
now
increased
by
the
host
of
impulses
the
nominal
rationality
of
impulse
and
propensity
lies
merely
in
their
general
impulse
not
to
be
subjective
merely
but
to
get
realised
overcoming
the
subjectivity
by
the
subjects
own
agency
their
genuine
rationality
cannot
reveal
its
secret
to
a
method
of
outer
reflection
which
presupposes
a
number
of
independent
innate
tendencies
and
immediate
instincts
and
therefore
is
wanting
in
a
single
principle
and
final
purpose
for
them
but
the
immanent
reflection
of
mind
itself
carries
it
beyond
their
particularity
and
their
natural
immediacy
and
gives
their
contents
a
rationality
and
objectivity
in
which
they
exist
as
necessary
ties
of
social
relation
as
rights
and
duties
it
is
this
objectification
which
evinces
their
real
value
their
mutual
connexions
and
their
truth
and
thus
it
was
a
true
perception
when
plato
especially
including
as
he
did
the
minds
whole
nature
under
its
right
showed
that
the
full
reality
of
justice
could
be
exhibited
only
in
the
objective
phase
of
justice
viz
in
the
construction
of
the
state
as
the
ethical
life
the
answer
to
the
question
therefore
what
are
the
good
and
rational
propensities
and
how
they
are
to
be
coordinated
with
each
other
resolves
itself
into
an
exposition
of
the
laws
and
forms
of
common
life
produced
by
the
mind
when
developing
itself
as
objective
minda
development
in
which
the
content
of
autonomous
action
loses
its
contingency
and
optionality
the
discussion
of
the
true
intrinsic
worth
of
the
impulses
inclinations
and
passions
is
thus
essentially
the
theory
of
legal
moral
and
social
duties

475
the
subject
is
the
act
of
satisfying
impulses
an
act
of
at
least
formal
rationality
as
it
translates
them
from
the
subjectivity
of
content
which
so
far
is
purpose
into
objectivity
where
the
subject
is
made
to
close
with
itself
if
the
content
of
the
impulse
is
distinguished
as
the
thing
or
business
from
this
act
of
carrying
it
out
and
we
regard
the
thing
which
has
been
brought
to
pass
as
containing
the
element
of
subjective
individuality
and
its
action
this
is
what
is
called
the
interest
nothing
therefore
is
brought
about
without
interest
an
action
is
an
aim
of
the
subject
and
it
is
his
agency
too
which
executes
this
aim
unless
the
subject
were
in
this
way
in
the
most
disinterested
action
ie
unless
he
had
an
interest
in
it
there
would
be
no
action
at
allthe
impulses
and
inclinations
are
sometimes
depreciated
by
being
contrasted
with
the
baseless
chimera
of
a
happiness
the
free
gift
of
nature
where
wants
are
supposed
to
find
their
satisfaction
without
the
agent
doing
anything
to
produce
a
conformity
between
immediate
existence
and
his
own
inner
requirements
they
are
sometimes
contrasted
on
the
whole
to
their
disadvantage
with
the
morality
of
duty
for
dutys
sake
but
impulse
and
passion
are
the
very
lifeblood
of
all
action
they
are
needed
if
the
agent
is
really
to
be
in
his
aim
and
the
execution
thereof
the
morality
concerns
the
content
of
the
aim
which
as
such
is
the
universal
an
inactive
thing
that
finds
its
actualising
in
the
agent
and
finds
it
only
when
the
aim
is
immanent

the
will
as
thinking
and

distinguishes
itself
from

no

therefore
it

falls
a

as
the

none

so
little

remembering
that

we
can
see
how
misconceptions
about

are
of
tremendous
consequence
in
practice
when
individuals

nations
have
once
got
in
their

the
abstract
concept
of
fullblown
liberty
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
its
uncontrollable
strength
just
because
it
is
the

that
as

whole
continents
africa

have
never

are
without
it
still
the
greeks

romans
plato
and
aristotle
even
the
stoics
did
not
have
it
on

they

the

in
the
knowledge
of
their
identity
as

are
simultaneously

independent
for

my
will
has
its
definite
recognisable
existence
in
the
thing
by
the
immediate
bodily
act
of
taking
possession
or
by
the

of

it
may
be
by

492
the
casual
aspect
of
property
is
that
i
place
my
will
in
this
thing
so
far
my
will
is
arbitrary
i
can
just
as
well
put

in
it
as
notjust
as
well
withdraw
it
as
not
but
so
far
as
my
will
lies
in
a
thing
it
is
only
i
who
can
withdraw
it
it
is
only
with
my
will
that
the
thing
can
pass
to
another
whose
property
it
similarly
becomes
only
with
his

b
contract

493
the
two
wills
and
their
agreement
in
the
contract
are
as
an
internal
state
of
mind
different
from
its
realisation
in
the
performance
the
comparatively
ideal
utterance
of
contract
in
the
stipulation
contains
the
actual
surrender
of
a
property
by
the
one
its
changing
hands
and
its
acceptance
by
the
other
will
the
contract
is
thus
thoroughly
binding
it
does
not
need
the
performance
of
the
one
or
the
other
to
become
sootherwise
we
should
have
an
infinite
regress
or
infinite
division
of
thing
labour
and
time
the
utterance
in
the
stipulation
is
complete
and
exhaustive
the
inwardness
of
the
will
which
surrenders
and
the
will
which
accepts
the
property
is
in
the
realm
of
ideation
and
in
that
realm
the
word
is
deed
and
thing

462the
full
and
complete
deed
since
here
the
conscientiousness
of
the
will
does
not
come
under
consideration
as
to
whether
the
thing
is
meant
in
earnest
or
is
a
deception
and
the
will
refers
only
to
the
external
thing

494
thus
in
the
stipulation
we
have
the
substantial
being
of
the
contract
standing
out
in
distinction
from
its
real
utterance
in
the
performance
which
is
brought
down
to
a
mere
sequel
in
this
way
there
is
put
into
the
thing
or
performance
a
distinction
between
its
immediate
specific
quality
and
its
substantial
being
or
value
meaning
by
value
the
quantitative
terms
into
which
that
qualitative
feature
has
been
translated
one
piece
of
property
is
thus
made
comparable
with
another
and
may
be
made
equivalent
to
a
thing
which
is
in
quality
wholly
heterogeneous
it
is
thus
treated
in
general
as
an
abstract
universal
thing
or
commodity

495
the
contract
as
an
agreement
which
has
a
voluntary
origin
and
deals
with
a
casual
commodity
involves
at
the
same
time
the
giving
to
this
accidental
will
a
positive
fixity
this
will
may
just
as
well
not
be
conformable
to
law
right
and
in
that
case
produces
a
wrong
by
which
however
the
absolute
law
right
is
not
superseded
but
only
a
relationship
originated
of
right
to
wrong
c
right
versus
wrong

496
law
right
considered
as
the
realisation
of
liberty
in
externals
breaks
up
into
a
multiplicity
of
relations
to
this
external
sphere
and
to
other
persons

491
493
seqq
in
this
way
there
are
1
several
titles
or
grounds
at
law
of
which
seeing
that
property
both
on
the
personal
and
the
real
side
is
exclusively
individual
only
one
is
the
right
but
which
because
they
face
each
other
each
and
all
are
invested
with
a
show
of
right
against
which
the
former
is
defined
as
the
intrinsically
right

497
now
so
long
as
compared
against
this
show
the
one
intrinsically
right
still
presumed
identical
with
the
several
titles
is
affirmed
willed
and
recognised
the
only
diversity
lies
in
this
that
the
special
thing
is
subsumed
under
the
one
law
or
right
by
the
particular
will
of
these
several
persons
this
is
nave
nonmalicious
wrong
such
wrong
in
the
several
claimants
is
a
simple
negative
judgment
expressing
the
civil
suit
to
settle
it
there
is
required
a
third
judgment
which
as
the
judgment
of
the
intrinsically
right
is
disinterested
and
a
power
of
giving
the
one
right
existence
as
against
that
semblance

498
but
2
if
the
semblance
of
right
is
willed
as
such
against
right
intrinsical
by
the
particular
will
which
thus
becomes
wicked
then
the
external
recognition
of
right
is
separated
from
the
rights
true
value
and
while
the
former
only
is
respected
the
latter
is
violated
this
gives
the
wrong
of
fraudthe
infinite
judgment
as
identical

173where
the
nominal
relation
is
retained
but
the
sterling
value
is
let
slip

499
3
finally
the
particular
will
sets
itself
in
opposition
to
the
intrinsic
right
by
negating
that
right
itself
as
well
as
its
recognition
or
semblance
here
there
is
a
negatively
infinite
judgment

173
in
which
there
is
denied
the
class
as
a
whole
and
not
merely
the
particular
modein
this
case
the
apparent
recognition
thus
the
will
is
violently
wicked
and
commits
a
crime

500
as
an
outrage
on
right
such
an
action
is
essentially
and
actually
null
in
it
the
agent
as
a
volitional
and
intelligent
being
sets
up
a
lawa
law
however
which
is
nominal
and
recognised
by
him
onlya
universal
which
holds
good
for
him
and
under
which
he
has
at
the
same
time
subsumed
himself
by
his
action
to
display
the
nullity
of
such
an
act
to
carry
out
simultaneously
this
nominal
law
and
the
intrinsic
right
in
the
first
instance
by
means
of
a
subjective
individual
will
is
the
work
of
revenge
but
revenge
starting
from
the
interest
of
an
immediate
particular
personality
is
at
the
same
time
only
a
new
outrage
and
so
on
without
end
this
progression
like
the
last
abolishes
itself
in
a
third
judgment
which
is
disinterestedpunishment

501
the
instrumentality
by
which
authority
is
given
to
intrinsic
right
is

that
a
particular
will
that
of
the
judge
being
conformable
to
the
right
has
an
interest
to
turn
against
the
crime
which
in
the
first
instance
in
revenge
is
a
matter
of
chance
and

that
an
executive
power
also
in
the
first
instance
casual
negates
the
negation
of
right
that
was
created
by
the
criminal
this
negation
of
right
has
its
existence
in
the
will
of
the
criminal
and
consequently
revenge
or
punishment
directs
itself
against
the
person
or
property
of
the
criminal
and
exercises
coercion
upon
him
it
is
in
this
legal
sphere
that
coercion
in
general
has
possible
scopecompulsion
against
the
thing
in
seizing
and
maintaining
it
against
anothers
seizure
for
in
this
sphere
the
will
has
its
existence
immediately
in
externals
as
such
or
in
corporeity
and
can
be
seized
only
in
this
quarter
but
more
than
possible
compulsion
is
not
so
long
as
i
can
withdraw
myself
as
free
from
every
mode
of
existence
even
from
the
range
of
all
existence
ie
from
life
it
is
legal
only
as
abolishing
a
first
and
original
compulsion

502
a
distinction
has
thus
emerged
between
the
law
right
and
the
subjective
will
the
reality
of
right
which
the
personal
will
in
the
first
instance
gives
itself
in
immediate
wise
is
seen
to
be
due
to
the
instrumentality
of
the
subjective
willwhose
influence
as
on
one
hand
it
gives
existence
to
the
essential
right
so
may
on
the
other
cut
itself
off
from
and
oppose
itself
to
it
conversely
the
claim
of
the
subjective
will
to
be
in
this
abstraction
a
power
over
the
law
of
right
is
null
and
empty
of
itself
it
gets
truth
and
reality
essentially
only
so
far
as
that
will
in
itself
realises
the
reasonable
will
as
such
it
is
morality153
proper
the
phrase
law
of
nature
or
natural
right154
in
use
for
the
philosophy
of
law
involves
the
ambiguity
that
it
may
mean
either
right
as
something
existing
readyformed
in
nature
or
right
as
governed
by
the
nature
of
things
ie
by
the
notion
the
former
used
to
be
the
common
meaning
accompanied
with
the
fiction
of
a
state
of
nature
in
which
the
law
of
nature
should
hold
sway
whereas
the
social
and
political
state
rather
required
and
implied
a
restriction
of
liberty
and
a
sacrifice
of
natural
rights
the
real
fact
is
that
the
whole
law
and
its
every
article
are
based
on
free
personality
aloneon
selfdetermination
or
autonomy
which
is
the
very
contrary
of
determination
by
nature
the
law
of
naturestrictly
so
calledis
for
that
reason
the
predominance
of
the
strong
and
the
reign
of
force
and
a
state
of
nature
a
state
of
violence
and
wrong
of
which
nothing
truer
can
be
said
than
that
one
ought
to
depart
from
it
the
social
state
on
the
other
hand
is
the
condition
in
which
alone
right
has
its
actuality
what
is
to
be
restricted
and
sacrificed
is
just
the
wilfulness
and
violence
of
the
state
of
nature
subsection
b
the
morality
of
conscience155

503
the
free
individual
who
in
mere
law
counts
only
as
a
person
is
now
characterised
as
a
subject
a
will
reflected
into
itself
so
that
be
its
affection
what
it
may
it
is
distinguished
as
existing
in
it
as
its
own
from
the
existence
of
freedom
in
an
external
thing
because
the
affection
of
the
will
is
thus
inwardised
the
will
is
at
the
same
time
made
a
particular
and
there
arise
further
particularisations
of
it
and
relations
of
these
to
one
another
this
affection
is
partly
the
essential
and
implicit
will
the
reason
of
the
will
the
essential
basis
of
law
and
moral
life
partly
it
is
the
existent
volition
which
is
before
us
and
throws
itself
into
actual
deeds
and
thus
comes
into
relationship
with
the
former
the
subjective
will
is
morally
free
so
far
as
these
features
are
its
inward
institution
its
own
and
willed
by
it
its
utterance
in
deed
with
this
freedom
is
an
action
in
the
externality
of
which
it
only
admits
as
its
own
and
allows
to
be
imputed
to
it
so
much
as
it
has
consciously
willed
this
subjective
or
moral
freedom
is
what
a
european
especially
calls
freedom
in
virtue
of
the
right
thereto
a
man
must
possess
a
personal
knowledge
of
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil
in
general
ethical
and
religious
principles
shall
not
merely
lay
their
claim
on
him
as
external
laws
and
precepts
of
authority
to
be
obeyed
but
have
their
assent
recognition
or
even
justification
in
his
heart
sentiment
conscience
intelligence
c
the
subjectivity
of
the
will
in
itself
is
its
supreme
aim
and
absolutely
essential
to
it
the
moral
must
be
taken
in
the
wider
sense
in
which
it
does
not
signify
the
morally
good
merely
in
french
le
moral
is
opposed
to
le
physique
and
means
the
mental
or
intellectual
in
general
but
here
the
moral
signifies
volitional
mode
so
far
as
it
is
in
the
interior
of
the
will
in
general
it
thus
includes
purpose
and
intentionand
also
moral
wickedness
a
purpose156

504
so
far
as
the
action
comes
into
immediate
touch
with
existence
my
part
in
it
is
to
this
extent
formal
that
external
existence
is
also
independent
of
the
agent
this
externality
can
pervert
his
action
and
bring
to
light
something
else
than
lay
in
it
now
though
any
alteration
as
such
which
is
set
on
foot
by
the
subjects
action
is
its
deed157
still
the
subject
does
not
for
that
reason
recognise
it
as
its
action158
but
only
admits
as
its
own
that
existence
in
the
deed
which
lay
in
its
knowledge
and
will
which
was
its
purpose
only
for
that
does
it
hold
itself
responsible
b
intention
and
welfare159

505
as
regards
its
empirically
concrete
content
1
the
action
has
a
variety
of
particular
aspects
and
connexions
in
point
of
form
the
agent
must
have
known
and
willed
the
action
in
its
essential
feature
embracing
these
individual
points
this
is
the
right
of
intention
while
purpose
affects
only
the
immediate
fact
of
existence
intention
regards
the
underlying
essence
and
aim
thereof
2
the
agent
has
no
less
the
right
to
see
that
the
particularity
of
content
in
the
action
in
point
of
its
matter
is
not
something
external
to
him
but
is
a
particularity
of

the

there
are

several

the

a
dialectic

absolute

dialectic
which
superseding
this

claim

concludes
such
a

excludes
the

to
the

who
in
his

on

it
is
likewise
an
accident
whether
they
harmonise

they
ought
to

the

the

itself

therefore

the

the

that

this

the

into
the

the

at
the

the

naturally
enters

this
happens
and
has
from

happened

clearly
to
be

the

determined
through

a
futile
perfectionism
to
have
such
expectations

to
make
such

in
the
sphere
of
the

there
are
some
who
look
upon

governing

hereditary

while
the

is
held
an
order
of

employed
for
an
opposite
thesisviz
to
support
the
opinion
that
a
code
is
impossible
or
impracticable
in
this
case
there
comes
in
the
additional
absurdity
of
putting
essential

universal
provisions
in
one
class

the

the

characteristics

an
advance
into
greater
and
ever
greater
speciality

the
acumen

the
analytic
intellect

discovers

distinctions

may
give

in
proportion
to
the
gradual
advance
in
specialisation
the
interest
and
value
of
these
provisions
declines
they
fall
within
the
already
subsisting
substantial
general
laws

though
something
new

not
a

there
is
a
contrary
case

the

with

provisos

the
main
point
in

question
of

it
is
an

point
that
the
two
ingredients
of
a
judicial
cognisance
the
judgment
as
to
the
state
of
the

and
the

as
application
of
the
law
to
it
should
as
at
bottom
different
sides
be
exercised
as
different
functions
by
the
said
institution
they
are
allotted
even
to
bodies
differently
qualifiedfrom
the
one
of
which
individuals
belonging
to
the
official
judiciary
are
expressly
excluded
to
carry
this
separation
of
functions
up
to
this
separation
in
the

rests
rather
on
extraessential
considerations
the
main
point
remains
only
the
separate
performance
of
these
essentially
different
functionsit
is
a
more
important
point
whether
the
confession
of
the
accused
is
or
is
not
to
be
made
a
condition
of
penal
judgment
the
institution
of
the
jurycourt
loses
sight
of
this
condition
the
point
is
that
on
this
ground
certainty
is
completely
inseparable
from
truth
but
the
confession
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
very
acm
of
certaintygiving
which
in
its
nature
is
subjective
the
final
decision
therefore
lies
with
the
confession
to
this
therefore
the
accused
has
an
absolute
right
if
the
proof
is
to
be
made
final
and
the
judges
to
be
convinced
no
doubt
this
factor
is
incomplete
because
it
is
only
one
factor
but
still
more
incomplete
is
the
other
when
no
less
abstractly
takenviz
mere
circumstantial
evidence
the
jurors
are
essentially
judges
and
pronounce
a
judgment
in
so
far
then
as
all
they
have
to
go
on
are
such
objective
proofs
whilst
at
the
same
time

it

the

shows
traces
of
its
barbaric
origin
in
a
confusion
and
admixture
between
objective
proofs

subjective
or
socalled

is
easy
to
call
extraordinary
punishments
an
absurdity
but
the
fault
lies
rather
with
the
shallowness
which
takes
offence
at
a
mere

the

involves
the

of

the
function
of
judicial
administration
is
only
to
actualise
to
necessity
the
abstract
side
of
personal
liberty
in
civil
society
but
this
actualisation
rests
at
first
on
the
particular
subjectivity
of
the
judge
since
here
as
yet
there
is
not
found
the
necessary
unity
of
it
with
right
in
the
abstract
conversely
the
blind
necessity
of
the
system
of
wants
is
not
lifted
up
into
the

of

judicial
administration
naturally
has
no
concern
with
such
part
of
actions
and
interests
as
belongs
only
to
particularity
and
leaves
to
chance
not
only
the
occurrence
of
crimes
but
also
the
care
for
public
weal
in
civil
society
the
sole
end
is
to
satisfy
wantand
that
because
it
is
mans
want
in
a
uniform
general
way
so
as
to
secure
this
satisfaction
but
the
machinery
of
social
necessity
leaves
in
many
ways
a
casualness
about
this
satisfaction
this
is
due
to
the
variability
of
the
wants
themselves
in
which
opinion
and
subjective
goodpleasure
play
a
great
part
it
results
also
from
circumstances
of
locality
from
the
connexions
between
nation
and
nation
from
errors
and
deceptions
which
can
be
foisted
upon
single
members
of
the
social
circulation
and
are
capable
of
creating
disorder
in
itas
also
and
especially
from
the
unequal
capacity
of
individuals
to
take
advantage
of
that
general
stock
the
onward
march
of
this
necessity
also
sacrifices
the
very
particularities
by
which
it
is
brought
about
and
does
not
itself
contain
the
affirmative
aim
of
securing
the
satisfaction
of
individuals
so
far
as
concerns
them
it
may
be
far
from
beneficial
yet
here
the
individuals
are
the
morallyjustifiable
end

534
to
keep
in
view
this
general
end
to
ascertain
the
way
in
which
the
powers
composing
that
social
necessity
act
and
their
variable
ingredients
and
to
maintain
that
end
in
them
and
against
them
is
the
work
of
an
institution
which
assumes
on
one
hand
to
the
concrete
of
civil
society
the
position
of
an
external
universality
such
an
order
acts
with
the
power
of
an
external
state
which
in
so
far
as
it
is
rooted
in
the
higher
or
substantial
state
appears
as
state
police
on
the
other
hand
in
this
sphere
of
particularity
the
only
recognition
of
the
aim
of
substantial
universality
and
the
only
carrying
of
it
out
is
restricted
to
the
business
of
particular
branches
and
interests
thus
we
have
the
corporation
in
which
the
particular
citizen
in
his
private
capacity
finds
the
securing
of
his
stock
whilst
at
the
same
time
he
in
it
emerges
from
his
single
private
interest
and
has
a
conscious
activity
for
a
comparatively
universal
end
just
as
in
his
legal
and
professional
duties
he
has
his
social
morality

535
the
state
is
the
selfconscious
ethical
substance
the
unification
of
the
family
principle
with
that
of
civil
society
the
same
unity
which
is
in
the

as
a
feeling
of
love
is
its
essence
receiving
however
at
the

time
through
the
second
principle
of
conscious
and
spontaneously
active
volition
the
form
of
conscious
universality
this
universal
principle
with
all
its
evolution
in
detail
is
the
absolute
aim
and
content
of
the
knowing
subject
which
thus
identifies
itself
in
its
volition

the

they

if
stuck

in

they

prevent

the

logically
carried
out
rejects
all
differences
and
thus
allows
no
sort
of
political
condition
to
exist
liberty
and
equality
are
indeed
the
foundation
of
the
state
but
as
the
most
abstract
also
the
most
superficial
and
for
that
very
reason
naturally
the
most
familiar
it
is
important
therefore
to
study
them
closer
as
regards
first
equality
the
familiar
proposition
all
men
are
by
nature
equal
blunders
by
confusing
the
natural
with
the
notion
it
ought
rather
to
read
by
nature
men
are
only
unequal
but
the
notion
of
liberty
as
it
exists
as
such
without
further
specification
and
development
is
abstract
subjectivity
as
a
person
capable
of
property

488
this
single
abstract
feature
of
personality
constitutes
the
actual
equality
of
human
beings
but
that
this
freedom
should
exist
that
it
should
be
man
and
not
as
in
greece
rome
c
some
men
that
is
recognised
and
legally
regarded
as
a
person
is
so
little
by
nature
that
it
is
rather
only
a
result
and
product
of
the
consciousness
of
the
deepest
principle
of
mind
and
of
the
universality
and
expansion
of
this
consciousness
that
the
citizens
are
equal
before
the
law
contains
a
great
truth
but
which
so
expressed
is
a
tautology
it
only
states
that
the
legal
status
in
general
exists
that
the
laws
rule
but
as
regards
the
concrete
the
citizensbesides
their
personalityare
equal
before
the
law
only
in
these
points
when
they
are
otherwise
equal
outside
the

only
that

in

as

circle
of

presuppose
unequal
conditions
and
provide
for
the
unequal
legal
duties
and
appurtenances
resulting
therefrom
as
regards
liberty
it
is
originally
taken
partly
in
a
negative
sense
against
arbitrary
intolerance
and
lawless
treatment
partly
in
the
affirmative
sense
of
subjective
freedom
but
this
freedom
is
allowed
great
latitude
both
as
regards
the
agents
selfwill
and
action
for
his
particular
ends
and
as
regards
his
claim
to
have
a
personal
intelligence
and
a
personal
share
in
general
affairs
formerly
the
legally
defined
rights
private
as
well
as
public
rights
of
a
nation
town
c
were
called
its
liberties
really
every
genuine
law
is
a
liberty
it
contains
a
reasonable
principle
of
objective
mind
in
other
words
it
embodies
a
liberty
nothing
has
become
on
the
contrary
more
familiar
than
the
idea
that
each
must
restrict
his
liberty
in
relation
to
the
liberty
of
others
that
the
state
is
a
condition
of
such
reciprocal
restriction
and
that
the
laws
are
restrictions
to
such
habits
of
mind
liberty
is
viewed
as
only
casual
goodpleasure
and
selfwill
hence
it
has
also
been
said
that
modern
nations
are
only
susceptible
of
equality
or
of
equality
more
than
liberty
and
that
for
no
other
reason
than
that
with
an
assumed
definition
of
liberty
chiefly
the
participation
of
all
in
political
affairs
and
actions
it
was
impossible
to
make
ends
meet
in
actualitywhich
is
at
once
more
reasonable
and
more
powerful
than
abstract
presuppositions
on
the
contrary
it
should
be
said
that
it
is
just
the
great
development
and
maturity
of
form
in
modern
states
which
produces
the
supreme
concrete
inequality
of
individuals
in
actuality
while
through
the
deeper
reasonableness
of
laws
and
the
greater
stability
of
the
legal
state
it
gives
rise
to
greater
and
more
stable
liberty
which
it
can
without
incompatibility
allow
even
the
superficial
distinction
of
the
words
liberty
and
equality
points
to
the
fact
that
the
former
tends
to
inequality
whereas
on
the
contrary
the
current
notions
of
liberty
only
carry
us
back
to
equality
but
the
more
we
fortify
libertyas
security
of
property
as
possibility
for
each
to
develop
and
make
the
best
of
his
talents
and
good
qualities
the
more
it
gets
taken
for
granted
and
then
the
sense
and
appreciation
of
liberty
especially
turns
in
a
subjective
direction
by
this
is
meant
the
liberty
to
attempt
action
on
every
side
and
to
throw
oneself
at
pleasure
in
action
for
particular
and
for
general
intellectual
interests
the
removal
of
all
checks
on
the
individual
particularity
as
well
as
the
inward
liberty
in
which
the
subject
has
principles
has
an
insight
and
conviction
of
his
own
and
thus
gains
moral
independence
but
this
liberty
itself
on
one
hand
implies
that
supreme
differentiation
in
which
men
are
unequal
and
make
themselves
more
unequal
by
education
and
on
another
it
only
grows
up
under
conditions
of
that
objective
liberty
and
is
and
could
grow
to
such
height
only
in
modern
states
if
with
this
development
of
particularity
there
be
simultaneous
and
endless
increase
of
the
number
of
wants
and
of
the
difficulty
of
satisfying
them
of
the
lust
of
argument
and
the
fancy
of
detecting
faults
with
its
insatiate
vanity
it
is
all
but
part
of
that
indiscriminating
relaxation
of
individuality
in
this
sphere
which
generates
all
possible
complications
and
must
deal
with
them
as
it
can
such
a
sphere
is
of
course
also
the
field
of
restrictions
because
liberty
is
there
under
the
taint
of
natural
selfwill
and
selfpleasing
and
has
therefore
to
restrict
itself
and
that
not
merely
with
regard
to
the
naturalness
selfwill
and
selfconceit
of
others
but
especially
and
essentially
with
regard
to
reasonable
liberty
the
term
political
liberty
however
is
often
used
to
mean
formal
participation
in
the
public
affairs
of
state
by
the
will
and
action
even
of
those
individuals
who
otherwise
find
their
chief
function
in
the
particular
aims
and
business
of
civil
society
and
it
has
in
part
become
usual
to
give
the
title
constitution
only
to
the
side
of
the
state
which
concerns
such
participation
of
these
individuals
in
general
affairs
and
to
regard
a
state
in
which
this
is
not
formally
done
as
a
state
without
a
constitution
on
this
use
of
the
term
the
only
thing
to
remark
is
that
by
constitution
must
be
understood
the
determination
of
rights
ie
of
liberties
in
general
and
the
organisation
of
the
actualisation
of
them
and
that
political
freedom
in
the
above
sense
can
in
any
case
only
constitute
a
part
of
it
of
it
the
following
paragraphs
will
speak

540
the
guarantee
of
a
constitution
ie
the
necessity
that
the
laws
be
reasonable
and
their
actualisation
secured
lies
in
the
collective
spirit
of
the
nationespecially
in
the
specific
way
in
which
it
is
itself
conscious
of
its
reason
religion
is
that
consciousness
in
its
absolute
substantiality
but
the
guarantee
lies
also
at
the
same
time
in
the
actual
organisation
or
development
of
that
principle
in
suitable
institutions
the
constitution
presupposes
that
consciousness
of
the
collective
spirit
and
conversely
that
spirit
presupposes
the
constitution
for
the
actual
spirit
only
has
a
definite
consciousness
of
its
principles
in
so
far
as
it
has
them
actually
existent
before
it
the
questionto
whom
to
what
authority
and
how
organised
belongs
the
power
to
make
a
constitution
is
the
same
as
the
question
who
has
to
make
the
spirit
of
a
nation
separate
our
idea
of
a
constitution
from
that
of
the
collective
spirit
as
if
the
latter
exists
or
has
existed
without
a
constitution
and
your
fancy
only
proves
how
superficially
you
have
apprehended
the
nexus
between
the
spirit
in
its
selfconsciousness
and
in
its
actuality
what
is
thus
called
making
a
constitution
isjust
because
of
this
inseparabilitya
thing
that
has
never
happened
in
history
just
as
little
as
the
making
of
a
code
of
laws
a
constitution
only
develops
from
the
national
spirit
identically
with
that
spirits
own
development
and
runs
through
at
the
same
time
with
it
the
grades
of
formation
and
the
alterations
required
by
its
concept
it
is
the
indwelling

and
the
history
of
the

and
be
it

in

of

of

the

is
the
universal
part
of
the

ie
the
part
which
intentionally
aims
at
preserving
those

at
the

gets

above
the

of

and
of

the
organisation
of
the

is
likewise
its
differentiation
into
powers
as
their
peculiarities
have
a
basis
in
principle
yet
without
that
difference
losing
touch
with
the
actual
unity
they
have
in
the
notions
subjectivity
as
the
most
obvious
categories
of
the
notion
are
those
of
universality
and
individuality
and
their
relationship
that
of
subsumption
of
individual
under
universal
it
has
come
about
that
in
the
state
the
legislative
and
executive
power
have
been
so
distinguished
as
to
make
the
former
exist
apart
as
the
absolute
superior
and
to
subdivide
the
latter
again
into
administrative
government
power
and
judicial
power
according
as
the
laws
are
applied
to
public
or
private
affairs
the
division
of
these
powers
has
been
treated
as
the
condition
of
political
equilibrium
meaning
by
division
their
independence
one
of

the
abovementioned
subsumption
of

the
theory
of

unmistakably
implies
the
elements
of
the
notion
but
so
combined
by
understanding
as
to
result
in
an
absurd
collocation
instead
of
the
selfredintegration
of
the
living
spirit
the
one
essential
canon
to
make
liberty
deep
and
real
is
to
give
every
business
belonging
to
the
general
interests
of
the
state
a
separate
organisation
wherever
they
are
essentially
distinct
such
real
division
must
be
for
liberty
is
only
deep
when
it
is
differentiated
in
all
its
fullness

these
differences
manifested
in
existence

to
make
the
business
of

independent

make
it
the
first

with
the
further
proviso
that
all
citizens
shall
have
part
therein
and
the
government
be
merely
executive
and
dependent
presupposes
ignorance
that
the
true
idea
and
therefore
the
living
and
spiritual
actuality
is
the
selfredintegrating
notion
in
other
words
the
subjectivity
which
contains
in
it
universality
as
only
one
of
its
moments
a
mistake
still
greater
if
it
goes
with
the
fancy
that
the
constitution
and
the
fundamental
laws
were
still
one

these
as

are
the
terms
on
which
the
different
elements
essentially
and
alone
truly
stand
towards
each
other
in
the
logic
of
reason
as
opposed
to
the
external
footing

stand
on
in

which
never
gets
beyond
subsuming

appointed

to

possess
independence

without
at

ceasing

arises
the

such

the

of
those

which
do
not

as
it
were
personal
interference

action
of

therefore

can
show
themselves
palpably
efficacious
and
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
themselves
to
count
for
something
the
division
of
constitutions
into
democracy
aristocracy
and
monarchy
is
still
the
most
definite
statement
of
their
difference
in
relation
to
sovereignty
they
must
at
the
same
time
be
regarded
as
necessary
structures
in
the
path
of
developmentin
short
in
the
history
of
the
state
hence
it
is
superficial
and
absurd
to
represent
them
as
an
object
of
choice
the
pure
formsnecessary
to
the
process
of
evolutionare
in
so
far
as
they
are
finite
and
in
course
of
change
conjoined
both
with
forms
of
their
degenerationsuch
as
ochlocracy
c
and
with
earlier
transitionforms
these
two
forms
are
not
to
be
confused
with
those
legitimate
structures
thus
it
may
beif
we
look
only
to
the
fact
that
the
will
of
one
individual
stands
at
the
head
of
the
stateoriental
despotism
is
included
under
the
vague
name
monarchyas
also
feudal
monarchy
to
which
indeed
even
the
favourite
name
of
constitutional
monarchy
cannot
be
refused
the
true
difference
of
these
forms
from
genuine
monarchy
depends
on
the
true
value
of
those
principles
of
right
which
are
in
vogue
and
have
their
actuality
and
guarantee
in
the
statepower
these
principles
are
those
expounded
earlier
liberty
of
property
and
above
all
personal
liberty
civil
society
with
its
industry
and
its
communities
and
the
regulated
efficiency
of
the
particular
bureaux
in
subordination
to
the
laws
the
question
which
is
most
discussed
is
in
what
sense
we
are
to
understand
the
participation
of
private
persons
in
state
affairs
for
it
is
as
private
persons
that
the
members
of
bodies
of
estates
are
primarily
to
be
taken
be
they
treated
as
mere
individuals
or
as
representatives
of
a
number
of
people
or
of
the
nation
the
aggregate
of
private
persons
is
often
spoken
of
as
the
nation
but
as
such
an
aggregate
it
is
vulgus
not
populus
and
in
this
direction
it
is
the
one
sole
aim
of
the
state
that
a
nation
should
not
come
to
existence
to
power
and
action
as
such
an
aggregate
such
a
condition
of
a
nation
is
a
condition
of
lawlessness
demoralisation
brutishness
in
it
the
nation
would
only
be
a
shapeless
wild
blind
force
like
that
of
the
stormy
elemental
sea
which
however
is
not
selfdestructive
as
the
nationa
spiritual
elementwould
be
yet
such
a
condition
may
be
often
heard
described
as
that
of
true
freedom
if
there
is
to
be
any
sense
in
embarking
upon
the
question
of
the
participation
of
private
persons
in
public
affairs
it
is
not
a
brutish
mass
but
an
already
organised
nationone
in
which
a
governmental
power
existswhich
should
be
presupposed
the
desirability
of
such
participation
however
is
not
to
be
put
in
the
superiority
of
particular
intelligence
which
private
persons
are
supposed
to
have
over
state
officialsthe
contrary
may
be
the
casenor
in
the
superiority
of
their
good
will
for
the
general
best
the
members
of
civil
society
as
such
are
rather
people
who
find
their
nearest
duty
in
their
private
interest
and
as
especially
in
the
feudal
society
in
the
interest
of
their
privileged
corporation
take
the
case
of
england
which
because
private
persons
have
a
predominant
share
in
public
affairs
has
been
regarded
as
having
the
freest
of
all
constitutions
experience
shows
that
that
countryas
compared
with
the
other
civilised
states
of
europeis
the
most
backward
in
civil
and
criminal
legislation
in
the
law
and
liberty
of
property
in
arrangements
for
art
and
science
and
that
objective
freedom
or
rational
right
is
rather
sacrificed
to
formal
right
and
particular
private
interest
and
that
this
happens
even
in
the
institutions
and
possessions
supposed
to
be
dedicated
to
religion
the
desirability
of
private
persons
taking
part
in
public
affairs
is
partly
to
be
put
in
their
concrete
and
therefore
more
urgent
sense
of
general
wants
but
the
true
motive
is
the
right
of
the
collective
spirit
to
appear
as
an
externally
universal
will
acting
with
orderly
and
express
efficacy
for
the
public
concerns
by
this
satisfaction
of
this
right
it
gets
its
own
life
quickened
and
at
the
same
time
breathes
fresh
life
in
the
administrative
officials
who
thus
have
it
brought
home
to
them
that
not
merely
have
they
to
enforce
duties
but
also
to
have
regard
to
rights
private
citizens
are
in
the

the
incomparably
greater
number
and
form
the
multitude
of
such
as
are
recognised
as
persons
hence
the
willreason
exhibits
its
existence
in
them
as
a
preponderating
majority
of
freemen
or
in
its
reflectional
universality
which
has
its
actuality
vouchsafed
it
as
a
participation
in
the
sovereignty
but
it
has
already
been
noted
as
a
moment
of
civil
society

527
534
that
the
individuals
rise
from
external
into
substantial
universality
and
form
a
particular
kindthe
estates
and
it
is
not
in
the
inorganic
form
of
mere
individuals
as
such
after
the
democratic
fashion
of
election
but
as
organic
factors
as
estates
that
they
enter
upon
that
participation
in
the
state
a
power
or
agency
must
never
appear
and
act
as
a
formless
inorganic
shape
ie
basing
itself
on
the
principle
of
multeity
and
mere
numbers
assemblies
of

have
been
wrongly
designated
as
the
legislative
power
so
far
as
they
form
only
one
branch
of
that
powera
branch
in
which
the
special
governmentofficials
have
an
ex

share
while
the
sovereign
power
has
the
privilege
of

decision
in
a
civilised

can
only
be
a
further

the
main
drift
of
which
has
been
already
prepared

by
the

of
the

as
it

it
is
only
improperly
called
a

the

embracing
a
wide
indeed
the
whole
range
of
the

the

to

it
would
have
to

not
be

afresh

in

even
less
the
character
of

yet
it
is
and
may
be
only
this
slight
variable
part

is
matter
of
dispute

can
be
subjected
to
a

it
is
this

even
to
the
plain
man
something
palpably
absurd
for
he
distinguishes
the
essential
and
developed
universal
as
content
of
a
true
law
from
the
reflectional
universality
which
only
externally
embraces
what
in
its
nature
is
many
to
give
the
name
of
a
law
to
the
annual
fixing
of
financial
requirements
only
serveswith
the

separation
of

from

keep
up
the
illusion
of
that
separation
having
real
existence
and
to
conceal
the
fact
that
the
legislative
power
when
it
makes
a
decree
about
finance
is
really
engaged
with
strict
executive
business
but
the
importance
attached
to
the
power
of
from
time
to
time
granting
supply
on
the
ground
that
the
assembly
of
estates
possesses
in
it
a
check
on
the
government
and
thus
a
guarantee
against
injustice
and
violencethis
importance
is
in
one
way
rather
plausible
than
real
the
financial
measures
necessary
for
the
states
subsistence
cannot
be
made
conditional
on
any
other
circumstances
nor
can
the
states
subsistence
be
put
yearly
in
doubt
it
would
be
a
parallel
absurdity
if
the
government
were
eg
to
grant
and
arrange
the
judicial
institutions
always
for
a
limited
time
merely
and
thus
by
the
threat
of
suspending
the
activity
of
such
an
institution
and
the
fear
of
a
consequent
state
of
brigandage

itself

of
coercing

pictures
of
a
condition
of
affairs

which
it
might
be
useful
and
necessary
to
have
in
hand
means
of
compulsion
are
partly
based
on
the
false
conception
of
a
contract
between
rulers
and
ruled
and
partly
presuppose
the
possibility
of
such
a
divergence
in
spirit
between
these
two
parties
as
would
make
constitution
and

quite
out
of
the
question
if
we
suppose
the
empty
possibility
of
getting
help
by
such
compulsive
means
brought
into
existence
such
help
would
rather
be
the
derangement
and
dissolution
of
the
state
in
which
there
would
no
longer
be
a
government
but
only
parties

the
violence
and
oppression
of
one
party
would
only
be
helped
away
by
the
other
to
fit
together
the
several
parts
of
the

into
a
constitution

on

on

in

this
note
must
go
into
further
detail
that

above

an

in

there
is

philosophical
ground
and
thus
shown
to
be
essentially
and
in
fact
necessary
to
presuppose
such
aim
is
blameworthy
only
when
the
assumed
conceptions

thoughts
are
arbitrarily
adopted

when
a
determined
attempt
is
made
to
force

into
conformity

such
conceptions

such
a

methods

treatment
at
the
present

however
those
are
chiefly
to
blame
who
profess
to
be
purely
historical
and
who
at
the
same
time
take
opportunity
expressly
to
raise
their
voice
against
the
habit
of
philosophising
first
in

then
in

is
to
them

enemy

persons
who
seem
to
consider
it
incumbent
on
a
learned
and
ingenious
historian
drawing
from
the
original
sources
to
concoct
such
baseless
fancies
and
form
bold
combinations
of
them
from
a
learned
rubbishheap
of
outoftheway
and
trivial
facts
in
defiance
of
the
bestaccredited
history
setting
aside
this
subjective
treatment
of
history
we
find
what
is
properly
the
opposite
view
forbidding
us
to
import
into
history
an
objective
purpose
this
is
after
all
synonymous
with
what
seems
to
be
the
still
more
legitimate
demand
that
the
historian
should
proceed
with
impartiality
this
is
a
requirement
often
and
especially
made
on
the
history
of
philosophy
where
it
is
insisted
there
should
be
no
prepossession
in
favour
of
an
idea
or
opinion
just
as
a
judge
should
have
no
special
sympathy
for
one
of
the
contending
parties
in
the
case
of
the
judge
it
is
at
the
same
time
assumed
that
he
would
administer
his
office
ill
and
foolishly
if
he
had
not
an
interest
and
an
exclusive
interest
in
justice
if
he
had
not
that
for
his
aim
and
one
sole
aim
or
if
he
declined
to
judge
at
all
this
requirement
which
we
may
make
upon
the
judge
may
be
called
partiality
for
justice
and
there
is
no
difficulty
here
in
distinguishing
it
from
subjective
partiality
but
in
speaking
of
the
impartiality
required
from
the
historian
this
selfsatisfied
insipid
chatter
lets
the
distinction
disappear
and
rejects
both
kinds
of
interest
it
demands
that
the
historian
shall
bring
with
him
no
definite
aim
and
view
by
which
he
may
sort
out
state
and
criticise
events
but
shall
narrate
them
exactly
in
the
casual
mode
he
finds
them
in
their
incoherent
and
unintelligent
particularity
now
it
is
at
least
admitted
that
a
history
must
have
an
object
eg
rome
and
its
fortunes
or
the
decline
of
the
grandeur
of
the
roman
empire
but
little
reflection
is
needed
to
discover
that
this
is
the
presupposed
end
which
lies
at
the
basis
of
the
events
themselves
as
of
the
critical
examination
into
their
comparative
importance
ie
their
nearer
or
more
remote
relation
to
it
a
history
without
such
aim
and
such
criticism
would
be
only
an
imbecile
mental
divagation
not
as
good
as
a
fairy
tale
for
even
children
expect
a
motif
in
their
stories
a
purpose
at
least
dimly
surmiseable
with
which
events
and
actions
are
put
in
relation
in
the
existence
of
a
nation
the
substantial
aim
is
to
be
a
state
and
preserve
itself
as
such
a
nation
with
no
state
formation
a
mere
nation
has
strictly
speaking
no
historylike
the
nations
which
existed
before
the
rise
of
states
and
others
which
still
exist
in
a
condition
of
savagery
what
happens
to
a
nation
and
takes
place
within
it
has
its
essential
significance
in
relation
to
the
state
whereas
the
mere
particularities
of
individuals
are
at
the
greatest
distance
from
the
true
object
of
history
it
is
true
that
the
general
spirit
of
an
age
leaves
its
imprint
in
the
character
of
its
celebrated
individuals
and
even
their
particularities
are
but
the
very
distant
and
the
dim
media
through
which
the
collective
light
still
plays
in
fainter
colours
ay
even
such
singularities
as
a
petty
occurrence
a
word
express
not
a
subjective
particularity
but
an
age
a
nation
a
civilisation
in
striking
portraiture
and
brevity
and
to
select
such
trifles
shows
the
hand
of
a
historian
of
genius
but
on
the
other
hand
the
main
mass
of
singularities
is
a
futile
and
useless
mass
by
the
painstaking
accumulation
of
which
the
objects
of
real
historical
value
are
overwhelmed
and
obscured
the
essential
characteristic
of
the
spirit
and
its
age
is
always
contained
in
the
great
events
it
was
a
correct
instinct
which
sought
to
banish
such
portraiture
of
the
particular
and
the
gleaning
of
insignificant
traits
into
the
novel
as
in
the
celebrated
romances
of
walter
scott
c
where
the
picture
presents
an
unessential
aspect
of
life
it
is
certainly
in
good
taste
to
conjoin
it
with
an
unessential
material
such
as
the
romance
takes
from
private
events
and
subjective
passions
but
to
take
the
individual
pettinesses
of
an
age
and
of
the
persons
in
it
and
in
the
interest
of
socalled
truth
weave
them
into
the
picture
of
general
interests
is
not
only
against
taste
and
judgment
but
violates
the
principles
of
objective
truth
the
only
truth
for
mind
is
the
substantial
and
underlying
essence
and
not
the
trivialities
of
external
existence
and
contingency
it
is
therefore
completely
indifferent
whether
such
insignificancies
are
duly
vouched
for
by
documents
or
as
in
the
romance
invented
to
suit
the
character
and
ascribed
to
this
or
that
name
and
circumstances
the
point
of
interest
of
biographyto
say
a
word
on
that
hereappears
to
run
directly
counter
to
any
universal
scope
and
aim
but
biography
too
has
for
its
background
the
historical
world
with
which
the
individual
is
intimately
bound
up
even
purely
personal
originality
the
freak
of
humour
c
suggests
by
allusion
that
central
reality
and
has
its
interest
heightened
by
the
suggestion
the
mere
play
of
sentiment
on
the
contrary
has
another
ground
and
interest
than
history
the
requirement
of
impartiality
addressed
to
the
history
of
philosophy
and
also
we
may
add
to
the
history
of
religion
first
in
general
and
secondly
to
church
history
generally
implies
an
even
more
decided
bar
against
presupposition
of
any
objective
aim
as
the
state
was
already
called
the
point
to
which
in
political
history
criticism
had
to
refer
all
events
so
here
the
truth
must
be
the
object
to
which
the
several
deeds
and
events
of
the
spirit
would
have
to
be
referred
what
is
actually
done
is
rather
to
make
the
contrary
presupposition
histories
with
such
an
object
as
religion
or
philosophy
are
understood
to
have
only
subjective
aims
for
their
theme
ie
only
opinions
and
mere
ideas
not
an
essential
and
realised
object
like
the
truth
and
that
with
the
mere
excuse
that
there
is
no
truth
on
this
assumption
the
sympathy
with
truth
appears
as
only
a
partiality
of
the
usual
sort
a
partiality
for
opinion
and
mere
ideas
which
all
alike
have
no
stuff
in
them
and
are
all
treated
as
indifferent
in
that
way
historical
truth
means
but
correctnessan
accurate
report
of

without
critical
treatment

in

no
judgments

or
notion
cf
notes
to

172
and
175
but
really
if
rome
or
the
german
empire

are
an
actual
and
genuine

of
political

which
the

which
they

which
all

therefore
through
their

the

steps
onward
over
its

then
delivers
it
over
to
its
chance

doom

551
to
such
extent
as
this
business
of
actuality
appears
as
an
action
and
therefore
as
a
work
of
individuals
these
individuals

such
apprehension
however
still
has
the
immanent
limitedness
of
the

the
spirit
which
thinks

the

actual

the

reason
enjoys
freedom

spoken

especially

51
note
as
regards
the
startingpoint
of
that
elevation
kant
has
on
the
whole
adopted
the
most
correct
when
he
treats
belief
in
god
as
proceeding
from
the
practical
reason
for
that
startingpoint
contains
the
material
or
content
which
constitutes
the
content
of
the
notion
of
god
but
the
true
concrete
material
is
neither
being
as
in
the
cosmological
nor
mere
action
by
design
as
in
the
physicotheological
proof
but
the
mind
the
absolute
characteristic
and
function
of
which
is
effective
reason
ie
the
selfdetermining
and
selfrealising
notion
itselfliberty
that
the
elevation
of
subjective
mind
to
god
which
these
considerations
give
is
by
kant
again
deposed
to
a
postulatea
mere
oughtis
the
peculiar
perversity
formerly
noticed
of
calmly
and
simply
reinstating
as
true
and
valid
that
very
antithesis
of
finitude
the
supersession
of
which
into
truth
is
the
essence
of
that
elevation
as
regards
the
mediation
which
as
it
has
been
already
shown

192
cf

204
note
that
elevation
to
god
really
involves
the
point
specially
calling
for
note
is
the
moment
of
negation
through
which
the
essential
content
of
the
startingpoint
is
purged
of
its
finitude
so
as
to
come
forth
free
this
factor
abstract
in
the
formal
treatment
of
logic
now
gets
its
most
concrete
interpretation
the
finite
from
which
the
start
is
now
made
is
the
real
ethical
selfconsciousness
the
negation
through
which
that
consciousness
raises
its
spirit
to
its
truth
is
the
purification
actually
accomplished
in
the
ethical
world
whereby
its
conscience
is
purged
of
subjective
opinion
and
its
will
freed
from
the
selfishness
of
desire
genuine
religion
and
genuine
religiosity
only
issue
from
the
moral
life
religion
is
that
life
rising
to
think
ie
becoming
aware
of
the
free
universality
of
its
concrete
essence
only
from
the
moral
life
and
by
the
moral
life
is
the
idea
of
god
seen
to
be
free
spirit
outside
the
ethical
spirit
therefore
it
is
vain
to
seek
for
true
religion
and
religiosity
butas
is
the
case
with
all

thing
out
of
another
means
that
what
appears
as
sequel
and
derivative
is
rather
the
absolute
prius
of
what
it
appears
to
be
mediated
by
and
what
is
here
in
mind
known
as
its
truth
here
then
is
the
place
to
go
more
deeply
into
the
reciprocal
relations
between
the
state
and
religion
and
in
doing
so
to
elucidate
the
terminology
which
is
familiar
and
current
on
the
topic
it
is
evident
and
apparent
from
what
has
preceded
that
moral
life
is
the
state
retracted
into
its
inner
heart
and
substance
while
the
state
is
the
organisation
and
actualisation
of
moral
life
and
that
religion
is
the
very
substance
of
the
moral
life
itself
and
of
the
state
at
this
rate
the
state
rests
on
the
ethical
sentiment
and
that
on
the
religious
if
religion
then
is
the
consciousness
of
absolute
truth
then
whatever
is
to
rank
as
right
and
justice
as
law
and
duty
ie
as
true
in
the
world
of
free
will
can
be
so
esteemed
only
as
it
is
participant
in
that
truth
as
it
is
subsumed
under
it
and
is
its
sequel
but
if
the
truly
moral
life
is
to
be
a
sequel
of
religion
then
perforce
religion
must
have
the
genuine
content
ie
the
idea
of
god
it
knows
must
be
the
true
and
real
the
ethical
life
is
the
divine
spirit
as
indwelling
in
selfconsciousness
as
it
is
actually
present
in
a
nation
and
its
individual
members
this
selfconsciousness
retiring
upon
itself
out
of
its
empirical
actuality
and
bringing
its
truth
to
consciousness
has
in
its
faith
and
in
its
conscience
only
what
it
has
consciously
secured
in
its
spiritual
actuality
the
two
are
inseparable
there
cannot
be
two
kinds
of
conscience
one
religious
and
another
ethical
differing
from
the
former
in
body
and
value
of
truth
but
in
point
of
form
ie
for
thought
and
knowledgeand
religion
and
ethical
life
belong
to
intelligence
and
are
a
thinking
and
knowingthe
body
of
religious
truth
as
the
pure
selfsubsisting
and
therefore
supreme
truth
exercises
a
sanction
over
the
moral
life
which
lies
in
empirical
actuality
thus
for
selfconsciousness
religion
is
the
basis
of
moral
life
and
of
the
state
it
has
been
the
monstrous
blunder
of
our
times
to
try
to
look
upon
these
inseparables
as
separable
from
one
another
and
even
as
mutually
indifferent
the
view
taken
of
the
relationship
of
religion
and
the
state
has
been
that
whereas
the
state
had
an
independent
existence
of
its
own
springing
from
some
force
and
power
religion
was
a
later
addition
something
desirable
perhaps
for
strengthening
the
political
bulwarks
but
purely
subjective
in
individualsor
it
may
be
religion
is
treated
as
something
without
effect
on
the
moral
life
of
the
state
ie
its
reasonable
law
and
constitution
which
are
based
on
a
ground
of
their
own
as
the
inseparability
of
the
two
sides
has
been
indicated
it
may
be
worth
while
to
note
the
separation
as
it
appears
on
the
side
of
religion
it
is
primarily
a
point
of
form
the
attitude
which
selfconsciousness
takes
to
the
body
of
truth
so
long
as
this
body
of
truth
is
the
very
substance
or
indwelling
spirit
of
selfconsciousness
in
its
actuality
then
selfconsciousness
in
this
content
has
the
certainty
of
itself
and
is
free
but
if
this
present
selfconsciousness
is
lacking
then
there
may
be
created
in
point
of
form
a
condition
of
spiritual
slavery
even
though
the
implicit
content
of
religion
is
absolute
spirit
this
great
difference
to
cite
a
specific
case
comes
out
within
the
christian
religion
itself
even
though
here
it
is
not
the
natureelement
in
which
the
idea
of
god
is
embodied
and
though
nothing
of
the
sort
even
enters
as
a
factor
into
its
central
dogma
and
sole
theme
of
a
god
who
is
known
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
yet
in
catholicism
this
spirit
of
all
truth
is
in
actuality
set
in
rigid
opposition
to
the
selfconscious
spirit
and
first
of
all
god
is
in
the
host
presented
to
religious
adoration
as
an
external
thing
in
the
lutheran
church
on
the
contrary
the
host
as
such
is
not
at
first
consecrated
but
in
the
moment
of
enjoyment
ie
in
the
annihilation
of
its
externality
and
in
the
act
of
faith
ie
in
the
free
selfcertain
spirit
only
then
is
it
consecrated
and
exalted
to
be
present
god
from
that
first
and
supreme
status
of
externalisation
flows
every
other
phase
of
externalityof
bondage
nonspirituality
and
superstition
it
leads
to
a
laity
receiving
its
knowledge
of
divine
truth
as
well
as
the
direction
of
its
will
and
conscience
from
without
and
from
another
orderwhich
order
again
does
not
get
possession
of
that
knowledge
in
a
spiritual
way
only
but
to
that
end
essentially
requires
an
external
consecration
it
leads
to
the
nonspiritual
style
of
prayingpartly
as
mere
moving
of
the
lips
partly
in
the
way
that
the
subject
foregoes
his
right
of
directly
addressing
god
and
prays
others
to
prayaddressing
his
devotion
to
miracleworking
images
even
to
bones
and
expecting
miracles
from
them
it
leads
generally
to
justification
by
external
works
a
merit
which
is
supposed
to
be
gained
by
acts
and
even
to
be
capable
of
being
transferred
to
others
all
this
binds
the
spirit
under
an
externalism
by
which
the
very
meaning
of
spirit
is
perverted
and
misconceived
at
its
source
and
law
and
justice
morality
and
conscience
responsibility
and
duty
are
corrupted
at
their
root
along
with
this
principle
of
spiritual
bondage
and
these
applications
of
it
in
the
religious
life
there
can
only
go
in
the
legislative
and
constitutional
system
a
legal
and
moral
bondage
and
a
state
of
lawlessness
and
immorality
in
political
life
catholicism
has
been
loudly
praised
and
is
still
often
praisedlogically
enoughas
the
one
religion
which
secures
the
stability
of
governments
but
in
reality
this
applies
only
to
governments
which
are
bound
up
with
institutions
founded
on
the
bondage
of
the
spirit
of
that
spirit
which
should
have
legal
and
moral
liberty
ie
with
institutions
that
embody
injustice
and
with
a
morally
corrupt
and
barbaric
state
of
society
but
these
governments
are
not
aware
that
in
fanaticism
they
have
a
terrible
power
which
does
not
rise
in
hostility
against
them
only
so
long
as
and
only
on
condition
that
they
remain
sunk
in
the
thraldom
of
injustice
and
immorality
but
in
mind
there
is
a
very
different
power
available
against
that
externalism
and
dismemberment
induced
by
a
false
religion
mind
collects
itself
into
its
inward
free

awakes
in
the
spirit
of

the
wisdom
to
discern
what
is
essentially
and
actually
right
and
reasonable
in
the
real
world
it
was
well
to
call
these
products
of

in
a
special
sense

the
wisdom
of

for

makes
the

an
actual

it
into
the
real

and
thus
liberates
it
in
its
actuality
and
in
its
own
self
thus
set
free
the
content
of
religion
assumes
quite
another
shape
so
long
as
the
form
ie
our
consciousness
and
subjectivity
lacked
liberty
it
followed
necessarily
that
selfconsciousness
was
conceived
as
not
immanent
in
the
ethical
principles
which
religion
embodies
and
these
principles
were
set
at
such
a
distance
as
to
seem
to
have
true

only
as
negative
to
actual
selfconsciousness
in
this
unreality
ethical
content

the
name
of
holiness
but
once
the
divine
spirit
introduces
itself
into
actuality
and
actuality
emancipates
itself
to
spirit
then
what
in
the
world
was
a
postulate
of
holiness
is
supplanted
by
the
actuality
of
moral
life
instead
of
the
vow
of
chastity
marriage
now
ranks
as
the
ethical
relation
and
therefore
as
the
highest
on
this
side
of
humanity
stands
the
family
instead
of
the
vow
of
poverty
muddled
up
into
a
contradiction
of
assigning
merit
to
whosoever
gives
away
goods
to
the
poor
ie
whosoever

them

instead
of
the

obedience
which
is

give
to
caesar
what

caesars
and
to

what

not
enough
the
question
is
to
settle
what
is
caesars
what
belongs
to
the
secular
authority
and
it
is
sufficiently
notorious
that
the
secular
no
less
than
the
ecclesiastical
authority
have
claimed
almost
everything
as
their
own
the
divine
spirit
must
interpenetrate
the
entire
secular
life
whereby
wisdom
is
concrete
within
it
and
it
carries
the
terms
of
its
own
justification
but
that
concrete
indwelling
is
only
the
aforesaid
ethical
organisations
it
is
the
morality
of

against
the
sanctity
of
a

morality
of
economic
and

action
against
the
sanctity
of
poverty
and
its
indolencethe
morality
of
an
obedience
dedicated
to
the
law
of
the
state
as
against
the
sanctity
of
an
obedience
from
which
law
and

are
absent
and
where
conscience
is
enslaved
with
the
growing
need
for
law
and

and
the
sense
of
the

essential
liberty
there
sets
in
a
conflict
of
spirit
with
the
religion
of
unfreedom
it
is
no
use
to
organise
political
laws
and
arrangements
on
principles
of
equity
and
reason
so
long
as
in
religion
the
principle
of
unfreedom
is
not
abandoned
a
free
state
and
a
slavish
religion
are
incompatible
it

silly
to
suppose
that
we
may
try
to
allot
them
separate

the
impression

their

maintain
an
attitude

tranquillity
one
to
another
and
not
break
out
in

principles
of
civil
freedom
can
be
but
abstract
and
superficial
and
political
institutions
deduced
from
them
must
be
if
taken
alone
untenable
so
long
as
those
principles
in
their
wisdom
mistake
religion
so
much
as
not
to
know
that
the
maxims
of
the
reason
in
actuality
have
their
last
and
supreme
sanction
in
the
religious
conscience
in
subsumption
under
the
consciousness
of
absolute
truth
let
us
suppose
even
that
no
matter
how
a
code
of
law
should
arise
so
to
speak
a
priori
founded
on
principles
of
reason
but
in
contradiction
with
an
established
religion
based
on
principles
of
spiritual
unfreedom
still
as
the
duty
of
carrying
out
the
laws
lies
in
the
hands
of
individual
members
of
the
government
and
of
the
various
classes
of
the
administrative
personnel
it
is
vain
to
delude
ourselves
with
the
abstract
and
empty
assumption
that
the
individuals
will
act
only
according
to
the
letter
or
meaning
of
the
law
and
not
in
the
spirit
of
their
religion
where
their
inmost
conscience
and
supreme
obligation
lies
opposed
to
what
religion
pronounces
holy
the
laws
appear
something
made
by
human
hands
even
though
backed
by
penalties
and
externally
introduced
they
could
offer
no
lasting
resistance
to
the
contradiction
and
attacks
of
the
religious
spirit
such
laws
however
sound
their
provisions
may
be
thus
founder
on
the
conscience
whose
spirit
is
different
from
the
spirit
of
the
laws
and
refuses
to
sanction
them
it
is
nothing
but
a
modern
folly
to
try
to
alter
a
corrupt
moral
organisation
by
altering
its
political
constitution
and
code
of
laws
without
changing
the
religionto
make
a
revolution
without
having
made
a
reformation
to
suppose
that
a
political
constitution
opposed
to
the
old
religion
could
live
in
peace
and
harmony
with
it
and
its
sanctities
and
that
stability
could
be
procured
for
the
laws
by
external
guarantees

at

it

persons
charged
with
administering
the
lawsamong
which
laws
these
guarantees
are
included
it
is
indeed
the
height
and
profanity
of
contradiction
to
seek
to
bind
and
subject
to
the
secular
code
the
religious
conscience
to
which
mere
human
law
is
a
thing
profane
the
perception
had
dawned
upon
plato
with
great
clearness
of
the
gulf
which
in
his
day
had
commenced
to
divide
the
established
religion
and
the
political
constitution
on
one
hand
from
those
deeper
requirements
which
on
the
other
hand
were
made
upon
religion
and
politics
by
liberty
which
had
learnt
to
recognise
its
inner
life
plato
gets
hold
of
the
thought
that
a
genuine
constitution
and
a
sound
political
life
have
their
deeper
foundation
on
the
ideaon
the
essentially
and
actually
universal
and
genuine
principles
of
eternal
righteousness
now
to
see
and
ascertain
what
these
are
is
certainly
the
function
and
the
business
of
philosophy
it
is
from
this
point
of
view
that
plato
breaks
out
into
the
celebrated
or
notorious
passage
where
he
makes
socrates
emphatically
state
that
philosophy
and
political
power
must
coincide
that
the
idea
must
be
regent
if
the
distress
of
nations
is
to
see
its
end
what
plato
thus
definitely
set
before
his
mind
was
that
the
ideawhich
implicitly
indeed
is
the
free
selfdetermining
thoughtcould
not
get
into
consciousness
save
only
in
the
form
of
a
thought
that
the
substance
of
the
thought
could
only
be
true
when
set
forth
as
a
universal
and
as
such
brought
to
consciousness
under
its
most
abstract
form
to
compare
the
platonic
standpoint
in
all
its
definiteness
with
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
relationship
of
state
and
religion
is
here
regarded
the
notional
differences
on
which
everything
turns
must
be
recalled
to
mind
the
first
of
these
is
that
in
natural
things
their
substance
or
genus
is
different
from
their
existence
in
which
that
substance
is
as
subject
further
that
this
subjective
existence
of
the
genus
is
distinct
from
that
which
it
gets
when
specially
set
in
relief
as
genus
or
to
put
it
simply
as
the
universal
in
a
mental
concept
or
idea

additional

on
which
the
universal
and
underlying
principle
freely
and
expressly
existsis
the
intellectual
and
thinking
self
in
the
case
of
natural
things
their
truth
and
reality
does
not
get
the
form
of
universality
and
essentiality
through
themselves
and
their
individuality
is
not
itself
the
form
the
form
is
only
found
in
subjective
thinking
which
in
philosophy
gives
that
universal
truth
and
reality
an
existence
of
its
own
in
mans
case
it

otherwise
his

the

earlier

philosophy
is
a
later
development
from
this

just
as
greek
philosophy
itself
is
later
than

religion
and
in
fact
reaches
its
completion
by
catching
and
comprehending
in
all
its
definite
essentiality
that
principle
of
spirit
which
first
manifests
itself
in
religion
but
greek
philosophy
could
set
itself
up
only
in
opposition
to
greek
religion
the
unity
of
thought
and
the
substantiality
of
the
idea
could
take
up
none
but
a
hostile
attitude
to
an
imaginative
polytheism
and
to
the
gladsome
and
frivolous
humours
of
its
poetic
creations
the
form
in
its
infinite
truth
the
subjectivity
of
mind
broke
forth
at
first
only
as
a
subjective
free
thinking
which
was
not
yet
identical
with
the
substantiality
itselfand
thus
this
underlying
principle
was
not
yet
apprehended
as
absolute
mind
thus
religion
might
appear
as
first
purified
only
through
philosophythrough
pure
selfexistent
thought

the
form
pervading
this
underlying

attackedwas
that
creative
imagination
political
power
which
is
developed
similarly
but
earlier

from

the
onesidedness
which
in
the
actual
world
may
infect
its
implicitly
true
idea
as
demoralisation
plato
in
common
with
all
his
thinking
contemporaries
perceived
this
demoralisation
of
democracy
and
the
defectiveness
even
of
its
principle
he
set
in
relief
accordingly
the
underlying
principle
of
the
state
but
could
not
work
into
his
idea
of
it
the
infinite
form
of
subjectivity
which
still
escaped
his
intelligence
his
state
is
therefore
on
its
own

not

the

its
selfconsciousness

in
it
elevated
to
substantial
liberty
but
with
the
stigma
of

upon
it
the

liberty
is
only
a
manner
of
life
without
the
infinite
selfreflection
and
the
subjective
inwardness
of
conscience
these
considerations
govern
in
their
further
developments
the
devotion
and
the
worship
in
the
religion
of
fine
art

558
for
the
objects
of
contemplation
it
has
to
produce
art
requires
not
only
an
external
given
materialunder
which
are
also
included
subjective
images
and
ideas
butfor
the
expression
of
spiritual
truthmust
use
the
given
forms
of
nature
with
a
significance
which
art
must
divine
and
possess
cf

411
of
all
such
forms
the
human
is
the
highest
and
the
true
because
only
in
it
can
the
spirit
have
its
corporeity
and
thus
its
visible
expression
this
disposes
of
the
principle
of
the
imitation
of
nature
in
art
a
point
on
which
it
is
impossible
to
come
to
an
understanding
while
a
distinction
is
left
thus
abstractin
other
words
so
long
as
the
natural
is
only
taken
in
its
externality
not
as
the
characteristic
meaningful
natureform
which
is
significant
of
spirit

559
in
such
single
shapes
the
absolute
mind
cannot
be
made
explicit
in
and
to
art
therefore
the
spirit
is
a
limited
natural
spirit
whose
implicit
universality
when
steps
are
taken
to
specify
its
fullness
in
detail
breaks
up
into
an
indeterminate
polytheism
with
the
essential
restrictedness
of
its
content
beauty
in
general
goes
no
further
than
a
penetration
of
the
vision
or
image
by
the
spiritual
principlesomething
formal
so
that
the
thought
embodied
or
the
idea
can
like
the
material
which
it
uses
to
work
in
be
of
the
most
diverse
and
unessential
kind
and
still
the
work
be
something
beautiful
and
a
work
of
art

560
the
onesidedness
of
immediacy
on
the
part
of
the
ideal
involves
the
opposite
onesidedness

556
that
it
is
something
made
by
the
artist
the
subject
or
agent
is
the
mere
technical
activity
and
the
work
of
art
is
only
then
an
expression
of
the
god
when
there
is
no
sign
of
subjective
particularity
in
it
and
the
net
power
of
the
indwelling
spirit
is
conceived
and
born
into
the
world
without
admixture
and
unspotted
from
its
contingency
but
as
liberty
only
goes
as
far
as
there
is
thought
the
action
inspired
with
the
fullness
of
this
indwelling
power
the
artists
enthusiasm
is
like
a
foreign
force
under
which
he
is
bound
and
passive
the
artistic
production
has
on
its
part
the
form
of
natural
immediacy
it
belongs
to
the
genius
or
particular
endowment
of
the
artistand
is
at
the
same
time
a
labour
concerned
with
technical
cleverness
and
mechanical
externalities
the
work
of
art
therefore
is
just
as
much
a
work
due
to
free
option
and
the
artist
is
the
master
of
the
god

561
in
work
so
inspired
the
reconciliation
appears
so
obvious
in
its
initial
stage
that
it
is
without
more
ado
accomplished
in
the
subjective
selfconsciousness
which
is
thus
selfconfident
and
of
good
cheer
without
the
depth
and
without
the
sense
of
its
antithesis
to
the
absolute
essence
on
the
further
side
of
the
perfection
which
is
reached
in
such
reconciliation
in
the
beauty
of
classical
art
lies
the
art
of
sublimitysymbolic
art
in
which
the
figuration
suitable
to
the
idea
is
not
yet
found
and
the
thought
as
going
forth
and
wrestling
with

exhibited
as
a
negative

562
in
another
way
the
idea
and
the
sensuous
figure

in
are
incompatible

that
is
where
the

is
not
as
in
the
first
extreme
a
mere
superficial
personality

its
inmost
depth
and
god
is
known
not
as
only
seeking
his
form
or
satisfying
himself
in
an
external
form
but
as
only

giving
himself
his
adequate

alone
romantic
art
gives
up
the
task
of
showing
him
as
such
in
external
form
and
by
means
of
beauty
it
presents
him
as
only
condescending
to
appearance
and
the
divine
as
the
heart
of
hearts
in
an
externality

which
it
always
disengages
itself
thus
the
external
can
here
appear
as
contingent

its
significance
the
philosophy

to
discover
the
logical
necessity

the
progress
by
which
the

it
may
be
specially
noted
that

can
only
belong

those
religions
in
which
the
spiritual
principle

concrete

where
the
idea
has
not

been
revealed

known
in
its
free
character
though
the
craving
for
art
is
felt
in
order
to
bring
in
imaginative
visibility
to
consciousness
the
idea
of
the
supreme
being
and
though
art
is
the

the

on
the

for
its

with
a
further

we

that
the
advent
of
art
in
a
religion
still
in
the

externality
shows
that
such

to

the

the

thing
left

the
whole
question
turns
entirely
on
the

of
the

from
the
forms

mental
representation

reflecting

it
is
the
whole
cycle
of
philosophy
and
of
logic
in
particular
which
has
not
merely
taught
and
made
known
this
difference
but
also
criticised
it
or
rather
has
let
its
nature
develop

judge
itself
by
these
very
categories
it
is
only
by
an
insight
into
the
value
of
these
forms
that
the
true
and
needful
conviction

gained

fall
outside
the
range
of

but
religion
is
the
truth
for
all
men

rests
on
the
witness
of
the

when
driven
to
expound
itself
its
first
definite
form
under
those
acquired
habits
of
thought
which
his
secular
consciousness
and
intellect
otherwise
employs
in
this
way
the
truth
becomes
liable
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
finitude
in
general
this
does
not
prevent
the
spirit
even
in
employing
sensuous
ideas
and
finite
categories
of
thought
from
retaining
its
content
which
as
religion
is
essentially
speculative
with
a
tenacity
which
does
violence
to
them
and
acts
inconsistently
towards
them
by
this
inconsistency
it
corrects
their
defects
nothing
easier
therefore
for
the
rationalist
than
to
point
out
contradictions
in
the
exposition
of
the
faith
and
then
to
prepare
triumphs
for
its
principle
of
formal
identity
if
the
spirit
yields
to
this
finite
reflection
which
has
usurped
the
title
of
reason
and
philosophyrationalismit
strips
religious
truth
of
its
infinity
and
makes
it
in
reality
nought
religion
in
that
case
is
completely
in
the
right
in
guarding
herself
against
such
reason
and
philosophy
and
treating
them
as
enemies
but
it
is
another
thing
when
religion
sets
herself
against
comprehending
reason
and
against
philosophy
in
general
and
specially
against
a
philosophy
of
which
the
doctrine
is
speculative
and
so
religious
such
an
opposition
proceeds
from
failure
to
appreciate
the
difference
indicated
and
the
value
of
spiritual
form
in
general
and
particularly
of
the
logical
form
or
to
be
more
precise
still
from
failure
to
note
the
distinction
of
the
contentwhich
may
be
in
both
the
samefrom
these
forms
it
is
on
the
ground
of
form
that
philosophy
has
been
reproached
and
accused
by
the
religious
party
just
as
conversely
its
speculative
content
has
brought
the
same
charges
upon
it
from
a
selfstyled
philosophyand
from
a
pithless
orthodoxy
it
had
too
little
of
god
in
it
for
the
former
too
much
for
the
latter
the
charge
of
atheism
which
used
often
to
be
brought
against
philosophy
that
it
has
too
little
of
god
has
grown
rare
the
more
widespread
grows
the
charge
of
pantheism
that
it
has
too
much
of
himso
much
so
that
it
is
treated
not
so
much
as
an
imputation
but
as
a
proved
fact
or
a
sheer
fact
which
needs
no
proof
piety
in
particular
which
with
its
pious
airs
of
superiority
fancies
itself
free
to
dispense
with
proof
goes
hand
in
hand
with
empty
rationalismwhich
means
to
be
so
much
opposed
to
it
though
both
repose
really
on
the
same
habit
of
mindin
the
wanton
assertion
almost
as
if
it
merely
mentioned
a
notorious
fact
that
philosophy
is
the
allone
doctrine
or
pantheism
it
must
be
said
that
it
was
more
to
the
credit
of
piety
and
theology
when
they
accused
a
philosophical
system
eg
spinozism
of
atheism
than
of
pantheism
though
the
former
imputation
at
the
first
glance
looks
more
cruel
and
insidious
cf

71
note
the
imputation
of
atheism
presupposes
a
definite
idea
of
a
full
and
real
god
and
arises
because
the
popular
idea
does
not
detect
in
the
philosophical
notion
the
peculiar
form
to
which
it
is
attached
philosophy
indeed
can
recognise
its
own
forms
in
the
categories
of
religious
consciousness
and
even
its
own
teaching
in
the
doctrine
of
religionwhich
therefore
it
does
not
disparage
but
the
converse
is
not
true
the
religious
consciousness
does
not
apply
the
criticism
of
thought
to
itself
does
not
comprehend
itself
and
is
therefore
as
it
stands
exclusive
to
impute
pantheism
instead
of
atheism
to
philosophy
is
part
of
the
modern
habit
of
mindof
the
new
piety
and
new
theology
for
them
philosophy

so
that
if
we
believe
them
it
asserts
that
god
is
everything
and
everything
is
god
this
new
theology
which
makes
religion
only
a
subjective
feeling
and
denies
the
knowledge
of
the
divine
nature
thus
retains
nothing
more
than
a
god
in
general
without
objective
characteristics
without
interest
of
its
own
for
the
concrete
fulfilled
notion
of
god
it
treats
it
only
as
an
interest
which
others
once
had
and
hence
treats
what
belongs
to
the
doctrine
of

as
something
merely

left
standing
in
fixed
undisturbed
substantiality
on
such
a
presupposition
even
after
philosophy
has
maintained
gods
absolute
universality
and
the
consequent
untruth
of
the
being
of
external
things
the
hearer
clings
as
he
did
before

his
belief
that
secular
things
still
keep
their
being
and
form
all
that
is
definite
in
the
divine
universality
he
thus
changes
that
universality
into
what
he
calls

pantheisticeverything
isempirical
things
without
distinction
whether
higher

sothus
he
understands

and
every
secular

is

it
is
only
his
own
stupidity
and
the
falsifications
due
to
such
misconception
which
generate
the
imagination
and
the
allegation
of
such
pantheism
but
if
those
who
give
out
that
a
certain
philosophy
is
pantheism
are
unable
and
unwilling
to
see
thisfor
it
is
just
to
see
the
notion
that
they
refusethey
should
before
everything
have
verified
the
alleged
fact
that
any
one
philosopher
or
any
one
man
had
really
ascribed
substantial
or
objective
and
inherent
reality
to
all
things
and
regarded
them
as
godthat
such
an
idea
had
ever
come
into
the
hand
of
any
body

themselves
this
allegation
i
will
further
elucidate
in
this
exoteric

the
only
way
to
do
so
is
to
set
down
the
evidence
if
we
want
to
take
socalled
pantheism
in
its
most
poetical
most
sublime
or
if
you
will
its
grossest
shape
we
must
as
is
well
known
consult
the
oriental
poets
and
the
most
copious
delineations
of
it
are
found
in
hindoo
literature
amongst
the
abundant
resources

immoveable
which
can
exist
without
me
even
in
these
totally
sensuous
delineations
krishna
and
we
must
not
suppose
there
is
besides
krishna
still
god
or
a
god
besides
as
he
said
before
he
was
siva
or
indra
so
it
is
afterwards
said
that
brahma
too
is
in
him
makes
himself
out
to
benot
everything
but
onlythe
most
excellent
of
everything
everywhere
there
is
a
distinction
drawn
between
external
unessential
existences
and
one
essential
amongst
them
which
he
is
even
when
at
the
beginning
of
the
passage
he
is
said
to
be
the
beginning
middle
and
end
of
living
things
this
totality
is
distinguished
from
the
living
things
themselves
as
single
existences
even
such
a
picture
which
extends
deity
far
and
wide
in
its
existence
cannot
be
called
pantheism
we
must
rather
say
that
in
the
infinitely
multiple
empirical
world
everything
is
reduced
to
a
limited
number
of
essential
existences
to
a
polytheism
but
even
what
has
been
quoted
shows
that
these
very
substantialities
of
the
externallyexistent
do
not
retain
the
independence
entitling
them
to
be
named
gods
even
siva
indra
c
melt
into
the
one
krishna
this
reduction
is
more
expressly
made
in
the
following
scene

krishna
says
i
am
the
producer
and
the
destroyer
of
the
whole
universe
there
is
nothing
else
higher
than
myself
all
this
is
woven
upon
me
like
numbers
of
pearls
upon
a
thread
i
am
the
taste
in
water
i
am

i

i
am
also
the
strength
of

then
he
adds
the
whole
universe
deluded
by
these
three
states
of
mind
developed
from
the
qualities
sc
goodness
passion
darkness
does
not
know
me
who
am
beyond
them
and
inexhaustible

of
mine
even
the
maya

nothing

developed
from
the
qualities
is
divine
and
difficult
to
transcend
those
cross
beyond
this
delusion
who
resort
to
me
alone
then
the
picture
gathers
itself
up
in
a
simple
expression
at
the
end
of
many
lives
the
man
possessed
of
knowledge
approaches
me
believing
that
vasudeva
is
everything
such
a
highsouled
mind
is
very
hard
to
find
those
who
are
deprived
of
knowledge
by
various
desires
approach
other
divinities
whichever
form
of
deity
one
worships
with
faith
from
it
he
obtains
the
beneficial
things
he
desires
really
given
by
me
but
the
fruit
thus
obtained
by
those
of
little
judgment
is
perishable
the
undiscerning
ones
not
knowing
my
transcendent
and
inexhaustible
essence
than
which
there
is
nothing
higher
think
me
who
am
unperceived
to
have
become
perceptible
this
all
which
krishna
calls
himself
is
not
any
more
than
the
eleatic
one
and
the
spinozan
substance
the
everything
this
everything
rather
the
infinitelymanifold
sensuous
manifold
of
the
finite
is
in
all
these
pictures
but
defined
as
the
accidental
without
essential
being
of
its
very
own
but
having
its
truth
in
the
substance
the
one
which
as
different
from
that
accidental
is
alone
the
divine
and
god
hindooism
however
has
the
higher
conception
of
brahma
the
pure
unity
of
thought
in
itself
where
the
empirical
everything
of
the
world
as
also
those
proximate
substantialities
called
gods
vanish
on
that
account
colebrooke
and
many
others
have
described
the
hindoo
religion
as
at
bottom
a
monotheism
that
this
description
is
not
incorrect
is
clear
from
these
short
citations
but
so
little
concrete
is
this
divine
unityspiritual
as
its
idea
of
god
isso
powerless
its
grip
so
to
speakthat
hindooism
with
a
monstrous
inconsistency
is
also
the
maddest
of
polytheisms
but
the
idolatry
of
the
wretched
hindoo
when
he
adores
the
ape
or
other
creature
is
still
a
long
way
from
that
wretched
fancy
of
a
pantheism
to
which
everything
is
god
and
god
everything
hindoo
monotheism
moreover
is
itself
an
example
how
little
comes
of
mere
monotheism
if
the
idea
of
god
is
not
deeply
determinate
in
itself
for
that
unity
if
it
be
intrinsically
abstract
and
therefore
empty
tends
of
itself
to
let
whatever
is
concrete
outside
itbe
it
as
a
lot
of
gods
or
as
secular
empirical
individualskeep
its
independence
that
pantheism
indeedon
the
shallow
conception
of
itmight
with
a
show
of
logic
as
well
be
called
a
monotheism
for
if
god
as
it
says
is
identical
with
the
world
then
as
there
is
only
one
world
there
would
be
in
that
pantheism
only
one
god
perhaps
the
empty
numerical
unity
must
be
predicated
of
the
world
but
such
abstract
predication
of
it
has
no
further
special
interest
on
the
contrary
a
mere
numerical
unity
just
means
that
its
content
is
an
infinite
multeity
and
variety
of
finitudes
but
it
is
that
delusion
with
the
empty
unity
which
alone
makes
possible
and
induces
the
wrong
idea
of
pantheism
it
is
only
the
picturefloating
in
the
indefinite
blueof
the
world
as
one
thing
the
all
that
could
ever
be
considered
capable
of
combining
with
god
only
on
that
assumption
could
philosophy
be
supposed
to
teach
that
god
is
the
world
for
if
the
world
were
taken
as
it
is
as
everything
as
the
endless
lot
of
empirical
existence
then
it
would
hardly
have
been
even
held
possible
to
suppose
a
pantheism
which
asserted
of
such
stuff
that
it
is
god
but
to
go
back
again
to
the
question
of
fact
if
we
want
to
see
the
consciousness
of
the
onenot
as
with
the
hindoos
split
between
the
featureless
unity
of
abstract
thought
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
the
longwinded
weary
story
of
its
particular
detail
butin
its
finest
purity
and
sublimity
we
must
consult
the
mohammedans
if
eg
in
the
excellent
jelaleddinrumi
in
particular
we
find
the
unity
of
the
soul
with
the
one
set
forth
and
that
unity
described
as
love
this
spiritual
unity
is
an
exaltation
above
the
finite
and
vulgar
a
transfiguration
of
the
natural
and
the
spiritual
in
which
the
externalism
and
transitoriness
of
immediate
nature
and
of
empirical
secular
spirit
is
discarded
and
absorbed174
i
refrain
from
accumulating
further
examples
of
the
religious
and
poetic
conceptions
which
it
is
customary
to
call
pantheistic
of
the
philosophies
to
which
that
name
is
given
the
eleatic
or
spinozist
it
has
been
remarked
earlier

50
note
that
so
far
are
they
from
identifying
god
with
the
world
and
making
him
finite
that
in
these
systems
this
everything
has
no
truth
and
that
we
should
rather
call
them
monotheistic
or
in
relation
to
the
popular
idea
of
the
world
acosmical
they
are
most
accurately
called
systems
which
apprehend
the
absolute
only
as
substance
of
the
oriental
especially
the
mohammedan
modes
of
envisaging
god
we
may
rather
say
that
they
represent
the
absolute
as
the
utterly
universal
genus
which
dwells
in
the
species
or
existences
but
dwells
so
potently
that
these
existences
have
no
actual
reality
the
fault
of
all
these
modes
of
thought
and
systems
is
that
they
stop
short
of
defining
substance
as
subject
and
as
mind
these
systems
and
modes
of
pictorial
conception
originate
from
the
one
need
common
to
all
philosophies
and
all
religions
of
getting
an
idea
of
god
and
secondly
of
the
relationship
of
god
and
the
world
in
philosophy
it
is
specially
made
out
that
the
determination
of
gods
nature
determines
his
relations
with
the
world
the
reflective
understanding
begins
by
rejecting
all
systems
and
modes
of
conception
which
whether
they
spring
from
heart
imagination
or
speculation
express
the
interconnexion
of
god
and
the
world
and
in
order
to
have
god
pure
in
faith
or
consciousness
he
is
as
essence
parted
from
appearance
as
infinite
from
the
finite
but
after
this
partition
the
conviction
arises
also
that
the
appearance
has
a
relation
to
the
essence
the
finite
to
the
infinite
and
so
on
and
thus
arises
the
question
of
reflection
as
to
the
nature
of
this
relation
it
is
in
the
reflective
form
that
the
whole
difficulty
of
the
affair
lies
and
that
causes
this
relation
to
be
called
incomprehensible
by
the
agnostic
the
close
of
philosophy
is
not
the
place
even
in
a
general
exoteric
discussion
to
waste
a
word
on
what
a
notion
means
but
as
the
view
taken
of
this
relation
is
closely
connected
with
the
view
taken
of
philosophy
generally
and
with
all
imputations
against
it
we
may
still
add
the
remark
that
though
philosophy
certainly
has
to
do
with
unity
in
general
it
is
not
however
with
abstract
unity
mere
identity
and
the
empty
absolute
but
with
concrete
unity
the
notion
and
that
in
its
whole
course
it
has
to
do
with
nothing
elsethat
each
step
in
its
advance
is
a
peculiar
term
or
phase
of
this
concrete
unity
and
that
the
deepest
and
last
expression
of
unity
is
the
unity
of
absolute
mind
itself
wouldbe
judges
and
critics
of
philosophy
might
be
recommended
to
familiarise
themselves
with
these
phases
of
unity
and
to
take
the
trouble
to
get
acquainted
with
them
at
least
to
know
so
much
that
of
these
terms
there
are
a
great
many
and
that
amongst
them
there
is
great
variety
but
they
show
so
little
acquaintance
with
themand
still
less
take
trouble
about
itthat
when
they
hear
of
unityand
relation
ipso
facto
implies
unitythey
rather
stick
fast
at
quite
abstract
indeterminate
unity
and
lose
sight
of
the
chief
point
of
interestthe
special
mode
in
which
the
unity
is
qualified
hence
all
they
can
say
about
philosophy
is
that
dry
identity
is
its
principle
and
result
and
that
it
is
the
system
of
identity
sticking
fast
to
the
undigested
thought
of
identity
they
have
laid
hands
on
not
the
concrete
unity
the
notion
and
content
of
philosophy
but
rather
its
reverse
in
the
philosophical
field
they
proceed
as
in
the
physical
field
the
physicist
who
also
is
well
aware
that
he
has
before
him
a
variety
of
sensuous
properties
and
mattersor
usually
matters
alone
for
the
properties
get
transformed
into
matters
also
for
the
physicistand
that
these
matters
elements
also
stand
in
relation
to
one
another
but
the
question
is
of
what
kind
is
this
relation
every
peculiarity
and
the
whole
difference
of
natural
things
inorganic
and
living
depend
solely
on
the
different
modes
of
this
unity
but
instead
of
ascertaining
these
different
modes
the
ordinary
physicist
chemist
included
takes
up
only
one
the
most
external
and
the
worst
viz
composition
applies
only
it
in
the
whole
range
of
natural
structures
which
he
thus
renders
for
ever
inexplicable
the
aforesaid
shallow
pantheism
is
an
equally
obvious
inference
from
this
shallow
identity
all
that
those
who
employ
this
invention
of
their
own
to
accuse
philosophy
gather
from
the
study
of
gods
relation
to
the
world
is
that
the
one
but
only
the
one
factor
of
this
category
of
relationand
that
the
factor
of
indeterminatenessis
identity
thereupon
they
stick
fast
in
this
halfperception
and
assertfalsely
as
a
factthat
philosophy
teaches
the
identity
of
god
and
the
world
and
as
in
their
judgment
either
of
the
twothe
world
as
much
as
godhas
the
same
solid
substantiality
as
the
other
they
infer
that
in
the
philosophic
idea
god
is
composed
of
god
and
the
world
such
then
is
the
idea
they
form
of
pantheism
and
which
they
ascribe
to
philosophy
unaccustomed
in
their
own
thinking
and
apprehending
of
thoughts
to
go
beyond
such
categories
they
import
them
into
philosophy
where
they
are
utterly
unknown
they
thus
infect
it
with
the
disease
against
which
they
subsequently
raise
an
outcry
if
any
difficulty
emerge
in
comprehending
gods
relation
to
the
world
they
at
once
and
very
easily
escape
it
by
admitting
that
this
relation
contains
for
them
an
inexplicable
contradiction
and
that
hence
they
must
stop
at
the
vague
conception
of
such
relation
perhaps
under
the
more
familiar
names
of
eg
omnipresence
providence
c
faith
in
their
use
of
the
term
means
no
more
than
a
refusal
to
define
the
conception
or
to
enter
on
a
closer
discussion
of
the
problem
that
men
and
classes
of
untrained
intellect
are
satisfied
with
such
indefiniteness
is
what
one
expects
but
when
a
trained
intellect
and
an
interest
for
reflective
study
is
satisfied
in
matters
admitted
to
be
of
superior
if
not
even
of
supreme
interest
with
indefinite
ideas
it
is
hard
to
decide
whether
the
thinker
is
really
in
earnest
with
the
subject
but
if
those
who
cling
to
this
crude
rationalism
were
in
earnest
eg
with
gods
omnipresence
so
far
as
to
realise
their
faith
thereon
in
a
definite
mental
idea
in
what
difficulties
would
they
be
involved
by
their
belief
in
the
true
reality
of
the
things
of
sense
they
would
hardly
like
as
epicurus
does
to
let
god
dwell
in
the
interspaces
of
things
ie
in
the
pores
of
the
physicistssaid
pores
being
the
negative
something
supposed
to
exist
beside
the
material
reality
this
very
beside
would
give
their
pantheism
its
spatialitytheir
everything
conceived
as
the
mutual
exclusion
of
parts
in
space
but
in
ascribing
to
god
in
his
relation
to
the
world
an
action
on
and
in
the
space
thus
filled
on
the
world
and
in
it
they
would
endlessly
split
up
the
divine
actuality
into
infinite
materiality
they
would
really
thus
have
the
misconception
they
call
pantheism
or
allonedoctrine
only
as
the
necessary
sequel
of
their
misconceptions
of
god
and
the
world
but
to
put
that
sort
of
thing
this
stale
gossip
of
oneness
or
identity
on
the
shoulders
of
philosophy
shows
such
recklessness
about
justice
and
truth
that
it
can
only
be
explained
through
the
difficulty
of
getting
into
the
head
thoughts
and
notions
ie
not
abstract
unity
but
the
manyshaped
modes
specified
if
statements
as
to
facts
are
put
forward
and
the
facts
in
question
are
thoughts
and
notions
it
is
indispensable
to
get
hold
of
their
meaning
but
even
the
fulfilment
of
this
requirement
has
been
rendered
superfluous
now
that
it
has
long
been
a
foregone
conclusion
that
philosophy
is
pantheism
a
system
of
identity
an
allone
doctrine
and
that
the
person
therefore
who
might
be
unaware
of
this
fact
is
treated
either
as
merely
unaware
of
a
matter
of
common
notoriety
or
as
prevaricating
for
a
purpose
on
account
of
this
chorus
of
assertions
then
i
have
believed
myself
obliged
to
speak
at
more
length
and
exoterically
on
the
outward
and
inward
untruth
of
this
alleged
fact
for
exoteric
discussion
is
the
only
method
available
in
dealing
with
the
external
apprehension
of
notions
as
mere
factsby
which
notions
are
perverted
into
their
opposite
the
esoteric
study
of
god
and
identity
as
of
cognitions
and
notions
is
philosophy
itself

574
this
notion
of
philosophy
is
the
selfthinking
idea
the
truth
aware
of
itself

236the
logical
system
but
with
the
signification
that
it
is
universality
approved
and
certified
in
concrete
content
as
in
its
actuality
in
this
way
the
science
has
gone
back
to
its
beginning
its
result
is
the
logical
system
but
as
a
spiritual
principle
out
of
the
presupposing
judgment
in
which
the
notion
was
only
implicit
and
the
beginning
an
immediateand
thus
out
of
the
appearance
which
it
had
thereit
has
risen
into
its
pure
principle
and
thus
also
into
its
proper
medium

575
it
is
this
appearing
which
originally
gives
the
motive
of
the
further
development
the
first
appearance
is
formed
by
the
syllogism
which
is
based
on
the
logical
system
as
startingpoint
with
nature
for
the
middle
term
which
couples
the
mind
with
it
the
logical
principle
turns
to
nature
and
nature
to
mind
nature
standing
between
the
mind
and
its
essence
sunders
itself
not
indeed
to
extremes
of
finite
abstraction
nor
itself
to
something
away
from
them
and
independentwhich
as
other
than
they
only
serves
as
a
link
between
them
for
the
syllogism
is
in
the
idea
and
nature
is
essentially
defined
as
a
transitionpoint
and
negative
factor
and
as
implicitly
the
idea
still
the
mediation
of
the
notion
has
the
external
form
of
transition
and
the
science
of
nature
presents
itself
as
the
course
of
necessity
so
that
it
is
only
in
the
one
extreme
that
the
liberty
of
the
notion
is
explicit
as
a
selfamalgamation

576
in
the
second
syllogism
this
appearance
is
so
far
superseded
that
that
syllogism
is
the
standpoint
of
the
mind
itself
whichas
the
mediating
agent
in
the
processpresupposes
nature
and
couples
it
with
the
logical
principle
it
is
the
syllogism
where
mind
reflects
on
itself
in
the
idea
philosophy
appears
as
a
subjective
cognition
of
which
liberty
is
the
aim
and
which
is
itself
the
way
to
produce
it

577
the
third
syllogism
is
the
idea
of
philosophy
which
has
selfknowing
reason
the
absolutelyuniversal
for
its
middle
term
a
middle
which
divides
itself
into
mind
and
nature
making
the
former
its
presupposition
as
process
of
the
ideas
subjective
activity
and
the
latter
its
universal
extreme
as
process
of
the
objectively
and
implicitly
existing
idea
the
selfjudging
of
the
idea
into
its
two
appearances

575
576
characterises
both
as
its
the
selfknowing
reasons
manifestations
and
in
it
there
is
a
unification
of
the
two
aspectsit
is
the
nature
of
the
fact
the
notion
which
causes
the
movement
and
development
yet
this
same
movement
is
equally
the
action
of
cognition
the
eternal
idea
in
full
fruition
of
its
essence
eternally
sets
itself
to
work
engenders
and
enjoys
itself

as

plato
had
a
better
idea
of
the
relation
of
prophecy
generally
to
the
state
of
sober
consciousness
than
many
moderns
who
supposed
that
the
platonic
language
on
the
subject
of
enthusiasm
authorised
their
belief
in
the
sublimity
of
the
revelations
of
somnambulistic
vision
plato
says
in
the
timaeus
p
71
the
author
of
our
being
so
ordered
our
inferior
parts
that
they
too
might
obtain
a
measure
of
truth
and
in
the
liver
placed
their
oracle
the
power
of
divination
by
dreams
and
herein
is
a
proof
that
god
has
given
the
art
of
divination
not
to
the
wisdom
but
to
the
foolishness
of
man
for
no
man
when
in
his
wits
attains
prophetic
truth
and
inspiration
but
when
he
receives
the
inspired
word
either
his
intelligence
is
enthralled
by
sleep
or
he
is
demented
by
some
distemper
or
possession
enthusiasm
plato
very
correctly
notes
not
merely
the
bodily
conditions
on
which
such
visionary
knowledge
depends
and
the
possibility
of
the
truth
of
the
dreams
but
also
the
inferiority
of
them

rise

this
poetry
which
soars
over
all
that
is
external
and
sensuous
who
would
recognise
the
prosaic
ideas
current
about
socalled
pantheismideas
which
let
the
divine
sink
to
the
external
and
the
sensuous
the
copious
extracts
which
tholuck
in
his
work
anthology
from
the
eastern
mystics
gives
us
from
the
poems
of
jelaleddin
and
others
are
made
from
the
very
point
of
view
now
under
discussion
in
his
introduction
herr
tholuck
proves
how
profoundly
his
soul
has
caught
the
note
of
mysticism
and
there
too
he
points
out
the
characteristic
traits
of
its
oriental
phase
in
distinction
from
that
of
the
west
and
christendom
with
all
their
divergence
however
they
have
in
common
the
mystical
character
the
conjunction
of
mysticism
with
socalled
pantheism
as
he
says
p
53
implies
that
inward
quickening
of
soul
and
spirit
which
inevitably
tends
to
annihilate
that
external
everything
which
pantheism
is
usually
held
to
adore
but
beyond
that
herr
tholuck
leaves
matters
standing
at
the
usual
indistinct
conception
of
pantheism
a
profounder
discussion
of
it
would
have
had
for
the
authors
emotional
christianity
no
direct
interest
but
we
see
that
personally
he
is
carried
away
by
remarkable
enthusiasm
for
a
mysticism
which
in
the
ordinary
phrase
entirely
deserves
the
epithet
pantheistic
where
however
he
tries
philosophising
p
12
he
does
not
get
beyond
the
standpoint
of
the
rationalist
metaphysic
with
its
uncritical
categories
