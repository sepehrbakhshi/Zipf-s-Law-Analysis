preface
the
translation
of
hegels
aesthetik
or
philosophy
of
fine
art
which
is
contained
in
the
four
volumes
of
the
present
work
is
the
first
complete
translation
in
english
of
the
three
volumes
devoted
to
this
subject
in
the
collected
edition

i
know
of
four
partial
translations
in
english
of
this
work
and
one
in

are

complete
translation
of
hegels
first
introduction
with
notes4
the
french
translation
of
m
bnard
purports
to
be
more
or
less
a
reproduction
of
the
entire
work
and
runs
into
two
largesized
volumes
it
also
is
however
so
far
as
hegels
introduction
and
the
first
two
parts
are
concerned
merely
a
compressed
summary
and
only
in
particular
passages
is
the
translation
anything
but
a
very
free
rendering
of
the
original
though
there
is
a
far
closer
approach
to
this
in
part
iii
i
have
not
seen
mr
bryants
translation
as
any
approach
to
an
adequate
reproduction
of
hegels
writing
mr
hasties
translation
of
michelets
work
and
mr
kedneys
analysis
are
of
very
little
value5
professor
bosanquets
translation
is
admirable
within
the
limits
imposed
to
that
extent
i
have
merely
followed
as
i
was
able
in
my
friends
footsteps
but
this
advance
covers
little
more
than
one
sixteenth
part
of
the
entire
work
of
1600
pages
with
regard
to
all
such
analyses
i
entirely
concur
with
professor
bosanquets
view
stated
in
his
preface
that
such
merely
mislead
if
regarded
as
in
any
way
a
reflex
of
either
hegel
himself
or
the
german
text
it
is
true
that
this
work
isas
are
in
their
degree
other
volumes
of
the
collected
edition
the
outlines
of
the
philosophy
of
right
for
examplea
heterogeneous
product
in
our
own
instance
not
merely
lacking
the
final
revision
of
the
author
but
rather
put
together
as
such
a
connected
treatise
by
the
editor
responsible
i
from
several
autograph
mss
of
hegel6
some
of
which
were
little
more
than
fragmentary
notes
for
lectures
ii
supplemented
further
from
notes7
taken
by
pupils
who
attended
such
lectures
the
entire
conglomerate
being
iii
finally
dovetailed
together
with
connecting
links
by
the
editorial
hand
much
as
to
cite
his
own
illustration
a
careful
picture
restorer
might
do
in
order
to
secure
the
impression
of
a
unified
work
the
unity
aimed
at
by
himself
being
rather
that
of
a
connected
literary
treatise
than
a
series
of
lectures
it
is
obvious
that
a
product
of
this
nature
will
vary
considerably
throughout
in
the
degree
that
the
personality
and
unique
flavour
of
hegel
himself
whether
viewed
as
writer
or
thinker
asserts
itself
the
introductions8
have
been
it
would
appear
taken
almost
exclusively
from
hegels
own
mss
but
even
these
remained
unrevised
for
the
press
owing
to
the
premature
and
sudden
death
of
their
author
of
the
greater
portion
of
the
work
we
can
merely
form
our
judgment
of
the
nature
of
its
authenticity
from
the
content
itself
on
the
whole
i
should
myself
say
that
the
result
was
more
favourable
than
might
under
such
conditions
have
been
expected
the
editor
assures
us
expressly
that
so
far
as
all
illustrations
and
the
substantive
content
of
the
work
is
concerned
no
attempt
has
been
made
whatever
to
supplement
the
same
hegel
is
throughout
here
entirely
responsible
i
think
further
that
the
endeavour
claimed
by
the
editor
to
preserve
the
general
character
and
tone
kolorit
of
hegels
own
diction
has
attained
a
degree
of
success
that
could
only
have
been
within
the
reach
of
devoted
pupils
and
friends
of
the
man
himself
who
for
many
years
both
attended
his
lectures
and
studied
his
published
works
whatever
opinion
however
we
may
arrive
at
on
this
head
there
can
hardly
be
two
opinions
as
to
the
sources
in
which
the
main
interest
consists
for
a
modern
reader
first
i
should
lay
particular
stress
on
the
forceful
and
characteristic
manner
in
which
the
fundamental
philosophical
conceptions
which
underlie
the
entire
fabric
are
worked
into
and
elaborated
explicitly
throughout
its
detail
the
very
nature
of
this
unwearied
and
insistent
interfusion
durchdringung
of
positive
fact
whether
historical
scientific
or
aesthetic
with
the
dialectic
movement
of
the
idea
is
here
as
essentially
the
method
of
hegel
as
it
is
elsewhere
and
this
is
so
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
here
presented
for
the
most
part
in
a
form
less
repellent
to
the
ordinary
reader
and
less
provocative
of
hostile
criticism
translators
therefore
who
following
the
example
of
the
french
translator9
deliberately
seek
to
lighten
the
burden
of
their
cargo
by
throwing
overboard
what
they
choose
to
call
the
injurious
dialectic
or
the
dark
labyrinth
of
this
aspect
of
our
work
may
reproduce
much
that
is
of
instruction
or
interest
but
most
certainly
do
not
reproduce
either
the
main
strength
of
hegel
as
a
thinker
or
the
most
characteristic
impressionto
say
nothing
of
the
repetitionsof
such
style
or
absence
of
literary
style
that
he
possessed
secondly
if
there
is
one
feature
more
striking
than
any
other
in
this
work
which
is
bound
at
least
to
surprise
anyone
who
still
harbours
the
obsolete
notion
that
this
philosopher
moved
in
an
exclusively
abstract
region
of
idea
remote
from
the
concrete
experience
of
life
and
scientific
or
artistic
knowledge
it
is
the
wealth
and
extraordinary
range
of
the
illustrations
in
these
volumes
no
less
than
the
vigour
and
freshness
of
their
application
in
this
respect
two
translations
which
merely
amount
to
a
summary
of
theoretical
content
simply
omit
the
vital
or
at
least
the
most
attractive
heart
of
the
interest
as
to
the
present
claim
of
this
laborious
work
to
recognition
and
study
its
historical
significance
is
i
think
admitted
by
the
most
acknowledged
authorities
on
the
subject
as
schasler
has
called
it
it
is
the
first
complete
system
of
a
philosophy
of
art
the
nature
of
its
importance
to
our
own
most
able
and
learned
historian
of
the
philosophy
of
fine
art
may
not
only
be
deduced
from
his
own
summary
of
its
contents
and
significance
in
his
invaluable
historical
survey10
but
is
further
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
he
has
reproduced
the
concluding
portion
of
hegels
introduction
in
extenso
in
an
appendix
to
this
work
other
writers
have
been
less
judicious
both
as
hostile
critics
and
in
the
degree
of
their
praise
or
enthusiasm
one
german
authority
has
called
it
hegels
masterpiece
such
a
title
is
apart
from
any
other
ground
sufficiently
excluded
by
its
history
alone
whether
hegel
might
have
made
it
his
masterpiece
had
he
lived
is
of
course
another
question
other
admirers
such
as
the
late
professor
caird11
have
more
legitimately
accepted
such
a
distinction
for
the
phenomenologie
des
geistes
mr
hastie
will
even
have
it
that
throughout
all
is
clear
radiant
harmonious
and
dim
with
the
things
that
are
a
joy
for
ever
such
an
effusive
display
of
abstract
vorstellung
reminds
one
little
of
either
the
dour
temper
of
the
swabian
philosopher
or
the
concrete
intelligence
which
most
distinguishes
him
from
his
rivals
now
and
in
his
lifetime
i
can
promise
no
such
garden
of
hesperides
or
even
platonic
banquet
to
any
of
my
readers
it
is
true
that
we
have
here
the
work
being
primarily
built
upon
lectures
intended
to
instruct
the
ordinary
student
no
such
parade
of
the
dialectic
method
in
its
formal
structure
such
as
constitutes
the
root
of
offence
in
some
other
works
of
hegel
but
if
we
approach
it
with
the
belief
that
all
is
therefore
the
plain
sailing
we
meet
with
in
the
world
of
journalistic
art
criticism
and
the
commonsense
conceptions
of
everyday
life
or
with
the
assurance
that
the
work
is
or
can
be
intelligible
without
some
real
attempt
to
grapple
with
the
fundamental
ideas
of
hegelian
metaphysic
we
may
find
our
disappointment
very
considerable
as
a
humble
translator
i
am
bound
to
say
that
in
a
very
large
number
of
passages
i
have
by
no
means
discovered
immediacy
of
intelligibility
or
radiance
to
be
a
conspicuous
feature
of
the
original
radiance
is
indeed
i
should
say
not
an
attribute
emphatically
characteristic
of
any
kind
of
teutonic
literature
and
least
of
all
of
its
scientific
and
philosophical
literature
the
present
work
is
certainly
no
exception
with
its
untiring
not
to
say
remorseless
effort
to
press
home
in
repeated
expression
often
but
slightly
varied
the
same
fundamental
points
its
dogged
and
endless
persistence
in
the
careful
explication
through
rational
definition
of
every
kind
of
positive
material
that
presents
itself
from
the
nature
of
the
divine
in
man
or
the
soul
of
living
beast
to
the
accurate
determination
in
the
terms
of
expressed
thought
of
a
musical
sound
or
an
epigram
or
simile
with
its
wellnigh
total
disregard
of
the
beauty
of
literary
style
and
its
by
no
means
unfrequent
disregard
of
all
principle
of
proportion
in
the
coordination
of
its
varied
subjectmatterwhatever
else
such
a
product
may
be
it
is
most
assuredly
not
at
least
to
english
apprehension
reminiscent
of
the
radiance
either
of
homer
or
apollo
but
though
even
sincere
admiration
may
smile
over
such
a
description
it
does
unquestionably
reflect
to
a
remarkable
extent
the
thoroughness
tenacity
of
purpose
the
absence
of
superficial
rhetoric
the
wide
range
the
extraordinary
combination
of
constructive
idea
and
detailed
knowledge
and
research
we
rightly
associate
with
the
most
valued
works
of
german
science
and
philosophy
it
has
never
been
more
needful
than
at
this
time
of
day
to
draw
attention
to
such
qualities
when
the
national
bias
is
to
ignore
or
belittle
their
presence
it
is
moreover
not
without
passages
which
attain
to
a
very
real
elevation
of
eloquence
eloquence
marked
by
the
profoundest
earnestness
and
entirely
free
from
the
least
flavour
of
bombast
or
sentimentalism
to
the
right
kind
of
reader
it
can
hardly
fail
to
convey
a
certain
fascination
which
is
not
merely
due
to
the
presence
of
a
powerful
and
original
intellect
but
is
equally
inseparable
from
the
product
of
a
human
soul
intent
upon
getting
at
the
heart
of
its
subject
and
keeping
its
vision
throughout
fixed
on
that
nor
is
the
mere
breadth
of
the
canvas
and
the
depth
of
its
content
its
only
attraction
the
work
is
indeed
full
of
digressions
of
exceptional
interest
to
the
general
reader
and
as
such
bears
the
indelible
stamp
of
hegels
manner
as
a
lecturer
which
his
editor
maintains
stood
out
in
such
marked
contrast
to
his
more
concise
style
as
an
author
drawing
as
he
did
when
lecturing
so
largely
on
his
encyclopaedic
stores
of
knowledge
to
treat
all
the
text
as
we
now
have
it
with
the
same
respect
may
very
possibly
betoken
to
some
an
excess
of
zeal
on
the
part
of
the
translator
but
after
all
the
most
important
thing
for
an
english
reader
is
to
know
what
the
volumes
actually
contain
in
dealing
with
hegel
the
outlined
sketch
whether
secured
through
a
process
of
distillation
or
adulteration
is
by
no
means
any
compensation
for
the
loss
of
the
complete
picture
if
we
are
impatient
over
many
aspects
of
this
philosophers
particularity
we
had
much
better
dispense
with
him
altogether
sympathetically
studied
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
this
monumental
work
is
an
education
in
itself
it
is
at
any
rate
one
which
cannot
fail
to
enlarge
our
conceptions
of
the
significance
and
dignity
of
human
art
nor
is
this
by
any
means
impossible
even
though
we
are
unable
to
concur
in
or
indeed
remain
insufficiently
qualified
to
express
a
judgment
upon
all
or
even
a
few
of
the
most
important
of
its
conclusions
but
it
is
perhaps
not
wholly
unnecessary
to
observe
that
before
venturing
upon
a
verdict
in
our
wisdom
we
must
as

browning

both
our

intelligence
that
they
may
the
better
judge
it
is
the
modest
aim
of
the
present
translation
to
make
that
preparatory
process
more
easy
for
the
english
reader
to
assist
that
intelligent
assimilation
of
the
truth
as
it
appears
to
a
great
and
worldfamous
thinker
which
is
the
necessary
condition
of
any
criticism
meriting
respectful
attention
at
all
such
assimilation
is
perhaps
impossible
in
the
case
of
hegel
without
effort
and
indeed
something
of
sympathy
with
his
general
outlook
and
temper
making
as
he
does
little
or
no
appeal
whatever
to
the
lover
of
literature
as
such
who
had
consequently
far
better
leave
him
austerely
alone
to
the
consideration
of
others
who
are
more
attracted
i
do
not
propose
in
these
prefatory
remarks
to
enlarge
further
on
the
actual
content
of
the
work

on
the
nature
of
the
criticism
which
has
been
directed
either
to
fundamental
positions
or
matters
of
detail
some
of
these
i
have
referred
to
in
my
notes
on
the
text
where
they
are
most
obviously
pertinent
the
general
reader
will
find
a
very
useful
introduction
to

the
more
serious

can
hardly
dispense
with

perusal
of
a
considerable
portion

i
hold
my
translation
to
be
as
literal
as
is
possible
consistently
with
an
endeavour
to
render
or
interpret
german
philosophical
language
in
the
language
or
idiom
of
really
expressive
and
intelligible
english
it
is
now
generally
admitted
that
all
translation
is
in
the
nature
of
an
interpretation
however
much
i
may
have
fallen
short
of
my
aim
that
aim
has
been
throughout
to
express
the
actual
ideal
content
of
the
german
not
merely
with
all
the
force
and
directness
i
could
muster
but
with
as
near
an
approach
to
the
formal
structure
of
the
german
text
as
was
consistent
with
the
like
condition
of
really
readable
english
above
all
i
have
striven
to
avoid
the
lassitude
of
mere
paraphrase
that
vague
generalization
of
content
which
conceives
itself
to
possess
the
right
to
eliminate
from
the
text
pretty
much
what
it
pleases
the
index
attached
to
the

preeminently
to

the

of

an
almost
inevitable
defect
of
such

is
that
criticism

the

for
any

as
a
partial
manifestation

such

it
may
be
said
that
while
we
prefer

this
is
partly
because
schelling
is

can

a

other

that
of
proving

occupy
a

the
idea

life
a
the
first
mode
under
which
the
notion
is
in
nature
asserted
as
objectivity

that
of
physical
matter
the
ideal
unity
whereof
is
not

a
further
step
is
the
integration
of
natural
objects
under
a
unified
system
as
the
solar
system
c
the
third
mode
is
that
of
organic
life

existence

to
the
conception
of
beauty

the
nature
of
organic
unity
and
the
degree
it
contributes
to
the
beauty
of
an
object
c
the
inward
unity
of

and
the
degree
it
contributes
to
the
correlation
of

of

organism
or
is
asserted
in
external
form

our
senses
rather
than
our
reflection
3
modes
under
which
the
beauty
of
nature
is
investigated
a
where
the
form
is
immediately
in
the
materia
as
its
essence
or
conformative
energy
as
in
crystals
or
more
concretely
as
the
informing
soul
through
the
living
organism
b
mobility
in
animals
as
a
test
of
their
apparent
beauty
c
selfconscious
life
the
culminating
mode
b
the
external
beauty
of
abstract
form
viewed
as
uniformity
symmetry
conformity
to
rule
and
harmony
also
beauty
regarded
generally
as
abstract
unity
of
the
sensuous
material
c
the
defective
aspects
of
the
beauty
of
nature
1
the
inward
principle
in
its
immediacy
as
merely
such
inwardness
a
immediate
singularity
as
conserved
in
the
purely
animal
organism
b
of
the
nature
of
the
contrast
between
the
above
and
the
human
body
c
social
organizations
viewed
in
such
particularized
immediacy
and
the
defects
they
betray
as
such
external
totalities
2
the
dependence
of
particular
existence
as
viewed
in
its
immediate
singularity
a
the
dependence
of
animal
life
upon
its
natural
environment
b
the
nature
of
a
similar
dependence
in
the
case
of
the
human
organism
c
the
dependence
of
human
souls
or
spiritual
interests
on
the
proselife
of
ordinary
existence
3
the
limitations
implied
by
such
conditions
a
the
restriction
of
species
in
the
animal
world
and
of
the
social
condition
as
it
affects
human
individuality
b
the
limitation
of
racial
division
or
of
particular
families
or
particular
professions
and
the
effect
of
such
upon
the
aspect
of
beauty
c
it
is
the
very
defects
of
this
finite
plane
of
reality
which
stimulates
man
to
recover
the
vision
of
his
freedom
in
art
chapter
iii
the
beauty
of
art
or
the
ideal
a
the
ideal
as
such
1
individuality
which
partakes
of
beauty
a
the
nature
of
the
conditions
under
which
art
can
express
a
profound
and
infinite
spiritual
content
b
what
art
rejects
from
natural
embodiment
in
order
to
effect
this
revelation
which
is
also
a
purification
c
this
referring
back
of
external
form
to
spirituality
or
inwardness
issuing
in
harmonious
individuality
is
the
very
nature
of
the
ideal

the

introduction
i
the
present
inquiry1
has
for
its
subjectmatter
aesthetic
it
is
a
subject
coextensive
with
the
entire
realm
of
the
beautiful
more
specifically
described
its
province
is
that
of
art
or
rather
we
should
say
of
fine
art
for
a
subjectmatter
such
as
this
the
term
aesthetic
is
no
doubt
not
entirely
appropriate
for
aesthetic
denotes
more
accurately
the
science
of
the
senses
or
emotion
it
came
by
its
origins
as
a
science
or
rather
as
something
that
to
start
with
purported
to
be
a
branch
of
philosophy
during
the
period
of
the
school
of
wolff
in
other
words
when
works
of
art
were
generally
regarded
in
germany
with
reference
to
the
feelings
they
were
calculated
to
evoke
as
for
example
the
feelings
of
pleasure
admiration
fear
pity
and
so
forth
it
is
owing
to
the
unsuitability
or
more
strictly
speaking
the
superficiality
of
this
term
that
the
attempt
has
been
made
by
some
to
apply
the
name
callistic
to
this
science
yet
this
also
is
clearly
insufficient
inasmuch
as
the
science
here
referred
to
does
not
investigate
beauty
in
its
general
signification
but
the
beauty
of
art
pure
and
simple
for
this
reason
we
shall
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
term
aesthetic
all
the
more
so
as
the
mere
question
of
nomenclature
is
for
ourselves
a
matter
of
indifference
it
has
as
such
been
provisionally
accepted
in
ordinary
speech
and
we
cannot
do
better
than
retain
it
the
term
however
which
fully
expresses
our
science
is
philosophy
of
art
and
with
still
more
precision
philosophy
of
fine
art
a
in
virtue
of
this
expression
we
at
once
exclude
the
beauty
of
nature
from
the
scientific
exposition
of
fine
art
such
a
limitation
of
our
subject
may
very
well
appear
from
a
certain
point
of
view
as
an
arbitrary
boundary
line
similar
to
that
which
every
science
is
entitled
to
fix
in
the
demarcation
of
its
subjectmatter
we
must
not
however
understand
the
limitation
of
aesthetic
to
the
beauty
of
art
in
this
sense
we
are
accustomed
no
doubt
in
ordinary
life
to
speak
of
a
beautiful
colour
a
beautiful
heaven
a
beautiful
stream
to
say
nothing
of
beautiful
flowers
animals
and
above
all
of
beautiful
human
beings
without
entering
now
into
the
disputed
question
how
far
the
quality
of
beauty
can
justly
be
predicated
of
such
objects
and
consequently
the
beauty
of
nature
comes
generally
into
competition
with
that
of
art
we
are
justified
in
maintaining
categorically
that
the
beauty
of
art
stands
higher
than
nature
for
the
beauty
of
art
is
a
beauty
begotten
a
new
birth
of
mind2
and
to
the
extent
that
spirit
and
its
creations
stand
higher
than
nature
and
its
phenomena
to
that
extent
the
beauty
of
art
is
more
exalted
than
the
beauty
of
nature
indeed
if
we
regard
the
matter
in
its
formal
aspect
that
is
to
say
according
to
the
way
it
is
there
any
chance
fancy
that
passes
through
any
ones
head3
is
of
higher
rank
than
any
product
of
nature
for
in
every
case
intellectual
conception
and
freedom
are
inseparable
from
such
a
conceit
in
respect
to
content
the
sun
appears
to
us
an
absolutely
necessary
constituent
of
actual
fact
while
the
perverse
fancy
passes
away
as
something
accidental
and
evanescent
none
the
less
in
its
own
independent
being
a
natural
existence
such
as
the
sun
possesses
no
power
of
selfdifferentiation
it
is
neither
essentially
free
nor
selfaware
and
if
we
regard
it
in
its
necessary
cohesion
with
other
things
we
do
not
regard
it
independently
for
its
own
sake
and
consequently
not
as
beautiful
merely
to
maintain
in
a
general
way
that
mind
and
the
beauty
of
art
which
originates
therefrom
stand
higher
than
the
beauty
of
nature
is
no
doubt
to
establish
next
to
nothing
the
expression
higher
is
obviously
entirely
indefinite
it
still
indicates
the
beauty
of
nature
and
art
as
standing
juxtaposed
in
the
field
of
conception
and
emphasizes
the
difference
as
a
quantitative
and
accordingly
external
difference
but
in
predicating
of
mind
and
its
artistic
beauty
a
higher
place
in
contrast
to
nature
we
do
not
denote
a
distinction
which
is
merely
relative
mind
and
mind
alone
is
pervious
to
truth
comprehending
all
in
itself
so
that
all
which
is
beautiful
can
only
be
veritably
beautiful
as
partaking
in
this
higher
sphere
and
as
begotten
of
the
same
regarded
under
this
point
of
view
it
is
only
a
reflection
of
the
beauty
appertinent
to
mind
that
is
we
have
it
under
an
imperfect
and
incomplete
mode
and
one
whose
substantive
being
is
already
contained
in
the
mind
itself
and
apart
from
this
we
shall
find
the
restriction
to
the
beauty
of
art
only
natural
for
in
so
far
as
the
beauties
of
nature
may
have
come
under
discussiona
rarer
occurrence
among
ancient
writers
than
among
ourselvesyet
at
least
it
has
occurred
to
no
one
to
insist
emphatically
on
the
beauty
of
natural
objects
to
the
extent
of
proposing
a
science
or
systematic
exposition
of
such
beauties
it
is
true
that
the
point
of
view
of
utility
has
been
selected
for
such
exclusive
treatment
we
have
for
example
the
conception
of
a
science
of
natural
objects
in
so
far
as
they
are
useful
in
the
conflict
with
diseases
in
other
words
a
description
of
minerals
chemical
products
plants
animals
which
subserve
the
art
of
healing
we
do
not
find
any
analogous
exploitation
and
consideration
of
the
realm
of
nature
in
its
aspect
of
beauty
in
the
case
of
natural
beauty
we
are
too
keenly
conscious
that
we
are
dealing
with
an
indefinite
subjectmatter
destitute
of
any
real
criterion
it
is
for
this
reason
that
such
an
effort
of
comparison
would
carry
with
it
too
little
interest
to
justify
the
attempt
these
preliminary
observations
over
beauty
in
nature
and
art
over
the
relation
of
both
and
the
exclusion
of
the
firstmentioned
from
the
province
of
our
real
subjectmatter
are
intended
to
disabuse
us
of
the
notion
that
the
limitation
of
our
science
is
simply
a
question
of
capricious
selection
we
have
however
not
reached
the
point
where
a
demonstration
of
this
fact
is
feasible
for
the
reason
that
such
an
investigation
falls
within
the
limits
of
our
science
itself
and
it
is
therefore
only
at
a
later
stage
that
we
can
either
discuss
or
prove
the
same
assuming
however
that
we
have
by
way
of
prelude
limited
our
inquiry
to
the
beauty
of
art
we
are
merely
by
this
first
step
involved
in
fresh
difficulties
b
what
must
first
of
all
occur
to
us
is
the
question
whether
fine
art
in
itself
is
truly
susceptible
to
a
scientific
treatment
it
is
a
simple
fact
that
beauty
and
art
pervade
all
the
affairs
of
life
like
some
friendly
genius
and
embellish
with
their
cheer
all
our
surroundings
mental
no
less
than
material
they
alleviate
the
strenuousness
of
such
relations
the
varied
changes
of
actual
life
they
banish
the
tedium
of
our
existence
with
their
entertainment
and
where
nothing
really
worth
having
is
actually
achieved
it
is
at
least
an
advantage
that
they
occupy
the
place
of
actual
vice
yet
while
art
prevails
on
all
sides
with
its
pleasing
shapes
from
the
crude
decorations
of
savage
tribes
up
to
the
splendours
of
the
sacred
shrine
adorned
with
every
conceivable
beauty
of
design
none
the
less
such
shapes
themselves
appear
to
fall
outside
the
real
purposes
of
life
and
even
where
the
imaginative
work
of
art
is
not
impervious
to
such
serious
objects
nay
rather
at
times
even
appear
to
assist
them
to
the
extent
at
least
of
removing
what
is
evil
to
a
distance
yet
for
all
that
art
essentially
belongs
to
the
relaxation
and
recreation
of
spiritual
life
whereas
its
substantive
interests
rather
make
a
call
upon
its
strained
energy
on
such
grounds
an
attempt
to
treat
that
which
on
its
own
account
is
not
of
a
serious
character
with
all
the
gravity
of
scientific
exposition
may
very
possibly
appear
to
be
unsuitable
and
pedantic
in
any
case
from
such
a
point
of
view
art
appears
a
superfluity
if
contrasted
with
the
essential
needs
and
interests
of
life
even
assuming
that
the
softening
of
the
soul
which
a
preoccupation
with
the
beauty
of
objects
is
capable
of
producing
does
not
actually
prove
injurious
in
its
effeminate
influence
upon
the
serious
quality
of
those
practical
interests
owing
to
this
fundamental
assumption
that
they
are
a
luxury
it
has
often
appeared
necessary
to
undertake
the
defence
of
the
fine
arts
relatively
to
the
necessities
of
practical
life
and
in
particular
relatively
to
morality
and
piety
and
inasmuch
as
this
harmlessness
is
incapable
of
demonstration
the
idea
has
been
at
least
to
make
it
appear
credible
that
this
luxury
of
human
experience
contributes
a
larger
proportion
of
advantages
than
disadvantages
in
this
respect
serious
aims
have
been
attributed
to
art
and
in
many
quarters
it
has
been
commended
as
a
mediator
between
reason
and
sensuous
associations
between
private
inclinations
and
duty
personified
in
short
as
a
reconciler
of
these
forces
in
the
strenuous
conflict
and
opposition
which
this
antagonism
generates
but
it
is
just
conceivable4
that
even
assuming
the
presence
of
such
aims
with
all
their
indubitably
greater
seriousness
neither
reason
nor
duty
come
by
much
profit
from
such
mediation
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
are
incapable
by
their
very
nature
of
any
such
interfusion
or
compromise
demanding
throughout
the
same
purity
which
they
intrinsically
possess
and
we
might
add
that
art
does
not
become
in
any
respect
more
worthy
thereby
of
scientific
discussion
inasmuch
as
it
remains
still
on
two
sides
a
menial
that
is
subservient
to
idleness
and
frivolity
if
also
to
objects
of
more
elevated
character
in
such
service
moreover
it
can
at
most
merely
appear
as
a
means
instead
of
being
an
object
for
its
own
sake
and
in
conclusion
assuming
that
art
is
a
means
it
still
invariably
labours
under
the
formal
defect
that
so
far
as
it
in
fact
is
subservient
to
more
serious
objects
and
produces
results
of
like
nature
the
means
which
actually
brings
this
about
is
deception
for
beauty
is
made
vital
in
the
appearance5
now
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
aims
which
are
true
and
serious
ought
not
to
be
achieved
by
deception
and
though
such
an
effect
is
here
and
there
secured
by
this
means
such
ought
only
to
be
the
case
in
a
restricted
degree
and
even
in
the
exceptional
case
we
are
not
justified
in
regarding
deception
as
the
right
means
for
the
means
ought
to
correspond
with
the
dignity
of
the
aim
neither
semblance
nor
deception
but
only
what
is
itself
real
and
true
possesses
a
title
to
create
what
is
real
and
true
just
in
the
same
way
science
has
to
investigate
the
true
interests
of
the
mind
in
accordance
with
the
actual
process
of
the
real
world
and
the
manner
of
conceiving
it
as
we
actually
find
it
we
may
possibly
conclude
from
the
above
grounds
that
the
art
of
beauty
is
unworthy
of
philosophical
examination
it
is
after
all
it
may
be
said
only
a
pleasant
pastime
and
though
we
may
admit
more
serious
aims
are
also
in
its
purview
nevertheless
it
is
essentially
opposed
to
such
aims
in
their
seriousness
it
is
at
the
most
merely
the
servant
of
specific
amusements
no
less
than
the
exceptional
serious
objects
and
for
the
medium
of
its
existence
as
also
for
the
means
of
its
operations
can
merely
avail
itself
of
deception
and
show
but
yet
further
in
the
second
place
it
is
a
still
more
plausible
contention
that
even
supposing
fine
art
to
be
compatible
generally
with
philosophical
disquisition
none
the
less
it
would
form
no
really
adequate
subjectmatter
for
scientific
enquiry
in
the
strict
sense
for
the
beauty
of
art
is
presented
to
sense
feeling
perception
and
imagination
its
field
is
not
that
of
thought
and
the
comprehension
of
its
activity
and
its
creations
demands
another
faculty
than
that
of
the
scientific
intelligence
furthermore
what
we
enjoy
in
artistic
beauty
is
just
the
freedom
of
its
creative
and
plastic
activity
in
the
production
and
contemplation
of
these
we
appear
to
escape
the
principle
of
rule
and
system
in
the
creations
of
art
we
seek
for
an
atmosphere
of
repose
and
animation
as
some
counterpoise
to
the
austerity
of
the
realm
of
law
and
the
sombre
selfconcentration
of
thought
we
seek
for
blithe
and
powerful
reality
in
exchange
for
the
shadowworld
of
the
idea
and
last
of
all
the
free
activity
of
the
imagination
is
the
source
of
the
fair
works
of
art
which
in
this
world
of
the
mind
are
even
more
free
than
nature
is
herself
not
only
has
art
at
its
service
the
entire
wealth
of
natural
form
in
all
their
superabundant
variety
but
the
creative
imagination
is
able
inexhaustibly
to
extend
the
realm
of
form
by
its
own
productions
and
modifications
in
the
presence
of
such
an
immeasurable
depth
of
inspired
creation
and
its
free
products
it
may
not
unreasonably
be
supposed
that
thought
will
lose
the
courage
to
apprehend
such
in
their
apparent
range
to
pronounce
its
verdict
thereon
and
to
appropriate
such
beneath
its
universal
formulae
science
on
the
other
hand
everyone
must
admit
is
formally
bound
to
occupy
itself
with
thinking
which
abstracts
from
the
mass
of
particulars
and
for
this
very
reason
from
one
point
of
view
the
imagination
and
its
contingency
and
caprice
in
other
words
the
organ
of
artistic
activity
and
enjoyment
is
excluded
from
it
on
the
other
hand
when
art
gives
joyous
animation
to
just
this
gloomy
and
arid
dryness
of
the
notion
bringing
its
abstractions
and
divisions
into
reconciliation
with
concrete
fact
supplementing
with
its
detail
what
is
wanting
to
the
notion
in
this
respect
even
in
that
case
a
purely
contemplative
reflection
simply
removes
once
more
all
that
has
been
added
does
away
with
it
conducting
the
notion
once
again
to
that
simplicity
denuded
of
positive
reality
which
belongs
to
it
and
its
shadowland
of
abstraction
it
is
also
a
possible
contention
that
science
in
respect
to
content
is
concerned
with
what
is
essentially
necessary
if
our
science
of
aesthetic
places
on
one
side
natural
beauty
not
merely
have
we
apparently
made
no
advance
but
rather
separated
ourselves
yet
further
from
what
is
necessary
the
expression
nature
implies
from
the
first
the
ideas
of
necessity
and
uniformity
that
is
to
say
a
constitution
which
gives
every
expectation
of
its
proximity
and
adaptability
to
scientific
inquiry
in
mental
operations
generally
and
most
of
all
in
the
imagination
if
contrasted
in
this
respect
with
nature
caprice
and
superiority
to
every
kind
of
formal
restriction
caprice
it
is
here
assumed
is
uniquely
in
its
right
place
and
these
at
once
put
out
of
court
the
basis
of
a
scientific
inquiry
from
each
and
all
these
points
of
view
consequently
in
its
origin
that
is
to
say
in
its
effect
and
in
its
range
fine
art
so
far
from
proving
itself
fitted
for
scientific
effort
rather
appears
fundamentally
to
resist
the
regulative
principle
of
thought
and
to
be
illadapted
for
exact
scientific
discussion
difficulties
of
this
kind
and
others
like
them
which
have
been
raised
in
respect
to
a
thoroughly
scientific
treatment
of
fine
art
have
been
borrowed
from
current
ideas
points
of
view
and
reflection
the
more
systematic
expansion
of
which
we
may
read
ad
nauseam
in
previous
literature
in
particular
french
literature
upon
the
subject
of
beauty
and
the
fine
arts
such
contain
to
some
extent
facts
which
have
their
justification
in
fact
elaborate
arguments6
are
deduced
therefrom
which
also
are
not
without
their
tincture
of
apparent
plausibility
in
this
way
for
instance
there
is
the
fact
that
the
configuration
of
beauty
is
as
multifold
as
the
phenomenon
of
beauty
is
of
universal
extension
from
which
we
may
conclude
if
we
care
to
do
so
that
a
universal
impulse
towards
beauty
is
enclosed
in
our
common
nature
and
may
yet
further
conceivably
infer
that
because
the
conceptions
of
beauty
are
so
countless
in
their
variety
and
withal
are
obviously
something
particular
it
is
impossible
to
secure
laws
of
universal
validity
either
relatively
to
beauty
or
our
taste
for
it
before
turning
away
from
such
theories
to
the
subject
as
we
ourselves
conceive
it
it
will
be
a
necessary
and
preliminary
task
to
discuss
the
questions
and
objections
raised
above
first
as
to
the
worthiness
of
art
to
form
the
object
of
scientific
inquiry
it
is
no
doubt
the
case
that
art
can
be
utilized
as
a
mere
pastime
in
the
service
of
pleasure
and
entertainment
either
in
the
embellishment
of
our
surroundings
the
imprinting
of
a
delightgiving
surface
to
the
external
conditions
of
life
or
the
emphasis
placed
by
decoration
on
other
objects
in
these
respects
it
is
unquestionably
no
independent
or
free
art
but
an
art
subservient
to
certain
objects
the
kind
of
art
however
which
we
ourselves
propose
to
examine
is
one
which
is
free
in
its
aim
and
its
means
that
art
in
general
can
serve
other
objects
and
even
be
merely
a
pastime
is
a
relation
which
it
possesses
in
common
with
thought
itself
from
one
point
of
view
thought
likewise
as
science
subservient
to
other
ends
can
be
used
in
just
the
same
way
for
finite
purposes
and
means
as
they
chance
to
crop
up
and
as
such
serviceable
faculty
of
science
is
not
selfdetermined
but
determined
by
something
alien
to
it
but
further
as
distinct
from
such
subservience
to
particular
objects
science
is
raised
of
its
own
essential
resources
in
free
independence
to
truth
and
exclusively
united
with
its
own
aims
in
discovering
the
true
fulfillment
in
that
truth
fine
art
is
not
art
in
the
true
sense
of
the
term
until
it
is
also
thus
free
and
its
highest
function
is
only
then
satisfied
when
it
has
established
itself
in
a
sphere
which
it
shares
with
religion
and
philosophy
becoming
thereby
merely
one
mode
and
form
through
which
the
divine
the
profoundest
interests
of
mankind
and
spiritual
truths
of
widest
range
art
brought
home
to
consciousness
and
expressed
it
is
in
works
of
art
that
nations
have
deposited
the
richest
intuitions
and
ideas
they
possess
and
not
infrequently
fine
art
supplies
a
key
of
interpretation
to
the
wisdom
and
religion
of
peoples
in
the
case
of
many
it
is
the
only
one
this
is
an
attribute
which
art
shares
in
common
with
religion
and
philosophy
the
peculiar
distinction
in
the
case
of
art
being
that
its
presentation
of
the
most
exalted
subjectmatter
is
in
sensuous
form
thereby
bringing
them
nearer
to
nature
and
her
mode
of
envisagement
that
is
closer
to
our
sensitive
and
emotional
life
the
world
into
the
profundity
of
which
thought
penetrates
is
a
supersensuous
one
a
world
which
to
start
with
is
posited
as
a
beyond
in
contrast
to
the
immediacy
of
ordinary
conscious
life
and
present
sensation
it
is
the
freedom
of
reflecting
consciousness
which
disengages
itself
from
this
immersion
in
the
this
side
or
immediacy
in
other
words
sensuous
reality
and
finitude
but
the
mind
is
able
too
to
heal
the
fracture
which
is
thus
created
in
its
progression
from
the
wealth
of
its
own
resources
it
brings
into
being
the
works
of
fine
art
as
the
primary
bond
of
mediation
between
that
which
is
exclusively
external
sensuous
and
transitory
and
the
medium
of
pure
thought
between
nature
and
its
finite
reality
and
the
infinite
freedom
of
a
reason
which
comprehends
now
it
was
objected
that
the
element7
of
art
was
if
we
view
it
as
a
whole
of
an
unworthy
character
inasmuch
as
it
consisted
of
appearance
and
deceptions
inseparable
from
such
such
a
contention
would
of
course
be
justifiable
if
we
were
entitled
to
assume
that
appearance
had
no
locus
standi8
at
all
an
appearance
or
show
is
however
essential
to
actuality
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
truth
if
it
did
not
appear
or
rather
let
itself
appear9
were
it
not
further
true
for
some
one
thing
or
person
for
itself
as
also
for
spirit
consequently
it
cannot
be
appearance
in
general
against
which
such
an
objection
can
be
raised
but
the
particular
mode
of
its
manifestation
under
which
art
makes
actual
what
is
essentially
real
and
true
if
then
the
appearance
in
the
medium
of
which
art
gives
determinate
existence
to
its
creations
be
defined
as
deception
such
an
objection
is
in
the
first
instance
intelligible
if
we
compare
it
with
the
external
world
of
a
phenomena
and
its
immediate
relation
to
ourselves
as
material
substance
or
view
it
relatively
to
our
own
world
of
emotions
that
is
our
inward
sensuous
life
both
these
are
worlds
to
which
in
our
everyday
life
the
life
that
is
of
visible
experience
we
are
accustomed
to
attach
the
worth
and
name
of
reality
actuality
and
truth
as
contrasted
with
that
of
art
which
fails
to
possess
such
reality
as
we
suppose
now
it
is
just
this
entire
sphere
of
the
empirical
world
whether
on
its
personal
side
or
its
objective
side
which
we
ought
rather
to
call
in
a
stricter
sense
than
when
we
apply
the
term
to
the
world
of
art
merely
a
show
or
appearance
and
an
even
more
unyielding
form
of
deception
it
is
only
beyond
the
immediacy
of
emotional
life
and
that
world
of
external
objects
that
we
shall
discover
reality
in
any
true
sense
of
the
term
nothing
is
actually
real
but
that
which
is
actual
in
its
own
independent
right
and
substance10
that
which
is
at
once
of
the
substance
of
nature
and
of
mind
which
while
it
is
actually
here
in
present
and
determinate
existence
yet
retains
under
such
limitation
an
essential
and
selfconcentred
being
and
only
in
virtue
of
such
is
truly
real
the
predominance
of
these
universal
powers
is
precisely
that
which
art
accentuates
and
manifests
in
the
external
and
soulworld
of
ordinary
experience
we
have
also
no
doubt
this
essence
of
actuality
but
in
the
chaotic
congeries
of
particular
detail
encumbered
by
the
immediacy
of
sensuous
envisagement
and
every
kind
of
caprice
of
condition
event
character
and
so
forth
now
it
is
just
the
show
and
deception
of
this
false
and
evanescent
world
which
art
disengages
from
the
veritable
significance
of
phenomena
to
which
we
have
referred
implanting
in
the
same
a
reality
of
more
exalted
rank
born
of
mind
the
phenomena
of
art
therefore
are
not
merely
not
appearance
and
nothing
more
we
are
justified
in
ascribing
to
them
as
contrasted
with
the
realities
of
our
ordinary
life
an
actually
higher
reality
and
more
veritable
existence
to
as
little
extent
are
the
representations
of
art
a
deceptive
appearance
as
compared
with
the
assumed
truer
delineations
of
historical
writing
for
immediate
existence
also
does
not
belong
to
historical
writing
it
only
possesses
the
intellectual
appearance
of
the
same
as
the
medium
of
its
delineations
and
its
content
remains
charged
with
the
entire
contingent
materia
of
ordinary
reality
and
its
events
developments
and
personalities
whereas
the
work
of
art
brings
us
face
to
face
with
the
eternal
powers
paramount
in
history
with
this
incidental
association
of
the
immediate
sensuous
present
and
its
unstable
appearance
expunged
if
however
it
is
in
contrast
with
philosophic
thought
and
religious
and
ethical
principles
that
the
mode
of
appearance
of
the
shapes
of
art
is
described
as
a
deception
there
is
certainly
this
in
support
of
the
view
that
the
mode
of
revelation
attained
by
a
content
in
the
realm
of
thought
is
the
truest
reality
in
comparison
nevertheless
with
the
appearance
of
immediate
sensuous
existence
and
that
of
historical
narration
the
show
of
art
possesses
the
advantage
that
in
its
own
virtue
it
points
beyond
itself
directing
us
to
a
somewhat
spiritual
which
it
seeks
to
envisage
to
the
conceptive
mind
immediate
appearance
on
the
contrary
does
not
give
itself
out
to
be
thus
illusive
but
rather
to
be
the
true
and
real
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
truth
is
contaminated
and
obstructed
by
the
immediately
sensuous
medium
the
hard
rind
of
nature
and
the
everyday
world
offer
more
difficulty
to
the
mind
in
breaking
through
to
the
idea
than
do
the
products
of
art
but
if
from
this
particular
point
of
view
we
place
art
thus
highly
we
must
not
on
the
other
hand
fail
to
remember
that
neither
in
respect
to
content
or
form
is
art
either
the
highest
or
most
absolute
mode
of
bringing
the
true
interests
of
our
spiritual
life
to
consciousness
the
very
form
of
art
itself
is
sufficient
to
limit
it
to
a
definite
content
it
is
only
a
particular
sphere
and
grade
of
truth
which
is
capable
of
being
reproduced
in
the
form
of
a
work
of
art
such
truth
must
have
the
power
in
its
own
determinate
character
to
go
out
freely
into
sensuous
shape
and
remain
adequate
to
itself
therein
if
it
is
to
be
the
genuine
content
of
art
as
is
the
case
for
example
with
the
gods
of
greece
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
profounder
grasp
of
truth
in
which
the
form
is
no
longer
on
such
easy
and
friendly
terms
with
the
sensuous
material
as
to
be
adequately
accepted
and
expressed
by
that
medium
of
such
a
type
is
the
christian
conception
of
truth
and
above
all
it
is
the
prevailing
spirit
of
our
modern
world
or
more
strictly
of
our
religion
and
our
intellectual
culture
which
have
passed
beyond
the
point
at
which
art
is
the
highest
mode
under
which
the
absolute
is
brought
home
to
human
consciousness
the
type
peculiar
to
artproduction
and
its
products
fails
any
longer
to
satisfy
mans
highest
need
we
are
beyond
the
stage
of
reverence
for
works
of
art
as
divine
and
objects
deserving
our
worship
the
impression
they
produce
is
one
of
a
more
reflective11
kind
and
the
emotions
which
they
arouse
require
a
higher
test
and
a
further
verification
thought
and
reflection
have
taken
their
flight
above
fine
art
to
those
who
are
fond
of
complaint
and
grumbling
such
a
condition
of
things
may
be
held
as
a
form
of
decadence
it
may
be
ascribed
to
the
obsession
of
passion
and
selfish
interests
which
scare
away
the
seriousness
of
art
no
less
than
its
blithesomeness
or
we
may
find
the
fault
to
lie
in
the
exigencies
of
the
present
day
the
complex
conditions
of
social
and
political
life
which
prevent
the
soul
entangled
as
it
is
in
microscopic
interests
from
securing
its
freedom
in
the
nobler
objects
of
art
a
condition
too
in
which
the
intelligence
itself
becomes
a
menial
to
such
trifling
wants
and
the
interests
they
excite
in
sciences
which
subserve
objects
of
a
like
nature
and
are
seduced
into
the
voluntary
exile
of
such
a
wilderness
but
however
we
may
explain
the
fact
it
certainly
is
the
case
that
art
is
no
longer
able
to
discover
that
satisfaction
of
spiritual
wants
which
previous
epochs
and
nations
have
sought
for
in
it
and
exclusively
found
in
it
a
satisfaction
which
at
least
on
the
religious
side
was
associated
with
art
in
the
most
intimate
way
the
fair
days
of
greek
art
as
also
the
golden
time
of
the
later
middle
ages
are
over
the
reflective
culture
of
our
life
of
today
makes
it
inevitable
both
relatively
to
our
volitional
power
and
our
judgment
that
we
adhere
strictly
to
general
points
of
view
and
regulate
particular
matters
in
consonance
with
them
so
that
universal
forms
laws
duties
rights
and
maxims
hold
valid
as
the
determining
basis
of
our
life
and
the
force
within
of
main
importance
what
is
demanded
for
artistic
interest
as
also
for
artistic
creation
is
speaking
in
general
terms
a
vital
energy
in
which
the
universal
is
not
present
as
law
and
maxim
but
is
operative
in
union
with
the
soul
and
emotions
just
as
also
in
the
imagination
what
is
universal
and
rational
is
enclosed
only
as
brought
into
unity
with
a
concrete
sensuous
phenomenon
for
this
reason
the
present
time
is
not
if
we
review
its
conditions
in
their
widest
range
favourable
to
art
and
with
regard
to
the
executive
artist
himself
it
is
not
merely
that
reflection
on
every
side
which
will
insist
on
utterance
owing
to
the
universal
habit
of
critical
opinion
and
judgment
leads
him
astray
from
his
art
and
infects
his
mind
with
a
like
desire
to
accumulate
abstract
thought
in
his
creations
rather
the
entire
spiritual
culture
of
the
times
is
of
such
a
nature
that
he
himself
stands
within
a
world
thus
disposed
to
reflection
and
the
conditions
it
presupposes
and
do
what
he
may
he
cannot
release
himself
either
by
his
wish
or
his
power
of
decision
from
their
influence
neither
can
he
by
means
of
exceptional
education
or
a
removal
from
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
conjure
up
for
himself
and
secure
a
solitude
capable
of
replacing
all
that
is
lost
in
all
these
respects
art
is
and
remains
for
us
on
the
side
of
its
highest
possibilities
a
thing
of
the
past
herein
it
has
further
lost
its
genuine
truth
and
life
and
is
rather
transported
to
our
world
of
ideas
than
is
able
to
maintain
its
former
necessity
and
its
superior
place
in
reality
what
is
now
stimulated
in
us
by
works
of
art
is
in
addition
to
the
fact
of
immediate
enjoyment
our
judgment
in
other
words
we
subject
the
content
and
the
means
of
presentation
of
the
work
of
art
and
the
suitability
and
unsuitability
of
both
to
the
contemplation
of
our
thought
a
science
of
art
is
therefore
a
far
more
urgent
necessity
in
our
own
days
than
in
times
in
which
art
as
art
sufficed
by
itself
alone
to
give
complete
satisfaction
we
are
invited
by
art
to
contemplate
it
reflectively
not
that
is
to
say
with
the
object
of
recreating
such
art12
but
in
order
to
ascertain
scientifically
its
nature
in
doing
our
best
to
accept
such
an
invitation
we
are
confronted
with
the
objection
already
adverted
to
that
even
assuming
that
art
is
a
subject
adapted
for
philosophical
investigation
in
a
general
way
yet
it
unquestionably
is
not
so
adapted
to
the
systematic
procedure
of
science
such
an
objection
however
implies
to
start
with
the
false
notion
that
we
can
have
a
philosophical
inquiry
which
is
at
the
same
time
unscientific
in
reply
to
such
a
point
i
can
only
here
state
summarily
my
opinion
that
whatever
ideas
other
people
may
have
of
philosophy
and
philosophizing
i
myself
conceive
philosophical
inquiry
of
any
sort
or
kind
to
be
inseparable
from
the
methods
of
science
the
function
of
philosophy
is
to
examine
subjectmatter
in
the
light
of
the
principle
of
necessity
not
it
is
true
merely
in
accordance
with
its
subjective13
necessity
or
external
coordination
classification
and
so
forth
it
has
rather
to
unfold
and
demonstrate
the
object
under
review
out
of
the
necessity
of
its
own
intimate
nature
until
this
essential
process
is
made
explicit
the
scientific
quality
of
such
an
inquiry
is
absent
in
so
far
however
as
the
objective
necessity
of
an
object
subsists
essentially
in
its
logical
and
metaphysical
nature
the
isolated
examination
of
art
may
in
such
a
case
at
any
rate
or
rather
inevitably
must
be
carried
forward
with
a
certain
relaxation
of
scientific
stringency
for
art
is
based
upon
many
assumptions
part
of
which
relate
to
its
content
part
to
its
material
or
conceptive14
medium
in
virtue
of
which
art
is
never
far
from
the
borders
of
contingency
and
caprice
consequently
it
is
only
relatively
to
the
essential
and
ideal
progression
of
its
content
and
its
means
of
expression
that
we
are
able
to
recall
with
advantage
the
formative
principle
of
its
necessity15
the
objection
that
works
of
fine
art
defy
the
examination
of
scientific
thought
because
they
originate
in
the
unregulated
world
of
imagination
and
temperament
and
assert
their
effect
exclusively
on
the
emotions
and
the
fancy
with
a
complexity
and
variety
which
defies
exact
analysis
raises
a
difficulty
which
still
carries
genuine
weight
behind
it16
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
beauty
of
art
does
appear
in
a
form
which
is
expressly
to
be
contrasted
with
abstract
thought
a
form
which
it
is
compelled
to
disturb
in
order
to
exercise
its
own
activity
in
its
own
way
such
a
result
is
simply
a
corollary
of
the
thesis
that
reality
anywhere
and
everywhere
whether
the
life
of
nature
or
mind
is
defaced
and
slain
by
its
comprehension
that
so
far
from
being
brought
more
close
to
us
by
the
comprehension
of
thinking
it
is
only
by
this
means
that
it
is
in
the
complete
sense
removed
apart
from
us
so
that
in
his
attempt
to
grasp
through
thought
as
a
means
the
nature
of
life
man
rather
renders
nugatory
this
very
aim
an
exhaustive
discussion
of
the
subject
is
here
impossible
we
propose
merely
to
indicate
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
removal
of
this
difficulty
or
impossibility
and
incompatibility
might
be
effected
it
will
at
least
be
readily
admitted
that
mind
is
capable
of
selfcontemplation
and
of
possessing
a
consciousness
and
indeed
one
that
implies
a
power
of
thought
coextensive
with
itself
and
everything
which
originates
from
itself
it
is
in
fact
precisely
thought
the
process
of
thinking
which
constitutes
the
most
intimate
and
essential
nature
of
mind
it
is
in
this
thinkingconsciousness
over
itself
and
its
products
despite
all
the
freedom
and
caprice
such
may
otherwise
and
indeed
must
invariably
possessassuming
only
mind
or
spirit
to
be
veritably
pregnant
thereinthat
mind
exhibits
the
activity
congenial
to
its
essential
nature
art
and
the
creations
of
art
being
works
which
originate
in
and
are
begotten
of
the
spirit
are
themselves
stamped
with
the
hallmark
of
spirit
even
though
the
mode
of
its
presentation
accept
for
its
own
the
phenomenal
guise
of
sensuous
reality
permeating
as
it
does
the
sensuous
substance
with
intelligence
viewed
in
this
light
art
is
placed
from
the
first
nearer
to
spirit
and
its
thought
than
the
purely
external
and
unintelligent
nature
in
the
products
of
art
mind
is
exclusively
dealing
with
that
which
is
its
own
and
although
works
of
art
are
not
thought
and
notion
simply
as
such
but
an
evolution
of
the
notion
out
of
itself
an
alienation
of
the
same
in
the
direction
of
sensuous
being
yet
for
all
that
the
might
of
the
thinking
spirit
is
discovered
not
merely
in
its
ability
to
grasp
itself
in
its
most
native
form
as
pure
thinking
but
also
and
as
completely
to
recognize
itself
in
its
selfdivestment
in
the
medium
of
emotion
and
the
sensuous
to
retain
the
grasp
of
itself
in
that
other
which
it
transforms
but
is
not
transmuting
the
alien
factor
into
thoughtexpression
and
by
so
doing
recovering
it
to
itself
and
moreover
in
this
active
and
frequent
relation
to
that
other
than
itself
the
reflective
mind
is
not
in
any
way
untrue
to
itself
we
have
here
no
oblivion
or
surrender
of
itself
neither
is
it
so
impotent
as
to
be
unable
to
comprehend
what
is
differentiated
from
that
other17
what
it
actually
does
is
to
grasp
in
the
notion
both
itself
and
its
opposite
for
the
notion
is
the
universal
which
maintains
itself
in
its
particularizations
which
covers
in
its
grasp
both
itself
and
its
other
and
consequently
contains
the
power
and
energy
to
cancel
the
very
alienation
into
which
it
passes
for
this
reason
the
work
of
art
in
which
thought
divests
itself
of
itself18
belongs
to
the
realm
of
comprehending
thought
and
mind
by
subjecting
it19
to
scientific
contemplation
thereby
simply
satisfies
its
most
essential
nature
for
inasmuch
as
thought
is
its
essence
and
notion
it
can
only
ultimately
find
such
a
satisfaction
after
passing
all
the
products
of
its
activity
through
the
alembic
of
rational
thought
and
in
this
way
making
them
for
the
first
time
in
very
truth
part
of
its
own
substance
but
though
art
as
we
shall
eventually
see
with
yet
more
distinctness
is
far
indeed
from
being
the
highest
form
of
mind
it
is
only
in
the
philosophy
of
art
that
it
comes
into
all
that
it
may
justly
claim
in
the
same
way
art
is
not
debarred
from
a
philosophical
inquiry
by
reason
of
its
unregulated
caprice
as
already
intimated
it
is
its
true
function
to
bring
to
consciousness
the
highest
interests
of
mind
an
immediate
consequence
of
this
is
that
so
far
as
the
content
of
fine
art
is
concerned
it
cannot
range
about
in
all
the
wildness
of
an
unbridled
fancy
these
interests
of
spirit
posit
categorically
for
the
content
that
embodies
them
definite
points
of
attachment20
however
multifold
and
inexhaustible
may
be
the
forms
and
shapes
they
assume
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
forms
themselves
they
too
do
not
remain
unaffected
by
constraining
principles
it
is
not
every
chance
form
which
is
capable
of
expressing
and
presenting
these
interests
capable
of
assimilating
them
and
reproducing
them
it
is
only
through
one
determinate
content
that
the
form
adequate
to
its
embodiment
is
defined
it
is
upon
grounds
such
as
these
that
we
are
also
able
to
discover
a
track
adapted
to
critical
reflection
through
the
apparently
endless
vistas
of
artistic
creations
and
shapes
we
have
now
i
trust
by
way
of
prelude
succeeded
in
restricting
the
content
of
our
science
on
the
lines
of
definition
proposed
we
have
made
it
clear
that
neither
is
fine
art
unworthy
of
philosophical
study
nor
is
such
a
philosophical
study
incapable
of
accepting
as
an
object
of
its
cognition
the
essence
of
fine
art
ii
if
we
now
investigate
the
required
mode
of
such
scientific
investigation
we
are
here
again
face
to
face
with
two
contradictory
modes
of
handling
the
subject
each
of
which
appears
to
exclude
the
other
and
to
permit
us
to
arrive
at
no
satisfactory
result
on
the
one
hand
we
observe
the
science
of
art
merely
so
to
speak
from
an
external
point
of
view
busying
itself
with
actual
works
of
art
cataloguing
them
in
a
history
of
art
drawing
up
a
sort
of
commentary
upon
extant
works
or
propounding
theories
which
are
intended
to
supply
the
general
points
of
view
for
artistic
criticism
no
less
than
artistic
production
on
the
other
hand
we
find
science
wholly
giving
itself
up
in
its
independence
and
selfassured
to
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
offering
generalizations
which
do
not
concern
the
specific
characteristics
of
a
work
of
art
producing
in
short
an
abstract
philosophy
of
the
beautiful
1
with
regard
to
the
first
mentioned
method
of
study
the
startingpoint
of
which
is
the
empirical
study
of
definite
facts
such
is
the
path
everyone
must
tread
who
means
to
study
art
at
all
and
just
as
everyone
nowadays
even
though
he
does
not
actually
concern
himself
with
physical
science
yet
deems
it
indispensable
to
his
intellectual
equipment
to
have
some
kind
of
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
that
science21
so
too
it
is
generally
considered
more
or
less
essential
to
any
man
of
real
cultivation
that
he
should
possess
some
general
knowledge
of
art
and
indeed
the
pretension
to
be
ranked
as
dilletante
or
even
as
genuine
connoisseur
meets
with
comparatively
few
exceptions
a
if
however
knowledge
of
this
kind
is
really
to
claim
the
rank
of
connoisseurship
of
the
first
class
it
must
be
both
varied
in
its
character
and
of
the
widest
range
it
is
an
indispensable
condition
to
such
that
it
should
possess
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
wellnigh
limitless
field
of
particular
works
of
art
both
of
ancient
and
modern
times
some
of
which
have
already
disappeared
while
others
are
only
to
be
found
in
distant
countries
or
portions
of
the
globe
and
which
it
is
the
misfortune
of
our
situation
to
be
unable
to
inspect
add
to
this
that
every
work
of
art
belongs
to
one
age
one
nationality
and
depends
upon
particular
historical
or
other
ends
and
ideas
on
account
of
this
it
is
indispensable
that
the
finest
type
of
artscholarship
should
have
at
its
command
not
merely
historical
knowledge
of
a
wide
range
but
knowledge
that
is
highly
specialized
in
other
words
a
work
of
art
is
associated
with
particular22
detail
in
a
peculiar
sense
and
a
specific
treatment
is
imperative
to
the
comprehension
and
interpretation
of
it
and
in
conclusion
this
connoisseurship
of
the
finest
class
does
not
merely
imply
like
every
other
a
retentive
memory
but
also
a
keen
imaginative
sense
in
order
to
hold
clearly
before
the
mind
the
images
of
such
artistic
representations
in
all
their
characteristic
lines
and
above
all
to
have
them
ready
for
comparison
with
other
works
of
art
b
within
the
limits
of
such
a
method
of
study
which
is
primarily
historical23
distinct
points
of
view
will
soon
assert
themselves
which
in
the
contemplation
of
such
works
we
are
not
suffered
to
lose
sight
of
inasmuch
as
they
are
indispensable
to
a
critical
verdict
such
points
of
view
as
is
the
case
with
other
sciences
the
commencement
of
which
is
empirical
are
summarized
after
their
due
collection
as
separate
units
and
comparison
in
general
criteria
and
propositions
emerging
in
a
yet
further
stage
of
formal
generalization
in
theories
of
the
arts
this
is
not
the
place
to
dwell
at
length
upon
literature
of
this
kind
we
will
merely
recall
a
few
specimens
of
such
work
in
the
most
general
way
there
is
for
instance
the
poetics
of
aristotle
which
contains
a
theory
of
tragedy
still
of
real
interest
with
still
more
pertinency
among
the
ancients
the
ars
poetica
of
horace
and
the
essay
on
the
sublime
by
longinus
will
exemplify
generally
the
manner
in
which
this
type
of
theorizing
is
carried
out
the
general
theses
which
are
therein
formulated
are
intended
to
stand
as
premises
and
rules
in
accordance
with
which
works
of
art
ought
to
be
produced
their
necessity
being
above
all
insisted
on
in
times
of
the
decadence
of
poetry
and
art
they
are
in
short
prescriptions
to
the
practitioner
the
prescriptions
however
of
these
physicians
of
art
were
even
less
successful
in
their
curative
effect
on
art
than
are
the
ordinary
ones
in
the
restoration
of
bodily
health
as
to
such
theories
i
will
merely
remark
that
although
in
their
detail
they
contain
much
that
is
instructive
yet
what
they
have
to
say
is
based
on
a
very
limited
range
of
artistic
production
which
passed
no
doubt
for
the
superlatively
beautiful
ones
but
for
all
that
occupied
but
a
very
restricted
portion
of
the
entire
field
of
survey
from
a
further
point
of
view
such
generalizations
are
in
part
very
trivial
reflections
which
in
their
generality
led
up
to
no
secure
grasp
of
actual
detail
though
that
is
above
all
the
matter
of
most
importance
the
epistle
of
horace
already
cited
is
full
of
such
general
theses
and
consequently
a
book
for
everyone
but
one
which
for
this
very
reason
contains
much
of
no
importance

all

the
intention
appears
to
be
rather
that
of
influencing
the

of
others
upon
artistic

by
such
theories
creating
in

to

found
many
readers
in
their
day
taste
in
this
sense
has
to
do
with
coordination
and
artistic
treatment
the

in
its
right
place
and
all
that
concerns
the
finish
of
that
which
belongs
to
the
external
embodiment
of
a
work
of
art
add
to
this
that
to
the
principles
of
such
a
taste
views
were
attached
which
belonged
to
the
psychology
in
fashion
at
the
time
views
which
had
been
discovered
by
empirical
observations
of
capacities
and
activities
of
the
soul
or
of
passions
and
their
potential

and
so
forth
it
is
however
an
invariable
fact
that
every
one
forms
his
opinion
of
works
of
art
or
characters
actions
and
events
according
to
the
measure
of
his
insight
and
his
perceptive
temperament
and
inasmuch
as
the
formation
of
taste
to
which
we
have
referred
merely
touched
what
was
external
and
therefore
jejune
and
apart
from
this
deduced
its
prescriptions
entirely
from
a
limited
circle
of
artistic
works
and
an
intellectual
culture
and
emotional
discipline
equally
restricted
its
sphere
of
influence
was
ineffective
and
it
had
neither
the
power
to
comprehend
the
profounder
significance24
and
the
true
nor
to
make
the
vision
more
keen
for
their
apprehension
such
theories
proceed
through
generalization
as
do
the
rest
of
the
nonphilosophic
sciences
the
content
which
they
submit
to
examination
is
accepted
from
ordinary
ideas
as
something
final
and
received
as
such
questions
are
then
asked
about
the
constitution
of
such
a
concept
the
need
for
more
distinct
specification
making
itself
apparent
and
this
too
is
borrowed
from
current
ideas
and
forthwith
finally
established
from
it
in
definitions
but
in
such
a
procedure
we
at
once
find
ourselves
on
an
insecure
basis
exposed
to
controversy
it
might
in
the
first
instance
no
doubt
appear
that
the
beautiful
was
quite
a
simple
idea
but
we
soon
discover
it
combines
several
aspects
one
writer
will
emphasize
one
of
these
another
some
other
one
or
even
assuming
the
same
points
of
view
are
considered
the
question
for
dispute
still
remains
which
aspect
is
to
be
regarded
as
essential
with
regard
to
such
questions
it
is
generally
reckoned
as
inseparable
from
scientific
completeness
that
the
various
definitions
of
the
beautiful
should
be
enumerated
and
criticized
for
ourselves
we
do
not
propose
to
attempt
this
with
such
historical
exhaustiveness
as
would
unfold
all
the
many
refinements
of
such
essays
at
definition
nor
indeed
on
account
of
their
historical
interest
we
simply
by
way
of
illustration
shall
offer
a
few
specimens
of
the
more
recent
and
more
interesting
ways
of
regarding
the
matter
which
do
in
fact
hit
off
pretty
nearly
what
is
actually
implied
in
the
idea
of
the
beautiful
with
this
in
view
it
is
of
first
importance
to
recall
goethes
definition
of
the
beautiful
which
meyer
has
incorporated
in
his
history
of
the
creative
arts
in
greece
in
which
work
he
also
brings
forward
the
views
of
hirt
though
he
does
not
actually
mention
his
name
hirt
one
of
the
greatest
among
connoisseurs
of
the
first
class
in
our
time
in
his
essay
upon
fine
art
horen
1797
seventh
number
after
considering
the
beautiful
in
the
several
arts
summarizes
his
conclusions
in
the
statement
that
the
basis
of
a
just
criticism
of
fine
art
and
cultivation
of
taste
is
the
idea
of
the
characteristic
in
other
words
he
defines
the
beautiful
ultimately
as
the
consummate25
which
is
or
can
be
an
object
of
eye
ear
or
imagination
he
then
proceeds
to
define
this
consummate
as
that
which
is
adequate
to
its
aim
which
nature
or
art
aimed
at
producing
in
the
constitution
of
the
objectafter
its
generic
kind
and
specific
type
for
which
reason
it
is
necessary
that
in
order
to
instruct
our
critical
sense
of
beauty
we
should
direct
our
attention
so
far
as
possible
to
the
specific
indications
of
the
objects
essential
constitution
it
is
in
fact
these
insignia
of
individuality
which
are
its
characteristic
consequently
under
the
term
character
as
a
principle
of
art
he
understands
that
definite
individual
characterization26
whereby
forms
movement
and
gesture
mien
and
expression
local
colouring
light
and
shadow
chiaroscuro
and
pose
are
severally
distinguished
in
due
relation
of
course
to
the
requirements
of
the
object
previously
selected
this
formula
is
more
significant
in
its
actual
terms
than
other
definitions
in
vogue
if
we
proceed
to
ask
what
the
characteristic
is
we
find
that
it
implies
first
a
content
as
for
instance
a
definite
emotion
situation
event
action
individual
person
or
thing
secondly
the
specific
manner
in
accordance
with
which
such
a
content
is
represented
it
is
to
this
mode
or
manner
of
presentation
that
the
artistic
principle
of
the
characteristic
is
related
it
requires
that
every
aspect
of
detail
in
the
mode
of
expression
shall
subserve
the
clearer
definition
of
that
expressions
content
and
become
a
vital
member
of
such
expression
the
abstract
determination
of
the
characteristic
emphasizes
therefore
the
pertinency
with
which
particular
detail
ought
to
bring
into
prominence
the
content
which
it
is
intended
to
reproduce
attempting
an
elucidation
of
this
conception
apart
from
technical
phrase
we
may
state
the
limitation
implied
in
it
as
follows
in
the
drama
for
instance
it
is
an
action
which
constitutes
the
content
that
is
to
say
the
drama
has
to
represent
how
this
or
that
action
takes
place
now
men
do
all
kinds
of
different
things
they
speak
to
each
other
take
their
meals
sleep
put
on
their
clothes
say
this
and
that
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
in
all
this
business
of
life
what
does
not
lie
in
immediate
relation
with
the
particular
action
selected
as
the
real
dramatic
content
must
be
excluded
in
order
that
relatively
to
it
everything
shall
be
significant
in
the
same
way
in
a
picture
which
only
includes
one
moment
of
that
action
and
it
is
possible
to
accumulatesuch
are
the
countless
vistas
into
which
the
objective
world
draws
usa

of
circumstances

situations
or
other
occurrences
which
stand
in
no
relation
to
the
specific
action
as
it
actually
occurs
nor
subserve
in
any
way
the
clearer
characterization
of
the
same
but
according
to
the
definition
given
of
the
characteristic
only
that
ought
to
enter
into
a
work
of
art
which
is
appertinent
to
the
manifestation
and
essential
expression
of
precisely
this
one
content
and
no
other
nothing
must
declare
itself
as
idle
or
superfluous
this
definition
is
no
doubt
of
real
importance
and
from
a
certain
point
of
view
admits
of
justification
meyer
however
in
the
work
cited
is
of
opinion
that
the
view
propounded
has
vanished
every
vestige
of
it
and
in
his
opinion
only
to
the
advantage
of
art
such
a
conception
he
thinks
would
in
all
probability
lead
to
caricature
this
judgment
is
based
on
the
previous
idea
that
an
attempt
of
this
kind
to
define
the
beautiful
once
and
for
all
is
associated
with
the
notion
of
prescription
the
philosophy
of
art
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
precepts
for
artists
the
object
is
to
unfold
the
essential
nature
of
the
beautiful
andapart
from
any
intention
to
propound
rules
for
the
executanthow
it
is
illustrated
in
actual
work
that
is
works
of
art
to
such
a
criticism
we
may
observe
that
the
definition
of
hirt
no
doubt
includes
what
is
capable
of
being
caricature
for
caricature
may
also
be
characteristic
the
obvious
point
to
make
however
against
it
is
this
that
in
caricature
character
in
its
definition
is
emphasized
to
the
point
of
exaggeration
and
is
if
we
may
say
so
a
superfluity
of
the
characteristic
but
a
surfeit
of
this
kind
is
no
longer
appropriate
to
the
characteristic
but
a
burdensome
reiteration
whereby
the
characteristic
may
itself
be
ousted
from
what
it
ought
to
be
moreover
what
is
of
the
nature
of
caricature
is
displayed
as
the
characteristic
presentment
of
what
is
ugly
which
is
of
course
a
mode
of
distortion
ugliness
is
in
its
own
right
in
this
way
more
closely
related
to
the
content27
so
that
it
may
be
actually
asserted
that
the
principle
of
the
characteristic
includes
also
ugliness
and
the
presentment
of
the
same
as
a
part
of
its
essential
determination
the
definition
of
hirt
of
course
gives
us
no
further
account
of
the
content
of
the
beautiful
it
merely
supplies
us
in
this
respect
with
a
purely
formal
statement
which
however
contains
real
truth
in
it
although
formulated
in
abstract
terms
there
is
however
the
further
questionwhat
meyer
would
substitute
for
the
artistic
principle
of
hirt
what
he
proposes
himself
he
deals
in
the
first
instance
exclusively
with
the
principle
as
we
have
it
in
ancient
works
of
art
which
however
must
contain
in
the
widest
connotation
of
the
term
the
essential
determinant28
of
beauty29
in
doing
so
he
finds
occasion
to
refer
to
mengs
and
to
winckelmanns
definition
of
the
ideal
and
expresses
himself
to
the
effect
that
he
does
not
wish
either
to
reject
or
wholly
to
accept
this
principle
of
beauty
but
on
the
other
hand
that
he
feels
no
hesitation
in
subscribing
to
the
opinion
of
an
enlightened
judge
of
art
that
is
goethe
inasmuch
as
its
meaning
is
distinct
and
it
appears
to
solve
the
problem
with
more
accuracy
now
what
goethe
says
is
this
the
highest
principle
of
the
ancients
was
the
significant
the
highest
result
of
successful
artistic
handling
is
the
beautiful
if
we
look
more
closely
at
what
this
dictum
implies
we
have
again
once
more
two
aspects
that
is
to
say
a
content
or
subject
matter
and
the
mode
of
its
presentation
in
our
consideration
of
a
work
of
art
we
begin
with
that
which
is
directly
presented
to
us
and
after
seeing
it
we
proceed
to
inquire
what
its
significance
or
content
is
that
external
husk
possesses
no
value
to
us
simply
as
such
we
assume
that
there
is
an
inward
an
ideality
or
a
significance
behind
it
in
virtue
of
which
the
external
appearance
is
made
alive
with
mind
or
spirit
it
is
to
this
its
soul
that
the
external
appearance
points
and
attests
for
an
appearance
which
is
significant
of
something
does
not
present
itself
to
us
and
merely
that
which
it
is
qu
externality
but
something
other
than
this
as
also
does
the
symbol
for
example
and
with
yet
more
clarity
the
fable
the
significance
of
which
is
simply
the
moral
and
teaching
of
the
same
in
fact
there
is
no
word
which
does
not
point
to
a
meaning
possessing
no
value
by
itself
in
the
same
way
the
human
eye
the
face
flesh
skin
the
entire
presence
are
a
revelation
of
spirit
intelligence
and
soul
and
in
such
a
case
the
significance
is
without
exception
something
beyond
that
which
is
offered
in
the
bare
appearance
in
this
way
too
the
work
of
art
must
possess
significance
it
must
not
appear
to
have
told
its
tale
simply
in
the
fact
of
particular
lines
curves
surfaces
indentations
reliefs
of
stonework
in
particular
colours
tones
sounds
of
words
whatever
medium
in
fact
art
may
employ
its
function
is
to
unveil
an
inward
or
ideal
vitality
emotion
soul
a
content
and
mind
which
is
precisely
what
we
mean
by
the
significance
of
a
work
of
art
this
demand
therefore
for
significance
in
a
work
of
art
is
to
all
intents
and
in
its
embrace
much
the
same
thing
as
hirts
principle
of
the
characteristic
according
to
this
conception
we
find
as
characteristic
constituents
of
the
beautiful
an
inward
somewhat
a
content
and
an
external
rind
which
possesses
that
content
as
its
significance
the
inner
or
ideal
constituent
appears
in
the
external
and
thus
enables
itself
to
be
recognized
that
which
is
external
pointing
away
from
itself
to
the
inward
we
cannot
however
pursue
the
matter
here
into
further
detail
c
but
the
earlier
fashion
of
this
theoryspinning
no
less
than
the
laying
down
of
rules
for
the
executant

from

of
an
art

is
itself
of
truly
spiritual
rank
as
also
of
a
sympathy
and
absorption
of
the

have
arisen
the
receptivity
and
freedom
which
make
it
possible
for
us
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
great
works
of
art
which
have
long
since
been
within
our
reach
whether
it
be
those
of
the
modern
world
of
the
middle
ages
or
of
wholly
foreign
peoples
of
the
past
the
works
of
india
for
example
works
which
in
virtue
of
their
antiquity
or
the
remoteness
of
their
nationality
possess
unquestionably
for
ourselves
a
side
alien
to
ourselves
but
which
if
we
consider
the
way
in
which
their
content
passes
over
and
beyond
such
national
limits
and
the
matter
in
it
of
common
appeal
to
all
mankind
can
only
be
hallmarked
by
the
prejudice
of
theory
among
the
products
of
a
barbarous
or
corrupt
taste
this
recognition
of
works
of
art
anywhere
and
everywhere
works
which
depart
from
the
specific
circle
and
forms
of
those
upon
which
in
the
main
the
abstractions
of
theory
were
based
has
as
a
primary
consequence
led
to
the
recognition
of
a
peculiar
type
of
artthe
romantic
art
it
became
necessary
to
apprehend
the
notion
and
the
nature
of
the
beautiful
in
a
profounder
way
than
these
theories
attempted
with
this
fact
another
too
cooperated
viz
that
the
notions
in
its
form
of
apperception
the
mind
as
pure
thought
on
its
part
reached
in
philosophy
a
point
of
profounder
selfcognition
and
was
thereby
compelled
forthwith
to
grasp
the
essence
of
art
too
on
profounder
lines
in
this
way
even
in
virtue
of
the
point
in
the
process
reached
of
this
general
evolution
of
human
thought
the
type
of
theorizing
upon
art
we
have
described
both
relatively
to
its
principles
no
less
than
their
elaboration
has
become
obsolete
it
is
only
the
scholarship
of
the
history
of
art
which
retains
an
abiding
value
and
must
continue
to
retain
it
in
proportion
as
the
boundaries
of
its
survey
have
enlarged
in
every
direction
by
means
of
the
advance
made
in
mans
powers
of
receptivity
already
noticed
its
business
and
function
consists
in
the
aesthetic
appreciation
of
particular
works
of
art
and
the
knowledge
of
the
historical
in
other
words
the
external
conditions
from
which
the
work
of
art
originates
it
is
an
attitude
of
the
mind
which
if
assisted
with
sound
sense
and
critical
insight
supported
too
with
historical
knowledge
is
an
indispensable
condition
to
the
complete
penetration
into
the
individuality
of
a
given
work
of
art
the
many
writings
of
goethe
upon
art
and
works
of
art
are
an
excellent
illustration
theorizing
in
the
specific
sense
noticed
is
not
the
aim
of
this
type
of
examination
although
no
doubt
it
not
unfrequently
also
busies
itself
with
abstract
principles
and
categories
and
may
drop
into
such
a
style
unconsciously
if
however
without
letting
such
deviations
on
our
route
detain
us
we
keep
before
our
vision
those
concrete
illustrations
of
artistic
works
such
at
least
whatever
else
they
may
do
supply
a
philosophy
of
art
with
the
visible
warrant
and
confirmation
of
actual
work
into
the
historical
detail
of
which
in
each
particular
case
philosophy
is
not
permitted
to
enter
this
then
may
be
accepted
as
the
first
method
of
art
study
it
starts
from
the
particular
work
which
we
have
before
us
2
the
method
or
point
of
view
to
be
contrasted
with
this
in
other
words
an
entirely
theoretical
reflection
which
is
concerned
to
cognize
the
beautiful
as
such
from
its
own
intrinsic
wealth
and
to
penetrate
to
the
idea
of
it
is
essentially
distinct
from
the
first
method
as
is
well
known
plato
was
the
first
to
demand
of
philosophical
inquiry
in
a
profounder
sense
that
objects
should
not
be
cognized
in
their
particularity
but
in
their
universality
in
their
generic
type
their
essential
being
and
its
explicit
manifestation
he
maintained
that
this
true
essence30
did
not
consist
in
particular
actions
which
were
good
in
particular
true
opinions
handsome
men
or
beautiful
works
of
art
but
in
goodness
beauty
and
truth
in
their
universality
now
if
in
fact
the
beautiful
ought
to
be
cognized
according
to
its
essence
and
notion
this
can
only
be
effected
by
means
of
the
thinking
notion31
by
means
of
which
the
logical
and
metaphysical
nature
of
the
idea
as
such
as
also
of
that
of
the
particular
idea
of
the
beautiful
enters
into
the
thinking
consciousness
but
the
consideration
of
the
beautiful
in
its
selfindependence
and
its
idea
may
readily
once
more
become
an
abstract
metaphysic
and
even
though
plato
is
accepted
as
founder
and
pioneer
the
platonic
abstraction
no
longer
supplies
all
we
require
not
even
for
the
logical
idea
of
the
beautiful
we
are
bound
to
grasp
this
idea
more
profoundly
and
more
in
the
concrete
the
emptiness
of
content
which
clings
to
the
platonic
idea
no
longer
satisfies
the
richer
philosophical
requirements
of
the
mind
today
it
is
no
doubt
the
case
that
we
also
in
the
philosophy
of
art
must
make
the
idea
of
the
beautiful
our
starting
point
but
it
is
by
no
means
inevitable
that
we
should
adhere
to
the
platonic
ideas
in
their
abstraction
ideas
from
which
the
philosophy
of
the
beautiful
merely
dates
its
origins
3
the
philosophical
idea
of
the
beautiful
to
indicate
at
any
rate
its
true
nature
provisionally
must
contain
both
extremes
which
we
have
described
mediated
in
itself
it
must
combine
that
is
to
say
metaphysical
universality
with
the
determinate
content
of
real
particularity
it
is
only
by
this
means
that
it
is
grasped
in
its
essential
no
less
than
explicit
truth
for
on
the
one
hand
it
is
then
as
contrasted
with
the
sterility
of
onesided
reflection
fruitbearing
out
of
its
own
wealth
it
is
its
function
in
consonance
with
its
own
notion
to
develop
into
a
totality
of
definite
qualities
and
this
essential
conception
itself
no
less
than
its
detailed
explication
comprises
the
necessary
coherence
of
its
particular
features
as
also
of
the
progress
and
transition
of
one
phase
thereof
into
another
on
the
other
hand
these
particulars
into
which
the
passage
is
made
essentially
carry
the
universality
and
essentiality
of
the
fundamental
notion
as
the
particulars
of
which
they
appear
the
modes
of
inquiry
hitherto
discussed
lack
both
these
aspects
and
for
this
reason
it
is
only
the
notion
as
above
formulated
in
its
completeness
which
conducts
us
to
definitive
principles
which
are
substantive
necessary
and
selfcontained
in
their
completeness
iii
after
these
preliminaries
we
come
to
closer
quarters
with
our
actual
subjectmatter
namely
the
philosophy
of
fine
art32
and
for
the
reason
that
we
are
undertaking
to
treat
it
scientifically
our
commencement
must
be
with
the
notional
concept
of
the
same
it
is
only
after
we
have
definitely
ascertained
this
that
we
can
map
out
the
division
of
its
parts
and
with
it
the
plan
of
the
science
as
a
whole
a
division
of
this
kind
if
it
is
not
to
be
as
is
the
case
with
nonphilosophical
inquiry
undertaken
in
a
purely
external
way
must
discover
its
principle
in
the
notion
of
the
subject
treated
itself
face
to
face
with
such
a
demand
we
are
at
once
met
by
the
question
whence
do
we
arrive
at
such
a
conception
if
we
begin
with
the
notional
concept
of
fine
art
itself
the
same
at
once
becomes
a
presupposition
and
mere
assumption
mere
assumptions
however
are
excluded
from
the
philosophical
method
whatever
here
is
allowed
as
valid
must
have
its
truth
demonstrated
in
other
words
must
be
established
in
its
necessity
we
will
endeavour
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
in
a
few
words
in
the
presence
of
this
difficulty
which
invariably
recurs
in
the
introduction
to
every
course
of
philosophical
study
if
treated
independently
the
subjectmatter
of
every
science
presents
in
the
first
instance
two
aspects
for
consideration
first
the
fact
that
a
given
object
is
secondly
the
question
what
it
is
upon
the
question
of
fact
in
ordinary
scientific
inquiry
little
difficulty
is
experienced
indeed
it
might
on
a
cursory
view
even
appear
ridiculous
if
the
demand
were
made
that
we
had
to
prove
in
geometry
for
instance
that
there
were
such
objects
as
space
and
geometrical
figures
or
in
astronomy
and
physics
that
there
was
a
sun
stars
and
magnetic
phenomena
in
these
sciences
which
are
concerned
with
what
is
actually
presented
to
sense
perception
objects
are
accepted
from
objective
experience
and
so
far
from
it
being
regarded
necessary
to
demonstrate
beweisen
them
it
is
deemed
sufficient
to
point
to
weisen
the
bare
facts
yet
even
within
the
limits
of
nonphilosophical
instruction
doubts
may
arise
as
to
the
existence
of
certain
objects
in
psychology
for
example
the
science
of
mind
the
doubt
is
possible
whether
there
is
a
soul
an
intelligence
ie
something
distinct
from
material
conditions
something
immaterial33
independent
and
selfsubstantive
or
in
the
theology
whether
a
god
actually
exists
moreover
assuming
the
objects
of
the
science
to
be
thus
immaterial
in
other
words
merely
present
in
the
mind
and
not
a
part
of
the
objective
world
we
perceive
we
have
to
face
the
possible
conviction
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
mind
but
that
which
it
has
evoked
in
virtue
of
its
own
activity
this
brings
up
incidentally
the
question
whether
men
have
produced
this
idea
or
intuition
which
is
inward
to
their
minds
or
not
and
even
if
we
do
actually
accept
the
first
alternative
whether
they
have
not
made
such
an
idea
once
more
to
vanish
or
depreciated
the
same
at
any
rate
to
an
idea
of
wholly
subjective
validity
whose
content
possesses
no
independent
or
selfcontained
existence34
in
this
way
for
example
the
beautiful
has
been
frequently
regarded
as
possessing
no
necessarily
essential
and
independent
stability
in
the
world
of
our
ideas
rather
it
is
accepted
as
a
pleasure
purely
personal
to
ourselves
due
to
the
caprice
of
our
senses35
even
our
external
intuitions
observations
and
perceptions
frequently
deceive
and
lead
us
astray
but
still
more
is
this
the
case
with
those
ideas
that
do
not
arise
from
senseperception
even
though
they
possess
in
themselves
the
greatest
vitality
and
are
able
to
transport
us
into
passion
we
are
powerless
to
resist
this
doubt
then
whether
an
object
of
the
inward
world
of
our
ideas
and
intuitions
actually
exists
as
an
independent
fact
or
not
as
also
that
further
incidental
problem
whether
the
particular
consciousness
in
question
has
produced
it
in
itself
and
whether
the
particular
mode
or
process
in
which
it
objectified
it
to
itself
is
also
adequate
to
the
object
thus
envisaged
in
its
essential
and
independent
naturethese
are
precisely
the
kind
of
questions
which
have
awakened
in
men
the
higher
demand
of
philosophy
which
is
that
even
if
there
is
every
appearance
that
an
object
is
or
that
we
have
before
us
such
an
object
yet
none
the
less
that
object
must
be
expounded
or
demonstrated
on
the
basis
of
its
necessity
a
demonstration
of
this
kind
if
developed
on
truly
philosophical
lines
ought
at
the
same
time
to
supply
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
question
what
a
given
object
is
to
work
this
out
fully
would
however
carry
us
further
than
is
now
possible
we
propose
to
limit
ourselves
to
the
following
general
remarks
if
we
are
to
propound
the
necessity
of
our
subjectmatter
in
other
words
the
beauty
of
art
we
are
bound
to
prove
that
art
or
the
beautiful
is
a
result
of
antecedents
such
as
when
regarded
relatively
to
their
true
notional
concept
conduct
us
with
scientific
necessity
to
the
similar
notion
of
fine
art
itself
inasmuch
as
however
we
propose
to
make
art
the
point
of
departure
and
its
idea
and
the
objective
presence
of
the
same
and
do
not
propose
to
deal
with
the
antecedent
conditions
which
are
essential
to
the
necessary
exposition
of
its
notional
concept
for
this
reason
art
in
our
treatment
of
it
as
a
particular
object
of
scientific
inquiry
involves
a
preassumption
which
lies
outside
the
boundary
of
our
investigation
which
implying
as
it
does
a
different
content
belongs
as
scientifically
treated
to
another
course
of
philosophical
inquiry
we
have
therefore
now
no
other
alternative
than
frankly
to
accept
the
notional
idea
of
art
so
to
speak
provisionally36
which
is
inevitable
with
every
one
of
the
particular
philosophical
sciences
if
regarded
in
their
abstract
isolation
for
it
is
the
entire
body
of
philosophy
and
that
alone
which
either
is
or
can
be
the
comprehension
of
the
universe
as
one
essentially
single
organic
totality
and
which
as
such
a
totality
selfevolved
from
its
own
notional
idea
and
returning
into
itself
so
as
to
form
a
whole
in
virtue
of
the
necessary
principle
in
which
it
is
placed
relatively
to
itself
encloses
itself
and
all
that
is
itself
into
one
single
world
of
truth
in
the
coronal
of
this
scientific
necessity
is
every
particular
member
thereof
a
selfcomplete
circle
which
returns
into
itself
while
at
the
same
time
and
as
imperatively
it
possesses
a
necessary
bond
of
connection
with
other
parts
this
bond
of
coherence
is
a
backward
from
which
it
is
selfderived
no
less
than
a
forward
to
which
it
is
selfimpelled
onward
in
so
far
as
it
fruitfully
begets
fresh
material
from
its
own
resources
and
renders
the
same
open
and
pervious
to
scientific
cognition
it
is
not
therefore
our
purpose
to
demonstrate
the
idea
of
the
beautiful
which
is
our
point
of
departure
or
in
other
words
to
deduce
it
in
all
its
necessity
from
the
assumptions
which
are
its
antecedents
in
philosophy
and
from
the
womb
of
which
it
is
born
this
is
the
object
appropriate
to
an
encyclopaedic
development
of
philosophy
as
a
whole
and
in
its
specific
branches
for
ourselves
the
notional
concept
of
the
beautiful
and
art
is
a
presupposition
supplied
us
by
the
system
of
philosophy
inasmuch
however
as
we
are
not
prepared
to
discuss
this
system
and
the
association
of
art
with
it
in
the
present
context37
we
have
not
as
yet
the
idea
of
the
beautiful
before
us
in
a
scientific
form
what
we
have
and
are
able
to
deal
with
are
simply
the
phases
and
aspects
of
the
same
as
we
find
them
in
the
various
conceptions
of
beauty
and
art
of
our
everyday
conscious
life
or
as
they
have
been
conceived
by
previous
writers
having
made
our
start
at
this
point
we
shall
then
at
a
later
stage
pass
on
to
the
more
fundamental
investigation
of
those
views
in
order
thereby
to
secure
the
advantage
of
in
the
first
instance
working
out
a
general
idea
of
our
subjectmatter
no
less
than
obtaining
a
provisional
acquaintance
as
a
result
of
our
necessarily
brief
criticism
with
its
higher
principles
which
will
occupy
our
thoughts
in
the
inquiry
which
follows38
by
this
means
our
final
introduction39
will
supply
a
sort
of
overture
to
the
exposition
of
the
subject
itself
and
will
aim
at
being
a
general
concatenation
and
direction
of
our
reflection
on
the
real
subjectmatter
before
us
what
in
the
first
instance
is
known
to
us
under
current
conceptions
of
a
work
of
art
may
be
subsumed
under
the
three
following
determinations
1
a
work
of
art
is
no
product
of
nature
it
is
brought
into
being
through
the
agency
of
man
2
it
is
created
essentially
for
man
and
what
is
more
it
is
to
a
greateror
less
degree
delivered
from
a
sensuous
medium
and
addressed
to
his
senses40
3
it
contains
an
end
bound
up
with
it
1
with
regard
to
the
first
point
that
a
work
of
art
is
a
product
of
human
activity
an
inference
has
been
drawn
from
this
a
that
such
an
activity
being
the
conscious
production
of
an
external
object
can
also
be
known
and
divulged
and
learned
and
reproduced
by
others
for
that
which
one
is
able
to
effect
anothersuch
is
the
notionis
able
to
effect
or
to
imitate41
when
he
has
once
simply
mastered
the
way
of
doing
it
in
short
we
have
merely
to
assume
an
acquaintance
with
the
rules
of
artproduction
universally
shared
and
anybody
may
then
if
he
cares
to
do
so
give
effect
to
executive
ability
of
the
same
type
and
produce
works
of
art
it
is
out
of
reasoning
of
this
kind
that
the
abovementioned
theories
with
their
provision
of
rules
and
their
prescriptions
formulated
for
practical
acceptance
have
arisen
unfortunately
that
which
is
capable
of
being
brought
into
effect
in
accordance
with
suggestions
of
this
description
can
only
be
something
formally
regular
and
mechanical
for
only
that
which
is
mechanical
is
of
so
exterior
a
type
that
only
an
entirely
empty
effort
of
will
and
dexterity
is
required
to
accept
it
among
our
working
conceptions
and
forthwith
to
carry
it
out
an
effort
in
fact
which
is
not
under
the
necessity
to
contribute
out
of
its
own
resources
anything
concrete
such
as
is
quite
outside
the
prescriptive
power
of
such
general
rules
this
is
apparent
with
most
vividness
when
precepts
of
this
kind
are
not
limited
to
what
is
purely
external
and
mechanical
but
extend
their
pretensions
to
the
activity
of
the
artist
in
the
sense
that
implies
wealth
of
significance
and
intelligence
in
this
field
our
rules
pass
off
to
purely
indefinite
generalities
such
as
the
theme
ought
to
be
interesting
and
each
individual
person
must
speak
as
is
appropriate
to
his
status
age
sex
and
situation
but
if
rules
are
really
to
suffice
for
such
a
purpose
their
directions
ought
to
be
formulated
with
such
directness
of
detail
that
without
any
further
cooperation
of
mind
they
could
be
executed
precisely
in
the
manner
they
are
prescribed
such
rules
being
in
respect
to
this
content
abstract
clearly
and
entirely
fall
short
of
their
pretension
of
being
able
to
complete42
the
artistic
consciousness
artistic
production
is
not
a
formal
activity
in
accordance
with
a
series
of
definitions
it
is
as
an
activity
of
soul
constrained
to
work
out
of
its
own
wealth
and
to
bring
before
the
minds
eye
a
wholly
other
and
far
richer
content
and
a
more
embracing
and
unique43
creation
than
ever
can
be
thus
prescribed
in
particular
cases
such
rules
may
prove
of
assistance
in
so
far
that
is
as
they
contain
something
really
definite
and
consequently
useful
for
practice
but
even
here
their
guidance
will
only
apply
to
conditions
wholly
external
b
this
above
indicated
tendency
has
consequently
been
wholly
given
up
but
writers
in
doing
so
have
only
fallen
as
unreservedly
into
the
opposite
extreme
a
work
of
art
came
to
be
looked
upon
and
so
far
rightly
as
no
longer
the
product
of
an
activity
shared
by
all
men
but
rather
as
a
creation
of
a
mind
gifted
in
an
extraordinary
degree
a
mind
of
this
type
has
in
this
view
merely
to
give
free
vent
to
its
peculiar
endowment
regarded
as
a
specific
natural
power
it
has
to
free
itself
absolutely
from
a
pursuit
of
rules
of
universal
application
as
also
from
any
admixture
of
conscious
reflection
with
its
creative
and
as
thus
viewed
wholly
instinctive
powers
or
rather
it
should
be
on
its
guard
therefrom
the
assumption
being
that
such
an
exercise
of
conscious
thought
can
only
act
on
its
creations
as
an
infection
and
a
taint
agreeably
to
such
a
view
the
work
of
art
has
been
heralded
as
the
product
of
talent
and
genius
and
it
is
mainly
the
aspect
of
natural
gift
inseparable
from
the
ordinary
conception
of
talent
and
genius
which
has
been
emphasized
there
is
to
some
extent
real
truth
in
this
talent
is
specific
genius
universal
capacity
with
neither44
of
these
can
a
man
endow
himself
simply
by
the
exercise
of
his
selfconscious
activity
we
shall
consider
this
at
greater
length
in
a
subsequent
chapter45
in
the
present
context
we
would
merely
draw
attention
to
the
false
assumption
in
this
view
that
in
artistic
production
every
kind
of
selfreflection
upon
the
artists
own
activity
was
regarded
as
not
merely
superfluous
but
actually
injurious
in
such
a
view
the
process
of
creation
by
talent
or
genius
simply
is
taken
to
be
a
general
state
or
we
may
define
it
more
precisely
as
a
condition
of
inspiration
to
such
a
condition
it
is
said
genius
is
in
some
measure
exalted
by
the
subjectmatter
itself
it
is
also
to
some
extent
voluntarily
able
to
place
itself
under
such
a
condition
a
process
of
selfinhibition
in
which
the
genial
service
of
the
champagne
bottle
is
not
forgotten46
an
idea
of
this
kind
was
in
vogue
during
the
socalled
epoch
of
genius
which
originated
with
the
early
poetical
work
of
goethe
receiving
subsequent
illustration
in
those
of
schiller
these
poets
by
their
rejection
of
all
rules
hitherto
fabricated
made
as
it
were
an
entirely
new
start
with
deliberate
intention
they
ran
counter
to
such
rules
and
while
doing
so
distanced
all
competitors
by
many
lengths
i
do
not
however
propose
to
discuss
with
more
detail
the
confusions
which
have
prevailed
over
the
conception
of
inspiration
and
genius
and
the
notion
which
even
at
the
present
day
finds
advocates
that
inspiration
simply
by
itself
can
effect
anything
and
everything
the
real
and
indeed
sole
point
to
maintain
as
essential
is
the
thesis
that
although
artistic
talent
and
genius
essentially
implies
an
element
of
natural
power
yet
it
is
equally
indispensable
that
it
should
be
thoughtfully
cultivated
that
reflection
should
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
particular
way
it
is
exercised
and
that
it
should
be
also
kept
alive
with
use
and
practice
in
actual
work
the
fact
is
that
an
important
aspect
of
the
creating
process
is
merely
facility
in
the
use
of
a
medium47
that
is
to
say
a
work
of
art
possesses
a
purely
technical
side
which
extends
to
the
borders
of
mere
handicraft
this
is
most
obviously
the
case
in
architecture
and
sculpture
less
so
in
painting
and
music
least
of
all
in
poetry
a
facility
here
is
not
assisted
at
all
by
inspiration
what
solely
indispensable
is
reflection
industry
and
practice
such
technical
skill
an
artist
simply
must
possess
in
order
that
he
may
be
master
over
the
external
material
and
not
be
thwarted
by
its
obstinacy
add
to
this
that
the
more
exalted
the
rank
of
an
artist
the
more
profoundly
ought
he
to
portray
depths
of
soul
and
mind
and
these
are
not
to
be
known
by
flashlight
but
are
exclusively
to
be
sounded
if
at
all
by
the
direction
of
the
mans
own
intelligence
on
the
world
of
souls
and
the
objective
world
in
this
respect
therefore
once
more
study
is
the
means
whereby
the
artist
brings
to
consciousness
such
a
content
and
appropriates
the
material
and
structure
of
his
conceptions
at
the
same
time
no
doubt
one
art
will
require
such
a
conscious
reception
and
cognitive
mastery
of
the
content
in
question
more
than
another
music
for
example
which
has
exclusively
to
deal
with
the
entirely
undefined
motion
of
the
soul
within
with
the
musical
tones
of
that
which
is
relatively
feeling
denuded
of
positive
thought
has
little
or
no
need
to
bring
home
to
consciousness
the
substance
of
intellectual
conception48
for
this
very
reason
musical
talent
declares
itself
as
a
rule
in
very
early
youth
when
the
head
is
still
empty
and
the
emotions
have
barely
had
a
flutter
it
has
in
fact
attained
real
distinction
at
a
time
in
the
artists
life
when
both
intelligence
and
life
are
practically
without
experience
and
for
the
matter
of
that
we
often
enough
see
very
great
accomplishment
in
musical
composition
and
execution
hung
together
with
considerable
indigence
of
mind
and
character
it
is
quite
another
matter
in
the
case
of
poetry
what
is
of
main
importance
here
is
a
presentation
of
our
humanity
rich
in
subjectmatter
and
reflective
power
of
its
profounder
interests
and
of
the
forces
which
move
it
here
at
least
mind
and
heart
must
themselves
be
richly
and
profoundly
disciplined
by
life
experience
and
thought
before
genius
itself
can
bring
into
being
the
fruit
that
is
ripe
the
content
that
has
substance
and
is
essentially
consummate
the
early
productions
of
goethe
and
schiller
are
characterized
by
an
immaturity
we
may
even
call
it
a
rawness
and
barbarity
which
really
are
appalling
this
phenomenon
that
in
the
majority
of
those
experiments
we
find
a
preponderating
mass
of
features
which
are
absolutely
prosaic
or
at
least
uninspired
and
commonplace
is
a
main
objection
to
the
ordinary
notion
that
inspiration
is
inseparable
from
youth
and
its
sirocco
season
these
two
men
of
genius
were
the
first
beyond
question
to
give
our
nation
true
works
of
poetry
are
in
fact
our
national
poets
but
for
all
that
it
was
only
their
mature
manhood
which
made
it
a
present
of
creations
profound
sterling
of
their
kind
creations
of
genuine
inspiration
and
no
less
technically
complete
in
their
artistic
form49
we
naturally
recall
the
case
of
the
veteran
homer
who
only
composed
and
uttered
his
immortal
songs
in
his
old
age
c
a
third
view
held
relatively
to
the
idea
of
a
work
of
art
as
a
product
of
human
activity
concerns
the
position
of
such
towards
the
phenomena
of
nature
the
natural
tendency
of
ordinary
thinking
in
this
respect
is
to
assume
that
the
product
of
human
art
is
of
subordinate
rank
to
the
works
of
nature
the
work
of
art
possesses
no
feeling
of
its
own
it
is
not
through
and
through
a
living
thing
but
regarded
as
an
external
object
is
a
dead
thing
it
is
usual
to
regard
that
which
is
alive
of
higher
worth
than
what
is
dead
we
may
admit
of
course
that
the
work
of
art
is
not
in
itself
capable
of
movement
and
alive
the
living
natural
thing
is
whether
looked
at
within
or
without
an
organization
with
the
lifepurpose
of
such
worked
out
into
the
minutest
detail
the
work
of
art
merely
attains
to
the
show
of
animation
on
its
surface
below
this
it
is
ordinary
stone
wood
or
canvas50
or
in
the
case
of
poetry
idea
the
medium
of
such
being
speech
and
letters
but
this
element
of
external
existence
is
not
that
which
makes
a
work
a
creation
of
fine
art
a
work
of
art
is
only
truly
such
in
so
far
as
originating
in
the
human
spirit
it
continues
to
belong
to
the
soil
from
which
it
sprang
has
received
in
short
the
baptism
of
the
mind
and
soul
of
man
and
only
presents
that
which
is
fashioned
in
consonance
with
such
a
sacrament
an
interest
vital
to
man
the
spiritual
values
which
the
single
event
one
individual
character
one
action
possesses
in
its
devolution
and
final
issue
is
seized
in
the
work
of
art
and
emphasized
with
greater
purity51
and
clarity
than
is
possible
on
the
ground
of
ordinary
reality
where
human
art
is
not
and
for
this
reason
the
work
of
art
is
of
higher
rank
than
any
product
of
nature
whatever
which
has
not
submitted
to
this
passage
through
the
mind
in
virtue
of
the
emotion
and
insight
for
example
in
the
atmosphere
of
which
a
landscape
is
portrayed
by
the
art
of
painting
this
creation
of
the
human
spirit
assumes
a
higher
rank
than
the
purely
natural
landscape
everything
which
partakes
of
spirit
is
better
than
anything
begotten
of
mere
nature
however
this
may
be
the
fact
remains
that
no
purely
natural
existence
is
able
as
art
is
to
represent
divine
ideals
and
further
all
that
the
mind
borrows
from
its
own
ideal
content
it
is
able
even
in
the
direction
of
external
existence
to
endow
with
permanence
the
individual
living
thing
on
the
contrary
is
transitory
it
vanishes
and
is
unstable
in
its
external
aspect
the
work
of
art
persists
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
mere
continuation
but
rather
the
form
and
pressure
thereon
of
the
mintage
of
soullife
which
constitutes
its
true
preeminence
as
contrasted
with
natures
reality
but
this
higher
position
we
have
thus
assigned
to
the
work
of
art
is
yet
further
contested
by
another
prevalent
conception
of
ordinary
ideas
it
is
contended
that
nature
and
all
that
proceeds
from
her
are
a
work
of
god
created
by
his
goodness
and
wisdom
the
work
of
art
is
on
the
contrary
merely
a
human
product
fashioned
by
human
hands
according
to
human
design
the
fallacy
implied
in
this
contrast
between
the
products
of
nature
viewed
as
a
divine
creation
and
human
activity
as
of
wholly
finite
energy
consists
in
the
apparent
assumption
that
god
is
not
operative
in
and
through
man
but
limits
the
sphere
of
his
activity
to
nature
alone
we
must
place
this
false
conception
entirely
on
one
side
if
we
are
desirous
of
penetrating
to
the
true
idea
of
art
or
rather
as
opposed
to
such
a
conception
we
ought
to
accept
the
extreme
opposite
thereto
namely
that
god
is
more
honoured
by
that
which
mind
makes
and
creates
than
by
everything
brought
into
being
and
fashioned
in
the
natural
process
for
not
only
is
there
a
divinity
in
man
but
it
is
actually
effective
in
him
in
a
form
which
is
adequate
to
the
essential
nature
of
god
in
a
far
higher
degree
than
in
the
work
of
nature
god
is
a
spirit
and
it
is
only
in
man
that
the
medium
through
which
the
divine
passes
possesses
the
form
of
spirit
fully
conscious
of
the
activity
in
which
it
manifests
its
ideal
presence
in
nature
the
medium
correspondent
to
this
is
the
unconscious
sensuous52
and
external
materia
which
is
by
many
degrees
inferior
to
consciousness
in
its
worth
in
the
products
of
art
god
works
precisely
as
he
works
through
the
phenomena
of
nature
the
divine
substance
however
as
it
is
asserted
in
the
work
of
art
has
secured
being
begotten
of
spirit
life
itself
a
highway
commensurable
to
its
existence
determinate
existence
in
the
unconscious
sensuousness
of
nature
is
not
a
mode
of
appearance
adequate
to
the
divine
being
d
assuming
then
that
the
work
of
art
is
a
creation
of
man
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
offspring
of
mind
or
spirit
we
have
still
a
further
question
in
conclusion
which
will
help
us
to
draw
a
more
profound
inference
still
from
our
previous
discussion
that
question
is
what
is
the
human
need
which
stimulates
artproduction
on
the
one
hand
the
artistic
activity
may
be
regarded
as
the
mere
play
of
accident
or
human
conceits
which
might
just
as
well
be
left
alone
as
attempted
for
it
may
be
urged
there
are
other
and
better
means
for
carrying
into
effect
the
aims
of
art
and
man
bears
within
himself
higher
and
more
weighty
interests
than
art
is
capable
of
satisfying
in
contrast
to
such
a
view
art
appears
to
originate
in
a
higher
impulse
and
to
satisfy
more
elevated
needs
nay
at
certain
times
the
highest
and
most
absolute
of
all
being
as
it
has
been
united
to
the
most
embracing
views
of
entire
epochs
and
nations
upon
the
constitution
of
the
world
and
the
nature
of
their
religion
this
inquiry
however
concerning
a
necessity
for
art
which
shall
not
be
merely
contingent
but
absolute
we
are
not
as
yet
able
to
answer
with
completeness
it
demands
in
fact
a
concreter
mode
of
exposition
than
is
compatible
with
the
form
of
this
introduction
we
must
accordingly
deem
it
sufficient
for
the
present
merely
to
establish
the
following
points
the
universal
and
absolute
want
from
which
art
on
its
side
of
essential
form53
arises
originates
in
the
fact
that
man
is
a
thinking
consciousness
in
other
words
that
he
renders
explicit
to
himself
and
from
his
own
substance54
what
he
is
and
all
in
fact
that
exists
the
objects
of
nature
exist
exclusively
in
immediacy
and
once
for
all55
man
on
the
contrary
as
mind
reduplicates
himself
he
is
to
start
with
an
object
of
nature
as
other
objects
but
in
addition
to
this
and
no
less
truly
he
exists
for
himself
he
observes
himself
makes
himself
present
to
his
imagination
and
thought
and
only
in
virtue
of
this
active
power
of
selfrealization
is
he
actually
mind
or
spirit
this
consciousness
of
himself
man
acquires
in
a
twofold
way
in
the
first
instance
theoretically
this
is
so
in
so
far
as
he
is
under
a
constraint
to
bring
himself
in
his
own
inner
life
to
consciousnessall
which
moves
in
the
human
heart
all
that
surges
up
and
strives
thereinand
generally
so
far
as
he
is
impelled
to
make
himself
an
object
of
perception
and
conception
to
fix
for
himself
definitively
that
which
thought
discovers
as
essential
being
and
in
all
that
he
summons
out
of
himself
no
less
than
in
that
which
is
received
from
without
to
recognize
only
himself
and
secondly
this
realization
is
effected
through
a
practical
activity
in
other
words
man
possesses
an
impulse
to
assert
himself
in
that
which
is
presented
him
in
immediacy
in
that
which
is
at
hand
as
an
external
something
to
himself
and
by
doing
so
at
the
same
time
once
more
to
recognize
himself
therein
this
purpose
he
achieved
by
the
alteration
he
effects
in
such
external
objects
upon
which
he
imprints
the
seal
of
his
inner
life
rediscovering
in
them
thereby
the
features
of
his
own
determinate
nature
and
man
does
all
this
in
order
that
he
may
as
a
free
agent
divest
the
external
world
of
its
stubborn
alienation
from
himselfand
in
order
that
he
may
enjoy
in
the
configuration
of
objective
fact
an
external
reality
simply
of
himself
the
very
first
impulse
of
the
child
implies
in
essentials
this
practical
process
of
deliberate
change
in
external
fact
a
boy
throws
stones
into
the
stream
and
then
looks
with
wonder
at
the
circles
which
follow
in
the
water
regarding
them
as
a
result
in
which
he
sees
something
of
his
own
doing
this
human
need
runs
through
the
most
varied
phenomena
up
to
that
particular
form
of
selfreproduction
in
the
external
fact
which
is
presented
us
in
human
art
and
it
is
not
merely
in
relation
to
external
objects
that
man
acts
thus
he
treats
himself
that
is
his
natural
form
in
a
similar
manner
he
will
not
permit
it
to
remain
as
he
finds
it
he
alters
it
deliberately
this
is
the
rational
ground
of
all
ornament
and
decoration
though
it
may
be
as
barbarous
tasteless
entirely
disfiguring
nay
as
injurious
as
the
crushing
of
the
feet
of
chinese
ladies
or
the
slitting
of
ears
and
lips
for
it
is
among
the
really
cultured
alone
that
a
change
of
figure
behaviour
and
every
mode
and
manner
of
selfexpression
will
issue
in
harmony
with
the
dictates
of
mental
elevation56
this
universal
demand
for
artistic
expression57
is
based
on
the
rational
impulse
in
mans
nature
to
exalt
both
the
world
of
his
soul
experience
and
that
of
nature
for
himself
into
the
conscious
embrace
of
mind
as
an
object
in
which
he
rediscovers
himself
he
satisfies
the
demand
of
this
spiritual
freedom
by
making
explicit
to
his
inner
life
all
that
exists
no
less
than
from
the
further
point
of
view
giving
a
realized
external
embodiment
to
the
self
made
thus
explicit
and
by
this
reduplication
of
what
is
his
own
he
places
before
the
vision
and
within
the
cognition
of
himself
and
others
what
is
within
him
this
is
the
free
rationality
of
man
in
which
art
as
also
all
action
and
knowledge
originates
we
shall
investigate
at
a
later
stage
the
specific
need
for
art
as
compared
with
that
for
other
political
and
ethical
action
or
that
for
religious
ideas
and
scientific
knowledge

we
have
hitherto
considered
the
work
of
art
under
the
aspect
that
it
is
fashioned
by
man
we
will
now
pass
over
to
the
second
part
of
our
definition
that
it
is
produced
for
his
senseapprehension
and
consequently
is
to
a
more
or
less
degree
under
obligations
to
a
sensuous
medium
a
this
reflection
has
been
responsible
for
the
inference
that
the
function
of
fine
art
is
to
arouse
feeling
more
precisely
the
feeling
which
suits
usthat
is
pleasant
feeling
from
such
a
point
of
view
writers
have
converted
the
investigation
of
fine
art
into
a
treatise
on
the
emotions
and
asked
what
kind
of
feelings
art
ought
to
excitetake
fear
for
example
and
compassionwith
the
further
question
how
such
can
be
regarded
as
pleasant
how
in
short
the
contemplation
of
a
misfortune
can
bring
satisfaction
this
tendency
of
reflection
dates
for
the
most
part
from
the
times
of
moses
mendelssohn
and
many
such
trains
of
reasoning
may
be
found
in
his
writings
a
discussion
of
this
kind
however
did
not
carry
the
problem
far
feeling
is
the
undefined
obscure
region
of
spiritual
life
what
is
felt
remains
cloaked
in
the
form
of
the
separate
personal
experience
under
its
most
abstract
persistence58
and
for
this
reason
the
distinctions
of
feeling
are
wholly
abstract
they
are
not
distinctions
which
apply
to
the
subjectmatter
itself
to
take
examplesfear
anxiety
care
dread
are
of
course
one
type
of
emotion
under
various
modifications
but
in
part
they
are
purely
quantitative
degrees
of
intensity
and
in
part
forms
which
reflect
no
light
on
their
content
itself
but
are
indifferent
to
it
in
the
case
of
fear
for
instance
an
existence
is
assumed
for
which
the
individual
in
question
possesses
an
interest
but
sees
at
the
same
time
the
negative
approach
which
threatens
to
destroy
this
existence
and
thereupon
discovers
in
immediate
fusion
within
himself
the
above
interest
and
the
approach
of
that
negative
as
a
contradictory
affection
of
his
personal
life
a
fear
of
this
sort
however
does
not
on
its
own
account
condition
any
particular
content
it
may
associate
with
itself
subjectmatter
of
the
most
opposed
and
varied
character
the
feeling
merely
as
such
is
in
short
a
wholly
empty
form
of
a
subjective
state
such
a
form
may
no
doubt
in
certain
cases
itself
be
essentially
complex
as
we
find
it
is
with
hope
pain
joy
and
pleasure
it
may
also
in
this
very
complexity
appropriate
various
modes
of
content
as
for
example
we
have
a
feeling
of
justice
an
ethical
feeling
a
sublime
religious
feeling
and
so
forth
but
despite
the
fact
that
a
content
of
this
kind
is
present
in
different
modes
of
feeling
no
light
whatever
is
thereby
thrown
on
such
content
which
will
disclose
its
essential
and
definite
character
the
feeling
throughout
remains
a
purely
subjective
state
which
belongs
to
me
one
in
which
the
concrete
fact
vanishes
as
though
contracted
to
a
vanishing
point
in
the
most
abstract
of
all
spheres59
for
this
reason
an
inquiry
over
the
nature
of
the
emotions
which
art
ought
or
ought
not
to
arouse
comes
simply
to
a
standstill
in
the
undefined
it
is
an
investigation
which
deliberately
abstracts
from
genuine
content
and
its
concrete
substance
and
notion
reflection
upon
feeling
is
satisfied
with
the
observation
of
the
personal
emotional
state
and
its
singularity
instead
of
penetrating
and
sounding
the
matter
for
study
in
other
words
the
work
of
art
and
in
doing
so
bidding
goodbye
to
the
wholly
subjective
state
and
its
conditions
in
feeling
however
it
is
just
this
subjective
state
void
of
content
which
is
not
merely
accepted
but
becomes
the
main
thing
and
that
is
precisely
why
people
are
so
proud
of
having
emotions
and
for
no
other
reason
that
is
why
such
an
investigation
is
tedious
owing
to
its
indefinite
nature
and
emptiness
and
even
repellent
in
its
attention
to
trivial
personal
idiosyncrasies
b
inasmuch
however
as
the
work
of
art
is
not
merely
concerned
with
exciting
some
kind
of
emotion
or
otherfor
this
is
an
object
it
would
share
without
any
valid
distinction
with
eloquence
historical
composition
religious
edification
and
much
elsebut
is
only
a
work
of
art
in
so
far
as
it
is
beautiful
it
occurred
to
reflective
minds
to
discover
a
specific
feeling
for
beauty
and
a
distinct
sense
faculty
correspondent
with
it
in
such
an
inquiry
it
soon
became
clear
that
a
sense
of
this
kind
was
no
definite
and
mere60
instinct
rigidly
fixed
by
nature
which
was
able
by
itself
and
independently
to
distinguish
the
beautiful
as
a
consequence
the
demand
was
made
for
culture
as
a
condition
precedent
to
such
a
sense
and
the
sense
of
beauty
as
thus
cultivated
was
called
taste
which
albeit
an
instructed
apprehension
and
discovery
of
the
beautiful
was
none
the
less
assumed
to
persist
in
the
character
of
immediate
feeling
we
have
already
discussed
the
way
in
which
abstract
theory
attempted
to
form
such
a
sense
of
taste
and
how
external
and
onesided
that
sense
remained
while
the
critical
sense
generally
of
the
time
when
such
ideas
were
in
currency
was
lacking
in
the
universality
of
its
principles
as
a
specific
critique
of
particular
works
of
art
it
was
less
concerned
to
substantiate
a
judgment
more
decisive
than
hithertoindeed
the
material
to
effectuate
this
was
not
as
yet
forthcomingthan
to
promote
in
a
general
way
the
cultivation
of
such
a
taste61
consequently
this
educative
process
also
came
to
a
halt
in
the
region
of
the
more
indefinite
and
merely
busied
itself
by
its
reflections
in
the
fitting
out
of
feeling
as
a
sense
of
beauty
in
such
a
way
that
beauty
could
immediately
be
discovered
whenever
and
wherever
it
might
chance
to
appear
the
real
depth
of
the
subjectmatter
remained
notwithstanding
a
closed
book
to
such
a
taste
profundity
of
this
kind
demands
not
merely
sensitive
reception
and
abstract
thought
but
the
reason
in
its
concrete
grasp
and
the
most
sterling
qualities
of
soullife
taste
on
the
contrary
is
merely
directed
to
the
outside
surfaces
which
are
the
playground
of
the
feelings
and
upon
which
onesided
principles
may
very
well
pass
as
currency
but
for
this
very
reason
our
socalled
good
taste
is
scared
by
every
kind
of
profounder
artistic
effect
and
is
dumb
where
the
ideal
significance62
is
in
question
and
all
mere
externalities
and
accessories
vanish
for
when
great
passions
and
the
movements
of
a
profound
soul
assert
themselves
we
do
not
bother
ourselves
any
more
with
the
finer
distinctions
of
taste
and
its
retail
traffic
in
trifles
it
is63
conscious
that
genius
leaves
such
ground
far
behind
it
in
its
stride
and
shrinking
before
that
power
feels
on
its
part
far
from
comfortable
not
knowing
very
well
which
way
to
turn
c
thus
it
is
the
further
change
has
come
about
that
critics
of
artproduction
no
longer
have
an
eye
simply
to
the
education
of
taste
or
are
intent
upon
the
illustration
of
such
a
sense
the
connoisseur
or
artscholar
has
taken
the
place
of
the
man
or
judge
of
artistic
taste
the
positive
side
of
artscholarship
in
so
far
as
it
implies
a
sound
and
exhaustive
acquaintance
with
the
entire
embrace
of
what
is
distinctive
and
peculiar
in
a
given
work
of
art
we
have
already
maintained
to
be
a
necessary
condition
of
artistic
research
a
work
of
art
owing
to
its
nature
which
if
it
is
material
from
one
point
of
view
is
also
related
to
a
particular
person
originates
from
specific
conditions
of
the
most
varied
kind
among
which
as
exceptionally
important
we
may
mention
the
date
and
place
of
its
origins
the
characteristic
personality
of
the
artist
and
above
all
the
degree
of
executive
accomplishment
secured
by
the
art
all
these
points
of
view
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
if
we
wish
to
obtain
a
view
and
knowledge
of
such
a
work
which
is
clear
in
its
outlines
and
founded
on
a
true
basis
nay
even
wish
to
enjoy
it
rightly
it
is
with
these
that
our
artscholarship
is
mainly
occupied
and
all
that
it
can
do
for
us
in
this
way
should
be
gratefully
accepted
though
it
is
quite
true
such
artscholarship
must
be
reckoned
as
of
essential
importance
it
ought
not
to
be
regarded
as
the
sole
or
indeed
the
highest
constituent
in
the
relation
of
the
contemplative
spirit
to
a
work
of
art
and
art
generally
such
artscholarship
this
is
the
defective
tendency
may
restrict
itself
wholly
to
a
knowledge
of
purely
external
characteristics
either
on
the
side
of
technique
or
historical
condition
or
in
other
directions
it
may
continue
to
possess
the
barest
inkling
of
the
true
nature
of
a
given
work
or
simply
no
knowledge
at
all
it
may
even
form
a
depreciatory
verdict
on
the
value
of
profounder
inquiries
as
compared
with
purely
matter
of
fact
technical
and
historical
knowledge
yet
even
so
an
artscholarship
assuming
it
to
be
really
genuine
and
thorough
at
least
proceeds
upon
grounds
and
knowledge
which
are
definite
and
an
intelligent
judgment
and
it
is
association
with
such
that
our
more
accurate
review
of
the
distinct
if
also
to
some
extent
exterior
aspects
of
a
work
of
art
and
our
estimate
of
their
relative
significance
is
secured
d
following
the
above
observations
upon
the
modes
of
inquiry
which
were
suggested
by
that
aspect
of
a
work
of
art
in
which
as
itself
an
object
with
a
material
medium
it
possessed
an
essential
relation
to
man
as
himself
receptive
through
sense
we
will
now
examine
this
point
of
view
in
its
more
essential
connection
with
art
itself
we
propose
to
do
this
partly

in
respect
to
the
artproduct
viewed
as
an
object
partly

as
regards
the
personal
characteristics
of
the
artist
his
genius
talent
and
so
forth
we
do
not
however
propose
to
enter
into
matter
which
can
in
this
connection
exclusively
proceed
from
the
knowledge
of
art
according
to
its
universal
concept64
the
truth
is
we
are
not
as
yet
in
the
full
sense
on
scientific
ground
we
have
merely
reached
the
province
of
external
reflection

there
is
no
question
then
that
a
work
of
art
is
presented
to
sensuous
apprehension
it
is
submitted
to
the
emotional
sense
whether
outer
or
inner
to
sensuous
perception
and
the
imaged
sense
precisely
as
the
objective
world
is
so
presented
around
us
or
as
is
our
own
inward
sensitive
nature
even
a
speech
for
example
may
be
addressed
to
the
sensuous
imagination
and
feeling
notwithstanding
this
fact
however
the
work
of
art
is
not
exclusively
directed
to
the
sensuous
apprehension
viewed
that
is
as
an
object
materially
conditioned
its
position
is
of
the
nature
that
along
with
its
sensuous
presentation
it
is
fundamentally
addressed
to
the
mind
the
mind
is
intended
to
be
affected
by
it
and
to
receive
some
kind
of
satisfaction
in
it
this
function
of
the
work
of
art
at
once
makes
it
clear
how
it
is
that
it
is
in
no
way
intended
to
be
a
natural
product
or
on
the
side
where
it
impinges
on
nature
to
possess
the
living
principle
of
nature
this
at
least
is
a
fact
whether
the
natural
product
is
ranked
lower
or
higher
than
a
mere
work
of
art
as
people
are
accustomed
to
express
themselves
in
the
tone
of
depreciation
in
other
words
the
sensuous
aspect
of
a
work
of
art
has
a
right
to
determinate
existence
only
in
so
far
as
it
exists
for
the
human
mind
not
however
in
so
far
as
itself
as
a
material
object
exists
for
itself
independently
if
we
examine
more
closely
in
what
way
the
sensuous
materia
is
presented
to
man
we
find
that
what
is
so
can
be
placed
under
various
relations
to
the
mind

the
lowest
in
grade
and
that
least
compatible
with
relation
to
intelligence
is
purely
sensuous
sensation
it
consists
primarily
in
mere
looking
listening
just
as
in
times
of
mental
overstrain
it
may
often
be
a
relaxation
to
go
about
without
thought
and
merely
listen
and
have
a
look
round
the
mind
however
does
not
rest
in
the
mere
apprehension
of
external
objects
through
sight
and
hearing
it
makes
them
objective
to
its
own
inward
nature
which
thereupon
is
impelled
itself
to
give
effect
to
itself
in
these
things
as
a
further
step
under
a
sensuous
mode
in
other
words
it
relates
itself
to
them
as
desire

this
appetitive
relation

in
a
relation
of

in
the

way

he
does
not
address
himself
to
them
with
open
mind
and
the
universal
ideas
of
thought
he
retains
an
isolated
position
with
its
personal
impulses
and
interests
relatively
to
objects
as
fixed
in
their
obduracy
as
himself
and
makes
himself
at
home
in
them
by
using
them
or
eating
them
up
altogether
and
in
short
gives

to
his

by
the
sacrifice
he
makes
of
them
in
this
negative
relation
desire
requires
for
itself
not
merely
the
superficial
show
of
external
objects
but
the
actual
things
themselves
in
their
material
concrete
existence
mere
pictures
of
the
wood
which
it
seeks
to
make
use
of
or
of
the
animals
which
it
hopes
to
eat
up
would
be
of
no
service
to
desire
just
as
little
is
it
possible
for
desire
to
suffer
the
object
to
remain
in
its
freedom
its
craving
is
just
this
to
force
it
to
annihilate
this
selfsubsistency
and
freedom
of
external
facts
and
to
demonstrate
that
these
things
are
only
there
to
be
destroyed
and
devoured
but
at
the
same
time
the
particular
person
is
neither
himself
free
begirt
as
he
is
by
the
particular
limited
and
transitory
interests
of
his
desires
for
his
definite
acts
do
not
proceed
from
the
essential
universality
and
rationality
of
his
will
neither
is
he
free
relatively
to
the
external
world
for
desire66
remains
essentially
determined
by
things
and
related
to
them
this
relation
then
of
desire
is
not
that
in
which
man
is
related
to
the
work
of
art
he
suffers
it
to
exist
in
its
free
independence
as
an
object
he
associates
himself
with
it
without
any
craving
of
this
kind
rather
as
with
an
object
reflective
of
himself67
which
exists
solely
for
the
contemplative
faculty
of
mind
for
this
reason
as
we
have
said
the
work
of
art
although
it
possesses
sensuous
existence
does
not
require
sensuous
concrete
existence
nor
yet
the
animated
life
of
such
objects
or
rather
we
should
add
it
ought
not
to
remain
on
such
a
level
in
so
far
as
its
true
function
is
exclusively
to
satisfy
spiritual
interests
and
to
shut
the
door
on
all
approach
to
mere
desire
hence
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
practical
desire
rates
the
particular
works
of
nature
in
the
organic
or
inorganic
world
which
are
at
its
service
more
highly
than
works
of
art
which
are
obviously
useless
in
this
sense
and
only
contribute
enjoyment
to
other
capacities
of
mans
spirit

a
second
mode
under
which
the
externally
present
comes
before
the
conscious
subject
is
as
contrasted
with
the
single
sensuous
perception
and
active
desire
the
purely
theoretical
relation
to
the
intelligence
the
theoretic
contemplation
of
objects
has
no
interest
in
consuming
the
same
in
their
particularity
and
satisfying
or
maintaining
itself
through
the
sense
by
their
means
its
object
is
to
attain
a
knowledge
of
them
in
their
universality
to
seek
out
their
ideal
nature
and
principle
to
comprehend
them
according
to
their
notional
idea
consequently
this
contemplative
interest
is
content
to
leave
the
particular
things
as
they
are
and
stands
aloof
from
them
in
their
objective
singularity
which
is
not
the
object
of
such
a
facultys
investigation
for
the
rational
intelligence
is
not
a
property
of
the
particular
person
in
the
sense
that
desire
is
so
it
appertains
to
his
singularity
as
being
itself
likewise
essentially
universal
so
long
as
it
persists
in
this
relation
of
universality
to
the
objects
in
question
it
is
his
reason
in
its
universal
potency
which
is
attempting
to
discover
itself
in
nature
and
thereby
the
inward
or
essential
being
of
the
natural
objects
which
his
sensuous
existence
does
not
present
under
its
mode
of
immediacy
although
such
existence
is
founded
therein
this
interest
of
contemplation
the
satisfaction
of
which
is
the
task
of
science
is
however
shared
in
this
scientific
form
just
as
little
by
art
as
it
shared
in
the
common
table
of
those
impulses
of
the
purely
practical
desire
science
can
it
is
true
take
as
its
point
of
departure
the
sensuous
thing
in
its
singularity
and
possess
itself
of
some
conception
how
this
individual
thing
is
present
in
its
specific
colour
or
form
but
for
all
that
this
isolated
thing
of
sense
as
such
possesses
no
further
relation
to
mind
inasmuch
as
the
interest
of
intelligence
makes
for
the
universal
the
law
the
thought
and
notion
of
the
object
and
consequently
not
only
does
it
forsake
it
in
its
immediate
singularity
but
it
actually
transforms
it
within
the
region
of
idea68
converting
a
concrete
object
of
sense
into
an
abstract
subjectmatter
of
thought
that
is
converting
it
into
something
other
than
the
same
object
of
its
sensuous
perception
actually
was
the
artistic
interest
does
not
follow
such
a
process
and
is
distinct
from
that
of
science
for
this
reason
the
contemplation
of
art
restricts
its
interest
simply
in
the
way
in
which
the
work
of
art
as
external
object
in
the
directness
of
its
definition
and
in
the
singularity
wherein
it
appears
to
sense
is
manifested
in
all
its
features
of
colour
form
and
sound
or
as
a
single
isolated
vision
of
the
whole
it
does
not
go
so
far
beyond
the
immediately
received
objective
character
as
to
propose
as
is
the
case
with
science
the
ideal
or
conceptive
thinking
of
this
particular
objectivity
under
the
terms
of
the
rational
and
universal
notion
which
underlies
it
the
interest
of
art
therefore
is
distinguishable
from
the
practical
interest
of
desire
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
suffers
its
object
to
remain
in
its
free
independence
whereas
desire
applies
it
even
to
the
point
of
destruction
to
its
own
uses
the
contemplation
of
art
on
the
other
hand
differs
from
that
of
a
scientific
intelligence
in
an
analogous
way69
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
cherishes
an
interest
for
the
object
in
its
isolated
existence
and
is
not
concerned
to
transform
the
same
into
terms
of
universal
thought
and
notion

it
follows
then
that
though
the
sensuous
materia
is
unquestionably
present
in
a
work
of
art
it
is
only
as
surface
or
show
of
the
sensuous
that
it
is
under
any
necessity
to
appear
in
the
sensuous
appearance
of
the
work
of
art
it
is
neither
the
concrete
material
stuff
the
empirically
perceived
completeness
and
extension
of
the
internal
organism
which
is
the
object
of
desire
nor
is
it
the
universal
thought
of
pure
ideality
which
in
either
case
the
mind
seeks
for
its
aim
is
the
sensuous
presence
which
albeit
suffered
to
persist
in
its
sensuousness
is
equally
entitled
to
be
delivered
from
the
framework
of
its
purely
material
substance
consequently
as
compared
with
the
immediately
envisaged
and
incorporated
object
of
nature
the
sensuous
presence
in
the
work
of
art
is
transmuted
to
mere
semblance
or
show
and
the
work
of
art
occupies
a
midway
ground
with
the
directly
perceived
objective
world
on
one
side
and
the
ideality
of
pure
thought
on
the
other
it
is
not
as
yet
pure
thought
but
despite
the
element
of
sensuousness
which
adheres
to
it
it
is
no
longer
purely
material
existence
in
the
sense
at
least
that
stones
plants
and
organic
life
are
such
the
sensuous
element
in
a
work
of
art
is
rather
itself
somewhat
of
ideal
intension70
which
however
as
not
being
actually
the
ideal
medium
of
thought
is
still
externally
presented
at
the
same
time
as
an
object
this
semblance
of
the
sensuous
presents
itself
to
the
mind
externally
as
the
form
visible
appearance
and
harmonious
vibration
of
things
this
is
always
assuming
that
it
suffers
the
objects
to
remain
in
their
freedom
as
objective
facts
and
does
not
seek
to
penetrate
into
their
inward
essence
by
abstract
thought
for
by
doing
so
they
would
as
above
explained
entirely
cease
to
exist
for
it
in
their
external
singularity
for
this
reason
the
sensuous
aspect
of
art
is
only
related
to
the
two
theoretical71
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
smell
on
the
other
hand
taste
and
the
feeling
of
touch
are
excluded
from
the
springs
of
arts
enjoyment
smell
taste
and
touch
come
into
contact
with
matter
simply
as
such72
and
with
the
immediate
sensuous
qualities
of
the
same
smell
with
the
material
volatization
through
the
air
taste
with
the
material
dissolution
of
substance
and
touch
or
mere
bodily
feeling
with
qualities
such
as
heat
coldness
smoothness
and
so
forth
on
this
account
these
senses
cannot
have
to
do
with
the
objects
of
art
which
ought
to
subsist
in
their
actual
and
very
independence
admitting
of
no
purely
sensuous
or
rather
physical
relation
the
pleasant
for
such
senses
is
not
the
beauty
of
art
thus
art
on
its
sensuous
side
brings
before
us
deliberately
merely
a
shadowworld
of
shapes
tones
and
imaged
conceptions73
and
it
is
quite
beside
the
point
to
maintain
that
it
is
simply
a
proof
of
the
impotence
and
limitations
of
man
that
he
can
only
present
us
with
the
surface
of
the
physical
world
mere
schemata
when
he
calls
into
being
his
creative
works
in
art
these
sensuous
shapes
and
tones
are
not
offered
as
exclusively
for
themselves
and
their
form
to
our
direct
vision
they
are
presented
with
the
intent
to
secure
in
such
shape
satisfaction
for
higher
and
more
spiritual
interests
inasmuch
as
they
are
mighty
to
summon
an
echo
and
response
in
the
human
spirit
evoked
from
all
depths
of
its
conscious
life
in
this
way
the
sensuous
is
spiritualized
in
art
or
in
other
words
the
life
of
spirit
comes
to
dwell
in
it
under
sensuous
guise

for
this
reason
however
a
product
of
art
is
only
possible
in
so
far
as
it
has
received
its
passage
through
the
mind
and
has
originated
from
the
productive
activity
of
mind
this
brings
us
to
another
question
we
have
to
answer
and
it
is
this
how
is
the
sensuous
or
material
aspect
which
is
imperative
as
a
condition
of
art
operative
in
the
artist
as
conjoined
to
his
personal
productive
activity74
now
this
mode
or
manner
of
artistic
production
contains
as
an
activity
personal
to
the
artist
in
essentials
just
the
same
determinants
which
we
found
posited
in
the
work
of
art
it
must
be
a
spiritual
activity
which
however
at
the
same
time
possesses
in
itself
the
element
of
sensuousness
and
immediacy
it
is
neither
on
the
one
hand
purely
mechanical
work
such
as
is
purely
unconscious
facility
in
sleight
of
hand
upon
physical
objects
or
a
stereotyped
activity
according
to
teachable
rule
of
thumb
nor
on
the
other
hand
is
it
a
productive
process
of
science
which
tends
to
pass
from
sensuous
things
to
abstract
ideas
and
thoughts
or
is
active
exclusively
in
the
medium
of
pure
thought
in
contrast
to
these
the
two
aspects
of
mental
idea
and
sensuous
material
must
in
the
artistic
product
be
united
for
example
it
would
be
possible
in
the
case
of
poetical
compositions
to
attempt
to
embody
what
was
the
subjectmatter
in
the
form
of
prosaic
thought
in
the
first
instance
and
only
after
doing
so
to
attach
to
the
same
imaginative
ideas
rhymes
and
so
on
so
that
as
a
net
result
such
imagery
would
be
appendent
to
the
abstract
reflections
as
so
much
ornament
and
decoration
an
attempt
of
this
kind
however
could
only
lead
us
to
a
poor
sort
of
poetry
for
in
it
we
should
have
operative
a
twofold
kind
of
activity
in
its
separation
which
in
the
activity
of
genuine
artistic
work
only
holds
good
in
inseparable
unity
it
is
this
true
kind
of
creative
activity
which
forms
what
is
generally
described
as
the
artistic
imagination
it
is
the
rational
element
which
in
its
import
as
spirit
only
exists
in
so
far
as
it
actively
forces
its
way
into
the
presence
of
consciousness
yet
likewise
and
only
subject
to
this
condition
displays
all
its
content
to
itself
under
a
sensuous
form
this
activity
possesses
therefore
a
spiritual
content
but
it
clothes
the
same
in
sensuous
image
and
for
this
reason
that
it
is
only
able
to
come
to
a
knowledge
of
the
same
under
this
sensuous
garb
we
may
compare
such
a
process
with
that
of
a
man
of
experience
in
life
a
man
shall
we
add
of
real
geniality
and
wit
whowhile
at
the
same
time
being
fully
conscious
in
what
the
main
importance
of
life
consists
what
are
the
things
which
essentially
bind
men
together
what
moves
them
and
is
the
mainspring
of
their
livesnevertheless
has
neither
brought
home
this
content
in
universal
maxims
nor
indeed
is
able
to
unfold
it
to
others
in
the
generalities
of
the
reflective
process
but
makes
these
mature
results
of
his
intelligence
without
exception
clear
to
himself
and
others
in
particular
cases
whether
real
or
invented
or
by
examples
and
such
like
which
hit
the
mark
for
in
the
ideas
of
such
a
man
everything
shapes
itself
into
the
concrete
image
determinate
in
its
time
and
place
to
which
therefore
the
addition
of
names
and
any
other
detail
of
external
condition
causes
no
difficulty
yet
such
a
kind
of
imagination
rather
rests
on
the
recollection
of
conditions
he
has
lived
through
actual
experience
than
it
is
a
creative
power
of
itself
memory
preserves
and
renews
the
particularity
and
external
fashion
of
such
previous
events
with
all
their
more
distinct
circumstances
but
on
the
other
hand
does
not
suffer
the
universal
to
appear
independently
the
creative
imagination
of
an
artist
is
the
imagination
of
a
great
mind
and
a
big
heart
it
is
the
grasp
and
excogitation
of
ideas
and
shapes
and
in
fact
nothing
less
than
this
grasp
of
the
profoundest
and
most
embracing
human
interests
in
the
wholly
definite
presentation
of
imagery
borrowed
from
objective
experience
a
consequence
of
this
is
that
imagination
of
this
type75
is
based
in
a
certain
sense
on
a
natural
gift
a
general
talent
for
it
as
we
say
because
its
creative
power
essentially
implies
an
aspect
of
sense
presentation
it
is
no
doubt
not
unusual
to
speak
in
the
same
way
of
scientific
talent
the
sciences
however
merely
presuppose
the
general
capacity
for
thought
which
does
not
possess
as
imagination
does
together
with
its
intellectual
activity
a
reference
to
the
concrete
testimony
of
nature
but
rather
precisely
abstracts
from
the
activity
that
form
in
which
we
find
it
in
nature
it
would
be
therefore
truer
to
the
mark
if
we
said
there
is
no
specific
scientific
talent
in
the
sense
of
a
purely
natural
endowment
imagination76
on
the
other
hand
combines
within
it
a
mode
of
instinctlike
creativeness
in
other
words
the
essential
plasticity
and
material
element
in
a
work
of
art
is
subjectively
present
in
the
artist
as
part
of
his
native
disposition
and
impulse77
and
as
his
unconscious
activity
belongs
in
part
to
that
which
man
receives
straight
from
nature
no
doubt
the
entire
talent
and
genius
of
an
individual
is
not
wholly
exhausted
by
that
we
describe
as
natural
capability
the
creation
of
art
is
quite
as
much
a
spiritual
and
selfcognized
process
but
for
all
that
we
affirm
that
its
spirituality
contains
an
element
of
plastic
or
configurative
facility
which
nature78
confers
on
it
for
this
reason
though
almost
anybody
can
reach
a
certain
point
in
art
yet
in
order
to
pass
beyond
thisand
it
is
here
that
the
art
in
question
really
beginsa
talent
for
art
which
is
inborn
and
of
a
higher
order
altogether
is
indispensable
considered
simply
as
a
natural
basis
a
talent
of
this
kind
asserts
itself
for
the
most
part
in
early
youth
and
is
manifested
in
the
restless
persistency
ever
intent
with
vivacity
and
alertness
to
create
artistic
shapes
in
some
particular
sensuous
medium
and
to
make
this
mode
of
expression
and
utterance
the
unique
one
or
the
one
of
main
importance
and
most
suitable
and
thus
also
a
virtuosity
up
to
a
certain
point
in
the
technique
of
art
which
is
arrived
at
with
ease
is
a
sign
of
inborn
talent
a
sculptor
finds
everything
convertible
into
plastic
shape
and
from
early
days
takes
to
modelling
clay
and
so
on
generally
whatever
men
of
such
innate
powers
have
in
their
minds
whatever
excites
and
moves
their
souls
becomes
forthwith
a
plastic
figure
a
drawing
a
melody
or
a
poem

thirdly
and
in
conclusion
the
content
of
art
is
also
in
some
respects
borrowed
from
the
objective
world
perceived
in
sense
that
is
nature
or
in
any
case
if
the
content
is
also
of
a
spiritual
character
it
can
only
be
grasped
in
such
a
way
that
the
spiritual
element
therein
as
human
relations
for
example
are
displayed
in
the
form
of
phenomena
which
possess
objective
reality
3
there
is
yet
another
question
to
solve
namely
what
the
interest
or
the
end
is
which
man
proposes
to
himself
in
the
creation
of
the
content
embodied
by
a
work
of
art
this
was
in
fact
the
third
point
of
view
which
we
propounded
relatively
to
the
artproduct
its
more
detailed
discussion
will
finally
introduce
us
to
the
true
notional
concept
of
art
itself
if
we
take
a
glance
at
our
ordinary
ideas
on
this
subject
one
of
the
most
prevalent
is
obviously
a
the
principle
of
the
imitation
of
nature
according
to
this
view
the
essential
aim
or
object
of
art
consists
in
imitation
by
which
is
understood
a
facility
in
copying
natural
forms
as
present
to
us
in
a
manner
which
shall
most
fully
correspond
to
such
facts
the
success
of
such
an
exact
representation
of
nature
is
assumed
to
afford
us
complete
satisfaction

now
in
this
definition
there
is
to
start
with
absolutely
nothing
but
the
formal
aim
to
bring
about
the
bare
repetition
a
second
time
by
man
so
far
as
his
means
will
permit
of
this
of
all
that
was
already
in
the
external
world
precisely
too
in
the
way
it
is
there
a
repetition
of
this
sort
may
at
once
be
set
down
as

a
superfluous
task
for
the
reason
that
everything
which
pictures
theatrical
performances
represent
by
way
of
imitationanimals
natural
scenery
incidents
of
human
lifewe
have
already
elsewhere
before
us
in
our
gardens
or
at
home
or
in
other
examples
of
the
more
restricted
or
extended
reaches
of
our
personal
acquaintance
looked
at
moreover
more
closely
such
a
superfluity
of
energy
can
hardly
appear
otherwise
than
a
presumptuous
trifling
it
is
so
because

it
lags
so
far
behind
nature
in
other
words
art
is
limited
in
its
means
of
representation
it
can
only
produce
onesided
illusions
a
semblance
to
take
one
example
of
real
fact
addressed
exclusively
to
one
sense
and
moreover
if
it
does
wholly
rely
on
the
bare
aim
of
mere
imitation
instead
of
natures
life
all
it
gives
us
ever
is
the
mere
pretence
of
its
substance
for
some
such
reason
the
turks
who
are
mohammedans
will
not
put
up
with
any
pictures
or
copies
of
men
and
other
objects
when
james
bruce
in
his
travels
through
abyssinia
showed
a
painted
fish
to
a
turk
that
worthy
was
at
first
astonished
but
quickly
recovering
himself
he
made
answer
as
follows
if
this
fish
shall
rise
up
against
you
at
the
last
day
and
say
you
have
certainly
given
me
a
body
but
no
living
soul
how
are
you
going
to
justify
yourself
against
such
a
complaint
the
prophet
himself
moreover
if
we
may
believe
the
sunna
said
to
the
two
women
ommi
hubiba
and
ommi
selma
who
told
him
of
certain
pictures
in
the
aethiopian
churches
these
pictures
will
rise
up
in
judgment
against
their
creators
on
the
last
day
there
are
no
doubt
no
less
examples
of
completely
deceptive
imitation
the
painted
grapes
of
zeuxis
have
been
accepted
from
antiquity
and
long
after
as
an
instance
of
arts
triumph
and
also
of
that
of
the
principle
of
imitation
because
we
are
told
actual
doves
pecked
at
them
we
might
add
to
this
ancient
example
that
more
modern
one
of
bltners
monkey
which
bit
to
pieces
a
painted
cockchafer
in
rsels
diversions
of
insects
and
was
consequently
forgiven
by
his
master
although
he
destroyed
by
this
means
a
fine
copy
of
the
precious
work
because
he
proved
thus
the
excellence
of
its
illustrations
but
if
we
will
only
reflect
a
moment
on
such
and
other
instances
we
can
only
come
to
the
conclusion
that
instead
of
praising
works
of
art
because
they
have
deceived
even
doves
and
monkeys
the
foolish
people
ought
to
be
condemned
who
imagine
that
the
quality
of
a
work
of
art
is
enhanced
if
they
are
able
to
proclaim
an
effect
of
the
same
so
miserable
as
the
supreme
and
last
word
they
can
say
for
it
in
short
to
sum
up
we
may
state
emphatically
that
in
the
mere
business
of
imitation
art
cannot
maintain
its
rivalry
with
nature
and
if
it
makes
the
attempt
it
must
look
like
a
worm
which
undertakes
to
crawl
after
an
elephant

having
regard
then
to
this
invariable
failure
that
is
relative
failure
of
human
imitation
as
contrasted
with
the
natural
prototype
we
have
no
end
left
us
but
the
pleasure
offered
by
sleight
of
hand
in
its
effort
to
produce
something
which
resembles
nature
and
it
is
unquestionably
a
fact
that
mankind
are
able
to
derive
enjoyment
from
the
attempt
to
reproduce
with
their
individual
labour
skill
and
industry
what
they
find
around
them
but
a
delight
and
admiration
of
this
kind
also
becomes
if
taken
alone79
indeed
just
in
proportion
as
the
copy
follows
slavishly
the
thing
copied
so
much
the
more
icily
null
and
cold
or
brings
its
reaction
of
surfeit
and
repugnance
there
are
portraits
which
as
has
been
drily
remarked
are
positively
shameless
in
their
likeness80
and
kant
brings
forward
a
further
example
of
this
pleasure
in
imitation
pure
and
simple
to
the
effect
that
we
are
very
soon
tired
of
a
manand
there
really
are
suchwho
is
able
to
imitate
the
nightingales
song
quite
perfectly
for
we
no
sooner
find
that
it
is
a
man
who
is
producing
the
strain
than
we
have
had
enough
of
it
we
then
take
it
to
be
nothing
but
a
clever
trick
neither
the
free
outpouring
of
nature
nor
yet
a
work
of
art
we
expect
in
short
from
the
free
creative
power
of
men
something
quite
other
than
a
music
of
this
kind
which
only
retains
our
interest
when
as
in
the
case
of
the
nightingales
note
it
breaks
forth
in
unpremeditated
fashion
resembling
in
this
respect
the
rhythmic
flood
of
human
feeling
from
the
native
springs
of
its
life
and
as
a
general
rule
this
delight
we
experience
in
the
skill
of
imitation
can
only
be
of
a
restricted
character
it
becomes
a
man
better
to
derive
enjoyment
from
that
which
he
brings
to
birth
from
himself
in
this
respect
the
invention
of
every
insignificant
technical
product
is
of
higher
rank
and
mankind
may
feel
more
proud
at
having
invented
the
hammer
nail
and
so
forth
than
in
making
themselves
adepts
as
imitators
for
this
abstract
zest
in
the
pursuit
of
imitation
is
on
the
same
lines
as
the
feat
of
the
man
who
had
taught
himself
to
throw
lentils
through
a
small
aperture
without
missing
he
made
an
exhibition
of
this
feat
to
alexander
and
alexander
merely
made
him
a
present
as
a
reward
for
this
art
empty
and
useless
as
it
was
of
a
bushel
of
lentils

inasmuch
as
moreover
the
principle
of
imitation
is
purely
formal
objective
beauty
itself
disappears
if
that
principle
is
accepted
as
the
end
for
the
question
is
then
no
longer
what
is
the
constitution
of
that
which
is
to
be
imitated
but
simply
whether
the
copy
is
correct
or
no
the
object
and
the
content
of
the
beautiful
comes
to
be
regarded
as
a
matter
of
indifference
when
in
other
words
putting
the
principle
of
mere
imitation
on
one
side
we
speak
in
connection
with
animals
human
beings
places
actions
and
characters
of
a
distinction
between
beauty
and
ugliness
it
remains
none
the
less
the
fact
that
relatively
to
such
a
principle
we
are
referring
to
a
distinction
which
does
not
properly
belong
to
an
art
for
which
we
have
appropriated
this
principle
of
imitation
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
in
such
a
case
therefore
whenever
we
select
objects
and
attempt
to
distinguish
between
their
beauty
and
ugliness
owing
to
this
absence
of
a
standard
we
can
apply
to
the
infinite
forms
of
nature
we
have
in
the
final
resort
only
left
us
the
personal
taste
which
is
fixed
by
no
rule
and
admits
of
no
discussion
and
in
truth
if
we
start
in
the
selection
of
objects
for
representation
from
that
which
mankind
generally
discover
as
beautiful
and
ugly
and
accept
accordingly
for
artistic
imitation
in
other
words
form
their
particular
taste
there
is
no
province
in
the
domain
of
the
objective
world
which
is
not
open
to
us
and
which
is
hardly
likely
to
fail
to
secure
its
admirer
at
any
rate
among
men
we
may
assume
that
though
the
case
of
every
husband
and
his
wife
may
be
disputed
yet
at
least
every
bridegroom
regards
his
bride
as
beautiful
very
possibly
being
the
only
person
who
does
so
and
that
an
individual
taste
for
a
beauty
of
this
kind
admits
of
no
fixed
rules
at
all
may
be
regarded
as
a
bit
of
luck
for
both
parties
if
moreover
we
cast
a
glance
wholly
beyond
mere
individuals
and
their
accidental
taste
to
that
of
nations
this
again
is
full
of
diversity
and
opposition
how
often
we
hear
it
repeated
that
a
european
beauty
would
not
please
a
chinaman
or
even
a
hottentota
chinaman
having
a
totally
distinct
notion
of
beauty
from
that
of
a
black
man
and
the
black
man
in
his
turn
from
that
of
a
european
indeed
if
we
consider
the
works
of
art
of
those
extraeuropean
peoples
their
images
of
gods
for
instance
which
have
been
imaginatively
conceived
as
worthy
of
veneration
and
sublime
they
can
only
appear
to
us
as
frightful
idols
their
music
will
merely
ring
in
our
ears
as
an
abominable
noise
while
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
such
aliens
will
regard
our
sculptures
paintings
and
musical
compositions
as
having
no
meaning
or
actually
ugly

but
even
assuming
that
we
abstract
from
an
objective
principle
of
art
and
retain
the
beautiful
as
established
on
the
subjective
and
individual
taste
we
shall
soon
discover
from
the
point
of
view
of
art
itself
that
the
imitation
of
natural
objects
which
appeared
to
be
a
universal
principle
and
indeed
one
secured
by
important
authorities
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
at
least
under
this
general
and
wholly
abstract
conception
of
it
if
we
look
at
the
particular
arts
we
cannot
fail
to
observe
that
albeit
painting
and
sculpture
portray
objects
which
resemble
those
of
nature
or
the
type
of
which
is
essentially
borrowed
from
nature
the
works
of
architecture
on
the
contraryand
this
too
is
one
of
the
fine
artsquite
as
little
as
the
compositions
of
poetry
to
the
extent
at
least
that
these
latter
are
not
restricted
to
mere
description
cannot
justly
be
described
as
imitations
of
nature
at
any
rate
if
we
are
desirous
of
maintaining
such
a
thesis
with
respect
to
the
arts
thus
excluded
we
should
find
ourselves
forced
to
make
important
deviations
from
the
track
in
order
to
condition
our
proposition
in
various
ways
and
level
down
our
socalled
truth
at
least
to
the
plane
of
probability
but
once
accept
probability
and
we
should
again
be
confronted
with
a
great
difficulty
in
determining
precisely
what
is
and
what
is
not
probable
and
in
the
end
no
one
could
really
think
of
or
succeed
even
if
he
did
so
in
excluding
from
poetry
all
compositions
of
an
entirely
capricious
and
completely
imaginative81
character
the
end
or
object
of
art
must
therefore
consist
in
something
other
than
the
purely
formal82
imitation
of
what
is
given
to
objective
sense
which
invariably
can
merely
call
into
being
technical
legerdemain
and
not
works
of
art83
it
is
no
doubt
an
essential
constituent
of
a
work
of
art
that
it
should
have
natural
forms
as
a
foundation
because
the
mode
of
its
representation
is
in
external
form
and
thereby
along
with
it
in
that
of
natural
phenomena
in
painting
it
is
obviously
an
important
study
to
learn
to
copy
with
accuracy
colours
in
their
mutual
relations
such
as
light
effects
and
reflections
and
so
forth
and
with
no
less
accuracy
the
forms
and
shapes
of
objects
carried
into
their
most
subtle
gradations
of
line
it
is
in
this
respect
that
in
modern
times
more
particularly
the
principle
of
the
imitation
of
nature
and
naturalism
generally
has
come
into
vogue
the
object
has
been
to
recall
an
art
which
has
deteriorated
into
weakness
and
nebulosity
to
the
strength
and
determinate
outlines
of
nature
or
in
yet
another
direction
as
against
the
purely
arbitrary
caprice
and
convention
of
a
studio
which
is
in
truth
as
remote
from
nature
as
it
is
from
art
and
merely
indicates
the
path
of
arts
declension
to
assert
the
claim
of
the
legitimate
direct
and
independent
no
less
than
coherent
stability
of
natural
fact
but
while
admitting
that
from
a
certain
point
of
view
such
an
effort
is
reasonable
enough
yet
for
all
that
the
naturalism
which
it
demands
taken
by
itself
is
neither
the
substantive
thing
not
yet
of
primary
importance
in
the
true
basis
of
art
and
although
the
external
fact
in
its
natural
appearance
constitutes
an
element
of
essential
value
yet
the
objective
fact
alone
does
not
supply
the
standard
of
rightness
nor
is
the
mere
imitation
of
external
phenomena
in
their
external
shape
that
is
the
end
of
art
b
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
we
have
the
further
questionwhat
is
the
true
content
of
art
and
with
what
aim
is
that
content
brought
before
us
on
this
head
we
are
confronted
by
the
common
opinion
that
it
is
the
task
and
object
of
art
to
bring
before
our
sense
feeling
and
power
of
emulation84
every
thing
that
the
spirit
of
man
can
perceive
or
conceive
art
has
in
short
to
realize
for
us
the
wellknown
saying
nihil
humani
a
me
alienum
puto
its
object
is
therefore
declared
to
be
that
of
arousing
and
giving
life
to
slumbering
emotions
inclinations
passions
of
every
description
of
filling
the
heart
up
to
the
brim
of
compelling
mankind
whether
cultured
or
the
reverse
to
pass
through
all
that
the
human
soul
carries
in
its
most
intimate
and
mysterious
chambers
all
that
it
is
able
to
experience
and
reproduce
all
that
the
heart
is
able
to
stir
and
evoke
in
its
depths
and
its
countlessly
manifold
possibilities
and
yet
further
to
deliver
to
the
domain
of
feeling
and
the
delight
of
our
vision
all
that
the
mind
may
possess
of
essential
and
exalted
being
in
its
thought
and
the
ideathat
majestic
hierarchy
of
the
noble
eternal
and
true
and
no
less
to
interpret
for
us
misfortune
and
misery
wickedness
and
crime
to
make
the
hearts
of
men
realize
through
and
through85
all
that
is
atrocious
and
dreadful
no
less
than
every
kind
of
pleasure
and
blessedness
and
last
of
all
to
start
the
imagination
like
a
rover
among
the
daydream
playingfields
of
the
fancy
there
to
revel
in
the
seductive
mirage
of
visions
and
emotions
which
captivate
the
senses
all
this
infinitely
manifold
contentso
it
is
heldit
is
the
function
of
art
to
explore
in
order
that
by
this
means
the
experience
of
our
external
life
may
be
repaired
of
its
deficiencies
and
yet
from
a
further
point
of
view
that
the
passions
we
share
with
all
men86
may
be
excited
not
merely
that
the
experiences
of
life
may
not
have
us
unmoved
but
that
we
ourselves
may
thereafter
long
to
make
ourselves
open
channels
of
a
universal
experience
such
a
stimulus
is
not
presented
on
the
plane
of
actual
experience
itself87
but
can
only
come
through
the
semblance
of
it
that
is
to
say
through
the
illusions
which
art
in
its
creations
substitutes
for
the
actual
world
and
the
possibility
of
such
a
deception
by
means
of
the
semblances
of
art
depends
on
the
fact
that
all
reality
must
for
man
pass
through
the
medium
of
the
vision
and
imaginative
idea
and
it
is
only
after
such
a
passage
that
it
penetrates
the
emotional
life
and
the
will
in
such
a
process
it
is
of
no
consequence
whether
it
is
immediate
external
reality
which
claims
his
attention
or
whether
the
result
is
effected
by
some
other
way
in
other
words
by
means
of
images
symbols
and
ideas
which
contain
and
display
the
content
of
such
actuality
men
are
able
to
imagine
things
which
do
not
actually
exist
as
if
they
did
exist
consequently
it
is
precisely
the
same
thing
for
our
emotional
life
whether
it
is
the
objective
world
or
merely
the
show
of
the
same
in
virtue
of
which
a
situation
a
relation
or
any
content
of
life
in
short
is
brought
home
to
us
either
mode
is
equally
able
to
stir
in
us
an
echo
to
the
essential
secret
which
it
carries
whether
it
be
in
grief
or
joy
in
agitation
or
convulsion
and
can
cause
to
flow
through
us
the
feelings
and
passions
of
anger
hate
pity
anxiety
fear
love
reverence
and
admiration
honour
and
fame
the
awakening
of
every
kind
of
emotion
in
us
the
drawing
our
soul
through
every
content
of
life
the
realization
of
all
these
movements
of
soullife
by
means
of
a
presence
which
is
only
external
as
an
illusionthis
it
is
which
in
the
opinion
described
is
preeminently
regarded
as
the
peculiar
and
transcendent
power
of
artistic
creation
we
must
not
however
overlook
the
fact
that
in
this
view
of
art
as
a
means
to
imprint
on
the
soul
and
the
mind
what
is
good
and
evil
alike
to
make
man
more
strong
in
the
pursuit
of
what
is
noblest
no
less
than
enervate
his
definite
course88
by
transporting
his
emotional
life
through
the
most
sensuous
and
selfish
desires
the
task
as
yet
proposed
to
art
remains
throughout
of
an
entirely
formal
character
without
possessing
independently
an
assured
aim
all
that
art
can
offer
is
the
empty
form
for
every
possible
kind
of
ideal
and
formative
content
c
as
a
matter
of
fact
art
does
not
possess
this
formal
side
namely
that
it
is
able
to
bring
before
our
senses
and
feeling
and
artistically
adorn
every
possible
kind
of
material
precisely
as
the
thoughts
of
ordinary
reflection89
elaborate
every
possible
subjectmatter
and
modes
of
action
supplying
the
same
with
its
equipment
of
reasons
and
vindications
in
the
presence
however
of
such
a
variety
of
content
we
cannot
fail
to
observe
that
these
diversified
emotions
and
ideas
which
it
is
assumed
art
has
to
stimulate
or
enforce
intersect
each
other
contradict
and
mutually
cancel
each
other
indeed
under
this
aspect
the
more
art
inspires
men
to
emotions
thus
opposed
to
that
extent
precisely
it
merely
enlarges
the
cleavage
in
their
feelings
and
passions
and
sets
them
staggering
about
in
bacchantic
riot
or
passes
over
into
sophistry
and
scepticism
precisely
as
your
ordinary
free
thinkers
do
this
variety
of
the
material
of
art
itself
compels
us
therefore
not
to
remain
satisfied
with
so
formal
a
determination
our
rational
nature
forces
its
way
into
this
motley
array
of
discord
and
demands
to
see
the
resurrection
of
a
higher
and
more
universal
purpose
from
these
elements
despite
their
opposition
and
to
be
conscious
of
its
attainment
just
in
a
similar
manner
the
social
life
of
mankind
and
the
state
are
no
doubt
credited
with
the
aim
that
in
them
all
human
capacities
and
all
individual
potencies
should
meet
with
expansion
and
expression
in
all
their
features
and
tendencies
but
in
opposition
to
so
formal
a
view
there
very
quickly
crops
up
the
question
in
what
unity
these
manifold
manifestations
are
to
be
concentrated
and
what
single
end
they
must
have
for
their
fundamental
concept
and
ultimate
end
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
notional
concept
of
the
human
state
so
too
there
arises
in
that
of
human
art
the
need
as
to
a
part
thereof
for
an
end
common
to
the
particular
aspects
no
less
than
in
part
for
one
which
is
more
exalted
and
substantive
in
its
character90
as
such
a
substantive
end
the
conclusion
of
reflection
is
readily
brought
home
to
us
that
art
possesses
at
once
the
power
and
function
to
mitigate
the
savagery
of
mere
desires

with
regard
to
this
first
conception
we
have
merely
to
ascertain
what
characteristic
peculiar
to
art
implies
this
possibility
of
eliminating
this
rawness
of
desire
and
of
fettering
and
instructing
the
impulses
and
passions
coarseness
in
general
has
its
groundroot
in
an
unmitigated
selfseeking
of
sensuous
impulses
which
take
their
plunge
off
and
are
exclusively
intent
on
the
satisfaction
of
their
concupiscence
sensual
desire
is
however
all
the
more
brutal
and
domineering
in
proportion
as
in
its
isolation
and
confinement
it
appropriates
the
entire
man
so
that
he
does
not
retain
the
power
to
separate
himself
in
his
universal
capacity
from
this
determinacy
and
to
maintain
the
conscious
presence
of
such
universality91
even
if
the
man
in
such
a
case
exclaims
the
passion
is
mightier
than
myself
though
it
is
true
no
doubt
that
for
that
mans
mind
the
abstract
ego
is
separate
from
the
particular
passion
yet
it
is
purely
so
in
a
formal
way
all
that
such
a
separation
amounts
to
is
that
as
against
the
force
of
the
passion
the
ego
in
its
universal
form
or
competency
is
of
no
account
at
all
the
savageness
of
passion
consists
therefore
in
the
fusion92
of
the
ego
as
such
a
universal
with
the
confined
content
of
its
desire
so
that
a
man
no
longer
possesses
volitional
power
outside
this
single
passion
such
savageness
and
untamed
force
of
the
possibilities
of
passion
art
mitigates
in
the
first
instance
to
the
extent
that
it
brings
home
to
the
mind
and
imagination
of
man
what
he
does
actually
feel
and
carry
into
effect
in
such
a
condition
and
even
if
art
restricts
itself
to
this
that
it
places
before
the
vision
of
the
mind
pictures
of
passion
nay
even
assuming
such
to
be
flattering
pictures
yet
for
all
that
a
power
of
amelioration
is
contained
therein
at
least
we
may
say
that
by
this
means
is
brought
before
a
mans
intelligence
what
apart
from
such
presentment
he
merely
is
the
man
in
this
way
contemplates
his
impulses
and
inclinations
and
whereas
apart
from
this
they
whirl
him
away
without
giving
him
time
to
reflect
he
now
sees
them
outside
himself
and
already
for
the
reason
that
they
come
before
him
rather
as
objects
than
a
part
of
himself
he
begins
to
be
free
from
them
as
aliens
for
this
reason
it
may
often
happen
that
an
artist
under
the
weight
of
grief
mitigates
and
weakens
the
intensity
of
his
own
emotions
in
their
effect
upon
him
by
the
artistic
representation
of
them
comfort
too
is
to
be
found
even
in
tears
the
man
who
to
start
with
is
wholly
given
up
to
and
concentrated
in
sorrow
is
able
thus
at
any
rate
to
express
that
which
is
merely
felt
within
in
a
direct
way
yet
more
alleviating
is
the
utterance
of
such
inner
life
in
words
images
musical
sound
and
shapes
it
was
therefore
a
good
old
custom
in
the
case
of
funerals
and
layingsout
to
appoint
wailing
women
in
order
to
give
audible
expression
to
grief
or
generally
to
create
an
external
sympathy
for
manifestations
of
sympathy
bring
the
content
of
human
sorrow
to
the
sufferer
in
an
objective
form
he
is
by
their
repetition
driven
to
reflect
upon
it
and
the
burden
is
thereby
made
lighter
and
so
it
has
from
of
old
been
considered
that
to
weep
or
to
speak
oneself
out
are
equally
means
whereby
freedom
is
secured
from
the
oppressing
burden
or
at
least
the
heart
is
appreciably
lifted
consequently
the
mitigation
of
the
violence
of
passions
admits
of
this
general
explanation
that
man
is
released
from
his
unmediated
confinement93
in
an
emotion
becomes
aware
of
it
as
a
thing
external
to
himself
to
which
he
is
consequently
obliged
to
place
himself
in
an
ideal
relation
art
while
still
remaining
within
the
sphere
of
the
senses
faces
man
from
the
might
of
his
sensitive
experience
by
means
of
its
representations
no
doubt
we
frequently
hear
that
pet
phrase
of
many
that
it
is
mans
duty
to
remain
in
immediate
union
with
nature
such
union
is
in
its
unmediated
purity
nothing
more
or
less
than
savagery
and
wildness
and
art
precisely
in
the
way
that
it
dissolves
this
unity
for
human
beings
lifts
them
with
gentle
hands
over
this
inclosure
in
nature
the
way
men
are
occupied
with
the
objects
of
arts
creation
remains
throughout
of
a
contemplative94
character
and
albeit
in
the
first
instance
it
educates
merely
an
attention
to
the
actual
facts
portrayed
yet
over
and
beyond
this
and
with
a
power
no
less
decisive
it
draws
mans
attention
to
their
significance
it
forces
him
to
compare
their
content
with
that
of
others
and
to
receive
without
reserve
the
general
conclusions
of
such
a
survey
and
all
the
ramifications95
such
imply

to
the
characteristic
above
discussed
adheres
in
natural
sequence
the
second
which
has
been
predicated
of
art
as
its
essential
aim
namely
the
purification
of
the
passions
an
instruction
that
is
and
a
building
to
moral
completeness
for
the
defining
role
that
art
has
to
bridle
savage
nature
and
educate
the
passions
remained
one
wholly
formal
and
general
so
that
the
further
question
must
arise
as
to
a
specific
kind
and
an
essential
and
culminating
point
of
such
an
educative
process

the
doctrine
of
the
purification
of
the
passions
shares
in
the
defect
previously
noted
as
adhering
to
the
mitigation
of
desires
it
does
however
emphasize
more
closely
the
fact
that
the
representations
of
art
needed
a
standard
by
means
of
which
it
would
be
possible
to
estimate
their
comparative
worth
and
unworth
this
standard
is
just
their
effectiveness
to
separate
what
is
pure
from
that
which
is
the
reverse
in
the
passions
art
therefore
requires
a
content
which
is
capable
of
expressing
this
purifying
power
and
in
so
far
as
the
power
to
assert
such
effectiveness
is
assumed
to
constitute
the
substantive
end
of
art
the
purifying
content
will
consist
in
asserting
that
effective
power
before
consciousness
in
its
universality
and
essentiality96

it
is
a
deduction
from
the
point
of
view
just
described
that
it
is
the
end
of
art
to
instruct
thus
on
the
one
hand
the
peculiar
character
of
art
consists
in
the
movement
of
the
emotions
and
in
the
satisfaction
which
is
found
in
this
movement
even
in
fear
compassion
in
painful
agitation
and
shockthat
is
to
say
in
the
satisfying
concern
of
the
feelings
and
passions
and
to
that
extent
in
a
complacent
delighted
or
enthusiastic
attitude
to
the
objects
of
art
and
their
presentation
and
effect
while
on
the
other
hand
this
artistic
object
is
held
to
discover
its
higher
standard
exclusively
in
its
power
to
instruct
in
the
fabula
docet
and
thereby
in
the
usefulness
which
the
work
of
art
is
able
to
exercise
on
the
recipient
in
this
respect
the
horatian
adage
et
prodesse
volunt
et
delectare
poetae97
contains
concentrated
into
a
few
words
all
that
in
after
times
has
been
drawn
out
as
a
doctrine
of
art
through
every
conceivable
grade
of
dilution
to
the
last
extreme
of
insipidity
in
respect
then
to
such
instruction
we
have
to
ask
whether
the
idea
is
that
the
same
ought
to
be
direct
or
indirect
in
the
work
of
art
explicit
or
implicit
now
if
the
question
at
issue
is
one
of
general
importance
to
art
about
a
universal
rather
than
contingent
purpose
such
an
ultimate
end
on
account
of
the
essential
spirituality
of
art
can
only
be
itself
of
spiritual
import
in
other
words
so
far
from
being
of
accidental
importance
it
must
be
true
in
virtue
of
its
own
nature
and
on
its
own
account
an
end
of
this
kind
can
only
apply
to
instruction
in
so
far
as
a
genuine
and
essentially
explicit
content
is
brought
before
the
mind
by
means
of
the
work
of
art
from
such
a
point
of
view
we
are
entitled
to
affirm
that
it
is
the
function
of
art
to
accept
so
much
the
more
of
a
content
of
this
nature
within
its
compass
in
proportion
to
the
nobility
of
its
rank
and
that
only
in
the
verity
of
such
a
content
will
it
discover
the
standard
according
to
which
the
pertinency
of
or
the
reverse
of
what
is
expressed
is
adjudged
art
is
in
truth
the
primary98
instructress
of
peoples
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
object
of
instruction
is
so
entirely
treated
as
an
end
that
the
universal
nature
of
the
content
presented
cannot
fail
to
be
asserted
and
renderedbluntly
and
on
its
own
account
explicit
as
abstract
thesis
prosaic
reflection
or
general
maxim
rather
than
merely
in
an
indirect
way
contained
by
implication
in
the
concrete
embodiment
of
art
then
and
in
that
case
by
means
of
such
a
separation
the
sensuous
plastic
configuration
which
is
precisely
that
which
makes
the
artistic
product
a
work
of
art
is
merely
an
otiose
accessory
a
husk
a
semblance
which
are
expressly
posited
as
nothing
more
than
shell
and
semblance
thereby
the
very
nature
of
a
work
of
art
is
abused
for
the
work
of
art
ought
not
to
bring
before
the
imaginative
vision
a
content
in
its
universality
as
such
but
rather
this
universality
under
the
mode
of
individual
concreteness
and
distinctive
sensuous
particularity
if
the
work
in
question
does
not
conform
to
such
a
principle
but
rather
sets
before
us
the
generalization
of
its
content
with
the
express
object
of
instruction
pure
and
simple
then
the
imaginative
no
less
than
the
material
aspect
of
it
are
merely
an
external
and
superfluous
ornament
and
the
work
of
art
is
itself
a
shattered
thing
within
that
ornament99
a
ruin
wherein
form
and
content
no
longer
appear
as
a
mutually
adherent
growth
for
in
the
case
supposed
the
particular
object
of
the
senses
and
the
ideal
content
apprehended
by
the
mind100
have
become
external
to
one
another
furthermore
if
the
object
of
art
is
assumed
to
consist
in
utilitarian
instruction
of
this
kind
that
other
aspect
of
delight
entertainment
and
diversion
is
simply
abandoned
on
its
own
account
as
unessential
it
has
now
to
look
for
its
substance
to
the
utility
of
the
matter
of
instruction
to
which
it
is
simply
an
accompaniment
but
this
amounts
to
saying
that
art
does
not
carry
its
vocation
and
purpose
in
itself
but
that
its
fundamental
conception
is
in
something
else
to
which
it
subserves
as
a
means
art
becomes
in
short
merely
one
of
the
many
means
which
are
either
of
use
or
may
be
employed
to
secure
the
aim
of
instruction
this
brings
us
to
the
boundary
line
where
art
can
only
cease
to
be
an
end
on
its
own
independent
account
it
is
deliberately
deposed
either
to
the
mere
plaything
of
entertainment
or
a
mere
means
of
instruction

the
line
of
this
limit
is
most
emphasized
when
the
question
is
raised
as
to
the
end
or
object
of
highest
rank
for
the
sake
of
which
the
passions
have
to
be
purified
or
men
have
to
be
instructed
this
goal
has
frequently
in
modern
times
been
identified
with
moral
improvement
and
the
end
of
art
is
assumed
to
consist
in
this
that
its
function
is
to
prepare
our
inclinations
and
impulses
and
generally
to
conduct
us
to
the
supreme
goal
of
moral
perfection
in
this
view
we
find
instruction
and
purification
combined
the
notion
is
that
art
by
the
insight
it
gives
us
of
genuine
moral
goodness
in
other
words
through
its
instruction
at
the
same
time
summons
us
to
the
process
of
purification
and
in
this
way
alone
can
and
ought
to
bring
about
the
improvement
of
mankind
as
the
right
use
they
can
make
of
it
and
its
supreme
object
with
reference
to
the
relation
in
which
art
stands
to
the
end
of
improvement
we
may
practically
say
the
same
thing
as
we
did
about
the
didactic
end
it
may
readily
be
admitted
that
art
as
its
principle
ought
not
to
make
the
immoral
and
its
advance
its
end
but
it
is
one
thing
deliberately
to
make
immorality
the
aim
of
its
presentation
and
another
not
expressly
to
do
so
in
the
case
of
morality
it
is
possible
to
deduce
an
excellent
moral
from
any
work
of
art
whatever
but
such
depends
of
course
on
a
particular
interpretation
and
consequently
on
the
individual
who
draws
the
moral
the
defence
is
made
of
the
most
immoral
representations
on
the
ground
that
people
ought
to
become
acquainted
with
evil
and
sin
in
order
to
act
morally
conversely
it
has
been
maintained
that
the
portrayal
of
mary
magdalene
the
fair
sinner
who
afterwards
repented
has
seduced
many
into
sin
because
art
makes

must
first
sin
before
you
can
repent
the
doctrine
of
moral
improvement
however
logically
carried
out
is
not
merely
satisfied
that
a
moral
should
be
conceivably
deducible
from
a
work
of
art
through
interpretation
on
the
contrary
it
would
have
the
moral
instruction
clearly
made
to
emerge
as
the
substantive
aim
of
the
work101
nay
further
it
would
deliberately
exclude
from
arts
products
all
subjects
characters
actions
and
events
which
fail
to
be
moral

its
own
sense

from
history
and
the
sciences
which
have
their
subjectmatter

a
choice
in
the
selection
of
its

we
may
be
in
a
position
to
estimate
this
view
of
the
moral
end
of
art
on
the
basis
of
principle
we
ought
above
all
to
raise
the
question
as
to
the
precise
standpoint
of
the
morality
which
is
recommended
for
our
reception
by
this
view
if
we
examine
more
closely
the
standpoint
of
morality
such
as
is
submitted
us
today
under
an
enlightened
interpretation102
we
soon
discover
that
its
conception
does
not
immediately
coincide
with
that
which
we
describe
in
a
general
way
as
virtue
respectability103
uprightness
and
so
forth
to
be
a
respectable
honest
man
is
not
sufficient

make
a
man
moral

the
sense
under
discussion
for
morality
in
this
sense
implies
reflection
and
the
definite
consciousness
of
what
is
consonant
with
duty
and
the
acts
which
issue
from
such
a
consciousness
now
duty
is
itself
the
law
of
the
will
which
man
however
freely
establishes
out
of
himself
and
thereon
is
taken
to
determine
himself
to
this
duty
for
dutys

and
its
fulfilments

the
reason
that
both
are

on

over

so

also
in

the

from
the
fixed
opposition
between
the
will

its
spiritual
universality

its
sensuous
natural
particularity
it
does
not
consist
in
the
perfected
mediation
of
these
opposed
aspects
but
in
their
mutual
conflict
as
opposed
to
one
another
which
carries
with
it
the
demand
that
the
impulses
in
their
antagonism
to
duty
ought
to
yield
to
it
an
opposition
of
this
nature
is
not
merely
present
to
mind
in
the
restricted
confines
of
moral
action
it
asserts
itself
as
a
fundamental
severation
and
antithesis
between
that
which
is
actual
essentially
and
on
its
own
account
and
that
which
is
external
reality
and
existence104
apprehended
in
entirely
formal
terms
it
is
the
contrast
exposed
by
the
universal
in
so
far
as
it
is
fixed
in
its
substantive
independence
over
against
the
particular
as
the
latter
is
also
on
its
part
rigidly
exterior
to
it
in
more
concrete
form
it
appears
in
nature
as
the
opposition
of
the
abstract
law
to
the
wealth
of
particular
phenomena
each
of
which
possesses
its
specific
characteristics
it
appears
in
mind
as
that
between
the
sensuous
and
spiritual
in
man
as
the
conflict
of
spirit
with
the
flesh
it
is
that
of
duty
for
dutys
sake
of
the
cold
imperative
with
particular
impulses
the
warm
heart
the
sensuous
inclinations
and
impulses
in
a
word
with
man
simply
as
individual
or
it
appears
as
the
harsh
antagonism
between
the
inward
freedom
and
the
external
necessity
of
natural
condition
and
lastly
as
the
contradiction
of
the
dead
essentially
emptied
concept
when
confronted
with
the
fulness
of
concrete
life
in
other
words
of
theory
and
subjective
thought
as
contrasted
with
objective
existence
and
experience
such
are
antithetical
points
of
view
the
discovery
of
which
is
not
to
be
ascribed
either
to
the
ingenuity
of
reflective
minds
or
the
pedantry
of
a
philosophical
cult
they
have
in
all
ages
if
in
manifold
guise
occupied
and
disquieted
the
human
consciousness
although
it
is
our
more
modern
culture
which
has
emphasized
their
opposition
most
deliberately
and
forced
it
in
each
case
to
the
keenest
edge
of
contradiction
intellectual
culture
or
rather
the
rapier
edge
of
the
modern
understanding
creates
in
man
this
contrast
which
converts
him
into
some
amphibious
animal
he
is
compelled
to
live
in
two
worlds
mutually
contradictory
and
in
this
divided
house
consciousness
too
wanders
aimlessly
tossed
over
from
one
side
to
the
other
it
is
unable
to
discover
permanent
satisfaction105
for
itself
in
either
one
side
or
the
other
for
on
the
one
hand
we
see
mankind
confined
within
common
reality
and
earthly
temporal
condition
oppressed
by
necessity
and
want
in
natures
toils
entangled
in
matter
in
sensuous
aims
and
their
enjoyment
dominated
and
whirled
away
by
impulse
and
passion
on
the
other
hand
he
lifts
himself
up
to
eternal
ideas
to
a
realm
of
thought
and
freedom
as
will
he
legislates
for
himself
universal
laws
and
destinations106
he
disrobes
the
world
of
the
life
and
blossom
of
its
reality
he
dissolves
it
in
abstractions
that
the
mind
may
vindicate
its
right
and
intrinsic
worth
by
this
very
dissolution
of
natures
rights
and
such
maltreatment
a
process
in
which
he
brings
home
to
her
again
the
necessity
and
violence
he
has
experienced
at
her
hands
such
a
cleavage
of
life
and
mind
is
however
accompanied
for
modern
culture
with
the
demand
that
a
contradiction
so
deepseated
should
be
dissolved
the
mere
understanding
of
abstract
reflection
is
unable
to
disengage
itself
from
the
obstinacy
of
such
contradictions
the
solution
consequently
remains
here
for
consciousness
a
mere
ought
and
the
present
and
reality
is
merely
moved
within
the
continuous
unrest
of
a
to
and
fro
which
seeks
for
that
reconciliation
it
is
unable
to
find
the
problem
therefore
arises
whether
such
a
manysided
and
fundamental
antagonism
which
is
unable
to
pass
beyond
the
mere
ought
and
postulate
of
its
solution
can
be
the
essential
and
wholly
expressed
truth
and107
indeed
the
final
and
supreme
consummation
if
the
culture
of
the
civilized
world
has
fallen
into
such
a
contradiction
it
becomes
the
task
of
philosophy
to
dissolve
the
same
in
other
words
to
demonstrate
that
neither
the
one
side
or
the
other
in
its
one
sided
abstractness
should
be
held
to
possess
truth
but
that
they
contain
within
themselves
the
principle
of
their
dissolution
the
truth
only
then
comes
before
us
in
the
reconciliation
and
mediation
of
both
and
this
mediation
is
no
mere
postulate
but
is
in
its
essential
nature
and
in
its
actual
presence
the
at
the
same
time
accomplished
and
selfaccomplishing
and
in
fact
this
view
agrees
directly
with
unwitting108
faith
and
will
which
always
has
before
its
conscious
life
this
contradiction
in
its
resolution
and
in
action
accepts
it
as
its
aim
and
carries
it
into
effect
all
that
philosophy
achieves
is
to
contribute
the
insight
of
thought
into
the
essence
of
such
cleavage
it
demonstrates
or
seeks
to
demonstrate
how
that
which
truth
really
is
is
simply
the
resolution
of
the
fracture
and
be
it
added
not
in
the
sense
that
this
antagonism
and
its
alternative
aspects
in
any
way
are
not
but
in
the
sense
that
they
are
there109
in
reconciliation
d
when
discussing
moral
improvement
as
the
ultimate
end
accepted
for
art
it
was
found
that
its
principle
pointed
to
a
higher
standpoint
it
will
be
necessary
also
to
vindicate
this
standpoint
for
art
thereby
the
false
position
to
which
we
have
already
directed
attention
vanishes
namely
that
art
has
to
serve
as
a
means
for
moral
ends
and
the
moral
end
of
the
world
generally
by
means
of
its
didactive
and
ameliorating
influence
and
by
doing
so
has
its
essential
aim
not
in
itself
but
in
something
else
if
we
therefore
continue
still
to
speak
of
an
end
or
goal
of
art
we
must
at
once
remove
the
perverse
idea
which
in
the
question
what
is
the
end
will
still
make
it
include
the
supplemental
query
what
is
the
use
the
perverseness
consists
in
this
that
the
work
of
art
would
then
have
to
be
regarded
as
related
to
something
else
which
is
presented
us
as
what
is
essential
and
ought
to
be
a
work
of
art
would
in
that
case
be
merely
a
useful
instrument
in
the
realization
of
an
end
which
possessed
real
and
independent
importance
outside
the
realm
of
art
as
opposed
to
this
we
must
maintain
that
it
is
arts
function
to
reveal
truth
under
the
mode
of
arts
sensuous
or
material
configuration
to
display
the
reconciled
antithesis
previously
described
and
by
this
means
to
prove
that
it
possesses
its
final
aim
in
itself
in
this
representation
in
short
and
selfrevelation
for
other
ends
such
as
instruction
purification
improvement
procuring
of
wealth
struggle
after
fame
and
honour
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
work
of
art
as
such
still
less
do
they
determine
the
fundamental
idea110
of
it
it
is
then
from
this
point
of
view
into
which
the
reflective
consideration
of
our
subjectmatter
finally
issues
that
we
have
to
grasp
the
fundamental
idea
of
art
in
terms
of
its
ideal
or
inward
necessity
as
it
is
also
from
this
point
of
view
that
historically
regarded
the
true
appreciation
and
acquaintance
with
art
took
its
origin
for
that
antithesis
to
which
we
have
drawn
attention
did
not
merely
assert
its
presence
within
the
general
thought
of
educated
men
but
equally
in
philosophy
as
such
it
was
only
after
philosophy
was
in
a
position
to
overcome
this
opposition
absolutely
that
it
grasped
the
fundamental
notion
of
its
own
content
and
to
the
extent
it
did
so
the
idea
of
nature
and
of
art
for
this
reason
as
this
point
of
view
implies
the
reawakening
of
philosophy
in
the
widest
connotation
of
the
term
so
also
it
is
the
reawakening
of
the
science
of
art
we
may
go
further
and
affirm
that
aesthetic
as
a
science
is
in
a
real
sense
primarily
indebted
to
this
reawakening
for
its
true
origination
and
art
for
its
higher
estimation
iv
from
this
point
of
transition
i
will
briefly
summarize
the
historical
subjectmatter
that
i
have
in
my
minds
eye
partly
on
account
of
the
historical
importance
itself
and
in
part
because
thereby
the
points
of
view
are
more
clearly
indicated
to
which
importance
is
attached
and
upon
the
basis
of
which
we
propose
to
continue
the
superstructure
in
its
most
general
definition
that
basis
consists
in
this
that
the
beauty
of
art
has
become
recognized
as
one
of
the
means
which
resolve
and
bring
back
to
unity
that
antithesis
and
contradiction
between
the
mind
and
nature
as
they
repose
in
abstract
alienation
from
each
other
in
themselves
whether
this
latter
is
regarded
as
external
phenomena

the
inward

turningpoint
of
philosophy
this
absolute
point
of
departure
deserves
recognition
and
does
not
admit
of
refutation
even
though
in
other
respects
the
kantian
philosophy
is
inadequate
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
kant
who
through
falling
back
upon
the
fixed
opposition
between
subjective
thought
and
objective
things
between
abstract
universality
and
the
sensuous
individuality
of
the
will
in
a
preeminent
degree
strained
to
the
extremest
limit
the
very
antithesis
of
morality
we
have
previously
adverted
to
inasmuch
as
over
and
above
this
he
emphasized
the
practical
operation
of
mind
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
contemplative
in
virtue
of
this
fixity
of
the
antithesis
as
cognized
by
the
faculty
of
the
understanding
he
had
no
other
alternative
than
to
express
the
unity
exclusively
in
the
form
of
subjective
ideas
for
which
no
adequate
reality
could
be
demonstrated
as
correspondent
or
on
its
practical
side
as
postulates
which
it
was
no
doubt
possible
to
deduce
from
the
practical
reason
but
whose
essential
being
was
not
within
the
cognition
of
thought
and
the
practical
fulfilment
of
which
remained
throughout
a
mere
ought
deferred
to
infinity
and
for
this
reason
though
kant
did
actually
bring
the
reconciled
opposition
within
the
compass
of
intelligible
ideas
he
was
neither
able
to
develop
its
essential
truth
scientifically
nor
to
assert
the
same
as
actual
and
exclusive
reality
unquestionably
kant
did
press
beyond
this
point
in
the
sense
that
is
to
say
that
he
discovered
the
unity
demanded
in
what
he
called
the
intuitive
understanding
but
in
this
respect
too
he
is
held
up
by
the
opposition
of
subjectivity
and
objectivity
so
that
while
he
no
doubt
offers
us
a
resolution
in
an
abstract
sense
of
the
antithesis
between
conception
and
reality
universality
and
particularity
understanding
and
senseperception
and
suggests
the
idea
yet
he
once
more
conceives
this
resolution
and
reconciliation
itself
in
a
wholly
subjective
sense
not
as
being
true
and
real
both
essentially
and
on
its
own
independent
account
in
this
respect
the
critique
of
the
power
of
the
judgment
in
which
he
investigates
the
aesthetic
and
teleological
power
of
the
judgment
is
both
instructive
and
remarkable
the
beautiful
objects
of
nature
and
art
the
products
of
nature
with
their
adaptations
to
ends
by
means
of
which
he
approaches
more
closely
the
notion
of
the
organic
and
the
living
he
considers
wholly
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
reflection
which
judges
them
subjectively
and
indeed
kant
himself
generally
defines
the
power
of
judgment
as
the
capacity
to
think
the
particular
as
comprised
under
the
universal
and
calls
the
power
of
judgment
reflective
when
it
has
only
the
particular
submitted
to
it
and
has
to
discover
the
universal
under
which
it
is
subsumed
to
this
end
it
requires
a
law
a
principle
which
it
has
to
contribute
to
itself
and
kant
affirms
teleology
to
be
this
law
with
regard
to
the
conception
of
freedom
which
belongs
to
the
practical
reason
the
achievement
of
end
or
purpose
gets
no
further
than
a
mere
ought
and
in
the
teleological
judgment
however
relatively
to
the
living
thing
kant
does
manage
to
regard
the
living
organism
in
such
a
way
that
the
notional
concept
the
universal
succeeds
in
also
including
the
particular
and
as
end
does
not
determine
the
particular
and
external
the
structure
of
the
members
from
outside
but
as
an
inward
principle
and
under
the
mode
that
the
particular
conforms
to
the
end
spontaneously
yet
with
such
a
judgment
once
more
it
is
assumed
that
the
objective
nature
of
the
thing
is
not
known
but
that
it
is
only
a
mode
of
subjective
reflection
which
is
thereby
expressed
in
a
similar
way
kant
so
conceives
the
aesthetic
judgment
that
it
neither
proceeds
from
the
understanding
as
such
in
other
words
as
the
faculty
of
ideas
nor
yet
from
the
sensuous
perception
as
such
and
its
varied
manifold
but
from
the
free
play
of
the
understanding
and
the
imagination
in
this
common
agreement
of
the
faculties
of
knowledge
the
object
finds
its
relation
to
the
individual
consciousness
and
its
feeling
of
pleasure
and
contentment
a
now
this
general
feeling
of
contentment
is
in
the
first
place
without
any
interest
that
is
to
say
it
is
devoid
of
relation
to
our
appetitive
faculty
if
we
have
an
interest
of
curiosity
shall
we
say
or
a
sensuous
interest
excited
for
a
physical
want
a
desire
for
possession
and
use
then
the
objects
are
not
important
for
their
own
sake
but
in
virtue
of
our
need
of
them
in
a
case
such
as
this
what
exists
merely
possesses
a
value
in
relation
to
such
a
need
and
the
relation
is
of
the
kind
that
the
object
is
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
is
an
attribute
distinct
from
the
object
to
which
we
relate
it
none
the
less
as
an
illustration
if
i
consume
the
object
in
order
to
nourish
myself
therewith
this
interest
rests
exclusively
in
me
and
remains
alien
to
the
object
now
in
kants
view
our
position
relatively
to
the
beautiful
is
not
of
this
description
the
aesthetic
judgment
suffers
that
which
is
externally
presented
to
subsist
in
free
independence
proceeding
as
it
does
from
the
desire
to
permit
the
object
to
persist
on
its
own
account
and
to
retain
its
end
unimpaired
within
itself
this
is
as
we
have
already
observed
an
important
observation
b
in
the
second
place
kant
maintains
that
the
beautiful
is
definable
as
that
which
without
a
conception
ie
without
a
category
of
the
understanding
is
placed
before
us
as
the
object
of
a
universal
satisfaction
to
estimate
the
beautiful
an
educated
mind
is
indispensable
the
man
in
the
street112
has
no
judgment
about
the
beautiful
this
judgment
in
fact
claims
universal
validity
the
universal
is
no
doubt
in
the
first
instance
simply
as
such
an
abstraction
one
which
however
is
in
its
essential
and
on
its
independent
account
true
and
consequently
carries
essentially
the
property
and
demand
to
pass
also
as
universally
valid
in
this
sense
too
the
beautiful
ought
to
be
universally
recognized
although
the
mere
concepts
of
the
understanding
are
compatible
with
no
judgment
thereupon
the
goodthe
right
which
enters
into
particular
actions
for
exampleis
subsumed
under
universal
concepts
and
the
action
is
accepted
as
good
if
it
is
conformable
to
such
concepts
the
beautiful
on
the
contrary
ought
according
to
this
view
to
arouse
a
universal
satisfaction
without
any
such
mediation
of
concept
this
simply
means
that
in
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
we
are
not
conscious
of
the
notional
concept
or
any
subsumption
under
it
and
do
not
permit
the
independent
passage
of
the
separation
between
the
particular
object
and
the
universal
concept
which
is
present
in
all
other
cases
of
the
judgment
c
thirdly
in
this
view
of
kant
the
beautiful
ought
to
have
the
teleological
form
to
the
extent
that
the
teleological
relation
is
apprehended
in
the
object
without
the
idea
of
an
end
this
is
substantially
a
mere
repetition
of
the
view
just
discussed
any
natural
producttake
for
instance
a
plant
or
an
animalis
organized
as
adapted
to
an
end
and
is
so
immediately
to
us
in
this
its
teleological
purpose
that
we
have
no
conception
of
the
end
on
its
own
account
as
separate
and
distinct
from
the
actual
presence
of
the
object
it
is
in
this
way
that
the
beautiful
also
is
presented
us
teleologically
in
finite
teleology
end
and
means
remain
external
to
each
other
the
end
stands
in
no
essential
inner
relation
to
the
material
means
of
its
execution113
in
this
case
the
idea
of
the
end
as
recognized
in
apartness114
is
distinguishable
from
the
object
in
which
the
end
appears
as
realized
the
beautiful
on
the
contrary
exists
as
teleological
in
the
essential
sense
without
means
and
end
appearing
as
disparate
in
aspects
distinct
from
each
other
for
example
the
purpose
of
the
members
of
the
organism
is
the
principle
of
life
which
exists
in
the
members
as
actual
therein
in
their
separation115
the
parts
cease
to
be
members
of
a
whole
for
in
the
living
thing
the
end
and
material
medium
of
the
end
are
so
immediately
united
that
the
existing
being
only
exists
in
so
far
as
the
end
remains
indwelling
the
beautiful
as
thus
regarded
and
in
kants
view
does
not
carry
its
teleological
purpose
as
an
external
form
attached
to
it
but
the
teleological
correspondence
of
the
inner
and
outer
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
immanent
nature
of
the
beautiful
object
d
fourthly
and
finally
the
view
of
kant
posits
the
beautiful
under
the
mode
that
it
is
recognized
without
a
universal
concept
as
object
of
a
necessary
feeling
of
satisfaction
necessity
is
an
abstract
category
and
indicates
an
ideal
and
essential
relation
between
two
aspects
or
sides
if
the
one
is
and
because
the
one
is
then
and
for
that
reason
the
other
is
also
the
one
likewise
includes
the
other
within
its
determinate
nature
cause
is
meaningless
without
effect
the
pleasure
which
we
obtain
from
beauty
is
necessary
in
this
sense
and
it
is
so
wholly
without
a
relation
to
conceptions
that
is
to
say
the
categories
of
the
understanding
thus
no
doubt
we
derive
pleasure
from
what
is
symmetrical
for
this
is
constructed
in
accord
with
an
idea
of
the
understanding
kant
however
demands
more
as
a
definition
of
delight
in
art
than
the
unity
and
uniformity
of
such
an
idea
as
this
now
what
we
find
in
all
these
theses
of
kant
is
the
nonseveration
of
that
which
otherwise
is
assumed
to
be
distinct
in
consciousness
in
the
beautiful
this
separation
is
found
to
be
abolished
the
universal
and
particular
purpose
and
means
idea
and
object
completely
interpenetrate
each
other
thus
too
kant
sees
the
beauty
of
art
as
a
concurrence
in
which
the
particular
itself
is
conformable
to
the
conception
particulars
taken
alone
are
primarily
both
as
against
each
other
and
the
universal
of
a
contingent
nature
and
this
very
contingent
element
whether
we
find
it
in
sense
feeling
susceptibility
or
impulse
is
now
in
the
beauty
of
art
not
merely
subsumed
under
the
categories
of
the
understanding
and
dominated
by
the
notion
of
freedom
in
its
abstract
universality
but
united
to
the
universal
in
such
a
way
that
it
appears
inwardly
and
on
its
own
merits

thereto
by
this
means
thought
is
incorporated
in
fine
art
and
the
material
is
not
externally

by
such
thought
but
continues
to
exist
in
its
own

and

too
in
the
same
way
are
raised
to
a
power
of
spiritual
universality
and
thought
no
less
not
merely
renounces
its
hostility
to
nature
but
is
made
blithe
therein
feeling
pleasure
and

are
thereby
justified
and

and
thus
it

true
or

these
may
i
think
be
taken
to
be
the
main
results
of
the
critique
of
kant
so
far
as
they
affect
our
present
inquiry
it
constitutes
the
startingpoint
for
the
true
conception
of
the
beauty
of
art
such
a
conception
could
however
only
make
itself
effective
as
the
higher
comprehension
of
the
true
union
of
necessity
and
freedom
particular
and
universal
sensuous
and
rational
by
its
overcoming
the
defects
still
latent
in
the
previous
standpoint
it
must
in
fact
be
admitted
that
the
artistic
sense
of
a
profound
and
at
the
same
time
philosophical
spirit
anticipated
philosophy
in
the
stricter

the
important
service
of
having
broken
through
the
kantian
subjectivity
and
abstractness
of
thought
and
of
having
ventured
the
attempt
to
pass
beyond
the
same
by
comprehending
in
thought
the
principles
of
unity
and
reconciliation
as
the
truth
and
giving
artistic
realization
to
that
truth
for
schiller
in
his
aesthetic
investigations
did
not
merely
adhere
to
art
and
its
interest
unaffected
by
their
relation
to
philosophy
proper
but
he
compared
his
own
interest
in
the
beauty
of
art
in
their
due
relation
to
philosophical
principles
and
it
is
only
from
the
startingpoint
of
these
latter
and
by
their
aid
that
he
penetrated
the
profounder
nature
and
notional
concept
of
beauty
thus
we
are
conscious
that
it
was
a
feature
of
a
certain
period
of
his
productive
activity
that
he
was
actively
engaged
with
reflective
thought
more
perhaps
than
was
wholly
favourable
to
the
simple
and
direct
beauty
of
his
work
as
an
art
product
the
deliberate
character
of
abstract
reflections
and
even
the
interest
of
the
philosophical
notion
arrest
the
attention
in
several
of
his
poems
he
has
in
fact
been
made
the
subject
of
stricture
on
this
account
and
especially
his
work
has
been
blamed
and
depreciated
in
its
contrast
with
the
equable
serenity
and
straightforward
simplicity
of
goethes
ideas
and
more
objective
naturalism
but
in
this
respect
schiller
as
poet
did
but
pay
the
debt
of
his
century
a
real
ideal
evolution117
was
responsible
the
recognition
of
which
only
redounds
to
the
honour
of
this
sublime
soul
and
profound
genius
as
it
has
been
no
less
of
signal
profit
to
science
and
knowledge
this
stimulating
movement
of
science
during
the
same
epoch
also
diverted
goethe
from
the
sphere
most
distinctively
his
own
as
poet
but
just
as
schiller
was
absorbed
in
the
study
of
the
ideal
depths
of
the
mind
so
the
characteristic
predilection
of
goethe
inclined
to
the
physical
aspect
of
art
to
external
nature
such
as
animal
and
vegetable
organization
crystals
cloudformation
and
colours
to
such
scientific
inquiry
goethe
applied
his
extraordinary
powers
of
intuition
which
in
these
provinces
have
driven
off
the
field
the
theories
of
the
mere
understanding
and
their
errors
just
as
schiller
on
the
other
side
succeeded
in
demonstrating
the
idea
of
the
free
totality
of
beauty
as
against
the
theory
of
the
analytical
understanding
relative
to
volition
and
thinking
an
entire
series
of
schillers
productions
is
devoted
to
this
insight
into
the
nature
of
art
above
all
in
importance
come
the
letters
upon
aesthetic
education
in
these
letters
the
main
point
of
departure
is
that
every
individual
man
contains
within
himself
the
natural
capacity
of
an
ideal
humanity
this
genuine
human
being
is
represented
by
the
state
which
in
his
view
is
the
objective
universal
and
in
short
normal
form
in
which
the
separate
individuals
or
subjects
of
such
human
consciousness
aim
at
making
all
coalesce
and
concentrate
in
unity
there
were
then
in
his
view
two
imaginable
ways
in
which
man
in
the
temporal
process
could
thus
coalesce
with
the
human
being
in
the
notional
idea118
on
the
one
hand
this
could
be
effected
in
the
suppression
of
individuality
by
the
state
under
its
generic
idea
of
morality
law
and
intelligence119
while
on
the
other
a
similar
result
could
be
effected
by
the
individual
himself
raising
himself
to
the
level
of
such
a
generic
conception
in
other
words
by
the
man
of
the
particular
temporal
condition
ennobling
himself
to
the
level
of
the
essential
man
of
the
idea
now
in
this
view
reason
demands
unity
as
such
the
generic
attribution
nature
however
asks
for
variety
and
individuality
and
both
these
legislatures
make
a
simultaneous
claim
upon
man
confronted
with
the
conflict
of
these
antagonistic
rivals
aesthetic
education
simply
consists
in
giving
actual
effect
to
the
demand
for
their
mediation
and
reconcilement
the
aim
of
such
an
education
is
according
to
schiller
to
give
vital
form
to
inclination
the
senses
impulse
and
emotional
life
in
such
a
way
that
they
become
essentially
permeated
with
mind
and
from
the
reverse
point
of
view
that
reason
freedom
and
spirituality
come
forth
from
the
graveclothes
of
their
abstractedness
are
mated
in
union
with
the
natural
element
thus
essentially
rationalized
and
thus
receive
the
substance
of
flesh
and
blood
beauty
is
therefore
affirmed
to
be
the
conformative
unification120
of
the
rational
and
the
sensuous
and
this
union
is
pronounced
the
truly
real
this
view
of
schiller
will
in
its
general
terms
be
all
the
more
readily
recognized
in
anmuth
und
wrde121
as
also
in
his
poems
for
the
reason
that
the
praise
of
women
is
in
such
works
more
particularly
the
theme
it
was
preeminently
in
their
character
that
he
recognized
and
emphasized
the
spontaneously
present
conjunction
of
the
spiritual
and
natural
this
unity
of
the
universal
and
particular
of
freedom
and
necessity
of
spirituality
and
the
natural
element
which
schiller
conceived
with
scientific
thoroughness
as
the
principle
and
essence
of
art
and
endeavoured
indefatigably
to
call
into
actual
life
by
means
of
art
and
aesthetic
education
has
received
yet
further
recognition
in
the
idea
itself
cognized
as
the
supreme
principle
of
knowledge
and
of
existence
the
idea
in
this
sense
being
apprehended
as
sole
truth
and
reality
by
means
of
this
acknowledgment
science
in
the
philosophy
of
schelling
attained
its
absolute
standpoint
and
although
art
had
already
begun
to
assert
its
peculiar
rights
and
dignity
in
their
relation
to
the
highest
interests
of
man
it
was
only
now
that
the
notion
itself
and
the
scientific
position
of
art
were
discovered
it
was
then
that
art
waseven
if
from
a
certain
point
of
view
with
a
measure
of
perversity
which
this
is
not
the
proper
place
to
discussaccepted
with
due
reference
to
its
exalted
and
true
vocation
even
before
this
time
and
independently
winckelmann
had
been
inspired
by
his
observation
of
the
ideals
of
the
ancients
in
a
way
which
prompted
the
creation
of
a
new
sense
of
artistic
contemplation
the
disengagement
of
it
from
the
association
of
vulgar
aims
and
mere
imitation
of
nature
and
exercised
a
mighty
influence
in
the
discovery
of
the
idea
of
art
in
works
of
art
and
in
its
history
winckelmann
ought
in
fact
to
be
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
type
of
men
who
have
been
able
in
the
field
of
art
to
supply
the
mind
with
a
new
organ
and
wholly
new
methods
of
observation
his
views
have
however
exercised
less
influence
on
the
theory
and
the
scientific
knowledge
of
art
to
summarize
these
historical
antecedents
further
yet
more
briefly
in
association
with
the
renaissance
of
our
modern
philosophy
a
w
and
friedrich
von
schlegel
impelled
by
their
zest
for
novelty
and
all
that
was
either
distinctive
or
arresting
assimilated
just
so
much
of
the
philosophical
ideas
as
was
compatible
with
minds
essentially
critical
though
by
no
means
really
philosophical
in
any
strict
sense
of
the
term
neither
of
these
writers
in
fact
can
claim
the
reputation
of
being
speculative
thinkers
they
did
however
in
virtue
of
their
critical
sagacity
at
least
approach
the
standpoint
of
the
idea
and
with
the
aid
of
remarkable
boldness
of
speech
and
audacity
of
innovationto
which
however
but
very
few
ingredients
of
genuine
philosophy
contributeddirected
a
brilliant
polemic
against
views
hitherto
received
and
by
this
means
unquestionably
introduced
a
novel
standard
of
criticism
and
new
ways
of
looking
at
things
which
were
of
superior
value
to
those
they
attacked
for
the
reason
however
that
their
criticism
was
not
accompanied
with
a
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
such
a
standard
based
on
philosophical
principles
a
lack
of
definition
and
continuity
was
inseparable
from
this
standard
and
they
at
one
time
attempted
too
much
and
again
at
another
too
little
despite
therefore
of
the
fact
that
it
may
be
reckoned
to
their
credit
that
they
have
once
more
drawn
attention
to
and
emphasized
with
genuine
enthusiasm
much
hitherto
regarded
as
obsolete
and
too
little
appreciated
by
their
times
the
works
of
the
older
italian
masters
for
example
and
certain
flemish
paintings
as
also
the
niebelungen
lied
among
other
things
despite
the
fact
that
they
even
endeavoured
with
zeal
to
acquire
knowledge
of
matter
barely
known
at
all
such
as
the
poetry
and
mythology
of
india
nevertheless
they
not
only
attached
too
high
an
importance
to
the
works
of
such
a
period
but
also
themselves
committed
the
mistake
of
admiring
works
of
very
average
merit
such
as
the
comedies
of
holberg
or
of
attaching
an
absolute
value
to
what
possessed
a
purely
relative
worth
or
even
of
boldly
proving
themselves
the
enthusiasts
of
a
perverse
tendency
and
a
subordinate
standpoint
as
though
one
of
firstrate
importance
from
this
tendency
and
particularly
from
the
opinions122
and
doctrines
of
friedrich
von
schlegel
issued
in
all
its
manifold
forms
the
socalled
irony
the
idea
had
its
profounder
root
as
to
one
of
its
aspects
in
the
philosophy
of
fichte
in
so
far
as
the
principles
of
that
philosophy
were
applied
to
art
friedrich
von
schlegel
as
also
schelling
made
the
standpoint
of
fichte
their
point
of
departure
schelling
passed
wholly
beyond
it
fried
von
schlegel
elaborated
it
in
his
own
peculiar
fashion
and
then
flung
himself
free
of
it
with
reference
to
the
more
intimate
connection
of
the
doctrines
of
fichte
with
one
tendency
of
this
irony
it
is
only
necessary
to
emphasize
the
following
point
in
our
present
context
namely
this
that
fichte
posits
the
ego
as
the
absolute
principle
of
all
knowledge
reason
and
cognition
and
in
fact
posits
it
as
the
ego
which
persists
throughout
in
its
abstraction
of
pure
form
for
this
reason
this
ego
is
in
the
second
place
wholly
and
essentially
simple
and
on
the
one
hand
it
is
the
negation
of
every
particularity
attributein
short
every
contentfor
every
positive
subjectmatter123
is
overwhelmed
in
this
abstract
freedom
and
unity
on
the
other
hand
every
content
which
is
to
pass
muster
for
the
ego
is
posited
and
recognized
as
exclusively
so
in
virtue
of
the
activity
of
the
ego
whatever
is
is
only
in
virtue
of
the
ego
whatever
is
through
me
that
is
my
ego
i
am
in
turn
able
to
annihilate
now
if
we
abide
in
these
entirely
vacant
forms
which
originate
in
the
absoluteness
of
the
abstract
ego
nothing
can
then
be
regarded
as
of
value
in
itself
that
is
essentially
and
on
its
own
account124
it
is
exclusively
produced
by
the
subjectivity
of
the
ego
but
this
being
so
it
follows
that
the
ego
remains
lord
and
master
over
everything
in
no
sphere
of
morals
or
law
of
all
that
is
human
or
divine
profane
or
sacred
is
there
anything
at
all
which
would
not
in
the
first
instance
have
to
be
posited
by
the
ego
and
which
consequently
could
not
equally
be
nullified
by
the
same
agency
this
is
nothing
less
than
making
all
that
exists
on
its
own
actual
and
independent
warranty
a
mere
semblance
not
true
and
a
part
of
reality
on
account
of
itself
and
by
its
own
instrumentality
but
a
mere
show
in
virtue
of
the
ego
within
whose
power
and
caprice
it
remains
at
the
free
disposition
of
such
to
suffer
its
presence
and
to
destroy
it
stands
purely
in
the
favour
of
the
ego
which
has
attained
the
absolute
standpoint
as
essentially
the
ego
that
and
nothing
more
than
that
thirdly
the
ego
is
a
living
active
individual
and
its
life
consists
in
bringing
home
its
individuality
to
itself
no
less
than
to
others
in
giving
expression
to
itself
and
revealing
itself
among
phenomena125
for
every
man
during
his
life
endeavours
to
realize
himself
and
does
realize
himself
in
relation
to
the
beautiful
and
art
this
means
that
he
lives
the
life
of
an
artist
and
shapes
his
life
artistically
but
according
to
the
principle
now
discussed
i
live
as
artist
when
all
my
action
and
expression
whatever
in
so
far
as
it
has
to
do
with
a
content
is
for
myself
on
the
plane
of
mere
semblance
and
assumes
a
formal
content
which
is
wholly
at
my
disposal
so
i
am
not
truly
serious
either
about
this
content
or
speaking
generally
about
its
expression
and
realization
genuine
seriousness
only
issues
from
a
substantive
interest
a
subjectmatter
which
itself
possesses
a
rich
content
such
as
truth
morality
and
so
onin
other
words
from
a
content
which
as
it
stands
i
regard
as
essential
so
that
i
only
become
essential
on
my
own
account
in
so
far
as
i
have
absorbed
myself
in
such
a
content
and
have
come
to
conform
myself
to
it
in
the
entire
range
of
my
thought
and
action
at
the
standpoint
at
which
the
artist
is
the
ego
which
both
posits
and
resolves
everything
through
its
own
essential
fiat126
for
which
no
content
of
consciousness
appears
as
absolute
and
essentially
independent
but
only
as
itself
a
semblance
created
and
destroyable
such
seriousness
can
find
no
place
nothing
here
receiving
a
right
to
be
save
the
formalism
of
the
ego
no
doubt
for
others
my
selfrevealment
in
which
i
appear
to
them
may
be
taken
seriously
inasmuch
as
they
interpret
me
as
though
in
reality
i
was
in
earnest
about
the
business
but
therein
they
are
deluded
poor
born
creatures
without
the
faculty
or
the
power
to
comprehend
and
attain
to
the
height
of
my
argument
and
by
this
it
is
brought
home
to
me
that
everyone
is
not
so
free
eg
that
is
formally
free
as
to
see
in
all
which
is
usually
of
value
dignity
and
sanctity
to
mankind
merely
a
product
of
each
mans
own
possibilities
of
inclination
which
is
operative
in
permitting
him
to
determine
and
make
rich
the
course
of
his
life
or
the
reverse
it
is
thus
that
this
virtuosity
of
your
ironical
artists
life
comes
to
be
credited
as
some
godlike
geniality
for
which
every
conceivable
thing
is
a
purely
spectral
creature
to
which
the
free
creator
knowing
himself
to
be
absolutely
unattached
does
not
yoke
himself
for
he
can
ever
annihilate
the
same
no
less
than
create
it
whoever
has
reached
such
a
standpoint
of
godlike
geniality
consequently
looks
down
in
his
superior
fashion
on
all
other
mortals
they
are
ruled
out
as
narrow
and
dull
in
so
far
that
is
as
law
morals
and
the
rest
retain
for
them
a
validity
that
is
assured
obligatory
and
essential
and
the
individual
who
thus
lives
this
artist
life
which
he
does
no
doubt
associate
with
others
whether
friends
or
mistresses
or
i
know
not
what
yet
as
man
of
genius
sets
no
real
stock
on
such
relations
as
they
stand
to
his
individual
personality
and
particular
actions
all
these
are
as
nothing
in
their
contrast
to
the
universal
which
is
his
in
its
own
and
independent
warranty
namely
that
genius
which
faces
all
such
with
irony
this
is
the
universal
import
of
the
genial
godlike
irony
as
this
concentration
of
the
ego
in
itself
for
which
all
bands
are
broken
and
which
can
only
live
in
the
bliss
of
selfenjoyment
this
irony
was
the
discovery
of
herr
fried
von
schlegel
and
many
have
chattered
about
it
after
him
or
it
may
be
are
giving
us
a
fresh
sample
of
such
chatter
the
proximate
form
of
this
negativity
which
has
been
called
irony
is
then
on
the
one
hand
the
illusory
nature127
of
all
that
is
matter
of
fact
or
moral
or
of
substantive
content
the
nothingness
of
all
that
is
objective
and
of
essential
and
independent
worth
so
long
as
the
ego
adheres
to
such
a
standpoint
as
this
everything
appears
to
be
null
and
void
the
personal
subjectivity
alone
excepted
which
thereby
becomes
hollow
and
empty
and
nothing
but
conceit
itself
conversely
however
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
the
ego
may
also
fail
to
find
satisfaction
in
this
selfdelight
it
may
prove
an
insufficient
supply
to
its
craving
so
that
it
now
feels
a
thirst
for
what
is
secure
and
substantive
definite
and
essential
interests
from
a
situation
such
as
this
there
arises
unhappiness
and
the
contradiction
that
whereas
on
the
one
hand
the
individual
seeks
to
penetrate
into
truth
and
longs
after
objectivity
yet
on
the
other
he
is
unable
to
divest
himself
of
this
isolation
and
selfseclusion
is
unable
to
overcome
this
unsatisfied
and
abstract
soulinwardness
and
consequently
is
seized
with
a
fit
of
sentimental
yearning
which
we
have
also
marked
as
one
of
the
emanations
of
the
philosophy
of
fichte
the
discontent
of
this
quiescence
and
impotence
which
is
unable
either
to
act
or
set
its
hands
to
anything
lest
it
have
to
surrender
the
harmony
within
and
which
remains
unreal
and
empty
even
though
it
may
be
essentially
unflecked
despite
all
its
craving
for
reality
and
the
absoluteis
the
source
of
morbid
saintliness128
and
yearning
a
soul
that
is
fair
or
saintly
in
a
true
sense
acts
and
is
a
reality
but
all
that
yearning
and
heart
burning
is
merely
the
feeling
of
the
nothingness
of
the
empty
and
vain
personage
who
has
it
and
yet
has
not
the
power
to
cast
himself
adrift
of
this
empty
void
and
fill
himself
with
that
which
is
solid
and
substantive
in
so
far
however
as
the
irony
is
made
an
art
type
it
did
not
restrict
itself
in
giving
artistic
shape
to
the
life
and
particular
individuality
of
the
man
who
appropriated
the
irony
over
and
beyond
the
artistic
content
of
his
own
actions
etc
the
artist
had
also
to
produce
objective
works
of
art
as
the
creations
of
his
imagination
the
principle
of
such
productions
which
mainly
are
confined
to
the
domain
of
poetry
is
once
more
the
display
of
the
godlike
as
irony
the
ironical
here
however
as
genial
individuality
consists
in
the
selfannihilation
of
what
is
noble
great
and
excellent
consequently
the
independent
figures
of
art
will
also
have
to
illustrate
the
principle
of
absolute
subjectivity
and
to
do
so
by
exhibiting
all
that
is
of
human
worth
and
dignity
as
a
mere
naught
in
this
process
of
selfannihilation
this
implies
not
merely
that
we
are
not
to
take
seriously
justice
morality
and
truth
but
that
there
is
really
nothing
in
what
is
highest
and
best
in
short
it
amounts
to
this
that
irony
contradicts
and
annihilates
itself
as
manifested
in
individuals
characters
and
actions
and
consequently
is
an
irony
which
overreaches
itself129
this
mode
or
arttype
abstractly
considered
approaches
closely
to
the
principle
of
comedy
at
the
same
time
we
ought
fundamentally
to
distinguish
the
comic
from
the
ironical
as
thus
associated
for
the
comic
must
be
limited
to
the
making
null
what
is
essentially
itself
of
no
worth
that
is
to
say
a
false
and
contradictory
appearance
a
whim
for
instance
a
piece
of
egotism
a
particular
caprice
as
set
over
against
a
mighty
passion
or
even
some
principle
assumed
to
be
efficacious
or
rigid
maxims
may
be
thus
exposed
in
their
nullity
but
it
is
wholly
a
different
matter
when
what
is
in
fact
moral
and
true
generally
something
with
really
substantive
core
is
asserted
in
an
individual
and
through
the
same
as
essentially
of
no
account
such
an
individual
is
then
nugatory
and
despicable
in
his
character
and
the
weakness
and
absence
of
character
are
thus
introduced
into
the
representation
in
this
distinction
therefore
between
the
ironical
and
the
comic
the
point
of
real
importance
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
content
which
is
destroyed
they
are
in
the
case
of
irony
evil
good
for
nothing
subjects
persons
unable
to
hold
staunchly
to
their
fixed
and
important
purposes
only
too
ready
to
give
it
up
and
to
permit
its
destruction
within
them
your
irony
loves
this
irony
of
the
characterless
for
true
character
implies
on
the
one
hand
an
essential
substance
in
its
purpose
and
on
the
other
adherence
to
such
a
purpose
so
that
individuality
would
be
rifled
of
its
veritable
existence
if
it
was
compelled
to
let
it
drop
and
give
it
up
this
doggedness
and
stability
constitutes
the
keynote
of
character
cato
can
only
live
as
roman
and
republican
now
if
irony
is
made
the
keynote
of
the
representation
we
have
the
extreme
antithesis
to
art
accepted
as
the
true
principle
of
the
work
of
art
for
what
we
have
here
is
in
part
insipid
figures
in
part
figures
that
have
neither
content
nor
defined
position130
seeing
that
what
is
of
substance
in
them
is
proved
to
be
an
illusion
and
last
of
all
we
have
into
the
bargain
those
yearning
floods
and
unresolved
contradictions
of
the
soul
compositions
of
this
kind
are
not
likely
to
arouse
real
interest
and
for
this
very
reason
it
is
precisely
from
the
advocates
of
this
irony
that
we
have
the
continuous
round
of
lament
over
the
publics
want
of
critical
sense
artistic
insight
and
genius
which
of
course
cannot
appreciate
the
lofty
ways
of
such
an
irony
in
other
words
what
the
public
does
not
like
is
this
very
mediocrity
which
is
the
half
of
it
mere
trifling131
and
the
other
half
without
distinctive
character
and
it
is
right
that
these
spectrelike
moonshine
gazing
natures
are
no
favourites
it
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
this
insincerity
and
hypocrisy
is
not
in
fashion
and
that
what
men
on
the
contrary
demand
imperatively
are
full
and
veritable
interests
and
no
less
so
characters
which
remain
true
to
the
weighty
substance
at
their
core
we
may
add
as
a
matter
of
historical
interest
that
it
was
solger
and
ludwig
tieck
who
above
all
accepted
irony
as
the
highest
principle
of
art
this
is
not
the
place
to
speak
of
solger
at
the
length
he
really
merits
and
i
must
content
myself
with
a
few
general
remarks
solger
was
not
as
the
others
were
satisfied
with
a
superficial
philosophical
culture
a
truly
speculative
impulse
of
his
innermost
nature
made
him
probe
the
very
depths
of
the
philosophical
idea
and
in
doing
so
he
came
upon
the
dialectical
phase
of
the
idea
that
transition
point
which
i
call
the
infinite
absolute
negativity
the
activity
of
the
idea
in
its
negation
of
itself
as
infinite
and
universal
in
order
to
pass
into
finiteness
and
particularity
and
with
no
less
truth
once
more
in
order
to
annul
this
negation
and
in
so
doing
to
establish
again
the
universal
and
infinite
within
the
finite
and
particular
solger
did
not
get
beyond
this
negativity
and
unquestionably
it
is
a
phase132
in
the
speculative
idea
but
nevertheless
as
exclusively
conceived
in
this
dialectic
unrest
and
dissolution
of
the
infinite
no
less
than
the
finite
it
is
only
such
a
phase
contributory
and
not
as
solger
imagined
the
entire
idea
unfortunately
solgers
life
was
too
early
broken
off
to
permit
him
to
grasp
the
concrete
evolvement
of
the
philosophical
idea
in
all
it
implies
and
so
he
never
got
beyond
this
aspect
of
negativity
which
possesses
an
affinity
with
the
dissolution
by
irony
of
all
that
is
determinate
no
less
than
essentially
substantive
a
negative
movement
which
he
identified
with
the
principle
of
artistic
activity
yet
in
the
actual
conditions
of
his
life
and
with
due
reference
to
the
stability
seriousness
and
sterling
qualities
of
his
character
he
was
neither
himself
an
ironic
artist
in
the
sense
we
have
previously
described
nor
was
his
really
profound
instinct
for
true
works
of
art
a
sense
which
a
long
course
of
study
of
art
had
developed
greatly
either
of
such
an
ironical
character
so
much
we
will
venture
in
the
vindication
of
solger
whose
life
philosophy
and
actual
contributions
to
art
merit
being
wholly
kept
separate
from
the
apostles
of
irony
previously
named
with
regard
to
ludwig
tieck
his
culture
too
dates
from
that
period
in
which
jena
was
the
literary
centre
tieck
and
others
who
belonged
to
these
superior
people
are
on
excellent
terms
with
such
modes
of
expression
without
being
able
to
tell
us
much
what
they
mean
thus
tieck
always
insists
on
the
importance
of
irony
but
when
it
comes
to
delivering
judgment
on
great
works
of
art
though
his
recognition
and
description
of
their
greatness
is
no
doubt
beyond
reproach
yet
if
one
imagines
that
in
any
particular
examplelet
us
say
romeo
and
julietwe
have
the
opportunity
put
for
an
explanation
of
that
in
which
here
the
irony
consists
we
are
wide
of
the
mark
we
hear

after
the
above
introductory
observations
we
may
now
pass
on
to
the
consideration
of
our
subject
itself
we
are
however
still
within
the
introduction
and
being
so
i
do
not
propose
to
attempt
anything
more
than
indicate
by
way
of
sketch
the
main
outlines
of
the
general
course
of
the
scientific
inquiry
which
is
to
follow
it
inasmuch
however
as
we
have
referred
to
art
as
issuing
from
the
absolute
idea
itself
and
indeed
have
assigned
as
its
end
the
sensuous
presentation
of
the
absolute
itself
it
will
be
incumbent
on
us
to
conduct
this
survey
of
the
entire
field
in
such
a
way
as
at
least
to
disclose
generally
how
the
particular
parts
originate
in
the
notional
concept
of
the
beauty
of
art
we
must
therefore
attempt
to
awaken
some
idea
of
this
notion
in
its
broadest
significance
it
has
already
been
stated
that
the
content
of
art
is
the
idea
and
the
form
of
its
display
the
configuration
of
the
sensuous
or
plastic
image
it
is
further
the
function
of
art
to
mediate
these
two
aspects
under
the
reconciled
mode
of
free
totality
the
first
determinant
implied
by
this
is
the
demand
that
the
content
which
has
to
secure
artistic
representation
shall
disclose
an
essential
capacity
for
such
display
if
this
is
not
so
all
that
we
possess
is
a
defective
combination
a
content
that
independently
is
ill
adapted
to
plastic
form
and
external
presentment
is
compelled
to
accept
this
form
or
a
matter
that
is
of
itself
prosaic
in
its
character
is
driven
to
make
the
best
it
can
of
a
mode
of
presentation
which
is
antagonistic
to
its
nature
the
second
requirement
which
is
deducible
from
the
first
is
the
demand
that
the
content
of
art
should
be
nothing
essentially
abstracts
this
does
not
mean
however
that
it
should
be
merely
concrete
in
the
sense
that
the
sensuous
object
is
such
in
its
contrast
to
all
that
is
spiritual
and
the
content
of
thought
regarding
these
as
the
essentially
simple
and
abstract
everything
that
possesses
truth
for
spirit
no
less
than
as
part
of
nature
is
essentially
concrete
and
despite
its
universality
possesses
both
ideality134
and
particularity
essentially
within
it
when
we
state
for
example
of
god
that
he
is
simple
one
the
supreme
being
as
such
we
have
thereby
merely
given
utterance
to
a
lifeless
abstraction
of
the
irrational
understanding
such
a
god
as
he
is
thus
not
conceived
in
his
concrete
truth
can
supply
no
content
for
art
least
of
all
plastic
art
consequently
neither
the
jews
nor
the
turks
have
been
able
to
represent
their
god
who
is
not
even
an
abstraction
of
the
understanding
in
the
above
sense
under
the
positive
mode
in
which
christians
have
represented
him
for
in
christianity
god
is
conceived
in
his
truth
and
as
such
essentially
concrete
as
personality135
as
the
subjective
focus
of
conscious
life
or
more
accurately
defined
as
spirit
and
what
he
is
as
spirit
is
made
explicit
to
the
religious
apprehension
as
a
trinity
of
persons
which
at
the
same
time
are
in
their
independence
regarded
as
one
here
is
essentiality
universality
and
particularity
no
less
than
their
reconciled
unity
and
it
is
only
a
unity
such
as
this
which
gives
us
the
concrete
and
inasmuch
as
a
content
in
order
to
unveil
truth
at
all
must
be
of
this
concrete
character
art
makes
the
demand
for
a
like
concreteness
and
for
this
reason
that
a
purely
abstract
universal
does
not
in
itself
possess
the
property
to
proceed
to
particularity
and
external
manifestation
and
to
unity
with
itself
therein
if
then
a
sensuous
form
and
configuration
is
to
be
correspondent
with
a
true
and
therefore
concrete
content
such
must
in
the
third
place
likewise
be
as
clearly
individual
entirely
concrete
and
a
selfenclosed
unity
this
character
of
concreteness
predicable
of
both
aspects
of
art
the
content
no
less
than
the
representation
is
just
the
point
in
which
both
coalesce
and
fall
in
with
one
another
the
natural
form
of
the
human
body
is
for
example
such
a
sensuous
concrete
capable
of
displaying
spirit
in
its
essential
concreteness
and
of
adapting
itself
wholly
to
such
a
presentment
for
which
reason
we
must
quit
ourselves
of
the
idea
that
it
is
a
matter
of
mere
accident
that
an
actual
phenomenon
of
the
objective
world
is
accepted
as
the
mode
in
which
to
embody
such
a
form
coalescent
with
truth
art
does
not
lay
hold
of
this
form
either
because
it
is
simply
there
or
because
there
is
no
other
the
concrete
content
itself
implies
the
presence
of
external
and
actual
we
may
even
add
the
sensuous
appearance
but
to
make
this
possible
this
sensuous
concrete
which
is
essentially
impressed
with
a
content
that
is
open
to
mind
is
also
essentially
addressed
to
the
inward
conscious
life
and
the
external
mode
of
its
configuration
whereby
it
is
visible
to
perception
and
the
world
of
idea
has
for
its
aim
the
being
there
exclusively
for
the
soul
and
mind
of
man
this
is
the
sole
reason
that
content
and
artistic
conformation
are
dovetailed
one
into
the
other
the
purely
sensuous
concrete
that
is
external
nature
as
such
does
not
exclusively
originate
in
such
an
end
the
variously
coloured
plumage
of
birds
is
resplendent
unseen
the
notes
of
this
song
are
unheard
the
cereus136
which
only
blossoms
for
a
night
withers
away
without
any
admiration
from
another
in
the
wilderness
of
the
southern
forests
and
these
forests
receptacles
themselves
of
the
most
beautiful
and
luxuriant
vegetation
with
the
richest
and
most
aromatic
perfumes
perish
and
collapse
in
like
manner
unenjoyed
the
work
of
art
has
no
such
nave
and
independent
being
it
is
essentially
a
question
an
address
to
the
responding
soul
of
man
an
appeal
to
affections
and
intelligence
although
the
endowment
by
art
of
sensuous
shape
is
not
in
this
respect
accidental
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
the
highest
mode
of
grasping
the
spiritually
concrete
thought
is
a
higher
mode
of
presentment
than
that
of
the
sensuous
concrete
though
abstract
in
a
relative
sense
yet
it
must
not
be
onesided
but
concrete
thinking
in
order
to
be
true
and
rational
the
extent
to
which
a
definite
content
possesses
for
its
appropriate
form
sensuous
artistic
representation
or
essentially
requires
in
virtue
of
its
nature
a
higher
and
more
spiritual
embodiment
is
a
question
of
difference
exemplified
at
once
if
we
compare
the
greek
gods
with
god
as
conceived
under
christian
ideas
the
greek
god
is
not
abstract
but
individual
and
is
in
close
association
with
the
natural
human
form
the
christian
god
is
also
no
doubt
a
concrete
personality
but
under
the
mode
of
pure
spiritual
actuality
who
is
cognized
as
spirit
and
in
spirit137
his
medium
of
determinate
existence
is
therefore
essentially
knowledge
of
the
mind
and
not
external
natural
shape
by
means
of
which
his
representation
can
only
be
imperfect
and
not
in
the
entire
depths
of
his
idea
or
notional
concept
inasmuch
however
as
it
is
the
function
of
art
to
represent
the
idea
to
immediate
vision
in
sensuous
shape
and
not
in
the
form
of
thought
and
pure
spirituality
in
the
strict
sense
and
inasmuch
as
the
value
and
intrinsic
worth
of
this
presentment
consists
in
the
correspondence
and
unity
of
the
two
aspects
that
is
the
idea
and
its
sensuous
shape
the
supreme
level
and
excellence
of
art
and
the
reality
which
is
truly
consonant
with
its
notion
will
depend
upon
the
degree
of
intimacy
and
union
with
which
idea
and
configuration
appear
together
in
elaborated
fusion
the
higher
truth
consequently
is
spiritual
content
which
has
received
the
shape
adequate
to
the
conception
of
its
essence
and
this
it
is
which
supplies
the
principle
of
division
for
the
philosophy
of
art
for
before
the
mind
can
attain
to
the
true
notion
of
its
absolute
essence
it
is
constrained
to
traverse
a
series
of
stages
rooted
in
this
very
notional
concept
and
to
this
course
of
stages
which
it
unfolds
to
itself
corresponds
a
coalescent
series
immediately
related
therewith
of
the
plastic
types
of
art
under
the
configuration
whereof
mind
as
artspirit
presents
to
itself
the
consciousness
of
itself138
this
evolution
within
the
artspirit
has
further
itself
two
sides
in
virtue
of
its
intrinsic
nature
first
that
is
to
say
the
development
is
itself
a
spiritual
and
universal
one
in
other
words
there
are
the
definite
and
comprehensive
views
of
the
world139
in
their
series
of
gradations
which
give
artistic
embodiment
to
the
specific
but
widely
embracing
consciousness
of
nature
man
and
god
secondly
this
ideal
or
universal
artdevelopment
has
to
provide
for
itself
immediate
existence
and
sensuous
configuration
and
the
definite
modes
of
this
artactualization
in
the
sensuous
medium
are
themselves
a
totality
of
necessary
distinctions
in
the
realm
of
artthat
is
to
say
they
are
the
particular
types
of
art
no
doubt
the
types
of
artistic
configuration
on
the
one
hand
are
in
respect
to
their
spirituality
of
a
general
character
and
not
restricted
to
any
one
material
and
the
sensuous
existence
is
similarly
itself
of
varied
multiplicity
of
medium
inasmuch
however
as
this
material
potentially
possesses
precisely
as
the
mind
or
spirit
does
the
idea
for
its
inward
soul
or
significance
it
follows
that
a
definite
sensuous
involves
with
itself
a
closer
relation
and
secret
bond
of
association
with
the
spiritualdistinctions
and
specific
types
of
artistic
embodiment140
relatively
to
these
points
of
view
our
philosophy
will
divided
into
three
fundamental
parts
first
we
have
a
general
part
it
has
for
its
content
object
the
universal
idea
of
fine
art
conceived
here
as
the
ideal
together
with
the
more
elaborated
relation
under
which
it
is
placed
respectively
to
nature
and
human
artistic
production
secondly
we
have
evolved
from
the
notional
concept
of
the
beauty
of
art
a
particular
part
in
so
far
as
the
essential
distinctions
which
this
idea
contains
in
itself
are
unfolded
in
a
graduated
series
of
particular
modes
of
configuration141
thirdly
there
results
a
final
part
which
has
to
consider
the
particularized
content
of
fine
art
itself
it
consists
in
the
advance
of
art
to
the
sensuous
realization
of
its
shapes
and
its
consummation
in
a
system
of
the
several
arts
and
their
genera
and
species
2
in
respect
to
the
first
and
second
of
these
divisions
it
is
important
to
recollect
in
order
to
make
all
that
follows
intelligible
that
the
idea
viewed
as
the
beautiful
in
art
is
not
the
idea
in
the
strict
sense
that
is
as
a
metaphysical
logic
apprehends
it
as
the
absolute
it
is
rather
the
idea
as
carried
into
concrete
form
in
the
direction
of
express
realization
and
as
having
entered
into
immediate
and
adequate
unity
with
such
reality
for
the
idea
as
such
although
it
is
both
potentially
and
explicitly
true
is
only
truth
in
its
universality
and
not
as
yet
presented
in
objective
embodiment
the
idea
as
fine
art
however
is
the
idea
with
the
more
specific
property
of
being
essentially
individual
reality
in
other
words
an
individual
configuration
of
reality
whose
express
function
it
is
to
make
manifest
the
ideain
its
appearance
this
amounts
to
the
demand
that
the
idea
and
its
formative
configuration
as
concrete
realization
must
be
brought
together
under
a
mode
of
complete
adequacy
the
idea
as
so
conceived
a
reality
that
is
tosay
moulded
in
conformity
with
the
notional
concept
of
the
idea
is
the
ideal
the
problem
of
such
consonancy
might
in
the
first
instance
be
understood
in
the
wholly
formal
sense
that
the
idea
might
be
any
idea
so
long
as
the
actual
shape
it
matters
not
what
the
shape
might
be
represented
this
particular
idea
and
no
other
in
that
case
however
the
required
truth
of
the
ideal
is
a
fact
simply
interchangeable
with
mere
correctness
a
correctness
which
consists
in
the
expression
of
any
significance
in
a
manner
adapted
to
it
provided
that
its
meaning
is
thereby
directly
discoverable
in
the
form
the
ideal
however
is
not
to
be
thus
understood
according
to
the
standard
or
test
of
its
own
nature
any
content
whatever
can
receive
adequate
presentation
but
it
does
not
necessarily
thereby
possess
a
claim
to
be
the
fine
art
of
the
ideal
nay
more
in
comparison
with
ideal
beauty
the
presentation
will
even
appear
defective
and
in
this
connection
we
may
once
for
all
observethough
actual
proof
is
reserved
to
a
later
stagethat
the
defects
of
a
work
of
art
are
not
invariably
to
be
attributed
to
defects
of
executive
skill
defectiveness
of
form
arises
also
from
defectiveness
of
content
the
chinese
hindoos
and
egyptians
for
example
in
their
artistic
images
sculptured
deities
and
idols
never
passed
beyond
a
formless
condition
or
a
definition
of
shape
that
was
vicious
and
false
and
were
unable
to
master
true
beauty
and
this
was
so
for
the
reason
that
their
mythological
conceptions
the
content
and
thought
of
their
works
of
art
were
still
essentially
indeterminate
or
only
determinate
in
a
false
sense
did
not
in
fact
attain
to
a
content
which
was
absolute
in
itself
viewed
in
this
sense
the
excellence
of
works
of
art
is
so
much
the
greater
in
the
degree
that
their
content
and
thought
is
ideal
and
profound
and
in
affirming
this
we
have
not
merely
in
our
mind
the
degree
of
executive
mastery
displayed
in
the
grasp
and
imitation
of
natural
form
as
we
find
it
in
the
objective
world
for
in
certain
stages
of
the
artistic
consciousness
and
its
reproductive
effects
the
desertion
and
distortion
of
the
conformations
of
nature
is
not
so
much
due
to
unintentional
technical
inexperience
or
lack
of
ability
as
it
is
to
deliberate
alteration
which
originates
in
the
mental
content
itself
and
is
demanded
by
the
same
from
this
point
of
view
there
is
therefore
imperfect
art
which
both
in
technical
and
other
respects
may
be
quite
consummate
in
its
own
specific
sphere
yet
if
tested
with
the
true
notion
of
art
and
the
ideal
can
only
appear
as
defective
only
in
the
highest
art
are
the
idea
and
the
artistic
presentation
truly
consonant
with
one
another
in
the
sense
that
the
objective
embodiment
of
the
idea
is
in
itself
essentially
and
as
realized
the
true
configuration
because
the
content
of
the
idea
thus
expressed
is
itself
in
truth
the
genuine
content
it
is
appertinent
to
this
as
already
noted
that
the
idea
must
be
defined
in
and
through
itself
as
concrete
totality
thereby
essentially
possessing
in
itself
the
principle
and
standard
of
its
particularization
and
definition
as
thus
manifested
objectively
for
example
the
christian
imagination
will
only
be
able
to
represent
god
in
human
form
and
with
mans
means
of
spiritual
expression
because
it
is
herein
that
god
himself
is
fully
known
in
himself
as
mind
or
spirit
determinacy
is
as
it
were
the
bridge
to
phenomenal
presence
where
this
determinacy
is
not
totality
derived
from
the
idea
itself
where
the
idea
is
not
conceived
as
that
which
is
selfdefinitive
and
selfdifferentiating
it
remains
abstract
and
possesses
its
definition
and
with
it
the
principle
for
the
particular
mode
of
embodiment
adapted
to
itself
not
within
itself
but
as
something
outside
it
and
owing
to
this
the
idea
is
also
still
abstract
and
the
configuration
it
assumes
is
not
as
yet
posited
by
itself
the
idea
however
which
is
essentially
concrete
carries
the
principle
of
its
manifestation
in
itself
and
is
thereby
the
means
of
its
own
free
manifestation
thus
it
is
only
the
truly
concrete
idea
that
is
able
to
evoke
the
true
embodiment
and
this
appropriate
coalescence
of
both
is
the
ideal
3
but
inasmuch
as
in
this
way
the
idea
is
concrete
unity
this
unity
can
only
enter
the
artistic
consciousness
by
the
expansion
and
further
mediation
of
the
particular
aspects
of
the
idea
and
it
is
through
this
evolution
that
the
beauty
of
art
receives
a
totality
of
particular
stages
and
forms
therefore
after
we
have
considered
fine
art
in
its
essence
and
on
its
own
account
we
must
see
how
the
beautiful
in
its
entirety
breaks
up
into
its
particular
determinations
this
gives
as
our
second
part
the
doctrine
of
the
types
of
art
the
origin
of
these
types
is
to
be
found
in
the
varied
ways
under
which
the
idea
is
conceived
as
the
content
of
art
it
is
by
this
means
that
a
distinction
in
the
mode
of
form
under
which
it
manifests
itself
is
conditioned
these
types
are
therefore
simply
the
different
modes
of
relation
which
obtain
between
the
idea
and
its
configuration
relations
which
emanate
from
the
idea
itself
and
thereby
present
us
with
the
general
basis
of
division
for
this
sphere
for
the
principle
of
division
must
always
be
found
in
the
notional
concept
the
particularization
and
division
of
which
it
is
we
have
here
to
consider
three
relations
of
the
idea
to
its
external
process
of
configuration
a
first
the
origin
of
artistic
creation
proceeds
from
the
idea
when
being
itself
still
involved
in
defective
definition
and
obscurity
or
in
vicious
and
untrue
determinacy
it
becomes
embodied
in
the
shapes
of
art
as
indeterminate
it
does
not
as
yet
possess
in
itself
that
individuality
which
the
ideal
demands
its
abstract
character
and
onesidedness
leaves
its
objective
presentment
still
defective
and
contingent
consequently
this
first
type
of
art
is
rather
a
mere
search
after
plastic
configuration
than
a
power
of
genuine
representation
the
idea
has
not
as
yet
found
the
formative
principle
within
itself
and
therefore
still
continues
to
be
the
mere
effort
and
strain
to
find
it
we
may
in
general
terms
describe
this
form
as
the
symbolic
type
of
art
the
abstract
idea
possesses
in
it
its
external
shape
outside
itself
in
the
purely
material
substance
of
nature
from
which
the
shaping
process
proceeds
and
to
which
in
its
expression
it
is
entirely
yoked
natural
objects
are
thus
in
the
first
instance
left
just
as
they
are
while
at
the
same
time
the
substantive
idea
is
imposed
upon
them
as
their
significance
so
that
their
function
is
henceforth
to
express
the
same
and
they
claim
to
be
interpreted
as
though
the
idea
itself
was
present
in
them
a
rationale
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
external
objects
of
reality
do
essentially
possess
an
aspect
in
which
they
are
qualified
to
express
a
universal
import
but
as
a
completely
adequate
coalescence
is
not
yet
possible
all
that
can
be
the
outcome
of
such
a
relation
is
an
abstract
attribute
as
when
a
lion
is
understood
to
symbolize
strength
on
the
other
hand
this
abstractness
of
the
relation
makes
present
to
consciousness
no
less
markedly
how
the
idea
stands
relatively
to
natural
phenomena
as
an
alien
and
albeit
it
expatiates
in
all
these
shapes
having
no
other
means
of
expression
among
all
that
is
real
and
seeks
after
itself
in
their
unrest
and
defects
of
genuine
proportion
yet
for
all
that
it
finds
them
inadequate
to
meet
its
needs
it
consequently
exaggerates
natural
shapes
and
the
phenomena
of
nature
in
every
degree
of
indefinite
and
limitless
extension
it
flounders
about
in
them
like
a
drunkard
and
seethes
and
ferments
doing
violence
to
their
truth
with
the
distorted
growth
of
unnatural
shapes
and
strives
vainly
by
the
contrast
hugeness
and
splendour
of
the
forms
accepted
to
exalt
the
phenomena
to
the
plane
of
the
idea
for
the
idea
is
here
still
more
or
less
indeterminate
and
unadaptable
while
the
objects
of
nature
are
wholly
definite
in
their
shape
hence
on
account
of
the
incompatibility
of
the
two
sides
of
ideality
and
objective
form
to
one
another
the
relation
of
the
idea
to
the
other
becomes
a
negative
one
the
former
being
in
its
nature
ideal
is
unsatisfied
with
such
an
embodiment
and
posits
itself
as
its
inward
or
ideally
universal
substance
under
a
relation
of
sublimity
over
and
above
all
this
inadequate
superfluity
of
natural
form
in
virtue
of
this
sublimity
the
natural
phenomena
of
course
and
the
human
form
and
event
are
accepted
and
left
simply
as
they
are
but
at
the
same
time
recognized
as
unequal
to
their
significance
which
is
exalted
far
above
all
earthly
content
these
features
constitute
in
general
terms
the
character
of
the
primitive
artistic
pantheism
of
the
east
which
on
the
one
hand
charges
the
meanest
objects
with
the
significance
of
the
absolute
idea
or
on
the
other
compels
natural
form
by
doing
violence
to
its
structure
to
express
its
worldideas
and
in
consequence
it
becomes
bizarre
grotesque
and
deficient
in
taste
or
turns
the
infinite
but
abstract
freedom
of
the
substantive
idea
contemptuously
against
all
phenomenal
existence
as
alike
nugatory
and
evanescent
by
such
means
the
significance
cannot
be
completely
presented
in
the
expression
and
despite
all
straining
and
endeavour
the
final
inadequacy
of
plastic
configuration
to
idea
remains
insuperable
such
may
be
accepted
as
the
first
type
of
artsymbolic
art
with
its
yearning
its
fermentation
its
mystery
and
sublimity
b
in
the
second
type
of
art
which
we
propose
to
call
classical
the
twofold
defect
of
symbolic
art
is
annulled
now
the
symbolic
configuration
is
imperfect
because
first
the
idea
here
only
enters
into
consciousness
in
abstract
determinacy
or
indeterminateness
and
secondly
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
coalescence
of
import
with
embodiment
can
only
throughout
remain
defective
and
in
its
turn
also
wholly
abstract
the
classical
arttype
solves
both
these
difficulties
it
is
in
fact
the
free
and
adequate
embodiment
of
the
idea
in
the
shape
which
according
to
its
notional
concept
is
uniquely
appropriate
to
the
idea
itself
the
idea
is
consequently
able
to
unite
in
free
and
completely
assonant
concord
with
it
for
this
reason
the
classical
type
of
art
is
the
first
to
present
us
with
the
creation
and
vision
of
the
complete
ideal
and
to
establish
the
same
as
realized
fact
the
conformability
however
of
notion
and
reality
in
the
classical
type
ought
not
to
be
taken
in
the
purely
formal
sense
of
the
coalescence
of
a
content
with
its
external
form
any
more
than
this
was
possible
in
the
case
of
the
ideal
otherwise
every
copy
from
nature
and
every
kind
of
portrait
every
landscape
flower
scene
and
so
forth
which
form
the
aim
of
the
presentment
would
at
once
become
classical
in
virtue
of
the
fact
of
the
agreement
it
offers
between
such
content
and
form
in
classical
art
on
the
contrary
the
characteristic
feature
of
the
content
consists
in
this
that
it
is
itself
concrete
idea
and
as
such
the
concrete
spiritual
for
it
is
only
that
which
pertains
to
spirit
which
is
veritable
ideality142
to
secure
such
a
content
we
must
find
out
that
in
nature
which
on
its
own
account
is
that
which
is
essentially
and
explicitly
appropriate
to
the
spiritual
it
must
be
the
original
notion
itself143
which
has
invented
the
form
for
concrete
spirituality
and
now
the
subjective
notionin
the
present
case
the
spirit
of
arthas
merely
discovered
it
and
made
it
as
an
existence
possessed
of
natural
shape
concordant
with
free
and
individual
spirituality
such
a
configuration
which
the
idea
essentially
possesses
as
spiritual
and
indeed
as
individually
determinate
spirituality
when
it
must
perforce
appear
as
a
temporal
phenomenon
is
the
human
form
personification
and
anthropomorphism
have
frequently
been
abused
as
a
degradation
of
the
spiritual
but
art
in
so
far
as
its
function
is
to
bring
to
vision
the
spiritual
in
sensuous
guise
must
advance
to
such
anthropomorphism
inasmuch
as
spirit
is
only
adequately
presented
to
perception
in
its
bodily
presence
the
transmigration
of
souls
in
this
respect
an
abstract
conception144
and
physiology
ought
to
make
it
one
of
its
fundamental
principles
that
life
has
necessarily
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
to
proceed
to
the
human
form
for
the
reason
that
it
is
alone
the
visible
phenomenon
adequate
to
the
expression
of
intelligence
the
human
bodily
form
then
is
employed
in
the
classical
type
of
art
not
as
purely
sensuous
existence
but
exclusively
as
the
existence
and
natural
shape
appropriate
to
mind
it
has
therefore
to
be
relieved
of
all
the
defective
excrescences
which
adhere
to
it
in
its
purely
physical
aspect
and
from
the
contingent
finiteness
of
its
phenomenal
appearance
the
external
shape
must
in
this
way
be
purified
in
order
to
express
in
itself
the
content
adequate
for
such
a
purpose
and
furthermore
along
with
this
that
the
coalescence
of
import
and
embodiment
may
be
complete
the
spirituality
which
constitutes
the
content
must
be
of
such
a
character
that
it
is
completely
able
to
express
itself
in
the
natural
form
of
man
without
projecting
beyond
the
limits
of
such
expression
within
the
sensuous
and
purely
physical
sphere
of
existence
under
such
a
condition
spirit
is
at
the
same
time
defined
as
particular
the
spirit
or
mind
of
man
not
as
simply
absolute
and
eternal
in
this
latter
case
it
is
only
capable
of
asserting
and
expressing
itself
as
intellectual
being145
out
of
this
latter
distinction
arises
in
its
turn
the
defect
which
brings
about
the
dissolution
of
the
classical
type
of
art
and
makes
the
demand
for
a
third
and
higher
form
namely
the
romantic
type
c
the
romantic
type
of
art
annuls
the
completed
union
of
the
idea
and
its
reality
and
occurs
if
on
a
higher
plane
to
the
difference
and
opposition
of
both
sides
which
remained
unovercome
in
symbolic
art
the
classical
type
of
art
no
doubt
attained
the
highest
excellence
of
which
the
sensuous
embodiment
of
art
is
capable
the
defect
such
as
it
is
is
due
to
the
defect
which
obtains
in
art
itself
throughout
the
limitations
of
its
entire
province
that
is
to
say
the
limitation
consists
in
this
that
art
in
general
and
agreeably
to
its
fundamental
idea
accepts
for
its
object
spirit
the
notion
of
which
is
infinite
concrete
universality
under
the
guise
of
sensuously
concrete
form
in
the
classical
type
it
sets
up
the
perfected
coalescence
of
spiritual
and
sensuous
existence
as
adequate
conformation
of
both
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
in
this
fusion
mind
itself
is
not
represented
agreeably
to
its
true
notional
concept
mind
is
the
infinite
subjectivity
of
the
idea
which
as
absolute
inwardness146
is
not
capable
of
freely
expanding
in
its
entire
independence
so
long
as
it
remains
within
the
mould
of
the
bodily
shape
fused
therein
as
in
the
existence
wholly
congenial
to
it
to
escape
from
such
a
condition
the
romantic
type
of
art
once
more
cancels
that
inseparable
unity
of
the
classical
type
by
securing
a
content
which
passes
beyond
the
classical
stage
and
its
mode
of
expression
this
content
if
we
may
recall
familiar
ideasis
coincident
with
what
christianity
affirms
to
be
true
of
god
as
spirit
in
contrast
to
the
greek
faith
in
gods
which
forms
the
essential
and
most
fitting
content
of
classical
art
in
greek
art
the
concrete
ideal
substance
is
potentially
but
not
as
fully
realized
the
unity
of
the
human
and
divine
nature
a
unity
which
for
the
very
reason
that
it
is
purely
immediate
and
not
wholly
explicit
is
manifested
without
defect
under
an
immediate
and
sensuous
mode
the
greek
god
is
the
object
of
nave
intuition
and
sensuous
imagination
his
shape
is
therefore
the
bodily
form
of
man
the
sphere
of
his
power
and
his
being
is
individual
and
individually
limited
and
in
his
opposition
to
the
individual
person147
is
an
essence
and
a
power
with
whom
the
inward
life
of
soul148
is
merely
potentially
in
unity
but
does
not
itself
possess
this
unity
as
inward
subjective
knowledge
the
higher
stage
is
the
knowledge
of
this
implied
unity
which
in
its
latency
the
classical
arttype
receives
as
its
content
and
is
able
to
perfectly
represent
in
bodily
shape
this
elevation
of
mere
potentiality
into
selfconscious
knowledge
constitutes
an
enormous
difference
it
is
nothing
less
than
the
infinite
difference
which
for
example
separates
man
generally
from
the
animal
creation
man
is
animal
but
even
in
his
animal
functions
he
is
not
restricted
within
the
potential
sphere
as
the
animal
is
but
becomes
conscious
of
them
learns
to
understand
them
and
raises
themas
for
instance
the
process
of
digestioninto
selfconscious
science
by
this
means
man
dissolves
the
boundaries
of
his
merely
potential
immediacy
in
virtue
of
the
very
fact
that
he
knows
himself
to
be
animal
he
ceases
to
be
merely
animal
and
as
mind
is
endowed
with
selfknowledge
if
then
in
this
way
the
unity
of
the
human
and
divine
nature
which
in
the
previous
stage
was
potential
is
raised
out
of
this
immediate
into
a
selfconscious
unity
it
follows
that
the
genuine
medium
for
the
reality
of
this
content
is
no
longer
the
sensuous
and
immediate
existence
of
what
is
spiritual
that
is
the
physical
body
of
man
but
the
selfaware
inner
life
of
soul
itself
now
it
is
christianityfor
the
reason
that
it
presents
to
mind
god
as
spirit
and
not
as
the
particular
individual
spirit
but
as
absolute
in
spirit
and
in
truthwhich
steps
back
from
the
sensuousness
of
imagination
into
the
inward
life
of
reason
and
makes
this
rather
than
bodily
form
the
medium
and
determinate
existence
of
its
content
so
also
the
unity
of
the
human
and
divine
nature
is
a
conscious
unity
exclusively
capable
of
realization
by
means
of
spiritual
knowledge
and
in
spirit
the
new
content
secured
thereby
is
consequently
not
indefeasibly
bound
up
with
the
sensuous
presentation
as
the
mode
completely
adequate
but
is
rather
delivered
from
this
immediate
existence
which
has
to
be
hypostatized
as
a
negative
factor
overcome
and
reflected
back
into
the
spiritual
unity
in
this
way
romantic
art
must
be
regarded
as
art
transcending
itself
albeit
within
the
boundary
of
its
own
province
and
in
the
form
of
art
itself
we
may
therefore
briefly
summarize
our
conclusion
that
in
this
third
stage
the
object
of
art
consists
in
the
free
and
concrete
presence
of
spiritual
activity149
whose
vocation
it
is
to
appear
as
such
a
presence
or
activity
for
the
inner
world
of
conscious
intelligence
in
consonance
with
such
an
object
art
cannot
merely
work
for
sensuous
perception
it
must
deliver
itself
to
the
inward
life
which
coalesces
with
its
object
simply
as
though
this
were
none
other
than
itself150
in
other
words
to
the
intimacy
of
soul
to
the
heart
the
emotional
life
which
as
the
medium
of
spirit
itself
essentially
strives
after
freedom
and
seeks
and
possesses
its
reconciliation
only
in
the
inner
chamber
of
spirit
it
is
this
inward
or
ideal
world
which
constitutes
the
content
of
the
romantic
sphere
it
will
therefore
necessarily
discover
its
representation
as
such
inner
idea
or
feeling
and
in
the
show
or
appearance
of
the
same
the
world
of
the
soul
and
intelligence
celebrates
its
triumph
over
the
external
world
and
actually
in
the
medium
of
that
outer
world
makes
that
victory
to
appear
by
reason
of
which
the
sensuous
appearance
sinks
into
worthlessness
on
the
other
hand
this
type
of
art
like
every
other
needs
an
external
vehicle
of
expression
as
already
stated
the
spiritual
content
has
here
withdrawn
from
the
external
world
and
its
immediate
unity
into
its
own
world
the
sensuous
externality
of
form
is
consequently
accepted
and
represented
as
in
the
symbolic
type
as
unessential
and
transient
furthermore
the
subjective
finite
spirit
and
volition
is
treated
in
a
similar
way
a
treatment
which
even
includes
the
idiosyncrasies
or
caprice
of
individuals
character
action
or
the
particular
features
of
incident
and
plot
the
aspect
of
external
existence
is
committed
to
contingency
and
handed
over
to
the
adventurous
action
of
imagination
whose
caprice
is
just
as
able
to
reflect
the
facts
given
as
they
are151
as
it
can
change
the
shapes
of
the
external
world
into
a
medley
of
its
own
invention
and
distort
them
to
mere
caricature
for
this
external
element
has
no
longer
its
notion
and
significance
in
its
own
essential
province
as
in
classical
art
it
is
now
discovered
in
the
emotional
realm
and
this
is
manifested
in
the
medium
of
that
realm
itself
rather
than
in
the
external
and
its
form
of
reality
and
is
able
to
secure
or
to
recover
again
the
condition
of
reconciliation
with
itself
in
every
accident
in
all
the
chance
circumstance
that
falls
into
independent
shape
in
all
misfortune
and
sorrow
nay
in
crime
itself
hence
it
comes
about
that
the
characteristics
of
symbolic
art
its
indifference
incompatibility
and
severance
of
idea
from
configurative
expression
are
here
reproduced
once
more
if
with
essential
difference
and
this
difference
consists
in
the
fact
that
in
romantic
art
the
idea
whose
defectiveness
in
the
case
of
the
symbol
brought
with
it
the
defect
of
external
form
has
to
display
itself
as
spirit
and
in
the
medium
of
soullife
as
essentially
selfcomplete
and
it
is
to
complete
fundamentally
this
higher
perfection
that
it
withdraws
itself
from
the
external
element
it
can
in
short
seek
and
consummate
its
true
reality
and
manifestation
nowhere
but
in
its
own
domain
this
we
may
take
to
be
in
general
terms
the
character
of
the
symbolic
classical
and
romantic
types
of
art
which
in
fact
constitute
the
three
relations
of
the
idea
to
its
embodiment
in
the
realm
of
human
art
they
consist
in
the
aspiration
after
the
attainment
and
transcendency
of
the
ideal
viewed
as
the
true
concrete
notion
of
beauty
4
in
contrast
to
these
two
previous
divisions
of
our
subject
the
third
part
presupposes
the
notional
concept
of
the
ideal
and
the
universal
arttypes
it
in
other
words
consists
in
their
realization
through
specific
sensuous
media
we
have
consequently
no
longer
to
deal
with
the
inner
or
ideal
evolution
of
the
beauty
of
art
in
conformity
with
its
widest
and
most
fundamental
determinations
what
we
have
now
before
us
to
consider
is
how
these
ideal
determinants
pass
into
actual
existence
how
they
are
distinguishable
in
their
external
aspect
and
how
they
give
an
independent
and
a
realized
shape
to
every
element
implied
in
the
evolution
of
this
idea
of
beauty
as
a
work
of
art
and
not
merely
as
a
universal
type
now
it
is
the
peculiar
differences
immanent
in
the
idea
of
beauty
which
are
carried
over
by
it
into
external
existence
for
this
reason
in
this
third
fundamental
division
these
general
arttypes
must
themselves
supply
the
basic
principle
for
the
articulation
and
definition
of
the
particular
arts
or
to
put
the
same
thing
another
way
the
several
species
of
art
possess
in
themselves
the
same
essential
differences
which
we
have
already
become
acquainted
with
as
the
universal
arttypes
external
objectivity
however
to
which
these
types
are
subjected
in
a
sensuous
and
consequently
specific
material
necessitates
the
differentiation
of
these
types
into
diverse
and
independent
modes
of
realization
in
other
words
those
of
particular
arts
each
general
type
discovers
its
determinate
character
in
one
determinate
external
material
or
medium
in
which
its
adequate
presentation
is
secured
under
the
manner
it
prescribes
but
from
another
point
of
view
these
types
of
art
inasmuch
as
their
definition
is
none
the
less
consistent
with
the
fact
of
the
universality
of
their
typical
import
break
through
the
boundaries
of
their
specific
realization
in
some
definite
artspecies
and
achieve
an
existence
in
other
arts
no
less
although
their
position
in
such
is
of
subordinate
importance
for
this
reason
albeit
the
particular
arts
belong
specifically
to
one
of
these
general
arttypes
respectively
the
adequate
external
embodiment
whereof
they
severally
constitute
yet
this
does
not
prevent
them
each
after
its
own
mode
of
external
configuration
from
representing
the
totality
of
these
arttypes152
to
summarize
then
in
this
third
principal
division
we
are
dealing
with
the
beauty
of
art
as
it
unveils
itself
in
a
world
of
realized
beauty
by
means
of
the
arts
and
their
creations
the
content
of
this
world
is
the
beautiful
and
the
true
beautiful
as
we
have
seen
is
spiritual
being
in
concrete
form
the
ideal
or
apprehended
with
still
more
intimacy
it
is
the
absolute
mind
and
truth
itself
this
region
of
divine
truth
artistically
presented
to
sensuous
vision
and
emotion
forms
the
centre
of
the
entire
world
of
art
it
is
the
independent
free
and
divine
image153
which
has
completely
appropriated
the
externality
of
form
and
medium
and
now
wears
them
simply
as
the
means
of
its
selfmanifestation
inasmuch
however
as
the
beautiful
is
unfolded
here
as
objective
reality
and
in
this
process
is
differentiated
into
particular
aspects
and
phases
this
centre
posits
its
extremes
as
realized
in
their
peculiar
actuality
in
antithetical
relation
to
itself
thus
one
of
these
extremes
consists
of
an
objectivity
as
yet
devoid
of
mind
which
we
may
call
the
natural
environment
of
god
here
the
external
element
when
it
receives
form
remains
as
it
was
and
does
not
possess
its
spiritual
aim
and
content
in
itself
but
in
another154
the
other
extreme
is
the
divine
as
inward
something
known
as
the
manifold
particularized
subjective
existence
of
deity
it
is
the
truth
as
operative
and
vital
in
sense
soul
and
intelligence
of
particular
persons
which
does
not
persist
as
poured
forth
into
its
mould
of
external
shape
but
returns
into
the
inward
life
of
individuals
the
divine
is
under
such
a
mode
at
once
distinguishable
from
its
pure
manifestation
as
godhead
and
passes
itself
thereby
into
the
variety
of
particularization
which
belongs
to
every
kind
of
particular
subjective
knowledge
feeling
perception
and
emotion
in
the
analogous
province
of
religion
with
which
art
at
its
highest
elevation
is
immediately
connected
we
conceive
the
same
distinction
as
follows
first
we
imagine
the
natural
life
on
earth
in
its
finitude
as
standing
on
one
side
but
then
secondly
the
human
consciousness
accepts
god
for
its
object
in
which
the
distinction
between
objectivity
and
subjectivity
falls
away
then
finally
we
advance
from
god
as
such
to
the
devotion
of
the
community
that
is
to
god
as
he
is
alive
and
present
in
the
subjective
consciousness
these
three
fundamental
modifications
present
themselves
in
the
world
of
art
in
independent
evolution
a
the
first
of
the
particular
arts
with
which
according
to
their
fundamental
principle
we
have
to
start
is
architecture
considered
as
a
fine
art
its
function
consists
in
so
elaborating
the
external
material
of
inorganic
nature
that
the
same
becomes
intimately
connected
with
spirit
as
an
artistic
and
external
environment
its
medium
is
matter
itself
as
an
external
object
a
heavy
mass
that
is
subject
to
mechanical
laws
and
its
forms
persist
as
the
forms
of
inorganic
nature
coordinated
with
the
relations
of
the
abstract
understanding
such
as
symmetry
and
so
forth
in
this
material
and
in
these
forms
the
ideal
is
incapable
of
realization
as
concrete
spirituality
and
the
reality
thus
presented
remains
confronting
the
idea
as
an
external
fabric
with
which
it
enters
into
no
fusion
or
has
only
entered
so
far
as
to
establish
an
abstract
relation
and
it
is
in
consequence
of
this
that
the
fundamental
type
of
the
art
of
building
is
that
of
symbolism
architecture
is
in
fact
the
first
pioneer
on
the
highway
toward
the
adequate
realization
of
godhead
in
this
service
it
is
put
to
severe
labour
with
objective
nature
that
it
may
disengage
it
by
its
effort
from
the
confused
growth
of
finitude
and
the
distortions
of
contingency
by
this
means
it
levels
a
space
for
the
god
informs
his
external
environment
and
builds
him
his
temple
as
a
fit
place
for
the
concentration
of
spirit
and
its
direction
to
the
absolute
objects
of
intelligent
life
it
raises
an
enclosure
for
the
congregation
of
those
assembled
as
a
defence
against
the
threatening
of
the
tempest
against
rain
the
hurricane
and
savage
animals
it
in
short
reveals
the
will
thus
to
assemble
and
although
under
an
external
relation
yet
in
agreement
with
the
principles
of
art
a
significance
such
as
this
it
can
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
import
into
its
material
and
its
forms
in
proportion
as
the
determinate
content
of
its
fabric
which
is
the
object
of
its
operations
and
effort
is
more
or
less
significant
is
more
concrete
or
more
abstract
more
profound
in
penetrating
its
own
essential
depth
or
more
obscure
and
superficial
indeed
architecture
may
in
this
respect
proceed
so
far
in
the
execution
of
such
a
purpose
as
to
create
an
adequate
artistic
existence
for
such
an
ideal
content
in
its
very
forms
and
material
in
doing
so
however
it
has
already
passed
beyond
its
peculiar
province
and
is
diverted
into
the
stage
immediately
above
it
of
sculpture
for
the
boundary
of
sculpture
lies
precisely
in
this
that
it
retains
the
spiritual
as
an
inward
being
which
persists
in
direct
contrast
to
the
external
embodiment
of
architecture
it
can
consequently
merely
point
to
that
which
is
absorbed
in
soullife
as
to
something
external
to
itself
b
nevertheless
as
above
explained
the
external
and
inorganic
world
is
purified
by
architecture
it
is
coordinated
under
symmetrical
laws
and
made
cognate
with
mind
and
as
a
result
the
temple
of
god
the
house
of
his
community
stands
before
us
into
this
temple
in
the
second
place
the
god
himself
enters
in
the
lightningflash
of
individuality
which
smites
its
way
into
the
inert
mass
permeating
the
same
with
its
presence
in
other
words
the
infinite155
and
no
longer
purely
symmetrical
form
belonging
to
intelligence
brings
as
it
were
to
a
focus
and
informs
the
shape
in
which
it
is
most
at
home
this
is
the
task
of
sculpture
in
so
far
as
in
it
the
inward
life
of
spirit
to
which
the
art
of
architecture
can
merely
point
away
to
makes
its
dwelling
within
the
sensuous
shape
and
its
external
material
and
to
the
extent
that
these
two
sides
come
into
plastic
communion
with
one
another
in
such
a
manner
that
neither
is
predominant
sculpture
receives
as
its
fundamental
type
the
classical
artform
for
this
reason
the
sensuous
element
on
its
own
account
admits
of
no
expression
here
which
is
not
affected
by
spiritual
affinities156
just
as
conversely
sculpture
can
reproduce
with
completeness
no
spiritual
content
which
does
not
maintain
throughout
adequate
presentation
to
perception
in
bodily
form
what
sculpture
in
short
has
to
do
is
to
make
the
presence
of
spirit
stand
before
us
in
its
bodily
shape
and
in
immediate
union
therewith
at
rest
and
in
blessedness
and
this
form
has
to
be
made
vital
by
means
of
the
content
of
spiritual
individuality
the
external
sensuous
material
is
consequently
no
longer
elaborated
either
in
conformity
with
its
mechanical
quality
alone
as
a
mass
of
weight
nor
in
shapes
of
the
inorganic
world
simply
nor
in
entire
indifference
to
colour
etc
it
is
carried
into
the
ideal
forms
of
the
human
figure
and
we
may
add
in
the
completeness
of
all
three
spatial
dimensions
in
other
words
and
relatively
to
such
a
process
we
must
maintain
for
sculpture
that
in
it
the
inward
or
ideal
content
of
spirit
are
first
revealed
in
their
eternal
repose
and
essential
selfstability
to
such
repose
and
unity
with
itself
there
can
only
correspond
that
external
shape
which
itself
persists
in
such
unity
and
repose
and
this
condition
is
satisfied
by
configuration
viewed
in
its
abstract
spatiality157
the
spirit
which
sculpture
represents
is
that
which
is
essentially
sound
not
broken
up
in
the
play
of
chance
conceits
and
passions
and
for
this
reason
its
external
form
also
is
not
dissolved
in
the
manifold
variety
of
appearance
but
exhibits
itself
under
this
one
presentment
only
as
the
abstraction
of
space
in
the
totality
of
its
dimensions
assuming
then
that
the
art
of
architecture
has
executed
its
temple
and
the
hand
of
sculpture
has
placed
therein
the
image
of
the
god
we
have
in
the
third
place
to
assume
the
community
of
the
faithful
as
confronting
the
god
thus
presented
to
vision
in
the
wide
chambers
of
his
dwellingplace
now
this
community
is
the
spiritual
reflection
into
its
own
world
of
that
sensuous
presence
the
subjective
and
inward
animating
life
of
soul
in
its
union
with
which
both
for
the
artistic
content
and
the
external
material
which
manifests
it
the
determining
principle
may
be
identified
with
particularization
in
varied
shapes
and
qualities
individualization
and
the
life
of
soul158
which
they
imply
the
downright
and
solid
fact
of
unity
the
god
possesses
in
sculpture
breaks
up
into
the
multiplicity
of
a
world
of
particular
souls159
whose
union
is
no
longer
sensuous
but
wholly
ideal
here
for
the
first
time
god
himself
is
revealed
as
veritably
spiritviz
the
spirit
revealed
in
his
community
here
at
last
he
is
seen
apprehended
as
this
moving
toandfro
as
this
alternation
between
his
own
essential
unity
and
his
realization
in
the
knowledge
of
individual
persons
and
that
separation
which
it
involves
as
also
in
the
universal
spiritual
being160
and
union
of
the
many
in
such
a
community
god
is
disengaged
from
the
abstraction
of
his
unfolded
selfseclusion
and
selfidentity
no
less
than
from
the
immediate
absorption
in
bodily
shape
in
which
he
is
presented
by
sculpture
he
is
in
a
word
lifted
into
the
actual
sphere
of
spiritual
existence
and
knowledge
into
the
reflected
appearance
whose
manifestation
is
essentially
inward
and
the
life
of
heart
and
soul
thereby
the
higher
content
is
now
the
nature
of
spirit
and
that
in
its
ultimate
or
absolute
shape
but
at
the
same
time
the
separation
to
which
we
have
alluded
displays
this
as
particular
spiritual
being
a
specific
emotional
life
moreover
for
the
reason
that
the
main
thing
here
is
not
the
untroubled
repose
of
the
god
in
himself161
but
his
manifestation
simply
the
being
which
is
for
another
selfrevealment
in
fact
it
follows
that
on
the
plane
we
have
now
reached
all
the
varied
content
of
human
subjectivity
in
its
vital
movement
and
activity
whether
viewed
as
passion
action
or
event
or
more
generally
the
wide
realm
of
human
feeling
volition
and
its
discontinuance
become
one
and
all
for
their
own
sake
objects
of
artistic
representation
agreeably
with
such
a
content
the
sensuous
element
of
art
has
likewise
to
show
itself
potentially
adapted
to
such
particularization
and
the
display
of
such
an
inward
content
of
heart
and
mind
media
of
this
description
are
supplied
by
colour
musical
tones
and
finally
in
sound
as
mere
sign
for
ideal
perceptions
and
conceptions
and
we
further
obtain
the
means
of
realizing
with
the
use
of
such
media
a
content
of
this
kind
in
the
arts
of
painting
music
and
poetry
throughout
this
sphere
the
sensuous
medium
is
found
to
be
essentially
disparate
in
itself
and
throughout
posited162
as
ideal
in
this
way
it
responds
in
the
highest
degree
to
the
fundamentally
spiritual
content
of
art
and
the
coalescence
of
spiritual
significance
and
sensuous
material
attains
a
more
intimate
union
than
was
possible
either
in
architecture
or
sculpture
at
the
same
time
such
a
union
is
necessarily
more
near
to
soullife
leaning
exclusively
to
the
subjective
side
of
human
experience
one
which
in
so
far
as
form
and
content
are
thus
constrained
to
particularization
and
to
posit
their
result
as
ideal
can
only
be
actually
effected
at
the
expense
of
the
objective
universality
of
the
content
as
also
of
the
fusion
with
the
immediately
sensuous
medium163
the
arts
then
which
are
lifted
into
a
higher
strain
of
ideality
abandoning
as
they
do
the
symbolism
of
architecture
and
the
classical
ideal
of
sculpture
accept
their
predominant
type
from
the
romantic
artform
and
these
are
the
arts
most
fitted
to
express
its
mode
of
configuration
they
are
however
a
totality
of
arts
because
the
romantic
type
is
itself
essentially
the
most
concrete
c
the
articulation
of
this
third
sphere
of
the
particular
arts
may
be
fixed
as
follows

the
first
art
which
comes
next
to
sculpture
is
that
of
painting
it
avails
itself
for
a
medium
of
its
content
and
the
plastic
configuration
of
the
same
of
visibility
as
such
to
the
extent
that
it
is
differentiated
in
its
own
nature
in
other
words
is
defined
in
the
continuity
of
colour
no
doubt
the
material
of
architecture
and
sculpture
is
likewise
both
visible
and
coloured
it
is
however
not
as
in
painting
visibility
in
its
pure
nature
not
the
essentially
simple
light
which
by
its
differentiating
of
itself
in
its
opposition
to
darkness
and
in
association
with
that
darkness
gives
rise
to
colour164
this
quality
of
visibility
made
essentially
ideal165
and
treated
as
such
no
longer
either
requires
as
in
architecture
the
abstractly
mechanical
qualities
of
mass
as
appropriate
to
materials
of
weight
nor
as
is
the
case
with
sculpture
the
complete
dimensuration
of
spatial
condition
even
when
concentrated
into
organic
forms
the
visibility
and
the
making
apparent
which
belong
to
painting
possess
differences
of
quality
under
a
more
ideal
modethat
is
in
the
specific
varieties
of
colourwhich
liberates
art
from
the
objective
totality
of

of
painting
the

existence

the
most
exalted
embodiment
of
mind
to
the
most

even
for

to
form
part
of
such
artistic
display
provided
only
that
we
have
some
reference
to
conscious
life
which
makes
it
akin
to
human
thought
and
emotion166

the
second
art
which
continues
the
further
realization
of
the
romantic
type
and
forms
a
distinct
contrast
to
painting
is
that
of
music
its
medium
albeit
still
sensuous
yet
proceeds
into
still
profounder
subjectivity
and
particularization
we
have
here
too
the
deliberate
treatment
of
the
sensuous
medium
as
ideal
and
it
consists
in
the
negation
and
idealization
into
the
isolated
unity
of
a
single
point167
the
indifferent
external
collocation
of
space168
whose
complete
appearance
is
retained
by
painting
and
deliberately
feigned
in
its
completeness
this
isolated
point
viewed
as
this
process
of
negation
is
an
essentially
concrete
and
active
process
of
cancellation
within
the
determinate
substance
of
the
material
medium
viewed
that
is
as
motion
and
vibration
of
the
material
object
within
itself
and
in
its
relation
to
itself
such
an
inchoate
ideality
of
matter
which
no
longer
appears
under
the
form
of
space
but
as
temporal
ideality169
is
sound
or
tone
we
have
here
the
sensuous
set
down
as
negated
and
its
abstract
visibility
converted
into
audibility
in
other
words
sound
liberates
the
ideal
content
from
its
fetters
in
the
material
substance
this
earliest170
secured
inwardness
of
matter
and
impregnation
of
it
with
soullife
supplies
the
medium
for
the
intimacy
and
soul
of
spirititself
as
yet
indefinitepermitting
as
it
does
the
echo
and
reverberation
of
mans
emotional
world
through
its
entire
range
of
feelings
and
passions
in
this
way
music
forms
the
centre
of
the
romantic
arts
just
as
sculpture
represents
the
midway
point
of
arrest
between
architecture
and
the
arts
of
the
romantic
subjectivity
thus
too
it
forms
the
point
of
transition
between
the
abstract
spatial
sensuousness
of
painting
and
the
abstract
spirituality
of
poetry
music
carries
within
itself
like
architecture
and
in
contrast
to
the
emotional
world
simply
and
its
inward
selfseclusion
a
relation
of
quantity
conformable
to
the
principles
of
the
understanding
and
their
modes
of
coordinated
configuration171

we
must
look
for
our
third
and
most
spiritual
type
of
artistic
presentation
among
the
romantic
arts
in
that
of
poetry
the
supreme
characteristic
of
poetry
consists
in
the
power
with
which
it
brings
into
vassalage
of
the
mind
and
its
conceptions
the
sensuous
element
from
which
music
and
painting
began
to
liberate
art
for
sound
the
only
remaining
external
material
retained
by
poetry
is
in
it
no
longer
the
feeling
of
the
sonorous
itself
but
is
a
mere
sign
without
independent
significance
and
it
is
moreover
a
sign
of
idea
which
has
become
essentially
concrete
and
not
merely172
of
indefinite
feeling
and
its
subtle
modes
and
gradations
and
this
is
how
sound
develops
into
the
word
as
essentially
articulate
voice
whose
intention
it
is
to
indicate
ideas
and
thoughts
the
purely
negative
moment
to
which
music
advanced
now
asserts
itself
as
the
wholly
concrete
point
the
point
which
is
mind
itself
the
selfconscious
individual
which
produces
from
itself
the
infinite
expansion
of
its
ideas
and
unites
the
same
with
the
temporal
condition
of
sound
yet
this
sensuous
element
which
was
still
in
music
immediately
united
to
emotion
is
in
poetry
separated
from
the
content
of
consciousness
mind
in
short
here
determines
this
content
for
its
own
sake
and
apart
from
all
else
into
the
content
of
idea
to
express
such
idea
it
no
doubt
avails
itself
of
sound
but
employs
it
merely
as
a
sign
without
independent
worth
or
substance
thus
viewed
the
sound
here
may
be
just
as
well
reproduced
by
the
mere
letter
for
the
audible
like
the
visible
is
here
reduced
to
a
mere
indication
of
mind173
for
this
reason
the
true
medium
of
poetical
representation
is
the
poetical
imagination
and
the
intellectual
presentation
itself
and
inasmuch
as
this
element
is
common
to
all
types
of
art
it
follows
that
poetry
is
a
common
thread
through
them
all
and
is
developed
independently
in
each
poetry
is
in
short
the
universal
art
of
the
mind
which
has
become
essentially
free
and
which
is
not
fettered
in
its
realization
to
an
externally
sensuous
material
but
which
is
creatively
active
in
the
space
and
time
belonging
to
the
inner
world
of
ideas
and
emotion
yet
it
is
precisely
in
this
its
highest
phase
that
art
terminates
by
transcending
itself
it
is
just
here
that
it
deserts
the
medium
of
a
harmonious
presentation
of
mind
in
sensuous
shape
and
passes
from
the
poetry
of
imaginative
idea
into
the
prose
of
thought
such
we
may
accept
as
the
articulate
totality
of
the
particular
arts
they
are
the
external
art
of
architecture
the
objective
art
of
sculpture
and
the
subjective
arts
of
painting
music
and
poetry
many
other
classifications
than
these
have
been
attempted
for
a
work
of
art
presents
such
a
wealth
of
aspects
that
it
is
quite
possible
as
has
frequently
been
the
case
to
make
first
one
and
then
another
the
basis
of
division
for
instance
you
may
take
the
sensuous
medium
simply
architecture
may
then
be
viewed
as
a
kind
of
crystallization
sculpture
as
the
organic
configuration
of
material
in
its
sensuous
and
spatial
totality
painting
as
the
coloured
surface
and
line
while
in
music
space
as
such
passes
over
into
the
point
or
moment
of
time
replete
with
content
in
itself
until
we
come
finally
to
poetry
where
the
external
medium
is
wholly
suppressed
into
insignificance
or
again
these
differences
have
been
viewed
with
reference
to
their
purely
abstract
conditions
of
space
and
time
such
abstract
divisions
of
works
of
art
may
as
their
medium
also
may
be
consequentially
traced
in
their
characteristic
features
they
cannot
however
be
worked
out
as
the
final
and
fundamental
principle
because
such
aspects
themselves
derive
their
origins
from
a
higher
principle
and
must
therefore
fall
into
subordination
thereto
this
higher
principle
we
have
discovered
in
the
types
of
artsymbolic
classical
and
romanticwhich
are
the
universal
stages
or
phases
of
the
idea
of
beauty
itself
their
relation
to
the
individual
arts
in
their
concrete
manifestation
as
embodiment
is
of
a
kind
that
these
arts
constitute
the
real
and
positive
existence
of
these
general
arttypes
for
symbolic
art
attains
its
most
adequate
realization
and
most
pertinent
application
in
architecture
in
which
it
expatiates
in
the
full
import
of
its
notion
and
is
not
as
yet
depreciated
as
it
were
into
the
merely
inorganic
nature
dealt
with
by
some
other
art
the
classical
type
of
art
finds
its
unfettered
realization
on
the
other
hand
in
sculpture
treating
architecture
merely
as
the
enclosure
which
surrounds
it
and
being
unable
to
elaborate
painting
and
music
into
the
wholly
adequate174
forms
of
its
content
finally
the
romantic
arttype
is
supreme
in
the
products
of
painting
and
music
and
likewise
in
poetical
composition
as
their
preeminent
and
unconditionally
adequate
modes
of
expression
poetry
is
however
conformable
to
all
types
of
the
beautiful
and
its
embrace
reaches
them
all
for
the
reason
that
the
poetic
imagination
is
its
own
proper
medium
and
imagination
is
essential
to
every
creation
of
beauty
whatever
its
type
may
be
to
sum
up
then
what
the
particular
arts
realize
in
particular
works
of
art
are
according
to
their
fundamental
conception
simply
the
universal
types
which
constitute
the
selfunfolding
idea
of
beauty
it
is
as
the
external
realization
of
this
idea
that
the
wide
pantheon
of
art
is
being
raised
and
the
architect
and
builder
thereof
is
the
spirit
of
beauty
as
it
gradually
comes
to
selfcognition
and
to
complete
which
the
history
of
the
world
will
require
its
evolution
of
centuries

i
have
translated
this
by
the
expression
fine

because
hegel
in
the
opening
of
the
introduction
makes
the
expression
interchangeable
with
schne
kunst
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
recollected
that
the
emphasis
here
is
even
more
on
beauty
than
the
fact
that
it
is
the
beauty
of
human
art
and
it
is
for
this
reason
i
presume
that
professor
bosanquet
translates
it
here
artistic

the
only
objection
i
have
to
make
to
this
apart
from
hegels
words
i
have
referred
to
is
that
the
expression
artistic
beauty
is
sometimes
used
to
signify
beauty
that
is
capable
of
being
expressed
by
art
of
course
that
is
excluded
from
hegels
use
of
the
term
he
means
the
beauty
of
artistic
work

no

appears
to
me
the

by
that
i

he
understands
the

a
sense

is

it

me

the
general

is
plain
enough
every

starts
from
the

whether

not
it
does

relatively
true

i

in

in

discuss
the
profounder
import
of

his
statements
are
not
perhaps
wholly
free
from
inconsistency

he

previously
said
that

from

the

it
was
not

to
do

also
some
of

was
not
his

actually
mentions
the

from
the

is
built

we

it

two
parallels

before
the

ends
are
regarded
as
one
that
is
to
say
the
general
critical
sense
is
contrasted
with
the
critique
of
particular
works
of
art
and
further
the
defect
of
that
general
sense
in
its
neglect
of
universal
principles
is
further
contrasted
with
the
way
the
specific
critique
deals
with

appears
to
be
that
the

hearing

sight
this
at
least
holds
good
as
against
taste
but
at
least
it
may
be
questioned
i
think
whether
the
sense
of
touch
may
not
be
the
source
of
artistic
enjoyment
certainly
in
the
case
of
the
blind
and
the
sense
of
smell
at
least
leaves
objects
as
they
are
and
some
may
contend
that
it
is
a
source
of
enjoyment
of
the
beauty
of
nature
hegel
would
reply
of
course
that
no
works
of
human
art
are
enjoyed
by
such
means
the
main
ground
is
however
that
sight

hearing
are
the
senses
closest

should

that
phantasie

enters
into

the

me
even

when

it
not
merely
ignores
the
indispensable
presence
of
imagination
in
the
pioneers
of
science
but
appears
to
myself
to
confuse
talent
as
the
natural
gift
of
a
man
with
the
mode
in
which
it
is
exercised
in
presenting

naturally
an

is

he
hardly
approaches

professor
bosanquet
in
his
note
on
this
passage
expresses
the
opinion
that
hegel
when
he
writes
thus
is
referring
to
the
selfconsciousness
of
individual
human
beings
as
constituting
and
reflecting
on
an
ideal
unity
between
them
this
no
doubt
as
he
suggests
does
put
a
somewhat
unnatural
meaning
on
the
word
person
or
subjekt
no
doubt
there
is
a
sense
in
which
we
can
ascribe
personality
to
a
state
or
nation
in
the
concrete
unity
of
its
life
but
while
admitting
that
unity
such
as
this
which
is
not
sensuous
but
ideal
can
be
effective
and
actual
i
find
it
difficult
to
conclude
that
hegel
did
himself
hold
that
the
unity
of
the
divine
being
was
merely
identical
with
the
unity
or
totality
of
concrete
human
life
as
reflected
upon
by
single
individuals
how
far
is
human
life
as
a
whole
on
this
earth
a
unity
or
totality
at
all
that
question
has
been
discussed
by
professor
bradley
and
others
with
very
different
conclusions
nay
how
far
does
human
existence
itself
exhaust
the
actually
present
realization
or
selfrealization
of
selfconscious
spirit
or
intelligence
whatever
maybe
the
wisest
answer
to
such
and
other
questions
i
can
hardly
think
that
hegel
would
have
accepted
professor

interpretation
as
completely
adequate

should
myself

is
the
three
relations

which
hegel
calls
symbolic

romantic
perhaps
this
is
what
professor
bosanquet
means

in
that
case
it
does
not

the

as
contrasted

the

certainly
untenable
what

the

may
unquestionably
be
most
intimately

apart
from
the

i
think
it
is
clear
he
underrates
all
that
is
implied
in
the
difference
between
the
musical
expression
of
poetry
as
contrasted
even
with
the
sonorous
language
of
mere
prose
a
further
question
upon
which
more
doubt
is
permissible
is
how
far
the
actual
script
in
written
or
printed
letters
is
not
entitled
to
be
regarded
as
at
least
in
part
the
sensuous
medium
no
doubt
the
poem
is
not
dependent
upon
it
as
a
painting
is
upon
colour
or
the
canvas
which
supports
it
for
it
may
be
recited
but
at
least
it
is
practically
dependent
upon
it
for
its
preservation
the
point
may
very
possibly
appear
however
as
nugatory
or
entirely
unimportant
beside
the
question
whether
the
medium
of
the
art
is
not
really
imaginative
idea
rather
than
articulate
speech

to

religion
and
philosophy
the
conclusion
of
the
introduction
brings
within
sight
the
more
methodical
exposition
of
our
subject
it
will
in
the
first
place
be
useful
as
a
point
of
departure
for
a
true
philosophy
of
the
beautiful
to
sum
up
shortly
the
position
of
fine
art
in
its
general
relation
to
the
real
no
less
than
to
emphasize
the
salient
features
which
distinguish
the
philosophy
of
fine
art
from
other
philosophical
inquiries
a
with
this
object
in
view
we
will
first
enumerate
the
diverse
attempts
which
have
been
made
to
apprehend
the
beautiful
in
thought
placing
each
in
the
order
which
will
best
assist
a
critical
verdict
we
have
already
contributed
something
to
this
in
our
introduction
and
moreover
we
may
add
that
the
mere
inquiry
what
others
have
contributed
either
rightly
or
wrongly
to
our
subject
at
least
with
the
hope
of
ascertaining
something
really
instructive
to
an
exposition
which
claims
to
be
wholly
scientific
will
not
assist
us
much
so
far
from
this
being
so
we
must
preface
our
remarks
with
the
admission
that
in
the
opinion
of
many
the
beautiful
for
the
very
reason
that
it
is
the
beautiful
does
not
admit
of
such
intellectual
apprehension
is
in
short
no
object
intelligible
to
human
thought
to
such
a
thesis
we
must
for
the
presentin
our
response
to
those
who
at
this
time
of
day
contend
that
all
truth
is
ultimately
incomprehensible
and
only
the
finiteness
of
the
phenomenal
and
the
contingent
matters
of
temporal
existence
is
within
our
mental
graspreply
that
it
is
precisely
truth
and
truth
alone
which
is
to
be
thus
comprehended
and
for
this
reason
that
it
possesses
the
absolute
notion
or
more
succinctly
the
idea
for
its
basic
support
now
beauty
is
no
other
than
a
particular
determination
under
which
the
true
is
expressed
and
revealed
to
us
and
it
lies
open
to
the
fullest
comprehension
of
thought
in
so
far
as
such
can
equip
it
with
the
armoury
of
the
concrete
notion
it
is
quite
true
that
no
idea
has
suffered
more
severely
in
our
own
time
from
misconceptions
than
this
which
we
call
the
notion
in
its
fullest
explication
one
is
only
too
often
misunderstood
to
mean
a
determination
which
is
abstract
and
one
sided
or
at
least
a
conception
of
the
analytical
understanding
as
thus
understood
neither
the
totality
of
truth
nor
the
idea
of
beauty
as
a
concrete
whole
can
be
brought
home
to
a
thinking
consciousness
but
the
idea
of
beauty
as
we
have
already
observed
and
shall
seek
to
make
more
intelligible
as
we
proceed
is
no
such
abstraction
of
the
mind
rather
it
may
be
defined
as
the
absolute
notion
in
its
selfevolved
concreteness
or
still
more
specifically
defined
the
absolute
idea
b
and
further
we
cannot
more
succinctly
define
the
absolute
idea
in
the
above
use
of
the
expression
than
by
saying
it
is
mind
spirit
and
we
may
add
that
the
mind
thus
referred
to
is
not
mind
regarded
as
finite
that
is
subject
to
the
conditions
and
limitations
of
senseperception
but
the
universal
and
absolute
intelligence175
which
out
of
its
own
free
activity
determines
truth
in
the
profoundest
signification
of
the
term
to
the
ordinary
consciousness
of
everyday
life
the
object
of
perception
no
doubt
breaks
away
from
mind
as
though
our
thought
stood
in
opposition
to
nature
which
receives
from
us
a
validity
equal
at
least
to
the
consciousness
which
perceives
it
but
in
this
way
of
looking
at
nature
and
the
conscious
subject
as
two
neighbours
set
over
against
one
another
in
territories
equally
selfsubsistent
it
is
only
the
finite
and
limited
mind
not
that
which
it
is
as
an
infinite
substance
and
in
its
notional
truth
which
is
apprehended
nature
is
not
thus
to
be
set
over
against
absolute
mind
either
as
conjoint
with
a
sphere
of
the
real
of
equal
worth
or
as
an
independent
boundary
thereto
rather
the
aspect
which
nature
appears
to
hold
in
this
respect
is
that
which
mind
or
spirit
itself
sets
up
and
of
which
it
becomes
the
product
as
a
nature
in
which
limit
and
boundary
are
themselves
determining
constituents
in
fact
mind
in
its
absolute
or
infinite
substance
can
only
be
apprehended
as
this
free
activity
which
is
manifested
in
selfdevelopment
through
differentiation
this
object
this
other
through
which
such
differentiation
proceeds
is
regarded
in
such
opposition
as
nature
but
as
the
object
of
intelligence
it
is
quite
as
much
indebted
to
mind
for
the
free
gift
and
fulness
of
its
own
essential
substance
we
must
therefore
conceive
nature
as
herself
containing
in
potency
the
absolute
idea
she
is
that
idea
in
apparent
shape
which
mind
in
its
synthetic
power
posits
as
the
object
opposed
to
itself
she
is
so
far
a
product
a
creation
the
truth
of
nature
therefore
is
simply
the
determination
by
mind
of
its
own
substance
its
ideality
and
power
of
determination
through
a
process
which
no
doubt
begins
with
a
separation
of
itself
into
two
factors
which
apparently
negate
each
other
but
which
by
the
very
activity
of
such
negation
and
separation
passes
beyond
the
contradiction
it
implies
to
a
unity
which
heals
the
fracture
instead
of
finding
ourelves
opposed
to
a
limit
and
a
barrier
we
have
a
totality
in
which
the
parts
which
opposed
each
other
are
fused
together
by
the
free
universality
of
mind
this
ideality
in
other
words
this
infinite
power
of
determination176
is
that
which
constitutes
the
profound
notion
of
minds
subjectivity
as
subjectivity
mind
is
in
the
first
instance
merely
nature
mind
or
spirit
that
is
not
explicitly
unfolded
mind
which
has
not
arrived
at
the
grasp
of
its
true
notion
nature
is
here
set
up
in
opposition
to
mind
not
as
an
object
which
itself
has
created
but
as
one
whose
limits
it
fails
to
overcome
an
object
moreover
which
as
assumed
to
be
already
subsisting
in
independence
mind
remains
alongside
of
in
the
internal
seclusion
of
knowledge
and
volition
and
is
only
able
to
constitute
the
other
side
of
nature
the
finiteness
of
scientific
theory
no
less
than
that
of
practical
life
is
to
be
found
in
this
limited
mode
of
consciousness
where
intelligence
is
restricted
to
the
use
of
finite
categories
and
the
formal
ought
in
the
realization
of
ethical
perfection177
we
find
here
as
we
have
pointed
out
was
the
case
with
nature
that
the
phenomenal
is
not
adequate
to
the
essential
truth
of
that
which
appears
what
we
receive
is
still
the
confusing
medley
of
abilities
passions
intentions
opinions
and
talents
which
no
sooner
make
themselves
felt
than
they
are
displaced
working
at
cross
purposes
as
often
against
as
on
the
side
of
each
other
in
a
strife
between
volition
opinion
and
reflection
which
brings
to
the
surface
every
phase
of
fortuitous
experience
in
all
its
confusing
variety
it
is
the
standpoint
of
the
entirely
finite
temporal
contradictory
and
for
that
reason
transitory
unsatisfied
and
unreconciled
spirit
for
the
satisfactions
which
obtain
in
such
a
consciousness
through
the
finiteness
which
inseparably
clings
to
its
entire
outlook
itself
so
limited
and
confused
are
of
a
purely
relative
and
isolated
validity
it
is
inevitable
that
consciousness
volition
and
thought
should
make
an
effort
to
rise
above
this
condition
and
seek
for
the
universality
unity
and
satisfaction
which
it
eventually
finds
in
the
infinite
substance
of
spirit
and
its
truth
this
unity
and
satisfaction
to
which
mind
is
carried
forward
by
the
impulse
of
its
own
ideal
activity
transmuting
the
raw
material
of
its
finite
conditions
constitutes
the
first
revelation
of
that
which
the
world
of
appearances
is
under
a
more
notional
grasp
of
it
mind
grasps
its
finiteness
as
the
negation
of
its
own
essential
substance
and
is
aware
of
its
infinity
and
this
essential
truth
of
the
finite
mind
is
the
absolute
mind
or
spirit
in
this
form
of
selfconsciousness
mind
is
merely
actualized
as
absolute
negativity
the
element
of
finitude
which
it
confronts
is
apprehended
as
such
and
annulled
in
this
the
highest
sphere
of
its
activity
mind
becomes
the
object
of
volition
the
absolute
itself
becomes
the
object
of
mind
spirit
as
selfconsciousness
differentiates
itself
as
the
knowing
subject
from
the
absolute
spirit
as
the
object
of
knowledge
mind
in
this
latter
sense
in
contradistinction
from
mind
which
has
not
overcome
the
conditions
of
finite
perception
may
therefore
be
defined
as
a
finite
mind
in
possession
of
the
principle
of
differentiation
from
its
true
object
in
the
higher
and
more
speculative
consideration
of
truth
however
it
is
the
absolute
mind
itself
which
in
order
to
unfold
explicitly
the
knowledge
of
itself
essentially
becomes
a
principle
of
differentiation
to
itself
and
thereby
posits
the
finitude
of
mind
within
which
it
becomes
for
itself
absolute
object
of
the
knowledge
of
itself
it
is
now
absolute
mind
within
the
ideal
community178
which
belongs
to
it
the
actual
absolute
of
itself
in
the
form
of
mind
and
knowledge179
this
is
in
fact
the
startingpoint
of
the
philosophy
of
fine
art
for
the
idea
of
fine
art
is
neither
the
logical
idea
absolute
thought
that
is
which
develops
itself
in
the
medium
of
its
freest
activity
nor
is
it
the
idea
of
nature
apprehended
under
more
finite
categories
its
province
is
rather
that
of
mind
untrammelled
by
either
the
judgments
or
the
actions
of
the
finite
spirit
c
the
realm
of
fine
art
is
the
realm
of
absolute
spirit
we
can
but
briefly
indicate
the
reason
why
this
is
so
a
fully
philosophical
proof
belongs
rather
to
treatises
which
immediately
deal
with
those
questions
of
philosophy
we
have
noticed
already
by
which
we
mean
those
which
treat
of
logic
whose
content
as
above
explained
is
that
of
the
absolute
idea
or
the
philosophy
of
nature
or
lastly
the
philosophy
of
mind
in
its
determinate
spheres
of
finitude
for
in
these
sciences
the
object
is
to
show
not
merely
how
the
logical
idea
presupposes
the
objective
particularity
of
nature
as
a
vehicle
to
its
determinate
existence
but
also
how
it
is
capable
of
passing
from
such
externality
to
mind
and
finally
of
freeing
itself
from
all
the
finitude
that
clings
to
it
and
of
attaining
to
spirit
in
its
eternal
concreteness
and
truth
from
such
a
point
of
view
which
is
also
applicable
to
art
when
regarded
in
all
the
fulness
of
worth
it
in
truth
implies
we
are
justified
in
associating
it
with
the
selfsame
province
which
belongs
to
religion
and
speculative
philosophy
in
every
direction
in
which
mind
or
spirit
becomes
identical
with
the
absolute
mind
it
frees
itself
from
the
restricting
limits
of
its
positive
existence
and
while
liberating
itself
from
the
contingent
relations
which
pertain
to
it
in
its
temporal
existence
and
the
finite
content
of
its
objects
and
interests
is
made
aware
of
and
discloses
the
entire
wealth
of
reality
it
contains
it
may
be
of
service
here
to
expand
more
completely
the
position
which
art
thus
occupies
in
its
relation
respectively
to
the
life
of
nature
and
spirit
a
survey
of
the
entire
field
of
human
existence
presents
to
the
ordinary
consciousness
of
mankind
the
widest
variety
of
interests
and
means
of
satisfaction
there
is
in
the
first
instance
the
complex
system
of
purely
physical
necessities
to
the
satisfaction
of
which
the
whole
economy
of
industrial
enterprise
through
all
its
complicated
tissue
of
commerce
merchandize
and
technical
crafts
is
actively
pursued
if
we
raise
the
level
of
our
review
to
a
more
spiritual
range
we
are
confronted
with
the
world
where
rights
are
established
and
enforced
the
world
of
legislative
enactment
family
life
division
of
social
classes
in
a
word
the
concrete
living
organism
of
the
state
and
more
than
this
there
is
the
religious
want
which
asserts
itself
in
the
hearts
of
particular
men
and
women
and
finds
its
satisfaction
in
the
life
of
a
church
finally
there
is
the
manysided
and
intricately
specialized
activity
of
scientific
research
the
organized
effort
to
integrate
all
knowledge
and
the
comprehension
which
that
knowledge
implies
in
one
allembracing
system
within
this
latter
are
comprised
the
activities
of
the
fine
arts
the
interest
that
is
to
say
in
beauty
and
which
derives
its
spiritual
nutriment
in
the
realization
of
that
beauty
in
plastic
shapes
d
the
question
becomes
inevitable
how
far
a
spiritual
want
of
this
kind
is
bound
up
as
a
necessary
element
in
the
life
of
man
and
his
worldhistory
in
the
first
instance
these
two
spheres180
appear
simply
as
immediate
factors
of
our
entire
survey
it
is
however
the
requirement
of
philosophy
to
probe
more
deeply
into
that
which
binds
them
as
essential
and
necessarily
interacting
constituents
of
one
organic
whole
for
on
closer
inspection
it
will
be
found
that
they
do
not
stand
in
relation
to
one
another
on
the
mere
basis
of
utility
rather
we
shall
discover
that
only
through
the
one
we
shall
fully
comprehend
the
other
in
other
words
the
one
circle
overlaps
the
other
in
the
sense
that
the
higher
forms
of
its
activity
are
found
to
be
a
part
of
the
other
and
that
which
is
of
less
value
in
its
own
province
is
lifted
into
a
finer
atmosphere
and
what
had
failed
to
free
itself
from
its
original
bounds
is
now
enlarged
to
liberty
through
the
profounder
satisfaction
it
receives
in
the
widening
of
the
range
of
its
interests181
and
it
is
this
which
makes
clear
the
necessity
of
the
ideal
bond
we
will
recall
now
for
a
moment
the
analysis
we
established
of
the
notion
of
the
beautiful
and
that
of
art
generally
two
opposed
aspects
come
under
notice
in
the
first
place
we
have
a
content
an
end
a
significance
and
in
addition
to
that
we
get
the
artistic
expression
of
the
same
the
appearance
and
realization
of
such
content
and
thirdly
these
two
aspects
of
the
artistic
product
so
pass
into
each
other
that
the
rationality
or
particularity
is
nothing
short
of
the
expression
of
the
artistic
purpose
nothing
more
or
less
is
given
us
than
the
essential
expression
of
the
entire
content
what
we
designate
as
content
significance
is
just
this
simplicity
of
idea
the
work
of
art
resolved
into
its
simplest
yet
most
comprehensive
determinants
as
it
exists
for
mind
in
contrast
with
the
actual
work
executed
as
an
example
we
may
summarize
the
content
of
a
book
from
a
few
words
or
sentences
the
book
contains
and
nothing
may
be
necessary
to
expound
the
content
of
that
book
sufficiently
in
its
general
import
this
simple
idea
the
thesis
or
main
problem
of
our
book
which
forms
the
fundamental
basis
on
which
the
entire
structure
is
built
is
the
abstract
significance
it
is
only
the
detailed
exposition
which
gives
us
the
concrete
totality
both
sides
however
of
this
opposition
do
not
stand
in
an
indifferent
or
purely
external
relation
one
to
the
other
as
for
instance
is
the
case
when
we
contrast
with
it
the
particular
content
of
an
abstract
mathematical
figure
such
as
a
triangle
or
an
ellipse
to
which
the
external
particularity
of
its
size
or
figure
is
related
without
affecting
its
significance
rather
in
the
former
case
we
shall
find
that
the
content
of
its
form
taken
in
abstraction
in
itself
possesses
a
determinate
impulse
in
the
direction
of
realization
and
thereby
concreteness
there
is
in
it
essentially
the
should
of
purpose
however
strongly
form
is
here
posited
in
independence
we
are
unable
to
rest
satisfied
with
such
abstraction
and
ask
for
something
more
this
is
at
first
apprehended
merely
as
an
unsatisfied
want
a
desire
in
the
conscious
subject
which
strives
to
annul
itself
and
secure
satisfaction
from
such
a
standpoint
all
we
can
say
is
that
the
content
is
purely
selfcontained
or
subjective
over
against
which
the
objective
otherthanitself
is
placed
in
opposition
in
such
a
way
as
to
emphasize
the
desire
to
make
the
subjective
content
objective
such
a
conflict
between
the
subjective
content
and
the
objective
reality
which
confronts
it
no
less
than
the
mere
impulse
to
transcend
the
opposition
is
a
universal
characteristic
of
the
determination
of
all
selfconscious
life182
even
that
aspect
of
human
life
which
we
call
physical
and
still
more
that
world
of
mans
spiritual
aims
and
interests
depends
on
this
necessity
to
carry
forward
that
which
is
at
first
purely
subjective
and
ideal
into
the
objective
world
that
a
fuller
satisfaction
in
its
essential
substance
may
be
realized
but
so
long
as
the
content
of
aims
and
interests
is
merely
and
at
first
apprehended
in
the
onesided
form
of
subjective
consciousness
and
that
onesidedness
is
apprehended
as
a
mere
limit
this
loss
makes
itself
simply
felt
as
unrest
or
pain
it
is
a
negative
something
which
is
bound
to
resolve
itself
as
such
negativity
and
in
order
to
remove
the
sense
of
defect
exerts
an
impulse
to
transcend
the
barrier
itself
already
an
object
of
consciousness
and
thought
and
moreover
this
transcendency
does
not
merely
amount
to
this
that
the
objective
other
ceases
to
be
an
opposed
factor
to
the
general
subjective
consciousness
rather
in
the
more
determinate
connection
this
defect
of
subjective
thought
is
itself
and
within
itself
a
defect
and
negation
which
involves
an
impulse
to
negate
and
pass
beyond
in
other
words
the
conscious
subject
is
implicitly
and
according
to
its
essential
notion
the
complete
whole183
that
is
not
merely
what
is
inward
but
the
realization
no
less
of
that
which
is
inward
or
ideal
in
and
through
what
is
without
if
we
assume
that
it
exists
only
abstractly
in
one
form
we
have
to
face
the
contradiction
that
whereas
it
is
according
to
its
concrete
notion
the
whole
yet
according
to
its
mode
of
existence
it
remains
merely
one
side
of
that
totality
it
is
only
through
the
entire
resolution
of
such
a
contradiction
that
life
becomes
affirmative
to
pass
through
each
phase
of
this
opposition
contradiction
and
its
final
abrogation
is
the
higher
and
legitimate
demand
of
conscious
life
that
which
remains
always
affirmative
is
and
remains
without
life
life
is
built
upon
negation
and
pain
it
is
only
by
crushing
out
such
contradictions
in
the
crucible
of
fuller
life
and
knowledge
that
it
remains
in
its
affirmative
substance
if
it
anchor
wholly
on
contradiction
without
such
a
possibility
of
resolution
it
must
be
infallibly
wrecked
thereon
such
then
is
the
nature
of
these
determinations
of
thought
regarded
in
their
abstraction
to
which
it
was
necessary
to
draw
attention
at
the
present
stage
the
most
exalted
content
which
lies
within
the
grasp
of
selfconscious
life
may
be
concisely
called
freedom
freedom
is
the
highest
determination
of
spirit
in
its
formal
aspect
freedom
in
its
first
instance
consists
in
this
that
the
subject
thereof
ceases
to
find
a
limit
or
barrier
in
the
material
which
is
set
over
against
it
this
is
no
longer
an
element
foreign
to
it
but
one
in
which
it
finds
itself
again
even
under
this
formal
definition
of
it
all
necessity
and
misfortune
disappears
the
individual
consciousness
is
reconciled
with
the
world
finds
satisfaction
in
such
reconciliation
and
all
opposition
and
contradiction
is
thereby
dissolved
but
over
and
above
this
on
closer
inspection
we
find
that
it
is
universally
the
rationalthat
is
to
say
ethical
relations
in
practical
life
truth
in
thoughtwhich
constitutes
the
content
of
freedom
but
furthermore
inasmuch
as
freedom
itself
is
in
the
first
instance
only
subjective
not
wholly
carried
into
effect
there
must
remain
for
the
individual
an
element
of
unfreedom
a
somewhat
purely
objective
opposed
to
it
as
a
necessity
of
nature
and
it
is
accompanied
likewise
with
the
demand
to
secure
a
reconciliation
of
this
opposition
from
the
reverse
point
of
view
a
similar
contradiction
is
apparent
in
the
internal
domain
of
the
subjective
consciousness
itself
we
have
on
the
one
hand
that
which
is
universal
and
selfsubsistent
in
its
own
right
in
other
words
the
universal
dictates
or
principles
of
justice
goodness
and
truth
on
the
other
there
are
the
various
impulses
of
mankind
all
the
emotions
preferences
and
passions
which
exercise
their
power
over
the
heart
of
each
man
and
woman
individually
this
opposition
no
less
than
the
other
excites
conflict
and
contradiction
and
in
this
strife
man
becomes
subject
to
every
conceivable
longing
the
profoundest
grief
and
in
a
word
to
every
kind
of
worry
and
discontent
it
is
the
prerogative
of
the
spiritual
life
of
mankind
to
be
a
veil
severed
and
broken
asunder
tossed
as
it
must
be
on
the
waves
of
contradiction
the
animal
creation
lives
at
peace
with
itself
and
its
environment
man
is
unable
to
find
a
complete
refuge
in
that
which
is
exclusively
inward
the
soul
as
such
pure
thought
in
the
world
of
legal
obligation
and
its
universality
he
is
dependent
also
upon
his
sensuous
existence
his
emotions
and
all
that
appeals
to
his
heart
and
soul
it
is
the
part
of
philosophy
to
give
expression
to
this
contradiction
in
thought
as
it
extends
throughout
its
allembracing
compass
and
to
overcome
the
same
with
a
reconciliation
equally
comprehensive
in
the
immediacy
of
everyday
life
however
man
seeks
to
secure
an
immediate
satisfaction
perhaps
the
most
obvious
example
of
such
a
resolution
is
to
be
found
in
the
domain
of
animal
wants
and
their
satisfaction
the
states
of
hunger
thirst
fatigue
on
the
one
hand
and
feeding
drinking
sleep
on
the
other
with
all
such
similar
states
illustrate
the
contradictions
and
resolutions
to
which
we
here
refer
in
this
sphere
of
human
existence
which
is
fundamentally
the
same
as
purely
animal
life
the
content
of
such
satisfaction
is
however
of
a
finite
and
limited
range
such
satiety
carries
with
it
no
permanence
but
moves
forward
without
rest
to
a
renewed
sense
of
want
men
eat
drink
and
sleep
and
on
the
morrow
are
as
hungry
and
weary
as
before
man
is
compelled
therefore
to
strive
for
a
freedom
more
lasting
in
that
element
of
the
spiritual
life
which
he
appropriates
in
knowledge
and
volition
the
sciences
and
his
social
activities
the
ignorant
man
is
unfree
because
he
faces
a
world
which
is
foreign
to
himself
a
world
which
tosses
hither
and
thither
aimlessly
to
which
he
is
joined
as
an
appendage
unable
to
unite
that
foreign
world
to
itself
and
to
feel
itself
at
home
there
as
in
its
own
demesne
the
merest
impulse
of
curiosity
the
awakening
of
the
love
of
knowledge
the
lowest
phase
of
animate
unrest
and
the
highest
grasp
of
philosophical
insight
are
ultimately
derived
from
the
same
source
namely
the
desire
to
overcome
every
condition
that
is
unfavourable
to
freedom
and
to
bring
the
world
of
everyday
life
and
that
of
the
subject
which
reflects
upon
it
into
one
harmonious
unity
if
we
consider
the
world
of
action
the
result
is
the
same
freedom
in
human
action
is
the
attempt
to
make
positive
or
real
the
reason
of
the
will
reason
is
realized
by
voluntary
action
through
the
life
of
the
state
in
a
state
that
is
differentiated
through
itself
on
any
rational
principle
all
the
laws
and
social
institutions
which
belong
to
it
are
simply
a
realization
of
freedom
according
to
their
own
essential
determinants
this
being
so
the
reason
that
belongs
to
any
citizen
discovers
in
such
institutions
its
own
essential
life
and
so
long
as
such
is
not
in
revolt
from
those
laws
proceeds
with
them
as
with
its
own
kith
and
kin
rather
than
a
foreign
adversary
we
not
infrequently
find
licence
identified
with
freedom
but
the
freedom
of
licence
is
irrational
it
depends
upon
a
choice
and
selfdetermination
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
rational
will
but
is
rather
the
product
of
accidental
impulses
and
their
dependence
on
the
world
of
sense
and
physical
nature
we
may
conclude
then
that
the
physical
needs
of
man
no
less
than
his
knowledge
and
power
of
volition
receive
in
fact
each
in
its
own
sphere
a
satisfaction
in
the
world
and
deliberately
break
up
the
contradiction
between
the
subjective
and
objective
that
is
to
say
between
the
freedom
of
consciousness
and
the
external
necessity
of
things
with
which
it
is
confronted
the
content
however
of
such
a
freedom
and
the
satisfaction
which
is
therein
experienced
is
still
subject
to
limitations
and
for
this
reason
both
still
retain
an
element
of
finitude
and
wherever
we
find
such
an
element
supervening
it
is
inevitable
that
the
original
contradiction
should
again
reassert
itself
and
the
selfsatisfaction
only
maintain
a
relative
significance
for
example
in
the
sphere
of
jurisprudence
and
its
realization
in
the
state
it
is
true
enough
that
the
rationality
of
each
citizen
his
will
and
his
freedom
are
recognized
he
is
a
person
and
as
such
is
respected
he
is
the
owner
of
property
and
if
that
property
is
in
danger
the
courts
of
law
reassert
his
rights
in
their
integrity
this
recognition
however
and
the
freedom
it
establishes
are
confined
to
single
relations
and
isolated
objects
such
as
a
particular
house
a
sum
of
money
some
particular
right
or
law
in
fine
some
particular
transaction
in
the
practical
world
what
the
consciousness
has
at
any
one
time
before
it
are
particular
things
which
no
doubt
are
related
to
one
another
and
in
fact
form
a
nucleus
of
such
relations
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
appropriate
to
categories
of
purely
relative
validity
are
subject
to
various
conditions
of
tenure
which
make
the
satisfaction
only
immediately
experienced
when
their
predominance
is
reasserted
or
at
any
rate
fail
to
establish
any
degree
of
permanence
and
further
than
this
the
life
of
the

in
its
organic
entirety
as
a

of
all
the

no

than
the

duties
which
such
arrangements
presuppose
the
aims
and
satisfaction
to
which
they
are
directed
the
entire
scope
of
its
civic
and
commercial
activities
already
referred
to
in
one
word
the
complete

of

is
indeed
in
a
genuine
state
complete
in
itself
and
in
a
sense
rounded
off
as
a
real
totality
at
the
same
time
we
must
observe
that
the
fundamental
principle
for
the
realization
of
which
the
state
exists
and
wherein
the
individual
man
finds
his
satisfaction
as
a
citizen
is
despite
all
the
variety
of
that
life
all
the
manifold
differentiation
of
class
within
itself
and
as
related
to
the
world
without
still
a
whole
that
is
onesided
and
in
a
real
sense
abstract
it
is
only
the
rational
freedom
of
the
will
made
explicit
in
a
particular
totality
it
is
in
short
only
the
national
life
and
further
the
life
of
a
particular
nation
a
life
moreover
in
which
freedom
is
realized
in
a
particular
sphere
of
existence
as
individualized
reality
and
on
this
account
it
is
that
we
are
necessarily
conscious
that
rights
and
obligations
in
the
mere
bounds
of
civic
existence
on
the
plane
that
is
to
say
of
merely
this
worlds
or
temporal
existence
do
not
discover
the
absolute
satisfaction
we
are
seeking
we
require
as
rational
beings
a
higher
realization
of
their
objective
truth
as
private
individuals
a
fuller
sanction
of
their
imperative
validity
than
they
themselves
in
such
a
sphere
can
offer
us
what
mankind
pressed
on
all
sides
by
the
boundaries
of
his
purely
terrestrial
life
in
fact
requires
is
that
region
of
more
essential
reality
in
which
every
opposition
and
contradiction
is
overcome
and
freedom
can
finally
claim
to
be
wholly
at
peace
with
itself
and
this
is
of
course
nothing
other
than
absolute
truth
itself
no
merely
relative
truth
in
the
truth
according
to
its
highest
notion
all
must
be
brought
home
to
one
unity
in
it
there
can
be
no
more
opposition
between
freedom
and
necessity
spirit
and
nature
knowledge
and
the
object
of
knowledge
law
and
impulse
between
whatever
form
in
fact
the
opposition
of
these
contradictory
phenomena
of
human
experience
may
assume
it
is
in
virtue
of
such
truth
that
proof
is
possible
that
neither
a
freedom
which
is
essentially
subjective
and
disparate
from
every
element
of
necessity
is
true
in
the
absolute
sense
nor
on
the
other
hand
is
it
admissible
to
predicate
truth
of
a
necessity
conceived
in
absolute
isolation
from
consciousness
our
ordinary
conscious
life
fails
to
overcome
this
contradiction
and
either
plunges
desperately
into
the
same
or
thrusts
it
on
one
side
and
makes
its
escape
from
it
in
some
other
way
philosophy
will
however
so
address
itself
to
the
two
determinating
factors
of
the
contradiction
as
to
show
that
they
are
apprehended
as
isolate
from
each
other
in
abstraction
not
according
to
their
concrete
notion
and
by
the
grasp
of
this
latter
it
will
demonstrate
the
onesidedness
in
its
relative
character
placing
these
opposing
aspects
in
the
fuller
union
and
harmony
which
is
truth
it
is
the
function
of
philosophy
to
grasp
and
formulate
this
notion
of
truth
unquestionably
philosophy
recognizes
the
concrete
notion
throughout
and
it
is
in
virtue
of
this
that
it
is
thought
with
full
grasp
of
truth
but
what
we
call
the
notion
is
something
other
than
this
truth
that
is
in
its
essential
verity
together
with
the
existence
which
is
either
adequate
to
it
or
is
not
so
in
all
finite
reality
the
determinations
which
are
essential
to
ideal
truth
appear
separable
from
each
other
dividing
the
veil
of
that
which
in
its
absolute
truth
is
a
complete
totality
take
the
case
of
a
living
being
under
such
finite
categories
we
are
forced
to
regard
it
as
a
subject
in
opposition
to
the
inorganic
nature
which
environs
it
both
the
points
of
view
are
no
doubt
present
in
the
notion
but
they
are
there
reconciled
finite
existence
however
thrusts
them
apart
it
is
in
short
an
existence
or
reality
which
is
unequal
to
the
unity
of
the
notion
we
may
therefore
say
that
the
notion
is
valid
in
every
sphere
of
actuality
at
the
same
time
the
main
point
to
be
determined
is
whether
the
notion
in
its
ideal
concreteness
is
actually
completed
in
the
particular
unity
presented
wherein
the
two
aspects
posited
in
opposition
persist
in
no
ultimate
selfsubsistence
and
coherence
over
against
each
other
but
are
rather
ideal
phases
which
tend
to
pass
into
a
higher
unity
which
cancels
such
opposition
and
the
reality
of
this
highest
mode
of
union
is
only
reached
when
we
enter
the
sphere
of
truth
freedom
and
the
satisfaction
which
they
create
the
higher
life
which
belongs
to
this
sphere
this
supreme
enjoyment
of
truth
which
as
feeling
is
called
blessedness
and
as
conscious
thought
contemplation
we
may
describe
generically
as
the
life
known
to
religion
for
religion
is
just
this
universal
domain184
in
virtue
of
which
the
one
concrete
totality
of
the
world
comes
to
each
man
in
union
with
himself
as
his
essential
substance
while
it
remains
no
less
for
consciousness
the
essential
truth
of
nature
and
it
is
this
profounder
truth
of
the
real
which
alone
proves
itself
invincible
over
all
that
is
merely
particular
and
finite
being
as
it
is
the
one
absolute
harmony
wherein
all
that
is
otherwise
discordant
and
opposed
is
finally
resolved
now
it
is
through
its
direct
concern
in
the
true
regarded
as
the
absolute
object
of
consciousness
that
art
belongs
to
the
supreme
sphere
of
spirit
and
it
is
to
be
placed
in
respect
to
its
content
if
in
a
more
specific
sense
on
the
same
basis
as
religion
and
philosophy
i
connect
these
two
last
for
the
reason
that
philosophy
has
no
other
object
than
god
in
its
substance
it
is
in
fact
rational
theology
and
in
its
service
of
the
truth
a
continual
service
of
god
e
accepting
then
this
fundamental
similarity
of
content
these
three
spheres
of
absolute
spirit
only
differ
in
the
forms
under
which
they
present
their
object
that
is
the
absolute
to
human
consciousness
the
differences
which
are
perceptible
in
these
modes
of
presentment
are
due
to
the
notion
of
the
absolute
spirit
mind
itself
spirit
in
its
truth
is
essential
substance
brought
home
to
itself
it
is
therefore
no
essence
which
lies
outside
and
in
abstract
relation
to
objectivity
but
rather
is
within
the
compass
of
that
objectivity
the
recollected
presence185
of
the
substance
of
all
objects
within
finite
spirit
it
is
the
finite
which
grasps
its
own
essential
universality
and
in
doing
so
grasps
essential
being
in
the
absolute
sense
the
first
mode
of
this
comprehension
is
an
immediate
one
that
is
to
say
it
is
a
sensuous
cognition
a
cognition
in
the
form
and
semblance
of
the
object
of
senseperception
in
which
the
absolute
is
presented
directly
to
the
understanding186
and
feeling
the
second
form
is
that
of
the
conceptive
or
imaginative
consciousness
last
of
all
we
have
the
free
thought
of
absolute
spirit
the
form
of
sensuous
perception
is
appropriate
to
art
in
the
sense
that
it
is
art
which
presents
truth
to
consciousness
in
its
sensuous
semblance
but
it
is
a
semblance
which
under
the
mode
of
its
appearance
possesses
a
higher
and
profounder
meaning
and
significance
although
it
is
not
its
function
to
render
the
universality
of
the
notion
wholly
intelligible
through
the
medium
of
sense
it
is
indeed
rather
the
unity
to
which
art
attains
with
that
of
the
particular
appearance
which
constitutes
the
essence
of
the
beautiful
the
essence
of
the
artistic
product
this
union
is
perfected
in
art
not
entirely
through
sensuous
objectification
but
also
through
the
medium
of
imaginative
conception
this
is
exceptionally
so
in
the
art
of
poetry
at
the
same
time
even
in
this
the
most
intellectual
or
ideal
art
the
union
between
significance
and
the
individual
mode
of
its
presentation
is
present
with
the
same
although
it
is
displayed
to
the
imaginative
consciousness
and
every
part
of
its
content
is
conceived
in
its
immediacy
and
visualized
for
the
imagination187
and
generally
we
must
accept
the
fact
that
art
possessing
as
it
does
truth
or
spirit
for
its
object
is
unable
to
reproduce
the
same
by
merely
copying
particular
objects
of
nature
such
as
the
sun
moon
earth
and
stars
such
are
no
doubt
objects
of
sensuous
perception
but
simply
as
such
they
are
isolated
and
can
offer
no
reflection
of
what
is
spiritual
in
thus
attributing
to
art
this
absolute
significance
as
a
manifestation
of
spirit
we
have
expressly
set
on
one
side
the
conception
of
art
which
finds
its
content
of
too
various
a
nature
or
too
much
occupied
with
interests
foreign
to
it
to
merit
such
a
view
and
at
the
other
extreme
religion
no
doubt
frequently
summons
art
to
her
service
in
order
to
bring
the
truths
of
religion
more
near
to
the
emotion
or
to
clothe
the
same
in
imaginative
form
in
both
cases
unquestionably
art
is
rendering
a
service
to
a
province
not
in
strictness
its
own
at
the
same
time
where
art
is
found
in
most
exalted
perfection
in
that
case
no
doubt
it
unfolds
in
plastic
guise
the
mode
of
exposition
most
adequate
and
essentially
necessary
to
the
content
of
the
truth
accepted
among
the
greeks
for
example
art
was
the
highest
medium
under
which
the
community
conceived
its
gods
and
became
conscious
of
truth
for
this
reason
we
may
justly
say
that
the
poets
and
artists
of
greece
created
the
gods
of
their
people
in
other
words
they
defined
for
the
imagination
of
their
people
the
active
life
and
energy
of
the
divine
presence
giving
them
the
definite
content
of
a
religion
and
this
statement
must
not
merely
be
taken
to
imply
that
all
greek
artists
did
was
to
clothe
in
imagery
or
embellish
with
the
beauty
of
poesy
vague
conceptions
and
hearsays
which
as
general
religious
maxims
or
isolated
determinations
of
conscious
life
were
already
present
before
the
era
of
such
poetic
creations
the
truth
of
this
artistic
production
is
rather
to
be
found
in
this
that
art
and
poetry
were
the
exclusive
forms
in
which
these
creative
artists
could
bring
to
life
and
expression
the
ideas
which
fermented
in
themselves
in
other
phases
of
that
consciousness
where
we
find
the
content
less
completely
represented
by
the
plastic
imagery
of
art
the
scope
of
art
as
the
handmaid
of
religion
is
of
less
importance
we
have
thus
indicated
what
was
at
any
rate
once
the
true
position
of
art
in
its
relation
to
the
highest
interests
of
mans
spiritual
life
but
inasmuch
as
art
is
preceded
in
nature
and
the
finite
processes
of
life
by
a
kind
of
antenatal
history
so
too
there
is
a
history
that
follows
its
culmination
which
in
other
terms
passes
over
and
beyond
its
purely
conceptive
or
plastic
grasp
of
the
infinite
for
art
carries
in
the
notion
that
gives
it
life
a
limit
and
it
is
from
this
boundary
that
the
human
consciousness
passes
beyond
into
forms
more
adequate
to
its
spiritual
import
it
is
this
inherent
shortness
of
the
mark
that
fixes
the
subordinate
position
we
are
only
too
ready
to
assign
to
art
in
our
daily
life
nowadays
for
us
european
art
is
no
longer
the
highest
means
in
which
the
actuality
of
truth
is
possessed
speaking
generally
thought
has
long
ago
pronounced
a
verdict
upon
art
when
it
defined
it
as
the
portrayal
of
the
divine
by
concepts
which
appeal
to
senseperception
this
was
the
judgment
passed
on
it
by
the
jews
and
the
followers
of
mohammed
nay
we
find
it
present
among
the
greeks
themselves
as
the
strong
opposition
of
plato
and
homer
and
hesiod
to
the
popular
conception
of
the
gods
proves
clearly
there
is
a
period
in
the
education
of
every
civilized
nation
when
art
becomes
a
signpost
as
it
were
to
that
which
stands
beyond
her
border
the
evolution
of
christendom
is
itself
an
illustration
the
historical
features
of
that
religion
the
resurrection
of
christ
his
life
and
death
have
doubtless
offered
to
the
art
of
painting
a
mighty
field
on
which
to
exercise
its
imaginative
bounty
and
the
church
has
either
surrounded
such
art
with
its
magnificent
protection
or
suffered
it
simply
to
work
on
unheeded
but
as
the
love
of
knowledge
and
scientific
research
and
yet
more
the
felt
want
of
a
more
intimate
and
personal
spirituality
necessitated
the
reformation
the
religious
imagination
was
called
away
from
the
sensuous
medium
which
enwrapped
it
and
centred
once
for
all
upon
the
inward
spirituality
of
emotional
life
and
conscious
thought
in
this
way
there
grew
up
so
to
speak
that
posterior
twilight
of
arts
history
i
referred
to
where
the
want
has
found
a
dwelling
in
man
to
rest
satisfied
alone
with
the
pure
medium
of
the
soul
as
the
ultimate
form
of
truth
in
the
earliest
beginnings
of
art
we
shall
find
mystery
still
present
a
secret
strain
and
longing
which
persists
because
arts
imaginative
powers
are
unable
to
envisage
to
sense
the
complete
truth
of
its
content
when
once
however
the
mind
of
man
has
succeeded
in
endowing
such
content
with
perfect
outward
shape
in
art
it
is
driven
inevitably
away
from
this
objective
realization
to
its
own
free
spiritual
activity
as
from
something
repellent
to
it
a
period
such
as
this
is
our
own
we
may
indeed
express
the
hope
that
art
will
rise
to
yet
higher
grades
of
technical
perfection
but
in
any
case
art
in
its
specific
form
has
ceased
to
meet
the
highest
requirements
of
spiritual
life
we
may
still
wonder
at
the
unrivalled
excellence
of
the
statues
of
the
gods
of
hellas
and
imagine
that
god
the
father
christ
and
the
virgin
mary
have
received
ideal
representation
at
the
hands
of
more
recent
painters
but
it
is
of
no
use
our
knees
no
longer
bow
to
them
the
sphere
of
conscious
life
nearest
to
that
of
art
is
that
of
religion
the
form
which
belongs
to
the
religious
consciousness
is
that
of
the
imaginative
concept
the
absolute
is
here
removed
from
the
externality
of
artistic
production
and
received
in
a
more
spiritual
way
by
the
imagination
so
that
the
heart
and
emotions
the
inner
life
of
the
individual
that
is
to
say
become
its
vehicle
this
progress
in
spiritual
insight
from
art
to
religion
may
be
further
defined
by
the
statement
that
art
is
only
one
aspect
of
the
religious
consciousness
in
other
words
when
a
work
of
art
objectifies
the
truth
or
mind
for
senseperfection
and
apprehends
this
form
of
the
absolute
as
the
one
appropriate
to
its
vision
religion
blends
with
the
same
the
devotional
attitude
that
flows
from
the
inner
life
confronted
with
the
absolute
reality
as
thus
presented
devotion
is
a
type
of
emotional
existence
which
is
strictly
speaking
outside
the
province
of
art
it
originates
in
the
fact
that
the
individual
suffers
that
object
which
art
has
rendered
visible
to
sense
to
penetrate
the
arcana
of
his
emotional
life
and
so
completely
identifies
himself
with
it
that
this
inward
presence
which
the
imagination
and
the
inherent
might
of
feeling
has
rendered
possible
becomes
an
essential
phase
in
the
manifestation
of
absolute
reality
devotion
is
this
cultus
of
the
community
in
its
purest
most
intimate
and
subjective
form
a
culture
in
which
the
principle
of
objectivity
is
at
the
same
time
consumed
and
absorbed
and
the
content
thereof
is
transmuted
without
such
objectivity
into
the
possession
of
heart
and
soul
the
third
and
last
form
or
phase
in
the
evolution
of
absolute
mind
spirit
is
philosophy
in
the
boundaries
of
the
religious
sphere
where
god
is
apprehended
in
the
first
instance
perforce
as
an
external
object
and
men
are
taught
that
there
is
a
god
and
how
he
has
revealed
himself
and
still
is
revealed
to
mankind
the
subjective
consciousness
is
indeed
made
the
vehicle
of
such
knowledge
and
the
religious
sense
imparted
stirs
and
fills
the
heart
of
the
community
but
the
inwardness
of
devotion
which
is
born
of
the
emotions
and
the
imagination
is
not
the
highest
form
of
inwardness
we
are
bound
to
recognize
that
the
purest
form
of
knowledge
is
conscious
thought
in
its
freest
activity
in
this
alone
the
content
of
knowledge
is
adequate
to
the
demands
of
that
which
is
consciously
apprehended
here
alone
we
are
in
the
presence
of
that
most
intelligent
form
of
cultus
which
seeks
wholly
to
appropriate
to
itself
and
to
grasp
in
concrete
thought
what
is
otherwise
only
the
evanescent
content
of
feeling
or
the
imagination
in
the
purview
of
such
a
philosophy
art
and
religion
as
two
aspects
of
one
truth
become
related
under
a
unifying
conception
on
the
one
hand
though
philosophy
by
its
surrender
of
all
sensuous
externality
has
lost
the
objective
presentation
of
art
yet
it
has
exchanged
it
for
the
highest
form
under
which
concrete
reality
is
objectively
apprehended
and
redeemed
in
other
words
that
of
speculative
reason
it
has
on
the
other
lost
the
emotional
subjectivity
of
the
religious
consciousness
in
the
same
pure
medium
for
while
human
thought
is
the
most
inward
and
appropriate
vehicle
of
subjective
life
such
thought
in
its
fullest
grasp
of
truth
the
idea
is
actuality
in
the
most
objective
and
universal
sense
of
the
term
and
is
only
to
be
apprehended
by
pure
thought
in
the
medium
native
to
itself
with
this
adumbration
of
the
difference
between
the
spheres
of
art
religion
and
philosophy
we
must
on
the
present
occasion
rest
content
the
sensuous
mode
of
consciousness
is
that
which
first
appears
in
the
history
of
mankind
the
earliest
stages
of
religion
are
for
this
reason
indistinguishable
from
a
religion
of
art
and
its
sensuous
manner
of
presentation
in
the
religion
of
spirit
for
the
first
time
is
god
as
spirit
cognized
also
on
a
higher
plane
and
one
more
adequate
to
thought
wherein
it
likewise
follows
as
a
corollary
that
the
presentation
of
truth
in
sensuous
shape
is
not
truly
adequate
to
spirit
now
that
we
know
something
of
the
position
which
art
occupies
in
the
field
of
spiritual
activity
and
that
which
belongs
to
the
philosophy
of
art
among
the
several
philosophical
sciences
we
will
proceed
in
this
introductory
portion
of
our
work
in
the
first
place
to
investigate
the
general
idea
of
the
beauty
of
art
subdivision
of
subject
idea
of
the
beauty
of
art
otherwise
fine
art
to
arrive
at
the
idea
of
fine
art
in
all
its
concreteness
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
consider
it
under
three
phases
1
the
first
is
concerned
with
the
notion
of
the
beautiful
generally
2
the
second
is
that
of
natural
beauty
the
defects
of
which
will
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
the
ideal
as
fine
art
3
in
the
third
of
these
aspects
the
subject
of
our
investigation
will
be
the
ideal
in
its
positive
realization
in
other
words
as
the
artistic
display
of
this
ideal
in
particular
works
of

the
notion
of
the
beautiful
in
its
general
significance
i
we
have
defined
beauty
to
be
the
idea
of
the
beautiful
by
this
definition
is
implied
that
we
have
to
conceive
the
beautiful
as
idea
and
moreover
as
idea
in
a
determinate
shape
as
ideal
idea
as
thus
posited
is
just
this
the
conceptive
notion
the
realization
of
the
same
and
the
unity
of
both
the
notion
as
such
is
not
yet
the
idea
although
the
terms
notion
and
idea
are
often
loosely
interchanged
idea
is
the
notion
only
as
presented
in
and
brought
into
coalescence
with
its
objective
reality
this
unity
however
is
by
no
means
to
be
regarded
as
the
mere
neutralization
of
notion
and
reality
so
that
the
individual
character
and
quality
of
either
is
absorbed
as
for
example
where
we
find
that
in
a
chemical
compound
saltpotash
and
acid
tend
to
neutralize
each
other
in
so
far
as
they
have
weakened
their
opposition
in
this
unity
on
the
contrary
the
notion
is
retained
as
the
commanding
factor
it
is
already
implicitly
in
virtue
of
its
own
nature
this
very
identity
out
of
its
own
wealth
it
evolves
the
reality
as
part
of
itself
by
means
of
a
process
which
being
no
other
than
that
of
development
surrenders
nothing
of
its
own
nature
but
brings
into
more
concrete
actuality
the
riches
of
the
notion
and
for
this
reason
continues
in
unity
with
itself
and
its
objective
realization
such
a
unity
of
the
notional
concept
and
its
realization
is
the
idea
defined
in
abstract
terms
the
word
idea
is
of
course
frequently
used
by
authors
of
works
dealing
with
the
theory
of
art
it
must
however
be
admitted
that
many
connoisseurs
of
high
standing
are
particularly
severe
upon
its
employment
the
latest
and
most
interesting
example
of
this
polemical
attitude
is
to
be
found
in
herr
von
rumohrs
italian
investigations
this
work
is
based
on
the
practical
interest
that
the
arts
excite
and
is
wholly
unconcerned
with
that
which
for
brevity
we
may
call
the
idea
the
truth
is
that
this
writer
who
appears
to
have
no
knowledge
of
the
development
of
philosophy
in
modern
times
freely
confuses
the
expression
as
above
defined
with
the
undetermined
conceptions
of
the
phantasy
or
the
abstract
and
characterless
ideal
of
wellknown
art
theories
or
schools
of
art
ideas
which
present
a
lean
contrast
to
the
clearly
defined
and
richly
caparisoned
objects
of
nature
in
their
truth
and
which
this
writer
opposes
to
the
idea
and
empty
ideal
which
the
artist
himself
evolves
from
his
own
consciousness
we
have
of
course
no
more
right
to
suppose
that
creative
work
can
be
the
result
of
such
poverty
than
we
can
with
justice
assume
that
a
thinker
can
think
with
conceptions
wholly
indeterminate
and
persist
in
his
thought
with
a
content
destitute
of
all
defined
relation
such
an
objection
however
does
not
apply
in
any
respect
to
the
idea
in
the
sense
we
use
the
expression
this
idea
is
through
and
through
concrete
a
whole
which
consists
of
relations
and
is
simply
beautiful
from
being
in
direct
union
with
the
objective
form
adequate
to
its
expression
herr
von
rumohr
has
placed
on
record
in
this
very
book
book
i
pp
14546
the
following
assertion
that
beauty
in
the
most
comprehensive
meaning
of
the
term
and
as
it
is
understood
by
intelligent
people
of
our
day
includes
every
quality
of
an
object
which
may
either
stir
the
sense
of
sight
with
satisfaction
or
through
that
sense
attune
the
soul
and
delight
the
mind
these
qualities
are
then
further
subdivided
into
three
classes
as
follows
first
there
is
all
that
is
perceptible
through
the
eye
secondly
that
which
is
apprehended
by
means
of
the
peculiar
presumably
innate
sense
of
mankind
for
spatial
relations
and
thirdly
all
that
in
the
first
instance
works
upon
the
understanding
and
only
indirectly
through
cognition
on
the
emotions
this
third
and
most
important
determination
rests
apparently
on
forms
which
quite
independently
of
all
pleasure
to
the
sense
and
the
beauty
of
extended
shape
arouse
in
us
a
specific
delight
which
is
ethical
or
spiritual
in
its
quality
which
in
part
to
all
appearance
proceeds
from
the
enjoyment
we
derive
from
the
images
excited
i
presume
he
means
ethical
or
spiritual
ones188
and
in
part
from
the
pleasure
which
the
mere
activity
of
an
intelligent
appreciation
infallibly
brings
with
it
such
are
the
principal
factors
according
to
which
this
undoubted
connoisseur
of
art
defines
his
subject
relatively
to
the
beautiful
it
may
very
possibly
pass
muster
with
a
certain
type
of
uncritical
reader
it
is
however
very
unsatisfactory
regarded
from
the
philosophical
standpoint
for
what
does
it
at
bottom
amount
to
but
this
namely
that
the
sense
of
vision
or
spiritual
sense
we
may
add
the
understanding
itself
are
moved
pleasurably
or
excite
a
feeling
which
results
in
awakened
pleasure
the
entire
argument
hinges
on
this
one
aspect
of
awakened
gratification
this
reduction
however
of
the
activity
of
the
beautiful
to
terms
of
feelingthat
which
pleases
and
charms
ushas
been
disposed
of
once
for
all
by
kant
his
exposition
has
already
left
far
behind
the
feeling
for
the
beautiful
we
will
direct
our
attention
now
from
this
polemical
tractate
to
a
further
consideration
of
the
idea
its
hostility
has
failed
to
weaken
in
this
as
already
stated
is
comprehended
the
concrete
unity
of
the
notion
and
its
objective
realization
a
now
first
we
will
observe
in
directing
our
attention
more
closely
to
the
essential
nature
of
the
notion
that
it
is
no
purely
abstract
unity
opposed
to
the
differences
of
phenomenal
reality
rather
as
the
notion
it
is
already
the
unity
that
integrates
those
relations
and
by
doing
so
is
concrete
totality
the
abstract
conceptions
such
as
man
the
quality
blueness
and
their
like
are
not
notions
as
such
at
all
but
rather
should
be
called
abstract
general
concepts
which
are
only
raised
to
the
dignity
of
the
notion
when
we
have
demonstrated
that
they
contain
opposing
factors
in
unity
and
in
such
a
way
that
this
selfrelated
nexus
of
unity
constitutes
their
notional
truth
for
instance
the
concept
blueness
as
a
colour
receives
such
a
notional
value
when
it
is
grasped
as
the
unity
and
indeed
the
specific
unity
of
light
and
darkness189
in
the
same
way
the
concept
man
contains
within
it
the
opposing
factors
of
sense
life
and
reason
body
and
mind
spirit
but
a
particular
man
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
whole
consisting
in
some
way
of
these
two
aspects
of
his
personality
placed
in
a
relation
of
indifference
side
by
side
as
constituents
of
the
same
rather
in
virtue
of
the
notion
such
a
whole
contains
these
constituents
in
concrete
and
mediated190
union
add
to
this
that
the
notion
is
so
completely
the
absolute
bond
and
unity
of
its
differences
that
independently
they
cease
to
exist
they
are
unable
to
assert
the
particularity
in
virtue
of
which
they
might
escape
from
such
a
union
for
this
reason
the
notion
includes
all
its
determining
constituents
in
the
form
of
its
own
ideal
unity
and
universality
which
constitute
its
subjective
character
in
contradistinction
from
the
real
as
the
object
of
senseperception
for
example
gold
is
as
a
particular
object
of
specific
weight
definite
colour
and
placed
in
a
certain
relation
to
specific
acids
such
are
varied
characteristics
of
gold
and
yet
are
invariably
found
in
a
unified
whole
the
smallest
speck
contains
them
all
in
inseparable
union
by
analysis
or
abstraction
we
indeed
separate
them
but
in
their
notion
they
are
inseparably
one
the
inability
of
the
differences
which
the
notion
in
its
truth
essentially
possesses
to
stand
alone
in
their
isolated
selfidentity
is
of
a
similar
nature
a
still
more
apposite
illustration
is
presented
by
the
unique
concept
of
the
selfconscious
ego
in
its
universality
for
that
which
we
call
soul
or
more
appositely
the
ego
is
the
notion
itself
in
its
free
existence
the
ego
contains
a
congeries
of
most
distinct
concepts
and
thoughts
in
itself
it
is
a
world
of
ideas
yet
none
the
less
this
infinitely
complex
content
in
so
far
as
it
lies
within
the
ego
remains
without
a
vestige
of
substantiality
or
materiality
packed
within
this
ideal
unity
as
the
pure
and
throughout
fluid
transparency
of
the
ego
itself
reflected
to
itself
and
this
is
precisely
the
way
in
which
the
notion
retains
its
varied
determinations
in
ideal
unity
the
determinants
of
the
notion
which
are
most
cognate
to
the
notion
as
such
are
the
universal
the
particular
and
the
single
every
one
of
these
determinate
qualities
taken
by
itself
is
a
mere
abstraction
as
thus
regarded
however
abstract
that
is
to
say
from
one
another
they
are
not
present
in
the
notion
that
is
rather
their
ideal
unity
the
notion
is
therefore
the
universal
which
on
the
one
hand
negates
itself
to
a
condition
of
relativity
and
particularization
but
on
the
other
this
riving
asunder
in
so
far
as
it
is
negation
of
the
universal
is
itself
again
annulled
for
the
universal
as
present
in
the
particular
which
itself
is
only
the
particular
aspects
of
the
universal
itself
is
present
in
no
particular
absolutely
but
rather
in
that
very
particular
reaffirms
once
more
its
essential
unity
as
universal
in
this
return
upon
itself
the
notion
is
infinite
negation
negation
i
mean
not
as
against
another
but
selfdetermination
in
which
alone
it
subsists
in
its
positive
and
correlative
unity
in
this
way
it
is
singularity
in
its
truth
it
is
the
universal
nexus
which
shuts
itself
up
with
itself
in
its
particulars
as
the
highest
example
of
this
property
of
the
notion
we
would
refer
back
to
what
we
have
already
if
in
a
summary
way
said
about
the
essential
activity
of
spirit
through
this
infinite
capacity
of
return
upon
itself
the
notion
is
already
by
virtue
of
its
intrinsic
wealth
totality
it
finds
the
unity
of
itself
in
the
being
of
another
and
for
this
reason
possesses
a
free
activity
being
however
negation
as
selfdetermination
not
as
the
alien
limitation
of
its
own
substance
through
something
other
than
itself
but
regarded
as
such
totality
the
notion
is
already
in
potential
possession
of
all
phenomenal
reality
and
is
that
which
mediates
and
restores
the
unity
of
the
idea
and
whoever
ventures
to
think
that
in
the
idea
we
have
presented
to
us
something
totally
different
and
apart
from
the
notion
has
as
little
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
idea
as
he
has
of
the
notion
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
doubt
a
difference
between
the
notion
and
the
idea
and
it
is
this
in
the
former
the
particularization
is
only
an
abstract
particularization
for
this
reason
that
in
the
notion
the
determinate
relations
are
alone
coherent
in
its
transparent
medium
that
is
to
say
in
its
unity
and
ideal
universality
the
notion
therefore
itself
remains
subject
to
the
onesidedness
of
its
particular
material
and
is
hampered
with
the
defect
that
although
in
its
own
nature
it
is
a
totality
yet
it
is
only
in
the
aspect
of
it
as
unity
and
universality
that
it
is
entitled
to
free
selfdevelopment
but
inasmuch
as
this
defect
in
its
completeness
is
foreign
to
its
own
essential
form
the
process
of
its
activity
is
to
remove
it
it
negates
itself
as
this
very
ideal
unity
and
universality
and
allows
that
which
is
enclosed
in
the
barren
chamber
of
ideal
subjectivity
to
flow
forth
freely
into
real
and
substantive
objectivity
in
other
words
the
notion
through
its
own
activity
posits
itself
as
objective
reality
b
objectivity
is
therefore
truly
apprehended
the
real
existence
of
the
notion
it
is
however
the
notion
under
the
mode
of
selfsubstantive
particularization
and
of
a
differentiation
of
all
antithetical
phases191
of
reality
whose
ideal
unity
the
notion
in
its
subjective
capacity
constituted
but
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
notion
and
only
the
notion
whose
function
it
is
to
endow
objectivity
with
its
determinate
existence
and
reality
so
too
it
is
only
through
objectivity
that
the
notion
is
unveiled
in
its
actuality
the
notion
is
however
the
mediating
and
ideal
unity
of
all
its
particular
antitheses
within
its
differentiated
reality
this
ideal
unity
effective
throughout
particularity
in
modes
adequate
to
the
notion
has
to
establish
itself
in
them
precisely
in
a
way
similar
to
that
in
which
the
realized
particularity
of
their
unity
as
thus
mediated
to
the
point
of
ideality
has
also
to
exist
in
them192
this
is
the
might
of
the
notion
which
refuses
to
surrender
or
forfeit
its
universality
among
the
disjecta
membra
of
the
objective
world
but
rather
reveals
its
essential
unity
through
such
reality
and
within
it
for
it
is
nothing
less
than
the
very
life
of
the
notion
to
preserve
its
unity
in
the
material
which
is
offered
it
only
by
so
doing
is
it
real
and
veritable
totality

this
totality
is
the
idea
the
idea
is
not
simply
the
ideal
unity
and
subjectivity
of
the
notion
it
is
quite
as
much
its
true
and
objective
reality
it
is
however
an
objectivity
which
does
not
confront
the
notion
as
an
opposing
factor
but
is
rather
that
in
which
the
notion
itself
is
selfdetermined
in
whichever
aspect
we
contemplate
the
notion
whether
as
subjective
to
our
apprehension
or
as
objectively
real
the
idea
it
manifests
is
a
totality
but
it
is
more
than
this
it
is
the
unity
which
for
ever
is
mediating
between
and
bringing
into
more
perfected
harmony
the
two
totalities
only
as
thus
apprehended
is
the
idea
truth
and
indeed
all
truth
2
all
that
exists
then
has
only
truth
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
definite
existence
of
the
idea
for
the
idea
is
alone
the
truly
real
the
truth
of
the
phenomenal
is
not
derived
from
the
fact
that
its
particular
existence
is
of
an
inward
or
external
character
and
as
such
is
in
a
general
sense
reality
it
is
so
wholly
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
such
reality
is
adequate
to
the
notion
then
alone
is
determinate
existence
real
and
true
and
the
truth
to
which
we
here
refer
is
not
a
subjective
interpretation
of
it
namely
that
a
particular
existence
is
accordant
with
my
own
conception
of
it
it
is
truth
in
the
objective
sense
that
the
reality
of
the
ego
or
of
any
external
object
action
or
circumstance
actually
contributes
to
the
realization
of
the
notion
if
this
identity
is
not
established
the
existence
remains
purely
phenomenal
instead
of
the
objectification
of
the
notion
in
its
completeness
what
obtains
is
purely
a
detached
aspect
of
it
and
with
regard
to
this
whatever
selfsubsistence
it
may
appear
to
have
in
opposition
to
the
unity
and
universality
of
the
notion
such
can
only
work
to
its
final
confusion
by
setting
it
in
hostility
to
the
true
notion
itself
our
conclusion
therefore
is
that
only
the
reality
which
adequately
expresses
the
notion
is
truly
reality
and
the
reason
it
is
so
is
that
therein
the
idea
manifests
itself
as
existence
3
we
have
maintained
that
beauty
is
idea
it
follows
that
beauty
and
truth
are
in
one
aspect
of
them
identical
in
other
words
beauty
must
itself
in
its
intrinsic
being
be
true
a
closer
investigation
will
further
show
to
us
that
truth
must
be
distinguished
from
beauty
the
idea
is
true
in
the
sense
that
it
is
so
by
virtue
of
its
essential
being
and
according
to
its
fundamental
principle193
and
as
such
truth
it
is
thought194
it
is
not
its
sensuous
and
external
existence
but
the
universal
idea
of
thought
as
present
in
this
at
the
same
time
the
idea
is
driven
to
seek
its
realization
in
external
and
objectively
determined
existence
both
in
the
sphere
of
nature
and
that
of
mind
the
true
in
the
absolute
sense
also
exists
and
in
so
far
as
in
this
its
external
existence
it
is
immediately
apprehended
by
consciousness
and
the
notion
rests
in
immediate
unity
with
its
external
appearance
the
idea
is
not
only
true
but
is
also
beautiful
the
beautiful
may
therefore
be
defined
as
the
sensuous
semblance195
of
the
idea
for
the
sensuous
condition
and
the
objective
world
generally
maintain
no
real
selfsubsistence
in
beauty
but
have
merely
to
surrender
the
immediacy
of
their
being
in
beauty
such
are
posited
simply
as
the
determinate
existence
and
externality
of
the
notion
and
as
a
form
of
reality
which
itself
manifests
the
notion
in
unity
with
its
external
appearance
in
this
its
particular
objective
existence
for
this
reason
it
can
only
pass
as
the
semblance
of
the
notion
a
accordantly
with
this
it
is
impossible
for
the
understanding196
alone
to
grasp
the
significance
of
beauty
for
inasmuch
as
objective
reality
is
apprehended
by
this
faculty
as
something
at
least
quite
other
than
ideality
sensuous
perception
as
something
very
different
from
the
notion
the
external
object
as
something
that
is
anywhere
rather
than
within
world
of
the
conscious
self
to
that
extent
it
cannot
fail
to
emphasize
the
contradictions
implied
in
such
separation
rather
than
penetrate
to
the
ideal
unity
we
have
above
described
the
understanding
remains
rooted
in
the
finite
the
incomplete
and
untrue
abstraction
the
beautiful
is
on
the
contrary
itself
essentially
infinite
and
free
for
although
the
content
of
beauty
is
stamped
with
particularity
and
to
that
extent
limited
such
content
is
essentially
in
its
mode
of
environment
a
totality
that
is
infinite197
and
a
free
existence
and
it
is
both
for
the
reason
that
it
is
the
notion
which
does
not
pass
beyond
this
its
objective
semblance
and
so
fall
into
finite
and
one
sided
abstraction
with
it
but
rather
is
immersed
as
a
blossom
with
this
its
objectification
and
through
the
imminent
unity
and
perfection
of
such
inclusion
is
revealed
as
essentially
infinite
with
equal
truth
we
may
affirm
that
the
notion
in
sealing
as
it
were
with
a
soul
the
real
existence
in
which
it
is
part
of
the
objective
world
is
itself
by
itself
freely
manifest
in
that
world
for
the
notion
will
not
suffer
that
external
existence
in
the
sphere
of
beauty
to
follow
as
it
would
otherwise
the
laws
that
therein
are
paramount
rather
it
determines
out
of
its
own
riches
the
articulation
and
form
of
its
appearance
therein
and
it
is
precisely
this
harmony
of
the
notion
with
the
mode
of
its
external
existence
which
constitutes
the
essential
life
of
beauty
and
the
bond
which
braces
all
together
no
less
than
the
power
behind
it
is
selfconscious
life
unity
soul
and
artistic
personality
b
we
conclude
then
that
if
we
consider
beauty
in
its
relation
to
conscious
life
on
the
subjective
side
that
is
it
is
neither
to
be
adequately
apprehended
by
an
intelligence
that
persists
in
the
unfree
medium
of
purely
finite
existence
nor
is
it
the
object
of
the
finite
will
we
will
enlarge
a
little
on
both
points
as
finite
intelligence
we
are
aware
in
feeling
of
the
inner
no
less
than
the
outer
objects
of
consciousness
we
observe
them
perceive
them
to
be
true
to
our
senses
allow
them
to
form
part
of
the
content
of
our
perceptions
concepts
and
finally
no
doubt
to
become
the
abstractions
which
our
understanding
presents
to
us
reflecting
on
their
appearance
and
endowing
them
with
the
abstract
form
of
universality
now
the
finiteness
and
absence
of
freedom
inseparable
from
this
mental
attitude
consists
in
the
assumption
that
the
things
perceived
are
selfsubsistent
we
direct
our
attention
to
these
objects
suffer
them
to
impress
us
form
our
ideas
of
them
possessed
with
the
faith
in
their
material
existence
as
objects
and
convinced
that
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
perceive
them
as
they
appear
to
our
passive
reception
to
preserve
in
short
the
formal
side
of
our
attention
intact
holding
such
unfettered
by
our
fancies
opinions
and
prejudices
in
thus
accepting
this
onesided
freedom
of
objects
we
posit
at
the
same
time
the
want
of
freedom
in
their
mental
apprehension
to
such
the
content
is
one
wholly
given
from
outside
and
instead
of
a
true
selfdetermination
through
difference
we
have
nothing
but
the
reception
and
acceptance
of
what
is
presented
as
a
part
of
the
objective
thing
we
would
arrive
at
truth
by
the
suppression
of
all
that
belongs
to
ourselves198
a
criticism
of
like
nature
though
the
defect
is
here
just
at
the
other
extreme
may
be
applied
to
the
finite
will
in
this
theory
interests
objects
intentions
and
conclusions
are
all
relegated
to
the
subject
whose
will
it
is
to
enforce
them
as
against
the
existence
and
properties
of
the
material
thing
this
it
can
only
do
by
the
annihilation
of
the
object
itself
or
at
least
in
so
far
as
it
can
modify
or
change
its
form
and
energies
by
transmuting
its
qualities
or
permitting
them
to
exercise
such
a
change
on
each
other
as
water
may
exercise
on
fire
fire
on
iron
iron
on
wood
and
so
forth
we
now
find
that
it
is
the
particular
things
which
the
subject
has
enrolled
in
its
service
as
things
to
be
regarded
and
treated
as
useful
which
in
their
turn
have
been
deprived
of
their
selfsubsistence
in
other
words
they
have
come
to
be
regarded
as
objects
whose
notion
and
meaning
is
not
their
own
but
derived
from
the
reflecting
consciousness
so
that
what
is
most
essential
to
them
is
precisely
this
relation
of
service
in
which
they
stand
to
the
subjective
purpose
that
is
our
own
intelligence
the
values
of
either
side
of
the
relation
are
thus
completely
reversed
the
objective
thing
has
lost
freedom
and
the
conscious
subject
secured
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
freedom
on
both
aspects
of
the
relation
is
owing
to
the
finitude
and
abstraction
it
implies
under
such
a
view
a
purely
supposititious
one
in
the
sphere
of
theory
here
it
is
the
assumed
independence
of
the
objective
world
which
creates
the
finitude
and
bondage
of
the
conscious
ego
in
that
of
the
practical
world
this
dependence
is
due
to
its
onesidedness
the
conflict
and
contradiction
of
its
aims
within
and
the
impulses
and
passions
which
press
from
without
no
less
than
to
the
unreconciled
opposition
of
a
world
of
objects
for
the
separation
and
opposition
of
these
two
aspects
of
one
whole
that
is
objects
and
relating
selfconscious
life
is
presupposed
in
and
indeed
is
an
accurate
definition
of
this
point
of
view
and
similarly
with
reference
to
the
lack
of
freedom
in
the
object
here
too
in
the
sphere
of
intelligible
conception
the
independence
of
the
object
is
assumed
but
the
freedom
assumed
is
only
apparent
for
it
is
only
posited
as
bare
objectivity
without
securing
the
presence
of
its
notion
as
the
unity
and
universality
of
the
conscious
subject
within
such
objectivity
it
still
remains
outside
it
every
object
thus
placed
external
to
the
notion
merely
exists
as
particularity
which
comes
back
to
us
in
external
guise
together
with
its
manifold
and
is
in
all
the
unlimited
scope
of
its
relations
through
its
contact
with
other
objects
subject
to
the
conditions
of
its
origin
change
opposing
force
and
final
overthrow
in
the
practical
world
the
dependence
of
the
object
is
expressly
in
this
view
assumed
and
the
opposition
of
the
thing
is
posited
in
definite
relation
to
volition
without
possessing
in
itself
the
power
of
ultimate
selfsubsistency
permitted
to
the
latter
c
the
apprehension
of
the
object
as
beautiful
unites
these
two
abstract
points
of
view
it
in
fact
annuls
the
onesidedness
of
both
whether
relatively
to
the
subject
of
consciousness
or
its
object
and
by
doing
so
cancels
the
finitude
and
lack
of
freedom
which
characterize
them
philosophically
regarded199
the
reason
is
this
that
the
object
is
not
apprehended
in
its
existence
as
an
isolated
thing
whose
notion
as
the
object
of
human
thought
is
removed
from
the
objectivity
which
belongs
to
it
as
something
outside
it
and
which
in
its
particular
reality
extends
and
is
dissipated
in
every
conceivable
direction
as
a
manifold
content
of
intelligible
relations
an
object
which
is
beautiful
suffers
its
own
notion
to
appear
as
realized
in
its
objective
presence
and
reveals
in
that
appearance
the
unity
and
life
inseparable
from
the
conscious
subject
for
this
reason
the
object
may
be
conceived
as
sweeping
back
into
the
curve
of
its
unity
that
impulse
of
continuous
externality
cancelling
its
dependence
on
other
objects
and
transmuting
to
our
vision
its
unfree
finitude
into
free
infinity
furthermore
the
ego
in
its
relation
to
the
object
of
beauty
ceases
to
be
merely
the
abstract
attention
or
sensuous
perception
and
the
floating
away
of
such
perceptions
into
equally
abstract
reflections
rather
it
is
itself
concretely
realized
in
this
object
being
at
once
the
unity
and
reality
of
its
notional
idea
and
uniting
for
itself
in
its
rounded
concreteness
that
which
has
hitherto
remained
as
abstractly
perceived
apart
in
the
ego
of
the
subject
of
perception
and
the
thing
perceived
coming
now
to
the
practical
import
of
this
relation
as
it
applies
to
the
object
of
beauty
we
have
already
drawn
attention
to
the
fact
at
some
length
that
in
the
contemplation
of
it
the
element
of
sensuous
passion
drops
away
all
personal
impulse
that
the
individual
may
feel
toward
the
object
is
done
away
with
through
that
very
aesthetic
contemplation
which
regards
it
as
selfsubsistent
in
itself
in
other
words
its
own
object
for
this
reason
the
purely
finite
relation
of
the
object
also
disappears
the
relation
that
is
in
which
it
subserved
as
a
means
for
their
realization
aims
which
were
foreign
to
it
and
towards
the
fulfilment
of
which
it
was
either
presented
as
unfree
or
was
compelled
to
take
up
however
strange
into
its
own
existence
at
the
same
time
that
relation
of
the
ego
in
the
practical
world
which
we
found
to
be
unfree
disappears
inasmuch
as
it
differentiates
itself
no
longer
in
subjective
motives
and
their
means
or
material
remaining
fixed
in
the
finite
relation
of
the
formal
ought
for
the
carrying
out
of
its
subjective
ends
in
the
object
but
is
here
confronted
with
the
notion
and
its
aim
completely
realized
we
may
say
then
that
the
aesthetic
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
is
a
liberal
education
a
portrayal
of
the
object
in
its
free
and
infinite
being
with
no
detracting
consideration
of
its
use
or
employment
for
finite
wants
and
purposes
further
the
object
as
a
thing
of
beauty
is
neither
under
force
or
compulsion
at
our
hands
nor
is
it
in
conflict
with
and
overcome
by
other
things
outside
it
it
is
of
the
essence
of
beauty
that
the
notion
end
and
soul
thereof
no
less
than
its
existent
form
and
variety
generally
manifest
themselves
out
of
their
own
intrinsic
wealth
rather
than
through
the
energy
of
something
outside
them
the
reason
of
this
lies
in
the
fact
already
insisted
upon
that
their
truth
consists
solely
in
the
unity
and
harmony
of
their
notion
with
their
objective
existence
and
inasmuch
as
the
notion
is
itself
concrete
totality
its
objective
reality
also
appears
as
a
manifestation
of
the
same
homogeneous
in
all
its
parts
which
as
thus
imbedded
in
the
notion
appear
to
fall
into
such
ideal
unity
and
animation
for
this
harmony
of
the
notion
and
its
envisagement
is
nothing
less
than
perfected
suffusion200
accordingly
the
exterior
form
and
shape
is
manifested
not
as
such
by
its
separation
from
other
material
or
as
an
impression
mechanically
related
to
aims
which
are
foreign
to
it
but
as
the
form
of
reality
wherein
the
notion
accommodates
itself
out
of
its
own
stuff
and
substance
finally
however
much
the
particular
aspects
parts
or
articulations
of
the
beautiful
object
are
presented
in
the
ideal
unity
of
the
notion
and
its
unified
envisagement
that
harmony
must
be
so
rendered
visible
to
sense
that
in
relation
to
one
another
they
preserve
the
semblance
of
selfsubsistent
freedom
in
other
words
they
must
not
only
possess
the
ideal
unity
of
the
notion
as
such
but
must
reflect
back
the
side
of
a
reality
which
is
substantially
objective
also
both
aspects
in
short
must
be
present
in
beautiful
objects
for
these
are
on
the
one
hand
the
necessity
posited
through
the
notion
and
discovered
in
the
harmonious
conclusion
of
these
particular
aspects
and
on
the
other
the
envisagement
of
their
freedom
as
essentially
one
with
the
whole
and
not
merely
that
of
the
unity
which
exists
between
the
parts
necessity
in
its
full
definition
means
the
just
relation
of
the
two
aspects
which
coalesce
so
completely
that
to
posit
one
is
to
posit
the
other
such
a
necessity
must
unquestionably
be
present
in
beautiful
objects
it
is
not
however
under
the
mode
of
necessity
that
it
appears
rather
it
should
conceal
itself
beneath
the
semblance
of
unintentional
accident
otherwise
the
particular
parts
of
such
a
real
presence
lose
the
position
they
should
occupy
according
to
their
own
real
existence
and
only
appear
in
the
service
of
their
ideal
unity
to
which
they
therefore
remain
in
abstract
subordination
in
virtue
of
the
freedom
and
infinitude
above
analysed
which
is
inherent
in
the
notion
of
beauty
whether
we
view
it
in
its
objective
presence
as
a
thing
of
beauty
or
under
its
aesthetic
contemplation
we
disengage
the
province
of
the
beautiful
from
the
relations
of
finite
condition
to
exalt
it
into
that
of
the
idea

the

beauty
is
the

of
the

its

reality

in
the
world
of

we
must
distinguish
between
the
modes
according
to
which
the

becomes

in
order
to
be
part
of
the
idea
a
in
the
first
place
the
notion
is
absorbed
so
immediately
in
pure
objectivity
that
in
its
character
of
subjective
and
ideal
unity
it
wholly
fails
to
assert
itself
and
passes
over
instead
as
a
thing
without
a
soul
into
the
raw
materia
presented
to
sense
the
purely
mechanical
or
physical
bodies
in
their
isolated
singularity
are
of
this
order
a
particular
metal
is
for
example
essentially
no
doubt
a
manifold
of
mechanical
and
physical
qualities
every
part
of
it
however
has
such
qualities
equally
in
itself
such
a
body
not
merely
fails
to
possess
any
entire
articulation
of
its
parts
in
the
sense
that
every
one
of
its
different
parts
receives
for
itself
a
particular
material
existence
but
even
the
negative
ideal
unity
of
such
differentiation
is
absent
which
might
assert
itself
as
animating
principle201
the
difference
here
is
a
purely
abstract
multiplicity
and
the
unity
posited
the
indifferent
equilibrium
of
identical
qualities
this
is
the
first
mode
of
the
existence
of
the
notion
the
differences
here
receive
no
independent
existence
and
the
ideal
unity
is
not
found
as
ideality
for
this
reason
such
isolated
bodies
are
essentially
defective
and
abstract
existences
b
natural
objects
of
a
higher
order
suffer
the
differences
asserted
by
the
notion
to
appear
as
free
so
that
each
one
as
external
to
another
is
itself
independently
existent
here
we
have
for
the
first
time
the
true
character
of
objectivity
objectivity
is
just
this
independent
assertion
of
the
segregated
differences
determined
by
the
notion
on
this
plane
of
existence
the
notion
asserts
itself
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
at
least
a
totality
of
its
differences
which
is
truly
realized
in
so
far
as
the
particular
bodies
while
they
each
severally
possess
independent
existence
for
themselves
are
at
the
same
time
members
of
one
inclusive
system
of
such
a
character
is
the
solar
system
in
one
aspect
of
them
the
sun
comets
moon
and
planets
appear
as
independent
heavenly
bodies
apart
from
one
another
in
another
however
they
derive
their
definite
character
from
being
parts
of
one
system
of
such
material
bodies
not
only
their
specific
modes
of
motion
but
also
their
physical
qualities
are
only
to
be
deduced
from
their
relation
to
this
system
this
nexus
which
binds
them
together
constitutes
that
inward
unity
which
relates
these
particular
existences
together
in
one
whole
but
further
than
this
in
this
conception
of
system
the
operation
of
the
notion
is
not
exhausted
in
the
existent
unity
of
independent
bodies
as
essential
parts
of
it
for
just
as
the

are

the

relates
them
to
the

to
assert
itself
as

this

in
other
words
differentiates
itself
from
the
multifold
particularity
of
those
objective
bodies
of
which
it
is
the
integrating
principle
and
on
this
plane
of
existence
it
is
differentiated
therefore
itself
against
such
a
particularity
as
real
independent
and
objective
existence
in
the
solar
system
the
sun
exists
over
against
all
particularity
related
to
that

as
such
a
unity
of
the
system
such
a
material
existence
of
the
ideal
unity
of
the
notion
is
still
very
defective
for
whereas
on
the
one
hand
we
have
this
unity
posited
in
its
reality
only
as
the
relation
or
material
connection
between
the
severally
independent
bodies
on
the
other
we
have
it
posited
as
a
body
which
belongs
to
that
system
whose
unity
in
opposition
to
its
real
differences
it
essentially
represents
the
sun
in
short
which
we
take
to
be202
the
soul
of
the
system
has
itself
an
independent
entity
apart
from
the
members
which
form
the
explicit
content
of
this
soul
it
is
itself
only
one
particular
mode
or
phase
of
the
notion
that
namely
of
unity
in
its
difference
from
the
actual
separation
of
the
several
parts
a
unity
which
remains
outside
itself
and
is
consequently
abstract
for
however
much
the
sun
by
virtue
of
its
physical
quality
is
plainly
a
principle
of
unity
the
illuminating
body
as
such
this
is
after
all
merely
an
abstract
identity
for
light
is
simple
undifferentiated
appearance
and
nothing
more
we
find
therefore
in
the
solar
system
the
unity
of
the
notion
indeed
objective
and
the
totality
of
its
differences
explicitly
realized
each
body
making
visible
one
particular
phase203
of
the
notion
but
here
too
it
lies
absorbed
in
its
objective
reality
and
it
fails
to
assert
itself
in
such
material
as
is
truly
inherent
and
explicit
ideality
the
form
of
its
existence
which
here
prevails
remains
the
independent
segregation
of
its
particular
phasal
units204
it
is
however
essential
to
the
true
existence
of
the
notion
that
the
differences
of
the
objectively
real
the
reality
that
is
to
say
of
the
separate
independent
parts
and
the
equally
independent
unity
that
is
therein
objectively
realized
should
as
such
be
together
brought
back
into
unity
only
thus
such
a
totality
of
innate
differences
can
make
wholly
explicit
either
the
notion
as
the
realized
differentiation
of
its
characteristics
or
at
the
same
time
release
each
particular
that
belongs
to
it
from
the
element
of
isolated
independence
which
it
cancels
by
enabling
the
ideality
in
which
these
differences
recover
their
subjective
unity
to
assert
itself
fully
as
the
universal
principle
of
their
animated
being
in
that
case
they
become
no
longer
parts
hanging
loosely
to
one
another
by
a
bond
that
still
leaves
their
particularity
unaffected
but
genuine
members
of
one
body
they
no
longer
possess
an
existence
in
their
isolated
singularity
but
retain
such
truly
in
the
ideal
unity
which
binds
them
together
only
in
such
an
organic
articulation
the
ideal
unity
of
the
notion
is
present
to
the
parts
thus
integrated
it
is
at
once
their
support
and
immanent
soul
here
for
the
first
time
the
notion
is
not
overwhelmed
in
objective
reality
but
passes
over
into
actual
existence
as
the
inward
identity
and

it
essentially
is

of
natures
manifestation
is
a
determinate
existence
of
the
idea
and
the
idea
as
thus
manifested
in
nature
is
life
dead
or
inorganic
nature
is
not
adequate
to
express
the
idea
only
the
organic
life
of
nature
unfolds
its
reality
for
in
life
we
shall
find
first
that
the
objective
reality
of
the
notion
as
differentiated
is
presented
as
such
reality
secondly
however
that
the
negation
of
such
differences
is
entirely
one
of
distinction
in
that
reality205
the
ideal
subjectivity
of
the
notion
overcoming
to
itself
this
very
reality
thirdly
the
unifying
principle
of
animation
is
now
the
positive
appearance
of
the
notion
in
the
form
of
its
bodily
substance
that
is
to
say
the
form
of
infinity
which
is
sufficiently
powerful
to
assert
itself
thus
formally
in
its
content

if
we
ask
ordinary
consciousness206
for
a
definition
of
life
we
have
two
determinations
presented
either
the
imaginative
conception
of
it
as
bodily
life
or
as
soullife
in
the
same
view
we
distinguish
these
two
determinations
with
qualities
peculiarly
belonging
to
each
this
contrast
we
set
up
between
soul
and
body
is
also
of
great
importance
in
the
more
philosophical
consideration
of
our
subject
and
it
is
no
less
part
of
our
inquiry
to
investigate
it
at
the
same
time
we
would
point
out
that
the
philosophical
interest
concentrates
itself
quite
as
much
on
the
unity
which
exists
between
soul
and
body
a
part
of
this
inquiry
which
a
really
adequate
survey
of
the
subject
has
at
all
times
found
beset
with
the
greatest
difficulties
it
is
however
precisely
in
virtue
of
this
unity
that
life
is
the
first
genuine
appearance
of
the
idea
in
nature
we
must
consequently
apprehend
the
identity
of
soul
and
body
as
no
fortuitous
connection207
but
a
union
of
profounder
significance
in
other
words
we
must
recognize
the
body
and
its
members
as
the
objective
existence
of
the
notion
itself
in
systematic
articulation
which
in
the
members
of
the
living
organism
secures
an
objective
existence
for
its
determinate
features
analogously
no
doubt
if
on
a
higher
plane
to
the
facts
presented
by
the
solar
system
within
this
real
existence
the
notion
asserts
itself
in
like
manner
as
the
ideal
unity
of
all
these
determinate
parts
this
ideal
unity
is
the
soul
the
soul
is
the
substantive
unity
and
interfused
universality
which
is
no
less
a
simple
relation
of
selfdetermining
than
it
is
ideal
beingforitself
or
selfcoherent
totality
this
is
the
higher
view
of
the
union
between
soul
and
body
to
put
it
in
other
words
both
are
not
merely
distinct
aspects
set
side
by
side
they
are
one
and
the
same
totality
of
identical
determinants
just
as
the
idea
generally
can
only
be
grasped
in
its
explicit
reality
as
the
notion
evolving
itself
as
such208
in
which
conception
the
differentiation
and
unity
of
both
sides
that
is
both
the
notion
and
its
objective
reality
are
inseparably
present
in
the
same
way
life
must
be
conceived
as
the
unity
of
both
soul
and
body
and
further
the
subjective
no
less
than
substantive
unity
of
soul
within
the
body
is
presented
us
and
exemplified
in
feeling
the
feeling
of
a
living
organism
is
that
is
to
say
not
merely
an
independent
product
of
a
particular
member
but
it
is
also
this
ideal
and
simple
unity
of
the
entire
organism
it
is
carried
through
every
member
of
the
body
is
felt
throughout
in
more
than
a
hundred
places
at
once
and
indeed
to
put
it
shortly
rather
than
saying
there
are
many
thousand
sensitive
points209
in
a
single
organism
we
should
more
justly
say
there
is
but
one
namely
the
subject
of
consciousness
and
inasmuch
as
the
animating
principle
of
organic
nature
includes
in
itself
this
distinction
between
the
real
existence
of
the
organic
members
and
the
abstract
or
simple
selfcoherence
within
such
parts
which
we
call
the
growing
soul
mediating
between
them
both
by
virtue
of
its
inherent
unity
such
a
principle
of
life
stands
on
a
higher
plane
than
that
of
inorganic
nature
only
with
life
is
the
idea
existent
and
only
thus
is
the
idea
truth
no
doubt
even
in
the
organic
world
this
truth
can
be
extinguished
we
find
the
body
unable
to
perfect
its
essential
ideality
and
animating
energy
such
is
the
case
in
disease
here
we
find
the
notion
deprived
of
its
controlling
sovereignty
and
other
powers
are
potent
with
it
such
a
life
is
however
defective
and
crippled
it
merely
continues
because
the
inadequacy
of
reality
to
the
notion
has
not
reached
the
point
of
absolute
contradiction
it
is
still
only
relatively
valid
once
assume
that
all
harmony
between
the
two
sides
is
broken
that
all
genuine
articulation
of
the
members
of
the
body
and
their
true
identity
has
dropped
away
and
life
is
dissolved
in
death
the
several
members
are
now
mere
appendages
to
each
other
with
no
principle
of
life
to
hold
them
in
unsevered
unity

we
must
add
that
when
we
stated
the
soul
is
the
totality
of
the
notion
regarded
as
the
subjective
and
ideal
unity
the
body
on
the
other
hand
as
distinguished
by
its
members
is
the
same
totality
but
rather
in
its
material
aspect
as
the
juxtaposition
and
sensuous
accretion
of
all
the
several
parts
affirming
at
the
same
time
that
both
soul
and
body
are
posited
as
one
in
the
living
organism
there
is
no
doubt
something
contradictory
in
the
statement
for
the
ideal
unity
so
far
from
being
this
material
juxtaposition
of
parts
in
which
each
particularity
possesses
its
independent
consistency
and
exclusive
character
is
rather
in
direct
antithesis
to
such
external
reality
that
what
is
diametrically
opposed
should
nevertheless
be
identical
is
obviously
a
contradiction
in
terms
the
man
however
who
declares
the
nonexistence
of
anything
from
the
fact
that
it
carries
in
our
notion
of
it
a
contradiction
which
implies
the
identity
of
opposed
antitheses
simply
excludes
life
itself
from
the
idea
of
existence
for
the
force
of
life
and
still
more
the
power
of
spirit
mind
consists
in
this
very
movement
namely
to
assert
the
law
of
contradiction
inherent
within
them
to
bear
the
burden
thereof
and
to
overcome
it
this
affirmation
and
resolution
of
the
contradiction
which
obtains
between
the
ideal
unity
and
material
juxtaposition
of
the
members
constitutes
the
appointed
process
of
life
itself
and
life
is
simply
process
and
this
process
of
life
includes
an
activity
which
has
two
distinct
functions
on
the
one
hand
it
has
continually
to
affirm
the
material
existence
of
the
physical
distinctions210
among
the
members
of
the
organism
thus
determined
on
the
other
just
in
proportion
as
such
distinctions
grow
obdurate
in
their
independent
particularity
and
tend
to
remain
fixed
in
absolute
separation
from
each
other
it
has
to
make
good
once
more
that
universal
ideality
which
is
the
principle
of
their
life
this
is
the
idealism
of
lifes
process
philosophy
is
not
the
only
idealism
far
from
it
nature
herself
in
her
domain
of
actuality
creates
in
the
lifeprocess
just
that
which
the
philosophy
of
idealism
completes
in
the
world
of
contemplative
thought
only
where
we
have
these
two
aspects
of
one
activity
that
is
the
constant
realization
of
the
corporeal
definition
of
the
organism
no
less
than
the
synthetic
affirmation
of
such
material
presentment
in
the
ideal
unity
which
it
is
as
one
with
the
notion211
then
and
only
then
we
have
the
completed
process
of
life
whose
more
primitive
forms212
however
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
through
this
unity
of
lifes
energy
in
both
its
branches
all
the
members
of
the
organism
are
up
held
in
their
integrity
and
continually
flushed
anew
with
the
ideality
of
their
life
this
ideality
is
furthermore
declared
by
the
organic
parts
in
the
fundamental
law
of
their
being
that
this
unity
of
life
is
not
so
much
an
accidental
quality
as
on
the
contrary
the
substance
of
it
in
this
alone
they
are
able
to
preserve
their
specific
character
this
it
is
which
precisely
constitutes
the
difference
between
the
part
of
a
mere
conglomerate
and
the
member
of
an
organism
the
particular
parts
of
a
house
for
example
the
stones
windows
and
so
forth
remain
just
what
they
are
whether
they
form
part
of
the
structure
of
a
house
or
whether
they
do
not
their
relationship
to
one
another
is
quite
indifferent
and
the
conceptual
notion
remains
in
their
case
a
purely
external
form
which
possesses
no
life
in
these
parts
raising
them
to
the
ideality
of
a
subjective
unity
the
members
of
an
organism
have
it
is
true
an
external
reality
but
for
all
that
it
is
the
notion
of
life
which
constitutes
the
inward
nay
the
characteristic
being
of
such
reality
a
reality
which
is
not
expressed
through
one
external
form
uniting
them
but
in
the
ideal
coherence
of
their
parts
in
one
living
whole
for
this
reason
the
limbs
have
no
such
reality
as
belongs
to
the
stones
of
a
building
or
the
planets
moon
and
comets
in
the
solar
system
their
reality
is
one
wholly
within
the
content
of
the
organism
and
all
appearance
to
the
contrary
is
as
such
ideally
imposed
on
them
dissever
the
hand
from
the
body
and
it
loses
its
independent
existence
as
a
member
of
the
organism
which
made
it
what
it
was
its
activity
form
and
colour
all
that
constitutes
it
is
at
once
changed
it
enters
the
process
of
corruption
and
ultimately
ceases
to
exist213
consistent
character
it
only
possesses
as
a
limb
of
organic
life
reality
only
in
constant
reunion
with
that
ideal
unity
which
sustains
it
and
that
is
just
the
superior
mode
of
reality
which
the
living
organism
possesses
in
itself
the
real
or
positive
is
for
ever
being
set
up
as
both
the
negation
of
itself
and
withal
the
ideal
resumption
of
itself
such
ideality
constituting
in
fact
both
the
maintenance
and
specific
character
of
the
mode
under
which
each
of
the
separate
parts
of
the
bodily
presence
are
associated
together

the
reality
then
which
the
idea
wins
for
itself
in
the
life
of
nature
is
reality
as
a
phenomenal
process
such
an
appearance
stated
in
its
simplest
terms
is
this
that
a
reality
exists
but
its
potential
being214
is
not
immediately
in
its
possession
rather
it
is
at
the
same
time
negatively
affirmed215
in
the
particular
form
that
belongs
to
it
the
negation
of
the
immediately
external
and
particular
members
of
a
body
is
not
only
a
negative
relative
relation
as
the
activity
of
the
inherent
idealization216
but
is
as
such
a
positive
realization217
hitherto
we
have
considered
the
particular
objects
of
the
real
as
positive
in
their
selfexclusive
particularity
this
independence
however
is
negated
in
the
living
object
and
the
ideal
unity
asserted
within
the
bodily
organism
is
alone
found
to
assert
over
itself
the
full
force
of
positive
determination
such
a
positive
ideality
in
the
principle
of
negation
it
asserts
is
the
soul
on
the
appearance
of
the
soul
in
the
body
we
have
at
once
such
an
affirmative
presence
as
the
one
indicated
the
soul
not
merely
asserts
itself
as
a
power
against
the
subdivision
of
the
bodily
members
it
is
their
plastic
creator218
which
preserves
as
inward
and
ideal
that
which
is
externally
minted
in
the
shape
of
physical
members
and
consequently
it
is
this
very
positive
and
ideal
inward219
which
appears
in
the
outer
structure
in
other
words
the
external
so
far
as
it
is
a
mere
external
is
a
mere
abstraction
a
mere
aspect
that
is
untrue
for
the
whole
in
organic
life
the
external
we
are
confronted
with
is
an
externality
through
which
the
inward
is
made
visible
the
outward
that
is
to
say
declares
itself
in
its
potential
nature
as
that
inward
which
is
its
notion
further
to
this
notion
appertains
the
reality
in
which
it
as
notion
is
made
visible
inasmuch
however
as
in
the
objective
world
the
notion
strictly
as
such
is
the
principle
of
subjective
life
and
selfdetermined
life
becoming
explicit
in
its
own
objective
reality220
life
exists
only
as
a
living
thing
an
individual
subject
it
is
only
with
life
thus
concentrated
to
a
point
that
we
find
this
negating
centrum
of
unity
and
it
is
negative
in
this
sense
that
the
ideal
explicitly
selfunified
totality221
can
only
now
stand
forth
in
its
reality
by
virtue
of
this
principle
of
ideality
being
asserted
through
the
differentiation
of
its
positive
presence
together
with
which
the
ideal
unity
of
such
totality
is
at
the
same
time
incorporated
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
to
make
clear
this
aspect
of
the
principle
of
subjectivity
it
is
only
as
the
single
living
thing
thus
unified
by
such
a
principle
that
life
is
actually
present
if
we
inquire
further
in
what
manner
the
idea
is
manifested
within
the
actual
life
of
such
living
individuals
our
survey
will
be
as
follows
first
this
principle
of
life
will
be
realized
as
the
totality
of
an
organism
possessing
bodily
shape
secondly
this
physical
shape
is
not
presented
as
a
rigid
product222
but
as
a
continous
process
of
ideal
generation
in
which
a
living
soul
asserts
itself
thirdly
the
changes
and
determinations
through
which
this
totality
passes
are
not
imposed
externally
to
it
but
are
changes
of
form
which
are
evolved
from
its
inherent
nature
imposed
on
itself
and
for
itself
in
a
process
wherein
it
stands
selfdetermined
as
the
subjective
unity
no
less
than
the
ultimate
end
of
its
being
this
free
selfsubsistence
of
the
subjective
principle
of
life
is
especially
exemplified
in
the
spontaneous
motion
of
a
living
organism
the
inanimate
bodies
of
inorganic
nature
are
fettered
to
the
conditions
of
space
which
limits
them
to
one
place
or
they
are
only
moved
from
it
by
external
forces
the
motion
in
short
does
not
originate
in
themselves
and
when
it
is
visible
upon
them
it
appears
as
an
energy
which
is
foreign
to
them
to
remove
which
the
only
force
they
exert
is
that
of
reaction
and
if
the
motion
of
the
planets
with
similar
phenomena
appear
to
be
otherwise
produced
such
are
at
least
wholly
fettered
by
natural
laws
and
their
abstract
necessity
the
living
animal
on
the
contrary
in
its
freedom
of
motion
negatives
this
enforced
limitation
to
one
spot
by
virtue
of
its
own
activity
it
is
through
such
selfdetermination
the
continuous
liberation
of
itself
from
the
material
isolation
and
for
the
same
reason
it
is
in
this
freedom
of
motion
if
only
in
a
subordinate
degree
the
release
of
itself
from
the
former
abstractness
referable
to
the
particular
modes
of
motion
their
direction
and
their
speed
under
a
yet
closer
view
moreover
the
animal
regarded
by
itself
in
its
organism
presents
the
same
sensuous
matter
that
is
moved
and
here
too
life
is
as
before
a
freedom
of
motion
within
this
organic
reality
evidenced
in
the
flow
of
blood
and
the
movement
of
the
limbs
motion
however
is
not
the
only
expression
of
animated
life
the
free
tones
of
the
voice
of
animals
which
are
unknown
in
the
inorganic
world
where
bodies
merely
roar
and
clatter
through
the
blow
of
objects
external
to
them
these
already
present
to
us
the
higher
expression
of
animated
subjectivity
the
most
intimate
and
vital
expression
of
such
ideal
activity
is
however
brought
before
us
when
we
find
the
living
individual
able
to
concentrate
itself
as
individuality
over
against
the
objective
world
while
at
the
same
time
it
appropriates
and
transfigures
that
world
for
its
own
and
this
is
accomplished
in
part
through
observation
by
means
of
vision
and
partly
for
practical
purposes
in
so
far
as
such
an
individual
brings
the
outer
world
into
subjection
to
himself
utilizes
the
same
assimilates
it
as
a
means
of
nourishment
and
in
this
manner
continually
reproduces
his
individuality
in
that
objective
alterum
such
a
process
of
course
as
it
ascends
through
stronger
organisms
assumes
more
and
more
emphatic
degrees
of
unsatisfied
desire
assimilation
satisfaction
or
satiety
such
then
are
the
activities
in
which
the
notion
of
animated
life
makes
itself
apparent
moreover
the
principle
of
ideality
thus
rendered
visible
is
not
merely
the
result
of
our
reflection
it
is
objectively
real
itself
in
the
living
subject
whose
existence
consequently
we
may
go
so
far
as
to
call
an
objective
idealism
and
it
is
the
soul
as
before
stated
which
as
this
ideal
energy
brings
about
its
own
manifestation223
always
reducing
the
purely
external
reality
of
the
body
to
an
appearance
and
thereby
affirming
itself
as
objective
totality
in
that
very
bodily
shape
2
now
it
is
as
the
idea
made
objectively
visible
to
the
senses
that
the
animated
life
of
nature
is
beautiful
in
so
far
that
is
to
say
as
the
truth
or
the
idea
presented
in
the
form
of
nature
where
under
it
first
appears
in
other
words
life
is
immediately
given
in
the
particular
shape
of
reality
adequate
to
it
owing
however
to
its
sensuous
immediacy
the
living
beauty
of
nature
is
neither
beautiful
for
itself
nor
is
the
beauty
strictly
that
which
is
the
outcome
of
itself
a
product
that
is
of
its
purely
objective
appearance
the
beauty
of
nature
is
only
beautiful
for
another
that
is
for
us
the
consciousness
that
apprehends
its
beauty
the
question
therefore
arises
in
what
way
and
by
virtue
of
what
characteristics
the
principle
of
life
appears
to
us
beautiful
in
its
immediate
existence
a
if
we
look
at
the
practical
way
in
which
a
living
object
becomes
visible
and
preserves
itself
the
first
thing
which
rivets
our
attention
is
spontaneous
motion
this
motion
regarded
simply
as
motion
is
nothing
more
than
the
entirely
abstract
freedom
of
motion
from
place
to
place
and
from
time
to
time
which
we
find
exemplified
in
the
spontaneous
but
entirely
haphazard
movements
of
animal
life
in
music
and
the
dance
we
have
it
is
true
motion
in
its
generic
significance
but
here
motion
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
chance
and
impulse
but
it
exhibits
the
laws
which
regulate
it
it
is
defined
complete
in
itself
and
subject
to
measure
and
it
is
all
this
though
we
still
abstract
from
it
the
significance
whereof
it
is
the
beautiful
expression
if
we
again
interpret
the
motion
of
animals
as
the
realization
of
an
aim
originating
within
themselves
this
excited
impulse
is
still
entirely
accidental
an
end
of
most
restricted
import
if
we
further
extend
our
survey
and
conceive
such
motion
as
the
activity
and
working
together
of
all
parts
of
the
animal
organism
towards
a
definite
purpose
we
shall
merely
find
that
such
a
conception
is
rendered
possible
by
our
own
effort
of
imagination224
the
case
is
just
the
same
if
we
reflect
upon
the
way
in
which
an
animal
gratifies
its
physical
wants
obtains
nourishment
through
the
organs
which
grasp
it
consume
it
digest
it
and
generally
is
a
subject
of
the
process
which
preserves
its
life
for
in
this
case
also
we
have
either
only
before
us
single
desires
and
their
spontaneous
and
haphazard
gratification
in
which
the
inward
activity225
of
the
organism
is
not
present
at
all
or
at
least
all
these
activities
and
their
means
of
expression
have
become
the
subject
of
our
imaginative
reflection
which
is
at
pains
to
understand
such
a
process
by
relating
it
to
definite
ends
and
to
establish
a
harmony
between
aims
assumed
to
belong
to
the
animal
itself
and
the
organs
which
fulfill
them
we
shall
rather
find
that
neither
the
sensuous
perception
of
single
haphazard
appetites
arbitrary
movements
and
efforts
towards
selfsatisfaction
nor
the
fanciful
consideration
of
the
animal
organism
as
one
directed
by
purpose
will
present
to
us
purely
animal
life
as
a
part
of
the
beauty
of
nature
the
beauty
consists
in
the
appearance
of
individual
form
both
in
repose
and
motion
quite
apart
from
the
relation
of
its
selfgratification
to
any
purpose
thus
subserved
as
it
is
apart
from
the
entirely
isolated
contingency
of
selfimposed
movement226
such
beauty
is
related
to
the
form
alone
because
it
is
only
as
such
that
it
is
the
external
appearance
in
which
the
objective
idealism
of
the
principle
of
life
makes
itself
known
to
us
as
a
thing
perceived
and
contemplated
upon
through
the
senses
thought
apprehends
this
objective
idealism
in
the
medium
of
its
notion
appropriating
the
same
in
the
element
of
universality
which
belongs
to
it
albeit
the
contemplation
of
its
beauty
is
inseparably
bound
with
its
phenomenal
reality
and
this
reality
is
the
external
form
of
the
articulated
organism
which
is
in
our
view
of
it
quite
as
much
determinate
particularity
as
it
is
a
semblance
namely
that
of
the
physical
manifold
of
the
separate
members
which
can
only
form
part
of
the
concrete
totality
of
the
living
form
under
the
guise
of
phenomenal
appearance
b
from
the
explanation
of
the
notion
of
life
already
given
we
may
deduce
more
narrowly
the
form
of
this
appearance
as
follows
the
form
is
one
of
spatial
extension
limitation
and
configuration
distinguished
through
its
various
shape
colour
and
motion
being
in
fact
a
manifold
of
such
distinctions
if
however
the
organism
which
manifests
these
differences
is
a
living
organism
it
will
inevitably
appear
that
the
organism
does
not
derive
its
true
existence
from
such
a
manifold
and
its
physical
configurations
this
is
brought
about
by
the
fact
that
the
different
parts
which
are
apprehended
by
us
through
the
senses
are
at
the
same
time
conjoined
together
in
one
totality
they
appear
consequently
as
the
members
of
one
individual
existence
which
is
a
unity
of
such
differences
and
which
not
merely
possesses
them
in
their
difference
but
as
parts
of
one
homogeneous
whole

in
the
first
place
however
this
unity
will
assert
itself
as
the
purposeless
identity
of
such
differences
that
is
to
say
with
no
abstract
relation
to
any
causal
end
whatever
the
parts
in
such
a
case
are
not
rendered
visible
to
sense
merely
as
a
means
to
or
in
the
service
of
some
defined
purpose
nor
are
they
able
to
fix
the
determinate
relation
of
form
and
structure
which
they
occupy
one
over
against
the
other

rather
the
contrary
is
the
case
for
in
the
second
place
the
bodily
members
have
for
our
senseperception
the
appearance
of
being
quite
accidental
in
their
form
in
other
words
the
determination
of
one
appears
to
be
quite
indifferent
to
that
of
another
in
other
words
we
can
never
conclude
because
one
has
a
certain
form
another
will
have
the
same
as
would
be
the
case
if
a
material
uniformity
was
clear
between
them
where
uniformity
is
the
rule
an
abstract
determination
of
some
kind
of
form
size
or
whatever
it
may
be
is
the
property
of
all
parts
the
windows
of
a
building
for
example
are
all
of
one
size
or
at
least
are
placed
together
in
one
row
or
we
may
illustrate
the
same
similarity
with
the
uniform
worn
by
all
soldiers
belonging
to
one
regiment
we
have
various
parts
of
such
clothing
differing
in
colour
texture
and
the
rest
but
their
formal
opposition
is
no
matter
of
chance
each
has
its
causal
connection
with
some
other
it
is
there
because
the
other
is
there
neither
is
there
here
any
complete
distinction
of
form
nor
any
unique
independence
wholly
asserted
with
the
individual
organism
of
life
the
case
is
entirely
otherwise
here
every
part
is
absolutely
distinguished
the
nose
from
the
forehead
the
mouth
from
the
cheek
the
breast
from
the
neck
the
arms
from
the
legs
and
so
on
inasmuch
as
for
our
senseperception
every
member
possesses
its
unique
form
rather
than
one
which
belongs
to
another
or
one
which
is
determined
by
that
of
another
the
members
appear
as
selfsubsistent
parts
and
for
this
reason
free
and
spontaneous227
for
the
material
juxtaposition
of
the
parts
alone
throws
no
light
upon
their
particular
form

thirdly
it
is
obvious
there
must
be
for
our
imaginative
perception
a
more
inward
bond
of
connection
present
in
the
selfsubsistence
of
the
organism
if
the
unity
is
not
offered
us
in
its
rational
spatial
temporal
or
quantitative
relations
such
as
are
presented
in
the
examples
of
uniformity
referred
to
which
as
we
have
seen
the
unique
particularity
of
the
parts
can
extinguish
this
identity
is
not
sensuous
and
immediately
present
to
perception
in
the
way
the
distinction
between
the
members
is
presented
it
is
rather
a
secret
and
inward
bond
of
necessity
and
harmonious
relation
between
the
members
and
their
form
if
it
were
only
inward
quite
out
of
reach
of
our
vision
such
a
necessary
unity
would
be
apprehended
only
in
thought
removed
from
our
senseperception
altogether
in
such
a
case
however
it
would
fail
to
enter
into
the
beautiful
object
of
our
vision
and
what
we
found
as
such
in
the
living
object
would
cease
to
be
the
idea
in
its
own
objective
and
phenomenal
reality
such
a
unity
must
consequently
enter
into
what
is
externally
perceived
although
it
is
as
the
ideal
principle
of
life
within
it
not
entirely
apparent
to
sense
or
confined
in
spatial
dimensions
it
appears
in
fact
in
the
individual
totality
as
the
universal
ideality
of
its
members
constituting
thus
the
fundamental
basis
which
supports
and
holds
them
together
the
subject
of
the
living
subject
and
this
subjective
unity
in
organic
life
finds
its
first
direct
expression
in
feeling
in
the
emotional
life
the
soul
finds
its
true
expression
as
soul
for
soul
the
mere
juxtaposition
of
limbs
have
no
real
truth
and
in
the
presence
of
its
subjective
ideality
the
purely
spatial
multiplicity
of
external
configuration
ceases
to
exist
such
a
manifold
with
its
unique
differentiations
its
organic
articulation
of
parts228
is
no
doubt
presupposed
but
when
and
in
so
far
as
the
soul
expresses
itself
through
such
in
feeling
the
more
inward
unity
everpresent
to
life
asserts
itself
equally
as
the
dissolution
of
all
absolute
independence
between
the
physical
parts
which
reveal
now
not
merely
their
materia
but
also
that
wave
of
animation
which
fuses
all
in
their
soul
c
to
start
with
however
we
must
observe
that
the
emotional
expression
of
soullife
neither
offers
us
the
visual
impression
of
any
necessary
interdependence
between
the
separate
members
nor
indeed
the
perception
of
an
identity
which
is
necessary
between
such
physical
articulation
and
the
subjective
unity
conferred
on
it
by
simple
feeling
we
will
investigate
this
more
narrowly

if
indeed
the
form
and
only
the
form
renders
in
some
way
visible
this
inward
harmony
and
its
necessity
it
may
be
because
we
look
upon
this
juxtaposition
as
the
habitual
relation
of
such
members
a
connection
which
brings
to
our
view
some
specific
type
and
the
oftrepeated
formal
exemplifications
of
such
a
type
but
the
necessity
of
custom
is
after
all
only
a
subjective
necessity229
according
to
such
a
principle
we
may
find
certain
animals
ugly
for
no
other
reason
than
that
we
find
in
them
an
organism
which
differs
from
our
ordinary
experience
or
runs
contrary
to
it
for
this
reason
we
call
the
organisms
of
certain
animals
bizarre
in
so
far
as
the
way
in
which
their
organs
are
related
together
is
foreign
to
what
is
more
common
to
our
experience
or
entirely
contradicts
it
fishes
whose
bodies
are
in
size
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
length
of
tail
or
those
in
which
we
find
eyes
together
on
one
side
of
the
head
only
are
an
example
in
the
world
of
plants
we
are
already
prepared
to
find
many
such
strange
departures
from
type
although
the
cactus
with
its
spines
and
the
more
rectilinear
shaping
of
its
angular
junctures230
may
still
arouse
our
wonder
the
more
a
man
is
educated
however
in
all
branches
of
natural
history
the
more
able
he
will
be
to
recognize
in
their
truth
the
subordination
of
all
parts
of
organic
life
and
carry
in
the
memory
the
greatest
variety
of
types
in
their
proper
classification
and
the
less
anything
he
may
observe
will
surprise
him

a
profounder
penetration
into
this
correlation
of
the
parts
will
however
in
the
second
place
tend
to
give
us
that
truer
insight
competent
to
determine
from
one
of
the
parts
the
entire
form
to
which
it
must
belong
cuvier
is
a
famous
example
of
such
aptitude
a
man
of
science
who
by
the
examination
of
a
single
bone
whether
fossil
or
otherwise
was
able
to
specify
at
once
by
its
characteristics
the
kind
of
animal
to
which
it
belonged
an
excellent
illustration
this
of
ex
ungue
leonem
so
from
a
claw
or
a
thigh
bone
we
may
discover
the
conformation
of
the
teeth
or
vice
versa
from
the
teeth
that
of
the
hipbone
or
that
of
the
vertebral
column
such
a
profound
synthesis
of
the
type
and
the
knowledge
it
implies
carries
us
however
beyond
habitual
experience
only
we
must
assume
to
render
it
possible
previous
thought
and
the
systematic
arrangement
of
the
isolated
facts
of
science
our
example
cuvier
had
no
doubt
secured
from
previous
experience
a
determinate
content
and
some
specific
quality
which
prevailed
in
each
generic
conception
and
asserted
itself
as
a
unity
of
principle
in
all
particulars
however
distinct
and
so
enabled
him
to
recognize
their
affinity
such
a
specific
quality
is
that
of
flesheating
which
is
then
the
determinating
principle
of
the
form
of
the
other
members
of
the
organism
to
which
it
belongs
a
flesheating
animal
requires
teeth
and
jaws
of
exceptional
vigour
when
hunting
it
will
require
claws
to
seize
its
prey
mere
hoofs
are
insufficient
here
in
short
is
a
quality
which
necessarily
determines
for
us
the
form
and
principle
of
affinity
among
all
the
organic
members
a
conception
of
such
a
typical
character
is
the
ordinary
one
we
form
of
the
strength
of
an
eagle
or
a
lion
we
may
no
doubt
find
something
both
beautiful
and
instructive231
in
this
way
of
regarding
the
animal
world
in
so
far
as
we
derive
from
it
some
unified
idea
of
its
configuration
which
is
not
a
mere
repetition
of
that
unity
in
all
the
parts
but
gives
full
value
to
the
distinctions
they
possess
for
all
that
it
must
be
remembered
the
dominant
factor
of
this
survey
is
not
the
perception
of
our
senses
but
the
generic
thought
of
our
minds
with
which
it
is
made
to
conform
reviewed
in
this
light
we
ought
not
to
say
that
we
find
the
object
as
such
beautiful
but
rather
attribute
that
beauty
to
the
reflection
of
our
own
minds
upon
it
and
if
we
examine
these
reflections
more
closely
we
shall
find
they
are
after
all
a
deduction
of
our
principle
of
unity
from
a
limited
aspect
of
the
organic
whole
we
concentrate
our
attention
for
example
on
the
mode
in
which
it
is
nourished
ie
whether
such
an
animal
is
carnivorous
or
herbivorous
through
such
a
limited
determination
we
are
still
removed
from
a
vision
of
the
coalescent
unity
of
the
whole
we
identified
with
the
notion
the
soul
itself

the
truth
is
we
can
only
in
this
sphere
bring
before
our
consciousness
the
entire
unity
of
life
by
means
of
our
thought
and
grasp
of
reason
in
the
natural
world
the
soul
in
its
full
activity
is
not
found
that
is
to
say
the
subjective
unity
in
its
pure
ideality
does
not
exist
there
for
a
selfconsciousness
if
however
by
means
of
thought
we
endeavour
to
grasp
the
nature
of
soullife
according
to
its
essential
notion
we
shall
find
two
aspects
under
which
we
may
regard
it
first
as
the
form
subject
to
such
a
principle
of
animation
secondly
as
the
notion
of
soul
for
thought
in
all
that
the
conception
implies
such
a
complete
grasp
of
its
true
nature
is
not
possible
in
the
sensuous
perception
of
the
objects
of
beauty
such
must
neither
pass
before
us
as
thought
nor
must
we
allow
the
interest
of
thought
as
such
to
form
a
barrier
of
difference
or
opposition
between
itself
and
the
vision
revealed
to
us
we
are
left
then
with
no
alternative
but
to
consider
under
this
point
of
view
the
object
as
wholly
presented
to
sense
we
must
assume
that
in
the
sphere
of
nature
a
sensuous
perception
of
the
natural
form
is
our
genuine
mode
of
contemplating
the
beautiful
sense
that
is
the
masterkey232
to
the
position
a
word
which
in
itself
is
interpreted
in
two
opposed
senses
in
the
first
place
we
may
indicate
thereby
the
organs
of
immediate233
perception
secondly
by
the
sense
of
a
thing
we
may
refer
to
the
significance
or
the
element
of
thought
and
the
universal
within
it
in
this
way
sense
is
related
on
one
side
to
the
immediate
externality
of
existence
and
on
the
other
to
its
inward
or
essential
nature
a
sensuous
perception
of
that
existence
in
fact
preserves
both
sides
in
unity
or
rather
in
one
direction
so
presents
the
aspect
that
is
opposed
to
it
in
the
immediate
sense
vision
as
to
include
therein
both
the
essence
and
notion
of
the
object
but
for
the
reason
that
it
combines
these
opposed
determinations
in
unfractured
unity
the
notion
is
not
presented
as
such
to
consciousness
but
is
rather
to
be
dimly
foreshadowed
there234
we
accept
for
example
as
a
determinate
fact
the
existence
of
three
realms
of
nature
which
we
define
as
that
of
the
mineral
world
that
of
plants
and
finally
that
of
animals
we
can
conclude
from
this
as
already
foreshadowed
by
its
truth
regarded
as
a
process
rising
from
plane
to
plane
that
there
is
an
inward
necessity
inherent
in
the
notional
articulation
of
its
divisions
and
do
not
confine
ourselves
only
to
the
purely
imaginative
conception
of
it
as
a
world
conforming
on
its
exterior
side
only
to
a
final
end
in
the
same
way
when
confronted
with
the
variety
of
the
external
presentment
in
each
of
these
realms
the
senseperception
surmises
a
controlling
unity
intelligible
to
mind
a
progress
subject
to
laws
of
thought
visible
no
less
in
the
formation
of
mountain
ranges
than
in
the
orderly
succession
of
plantlife
and
of
the
animal
races
the
same
tendency
is
presupposed
when
after
an
examination
of
the
form
of
any
particular
animal
organism
an
insects
for
example
as
subdivided
into
head
body
abdomen
and
extremities
we
conclude
the
correlation
of
such
parts
to
be
based
on
a
rational
principle
and
are
confident
that
though
at
first
blush
it
may
appear
quite
accidental
that
we
are
in
possession
of
five
senses
we
shall
discover
a
true
bond
of
relation
between
that
number
and
the
notion
therein
asserted
of
just
this
type
is
goethes
method
of
observing
and
accounting
for
the
innate
reason
of
nature
and
her
phenomena
with
an
extraordinary
intuitive
sense
he
directed
his
attention
directly
to235
the
objects
of
experience
entirely
convinced
of
the
ideal
bond
of
unity
which
explained
their
interconnection
history
may
be
written
with
a
like
object
the
narration
of
facts
and
individual
lives
is
given
in
such
a
way
as
indirectly
to
throw
a
light
on
the
essential
significance
which
such
events
or
persons
contributed
to
the
period
in
which
they
are
necessarily
bound
together
in
one
organic
whole
3
consequently
we
may
affirm
that
nature
generally
regarded
as
the
sensuous
manifestation
of
the
concrete
notion
and
the
idea
is
to
be
considered
an
object
of
beauty
in
so
far
as
by
such
a
sensuous
perception
of
natural
forms
some
kind
of
foreshadowing
of
the
notional
unity
consonant
to
them
is
surmised
and
we
are
able
through
the
channels
of
sense
to
discover
not
merely
their
form
but
somewhat
of
the
inner
necessity
which
binds
together
all
their
parts
further
than
this
incomplete
surmise
of
the
notion
the
sensuous
contemplation
of
nature
as
beautiful
is
not
carried
this
way
of
comprehending
things
for
which
the
separate
parts
despite
their
appearance
of
independent
freedom
among
themselves
nevertheless
reveal
to
the
sight
the
harmony
that
exists
there
either
in
the
characteristics
of
their
form
or
detached
portions
of
it
or
their
motion
and
so
forth
remains
for
all
that
indefinite
and
abstract
the
inward
unity
is
not
open
to
external
sense
nor
can
it
appear
in
its
ideal
and
concrete
form
to
such
perception236
whether
imaginative
or
no
such
at
most
acquiesces
generally
in
the
universality
of
a
law
of
connection
inherent
in
every
living
thing
a
it
is
then
in
the
first
instance
only
in
this
bond
of
union
which
reveals
itself
as
a
necessary
adjunct
of
vitality
from
the
objectivity
of
nature
in
so
far
as
the
same
is
presented
in
forms
adequate
to
the
notion
that
we
have
before
us
the
beauty
of
nature
with
this
coalescence
the
materia
is
wholly
identical
the
form
is
immediately
at
home
in
the
matter
as
its
true
essence
and
its
conforming
energy237
this
description
may
in
fact
stand
for
us
so
far
as
beauty
at
this
stage
is
concerned
as
a
general
definition
of
it
we
admire
for
example
the
natural
form
of
a
crystal
on
account
of
the
law
of
uniformity
it
manifests
a
law
which
through
no
mere
action
of
forces
external
to
it
but
by
virtue
of
its
own
specific
definition
and
free
activity
free
in
all
its
aspects
as
itself
an
object
is
manifested
there
for
although
an
activity
external
to
it
could
as
such
equally
be
free
yet
in
crystals
the
conformative
activity
is
not
extraneous
to
the
object
rather
it
is
a
form
operative
as
belonging
to
the
minerals
innate
character
we
may
define
it
as
the
free
force
of
its
substance
which
out
of
its
own
resources
informs
itself
and
is
not
merely
passively
receptive
of
its
environment
consequently
we
find
here
the
constituent
material
in
its
realized
form
as
a
free
and
independent
creation
in
still
higher
and
more
concrete
mode
the
immanent
form
projects
itself
through
the
living
organism
and
all
its
parts
in
the
articulate
form
and
above
all
in
its
motion
and
its
vital
expression
as
feeling
for
in
this
last
case
we
have
the
inward
vitality
pregnant
itself
as
living
b
it
is
moreover
through
this
indeterminacy
of
the
beauty
of
nature
originating
in
its
inward
principle
of
animation
that

both
in
virtue
of
the
conception
of
life
and
the
intuition
of
its
true
notion
no
less
than
of
the
habitual
types
conformable
to
its
adequate
presentment
we
are
able
to
distinguish
between
animals
which
are
beautiful
and
those
which
are
ugly
animals
incapable
of
vitality
such
as
the
sloth
which
creeps
about
with
difficulty
and
whose
entire
mode
of
life
is
suggestive
of
incapacity
for
motion
or
activity
offend
our
aesthetic
sense
for
this
very
reason238
activity
and
mobility
are
precisely
the
qualities
which
assert
the
higher
ideality
of
life
for
the
same
reason
we
condemn
forms
of
amphibious
life
certain
species
of
fishes
crocodiles
toads
and
many
kinds
of
insects
an
additional
reason
will
influence
our
similar
attitude
to
hybrid
species
where
confusion
of
form
marks
the
passage
from
one
determinate
type
to
another
the
ornithorhyncus
is
an
example239
an
animal
which
with
its
mixture
of
bird
and
fourfooted
beast
may
indeed
astonish
us
but
at
the
same
time
is
repulsive
to
our
sense
of
beauty
such
feelings
of
repulsion
can
no
doubt
be
traced
entirely
to
our
habitual
prepossessions
which
have
moulded
for
the
imagination
a
fixed
type
of
animal
species
consonant
to
experience
but
even
so
there
is
already
actively
present
the
intuitive
surmise
that
the
configuration
of
a
bird
for
example
is
related
in
its
parts
by
a
necessary
principle
of
unity
and
cannot
as
such
graft
upon
itself
forms
which
belong
to
other
species
without
being
thereby
transformed
into
a
hybrid
variety
such
abnormal
deviations
from
type
appear
to
us
both
strange
and
contradictory
neither
the
one
sided
narrowness
of
organization
which
is
so
defective
and
mean
in
its
manifestation
that
it
exercises
no
activity
over
the
straitened
conditions
of
its
environment
nor
confusions
and
passages
of
type
which
albeit
they
are
not
so
enclosed
within
themselves
are
unable
to
hold
fast
the
distinctive
features
of
their
type
belong
strictly
to
the
sphere
of
natural
beauty

there
is
another
sense
in
which
we
attribute
beauty
to
nature
namely
when
we
have
the
collective
picture
of
a
landscape
before
us
rather
than
observe
the
living
form
of
a
simple
object
here
we
have
no
organic
articulation
of
parts
such
as
is
derived
from
their
notion
and
is
presented
to
us
as
such
ideal
unity
in
spontaneous
life
we
have
instead
a
rich
variety
of
objects
both
organic
and
inorganic
which
are
united
together
on
one
or
more
planes
of
vision
in
their
distinctive
features
contour
of
mountains
winding
outlines
of
rivers
groups
of
trees
huts
dwellings
palaces
and
cities
of
mankind
ships
roadways
heaven
and
sea
valley
and
rockcleft
we
find
in
addition
to
this
variety
and
proceeding
therefrom
a
delightful
or
imposing
harmony
which
appeals
to
our
sense
and
interests
us
it
is
lastly
a
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
beauty
of
nature
that
it
should
excite
or
exercise
a
harmonious
influence
over
our
emotional
life
a
mood
of
this
kind
is
aroused
by
the
stillness
of
moonlight
the
peace
of
a
valley
through
which
some
brook
or
other
meanders
the
sublimity
of
the
immeasurable
stormtossed
sea
the
tranquil
depth
of
the
starstrewn
heavens
but
the
significant
factor
in
this
case
is
not
so
much
to
be
found
in
the
objects
as
in
the
peculiar
moods
they
arouse
in
our
feelings
and
affections
on
analogous
grounds
we
attribute
beauty
to
animals
when
the
expression
of
their
life
directly
suggests
human
qualities
such
as
courage
strength
cunning
good
nature
and
the
rest
such
no
doubt
in
one
aspect
of
it
truly
expresses
the
nature
of
the
animals
themselves
but
there
is
also
our
own
conception
of
its
affinity
to
ourselves
and
the
mood
in
which
we
receive
it
c
however
much
animal
life
as
the
culminating
point
of
natural
beauty
unfolds
its
freest
expression
as
a
living
principle
it
is
comparatively
narrow
in
its
range
and
subject
to
very
limited
qualities
the
circle
of
such
existence
is
a
strait
one
and
in
this
the
predominant
interests
are
those
of
the
satisfaction
of
natural
instincts
such
as
hunger
and
sexattraction
soullife
regarded
as
the
inward
principle
expressed
through
external
figure
is
poor
abstract
and
empty
of
content
add
to
this
the
consideration
that
this
inward
is
not
manifested
at
all
as
inward
the
soul
in
its
essential
substance
is
not
revealed
by
the
life
of
nature
it
is
in
fact
the
determining
characteristic
of
nature
that
its
soul
remains
shut
in
itself
does
not
in
other
words
proclaim
itself
in
its
ideality
as
already
pointed
out
the
soul
of
an
animal
is
not
this
ideal
unity
selfacknowledged
if
it
were
otherwise
we
should
have
the
manifestation
of
such
personality
brought
home
to
others
only
in
the
selfconscious
ego
do
we
find
the
ideal
in
its
simplest
terms
which
is
itself
an
ideal
medium
to
itself
knows
itself
as
this
simple
unity
and
thereby
endows
itself
with
a
reality
which
is
not
limited
to
bodily
and
sensuous
form
but
is
itself
of
an
ideal
character
here
for
the
first
time
reality
is
in
possession
of
a
form
adequate
to
the
notion
or
rather
the
notion
sets
itself
up
as
its
own
opposite
makes
itself
objectively
real
and
finds
its
own
realization
in
that
objectivity
the
animal
life
on
the
contrary
is
only
potentially
such
a
unity
as
that
in
which
reality
as
bodily
form
is
other
than
the
ideal
unity
of
soul
in
selfconsciousness
we
have
this
unity
realized
whose
opposing
factors
are
constituent
elements
of
one
transparent
ideality
and
it
is
as
this
concrete
totality
of
selfconsciousness
that
the
ego
is
manifested
to
others
the
forms
of
animal
life
merely
enable
us
through
imaginative
perception
to
divine
the
souls
existence
such
only
possess
the
troubled
semblance
of
a
soul
betrayed
to
us
through
the
breath
or
exhalement
which
permeates
the
whole
gives
some
unity
to
all
the
members
and
reveals
in
the
entire
instinctive
life
the
first
germs
of
an
independent
character
herein
lies
the
primary
defect
of
the
beauty
of
nature
even
when
taken
at
its
point
of
culminating
form
and
it
is
precisely
this
defect
which
will
introduce
us
to
the
necessity
of
the
ideal
as
the
beauty
of
art
but
before
we
consider
at
length
the
nature
of
this
ideal
there
are
two
determinations
involved
as
the
most
immediate
result
of
this
inherent
defect
in
natural
beauty
which
invite
our
attention
we
have
stated
that
in
the
animal
form
the
soul
appears
as
the
bond
of
connection
within
the
organism
and
the
unified
point
of
animation
only
under
a
cloud240
and
destitute
of
any
fully
realized
content
we
only
find
there
a
quite
indeterminate
and
restricted
mode
of
soullife
we
will
now
consider
the
abstract
limitations
of
this
mode
more
closely
b
the
external
beauty
of
abstract
form
regarded
as
uniformity
symmetry
conformity
to
rule
and
harmony
and
reality
in
the
sense
of
abstract
unity
of
the
physical
material
there
is
in
nature
an
external
reality
which
is
of
course
visible
and
definitely
objective
but
the
inward
unity
of
which
instead
of
presenting
itself
in
the
concrete
inwardness
referable
to
the
unity
of
soullife
only
goes
to
the
point
of
indeterminacy
and
abstraction
in
other
words
it
stops
short
of
the
inwardness
selfactualized
in
an
ideal
form
and
as
the
particular
existence
conformable
to
its
ideal
content
its
appearance
is
that
of
the
defining
principle
on
the
face
of
external
reality
now
the
specific
characteristics
of
inwardness
in
all
its
concreteness
should
be
these
first
the
principle
of
soullife
is
asserted
for
itself
no
less
than
is
potentially
replete
with
content
secondly
external
reality
interpenetrates
this
ideal
arcanum
and
by
so
doing
fully
reveals
its
true
form
as
such
external
reality
a
concrete
unity
of
this
nature
is
not
reached
by
mere
natural
beauty
it
lies
beyond
as
the
ideal
on
this
plane
of
existence
we
cannot
say
that
such
a
concrete
unity
enters
into
the
manifestation
of
form
we
have
to
deduce
it
through
analysis
examining
in
their
separation
and
singularity
the
distinguishing
features
which
the
unity
supports
the
form
that
informs
here
and
the
sensuous
external
reality
fall
apart
from
one
another
or
rather
we
have
two
distinct
aspects
which
we
are
compelled
to
consider
separately
by
virtue
of
this
fact
which
we
may
either
regard
as
a
division
of
the
material
of
sense
or
as
a
review
of
certain
facts
taken
in
abstraction
the
inward
unity
which
is
one
aspect
of
the
external
reality
itself
falls
outside
it
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
itself
asserted
in
that
rational
reality
as
the
wholly
immanent
form
of
the
entire
notion
which
constitutes
it
but
rather
as
an
ideality
and
determinacy
imposed
externally
such
are
the
points
of
view
thus
presented
us
which
we
will
now
consider
more
closely
first
then
we
have
to
discuss
1
the
beauty
of
abstract
form
the
form
of
natural
beauty
in
its
abstraction
is
a
form
which
is
determinate
and
thus
of
limited
range
in
a
further
aspect
of
it
it
is
focussed
in
a
unity
of
abstract
relation
to
itself241
on
closer
inspection
we
shall
however
find
that
the
external
manifold
controls
this
form
of
abstract
beauty
by
reason
of
its
own
determinacy
and
unity
we
must
not
however
imply
in
these
latter
any
immanent
inwardness
or
form
of
vital
ideality
but
regard
them
as
purely
material
definitions
and
unity
of
the
external
medium
forms
of
such
a
character
are
uniformity
symmetry
or
conformity
to
rule
and
finally
harmony
a
uniformity
uniformity
is
speaking
generally
equality
in
external
presentment
or
more
specifically
the
unbroken
repetition
of
one
and
the
same
definite
form
supplied
by
the
determining
unity
to
the
form
of
objects
such
a
unity
in
virtue
of
its
initial
abstraction
is
at
the
furthest
extreme
removed
from
the
rational
totality
of
the
concrete
notion
its
beauty
is
therefore
a
beauty
which
is
referable
to
the
faculty
of
the
analytical
understanding
the
fundamental
process
of
that
faculty
is
to
perceive
objects
in
their
abstraction
not
in
their
selfdetermined
completeness
and
identity
for
example
among
all
lines
the
straight
line
is
that
which
is
most
uniform
because
it
alone
manifests
one
abstract
and
undeviating
direction
for
the
same
reason
the
cube
is
a
figure
dominated
by
regularity
of
content
all
its
sides
are
of
the
same
size
the
same
length
of
line
and
the
same
angles
which
on
account
of
their
being
rectangular
however
much
their
size
is
changed
manifest
no
change
in
the
form
of
their
angles
as
is
the
case
with
angles
which
are
obtuse
or
acute
with
this
characteristic
of
uniformity
we
must
closely
connect
that
of
symmetry
form
is
unable
long
to
rest
in
that
barest
abstraction
of
its
determination
namely
undifferentiated
equality
a
diverse
relation
is
sure
to
assert
itself
breaking
into
the
empty
form
of
identity
in
this
way
we
obtain
symmetry
which
consists
in
no
mere
identical
repetition
of
one
form
but
in
a
combination
with
some
such
form
analogous
to
it
identical
that
is
to
say
in
its
selfdetermination
and
yet
manifesting
a
distinct
contrast
with
it
through
such
a
combination
we
obtain
another
kind
of
equality
and
unity
whose
determination
is
more
extensive
and
more
varied
if
for
example
on
one
side
of
a
house
we
meet
with
three
windows
of
the
same
size
separated
at
equal
intervals
of
distance
then
three
or
four
more
of
loftier
size
than
the
firstmentioned
standing
at
more
extended
or
closer
intervals
in
relation
to
them
and
again
three
more
precisely
similar
in
size
and
distance
to
our
original
ones
we
have
then
before
us
a
symmetrical
arrangement
mere
uniformity
and
repetition
of
the
same
distinctions
will
never
produce
this
result
we
may
find
such
distinguishing
features
in
size
position
form
colour
tones
and
many
others
like
them
which
however
to
produce
symmetry
must
be
harmoniously
related
to
similar
forms
of
construction
when
we
find
a
combination
which
presents
to
us
an
arrangement
of
such
distinguishing
characteristics
according
to
some
clearly
uniform
principle
that
then
is
symmetry
both
these
attributes
uniformity
and
symmetry
being
the
determinations
of
the
form
and
unity
of
external
appearance
are
mainly
applicable
to
distinctions
in
size
for
it
stands
to
reason
that
what
is
expressly
posited
as
external
rather
than
truly
immanent
determination
is
generally
a
quantitative242
determination
whereas
the
qualitative
fixes
the
inherent
character
of
anything
consequently
that
which
is
assumed
only
to
affect
the
external
appearance
cannot
be
concerned
with
the
changes
which
are
found
in
the
qualitative
aspect
size
on
the
other
hand
and
its
alteration
regarded
merely
as
size
is
for
the
qualitative
determination
when
it
is
unable
to
assert
itself
in
terms
of
measure
an
indifferent
determination
that
is
to
say
measure
is
quantity
precisely
in
so
far
as
it
can
give
to
itself
an
aspect
which
qualifies
it
and
thereby
a
qualitative
determination
is
united
to
the
purely
quantitative
one
as
thus
explained243
uniformity
and
symmetry
are
merely
restricted
to
the
determinations
of
size
and
their
uniform
appearance
or
arrangement
of
differences
in
symmetrical
order
further
inquiry
will
show
us
that
this
due
coordination
of
size
is
as
applicable
to
the
forms
of
organic
life
as
it
is
to
those
of
inorganic
nature
the
human
organism
is
for
example
at
least
in
a
certain
degree
both
uniform
and
symmetrical
we
have
two
eyes
two
arms
two
legs
similar
hipjoints
shoulderblades
and
so
on
of
other
portions
of
the
body
the
reverse
is
the
case
we
find
no
conspicuous
uniformity
in
the
heart
lungs
bowels
or
liver
the
question
arises
what
precisely
constitutes
the
difference
here
the
side
on
which
uniformity
whether
of
size
form
or
position
mainly
asserts
itself
is
obviously
the
aspect
of
the
organism
viewed
from
the
outside
the
uniform
and
symmetrical
determination
in
complete
conformity
with
what
we
should
expect
is
most
apparent
where
the
fact
as
objectively
determined
is
itself
the
external
envisagement
itself
and
carries
with
it
the
least
impression
of
inherent
life
the
reality
which
is
most
constant
to
this
pure
externality
rests
satisfied
with
the
abstract
unity
congenial
to
it
within
the
organism
on
the
contrary
where
we
find
the
heart
of
the
lifeprocess
and
still
more
openly
in
the
medium
of
untrammelled
reason
uniformity
gives
way
before
the
subjective
unity
of
life
nature
is
no
doubt
in
its
opposition
to
mind
a
determinate
existence
external
and
independent
but
even
in
her
we
find
that
uniformity
only
preeminently
asserts
itself
where
externality
is
the
predominant
principle

reviewing
then
shortly
the
prominent
classifications
of
natural
objects
we
observe
in
the
first
place
that
minerals
taking
the
crystal
for
an
example
as
structures
destitute
of
the
principle
of
life
are
characterized
in
their
fundamental
form
by
uniformity
and
symmetry
as
already
remarked
their
form
it
is
true
is
one
appropriate
to
themselves
is
not
merely
the
determination
of
external
forces
through
an
unseen
energy
the
form
that
makes
them
what
they
are
as
products
of
nature
creates
their
configuration
both
within
and
without
this
activity
however
is
not
yet
the
completed
energy
of
the
concrete
notion
as
an
ideal
principle
which
directs
the
independent
consistency
of
the
positive
reality
subsuming
them
under
an
ideal
totality
such
as
is
present
in
animal
life
the
unity
and
definition
of
their
form
persists
in
purely
abstract
onesidedness
and
we
have
as
the
characteristics
of
a
unity
which
is
wholly
on
the
outside
the
bare
forms
of
uniformity
and
symmetry
the
determinating
factor
in
each
case
being
an
abstraction

plant
life
is
of
course
many
degrees
above
the
order
of
crystals
from
the
very
commencement
its
evolution
is
marked
by
a
harmonious
articulation
and
consumes
material
in
a
constantly
active
process
of
selfnourishment
but
plantlife
also
is
not
yet
really
the
living
whole244
although
organically
divided
into
parts
its
activity
is
still
one
that
consists
wholly
in
assimilation245
it
is
rooted
in
the
earth
with
no
independent
power
of
motion
from
place
to
place
its
growth
is
continuous
and
such
energy
of
assimilation
and
selfnourishment
as
it
possesses
is
not
the
tranquil
selfsubsistence
of
a
completely
individualized
organic
existence
but
rather
a
continuous
extension
of
its
growth
as
an
external
object
an
animal
grows
just
as
a
plant
grows
but
at
a
determinate
point
that
growth
in
its
external
size
ceases
and
that
which
reproduces
itself
in
selfsubsistence
is
one
and
the
same
individual
plantlife
however
enlarges
without
intermission
and
only
its
decease
renders
the
further
increase
of
its
boughs
and
leaves
impossible
and
moreover
all
that
it
separately
produces
in
this
process
is
for
ever
the
repeated
pattern
of
the
same
organism
in
its
entirety
for
every
bough
is
a
new
plant
and
not
as
in
the
case
with
the
animal
organism
only
an
isolated
member
on
account
of
this
persistent
enlargement
of
itself
through
all
the
separate
plant
formations
whereof
it
consists
plantlife
is
without
the
subjective
animation
peculiar
to
sensation
and
the
ideal
unity
which
belongs
to
it
and
generally
speaking
we
may
say
that
plantlife
however
much
the
digestive
process
is
an
inward
one
in
which
we
find
nourishment
is
assimilated
and
the
organism
determines
the
form
which
is
impressed
on
its
substance
out
of
itself
by
virtue
of
the
increasing
freedom
of
the
notional
type
working
through
that
substance
nevertheless
substantially
through
the
entire
process
of
its
life
it
remains
rooted
to
externality
without
either
a
true
independence
or
unity
and
such
selfsubsistence
as
it
possesses
is
continuous
without
a
break
and
it
is
on
account
of
this
characteristic
of
plantgrowth
namely
that
it
is
for
ever
asserted
on
the
side
of
externality
that
we
find
uniformity
and
symmetry
to
be
the
fundamental
unity
of
its
selfexpression
as
it
is
a
predominant
principle
of
its
structure
no
doubt
uniformity
is
not
so
regnant
here
as
we
observed
it
to
be
in
the
formation
of
minerals
and
it
is
not
expressed
in
the
same
extreme
degree
through
the
abstract
straight
line
and
right
angle
but
it
prevails
here
notwithstanding
the
stem
for
the
most
part
runs
on
a
straight
line
the
rings
of
plants
of
higher
type
form
themselves
in
circles
leaves
closely
approach
the
configuration
of
crystals
and
at
least
as
the
basis
of
their
type
we
find
that
the
blossoms
themselves
in
the
number
of
their
leaves
their
position
and
form
are
determined
with
uniformity
and
symmetry

finally
in
the
living
organism
of
animals
a
difference
is
asserted
in
the
reduplicated
structure
of
the
members
in
the
bodies
of
animals
more
particularly
if
we
examine
the
higher
species
the
organism
is
a
more
inward
selfcontained
and
selfdetermined
totality
like
a
sphere
it
returns
so
to
speak
on
itself
while
still
remaining
an
external
organism
it
is
an
external
process
and
yet
as
a
process
asserted
against
externality
the
more
important
organs
are
those
within
such
as
heart
lungs
and
liver
and
in
these
the
life
is
bound
up
such
are
not
determined
under
the
simple
characteristics
of
uniformity
in
those
members
however
even
of
the
animal
organism
which
are
fixed
in
direct
relation
to
the
outside
world
symmetrical
arrangement
prevails
among
such
must
be
reckoned
the
members
and
organs
which
assert
the
subjective
principle
externally
no
less
than
those
which
are
the
instruments
of
the
active
life
the
senseorgans
such
as
sight
and
hearing
belong
to
the
former
all
that
we
see
and
hear
is
left
as
we
found
it
the
organs
of
smell
and
taste
already
mark
the
point
of
union
with
an
activity
exercised
externally
we
only
smell
that
which
is
already
assimilated246
by
the
organ
of
sense
and
we
only
exercise
our
taste
through
an
act
of
destruction
we
have
it
is
true
but
one
nose
but
it
is
subdivided
into
two
sections
each
of
which
is
uniform
in
structure
the
same
description
is
applicable
to
the
lips
and
teeth
and
other
organs
like
them
further
than
this
the
eyes
and
ears
and
the
limbs
employed
in
motion
from
place
to
place
or
for
direct
control
over
external
objects
in
other
words
legs
and
arms
are
entirely
uniform
in
position
form
and
other
qualities
we
find
therefore
that
in
the
organic
world
no
less
than
in
the
inorganic
uniformity
asserts
a
very
real
predominance
qualified
however
by
the
fact
that
its
presence
is
limited
to
those
members
which
are
the
instruments
of
the
organism
in
its
direct
relation
to
the
external
world
on
those
through
which
the
lifeprocess
returns
on
itself
by
virtue
of
its
own
subjective
principle
there
is
no
such
impression
of
uniformity
such
then
are
the
leading
characteristics
of
the
forms
of
uniformity
and
symmetry
and
the
manner
in
which
they
are
asserted
in
the
configuration
of
natural
phenomena
b
conformity
to
rule
we
now
propose
to
distinguish
the
more
generic
conception
of
conformity
to
law247
so
far
as
it
appears
on
a
higher
plane
of
organic
evolution
than
that
already
adverted
to
and
marks
the
passage
of
the
same
to
the
freedom
of
natural
no
less
than
spiritual
life
from
the
more
abstract
forms
discussed
above
taken
by
itself
no
doubt
conformity
to
rule
is
not
alone
sufficient
to
give
us
the
subjective
unity
and
freedom
of
totality
but
we
do
find
in
the
configuration
to
which
it
corresponds
a
totality
of
essentially
distinguished
characteristics
such
as
do
not
merely
emerge
in
difference
and
opposition
but
betray
both
unity
and
determinate
connection
in
such
totality
a
unity
thus
controlled
albeit
still
only
positively
asserted
in
quantitative
substance
is
no
longer
referable
to
essentially
exterior
distinctions
of
mere
size
numerically
ascertainable
but
already
introduces
to
our
notice
a
qualitative
relation
of
consistency
between
these
contrasted
determinations
in
other
words
we
have
here
neither
the
abstract
repetition
of
one
and
the
same
determinant248
nor
a
uniform
interchange
of
similarity
and
dissimilarity249
but
the
contemporaneous
association
of
aspects
essentially
distinct
from
one
another
we
find
in
fact
our
sense
of
sight
gratified
by
the
association
of
these
distinguishing
features
in
their
completeness
and
it
is
the
principle
of
reason
which
affords
us
such
satisfaction
gratifying
our
sense
only
through
the
totality
or
rather
through
the
very
totality
of
differences
the
nature
of
the
fact
requires
such
a
connection
however
still
remains
an
unexplained
nexus
which
senseperception
arrives
at
partly
on
account
of
its
persistent
repetition
and
in
part
through
an
intuition
of
deeper
source
a
few
examples
will
make
clear
the
process
of
definition
from
uniformity
to
conformity
with
law
parallel
lines
of
equal
length
are
abstractly
uniform
a
further
step
is
taken
when
we
compare
geometrical
figures
of
the
same
form
triangles
for
example
but
assume
their
size
to
be
unequal
here
the
angles
subtended
by
the
corners
of
each
and
the
relation
of
line
to
line
is
the
same
but
we
find
such
similarity
in
different
quanta
take
again
the
circle
it
does
not
possess
the
uniformity
of
the
straight
line
but
at
the
same
time
the
determination
of
abstract
equality
strictly
applies
to
it
for
all
its
radii
are
of
equal
length
the
circle
is
consequently
still
but
a
curved
line
that
awakes
no
particular
interest250
on
the
other
hand
there
is
still
less
uniformity
in
the
ellipse
and
the
parabola
and
they
are
only
understood
through
the
law
of
their
form
in
other
words
the
radii
vectores
of
the
ellipse
are
both
unequal
and
in
conformity
with
rule
and
the
same
qualification
applies
to
the
greater
and
lesser
axis
of
their
lines
of
differentiation251
moreover
their
foci
are
not
central
as
is
the
case
with
the
circle
we
find
in
these
examples
therefore
a
qualitative
relation
of
difference
assert
itself
in
the
law
applicable
to
such
lines
and
constructive
of
their
interconnection
if
however
we
divide
the
ellipse
by
means
of
its
greater
and
lesser
axes
we
obtain
four
equal
sections
regarded
as
a
whole
therefore
we
still
find
the
principle
of
uniformity
paramount
in
this
figure
of
a
higher
degree
of
freedom
in
its
conformity
to
law
is
the
oval
we
know
there
is
such
a
law
though
mathematicians
have
been
unable
to
express
its
formula
this
figure
is
not
an
ellipse
but
the
higher
curve
differs
from
that
below
it
still
we
find
that
even
in
this
example
of
freer
eccentricity
in
nature
if
we
divide
it
through
its
greater
axis
we
have
still
two
equal
halves
the
final
expression
of
mere
uniformity
in
conformity
to
law
is
shown
in
lines
which
as
in
the
example
of
the
oval
when
divided
through
the
smaller252
axis
give
us
unequal
sections
neither
section
being
a
mere
repetition
of
the
other
the
socalled
undulatory
line
is
an
example
of
this
in
the
sense
hogarth
describes
it
as
the
line
of
beauty
thus
the
inclination
of
the
arms
as
they
fall
on
either
side
of
the
human
body
is
opposed
here
we
have
conformity
to
rule
without
uniformity
pure
and
simple
such
a
kind
of
conformity
especially
characterises
with
its
variety
the
conformation
of
the
nobler
living
organisms
conformity
to
law
is
then
an
attribute
of
substantiality
binding
together
both
its
differences
and
its
unity
but
it
remains
still
abstract
on
the
side
of
its
controlling
form
unable
to
supply
individuality
with
the
freedom
of
motion
or
rather
by
virtue
of
that
form
is
entirely
without
the
higher
freedom
of
subjectivity
and
quite
incapable
of
revealing
the
vitality
and
ideality
proper
to
it
c
harmony
on
a
higher
plane
in
the
sphere
of
abstract
beauty
must
be
placed
harmony
in
harmony
we
find
qualitative
distinctions
are
held
together
and
further
held
together
in
a
totality
of
differentiation
such
as
is
based
on
the
essential
nature
of
the
fact
itself
this
consistency
of
support
is
derived
from
conformity
to
law
in
so
far
as
that
form
unfolds
what
is
essentially
uniformity
and
thereby
passes
beyond
the
mere
characteristics
of
equality
and
repetition
but
in
doing
this
the
distinctions
of
quality
assert
themselves
not
only
in
their
difference
of
opposition
and
contradiction
but
in
aspects
of
a
unity
that
rivets
them
together
a
unity
in
which
all
distinguishing
features
it
is
true
are
maintained
in
their
proper
place
but
still
only
as
belonging
to
one
single
whole
this
unity
of
accordance
is
what
constitutes
harmony
we
may
either
regard
it
as
a
totality
of
aspects
essentially
distinct
or
as
the
resolution
of
the
element
of
mere
contradiction
asserted
by
them
revealing
their
more
vital
interconnection
and
ideal
solidarity
in
this
sense
we
refer
to
the
harmony
of
form
or
colour
or
musical
tone
as
an
example
we
have
blue
yellow
green
and
red
as
the
fundamentally
necessary
differentiation
of
colour253
in
these
irresolvable
data
of
the
spectrum
we
have
not
merely
the
inequality
we
found
in
symmetry
but
contradictory
opposites
such
as
yellow
and
blue
their
neutralization
and
withal
concrete
identity
the
beauty
of
their
harmony
is
revealed
in
the
avoidance
of
their
crude
opposition
which
is
softened
thereby
in
such
a
way
as
to
put
before
us
the
concordance
hidden
beneath
their
difference
they
do
in
fact
emanate
from
one
source
namely
colour
which
is
not
an
abstract
conception254
but
an
essential
totality
so
far
indeed
can
the
compulsive
force
of
such
totality
carry
us
that
we
can
as
goethe
has
pointed
out
when
we
have
but
one
colour
presented
to
us
still
subjectively
recognize
another
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
way
the
tonic
mediant
and
dominant
are
essential
distinctions
among
musical
tones
which
the
unity
of
harmony
associates
through
their
difference
in
one
whole
we
may
submit
the
harmony
of
form
which
is
differentiated
through
the
varied
aspects
of
position
repose
and
motion
to
a
similar
analysis
if
we
suffer
any
one
of
the
subordinate
distinctions
to
assume
an
exclusive
predominance
the
unity
which
relates
them
will
be
destroyed
harmony
however
is
not
to
be
confused
with
free
ideal
subjectivity
and
soullife
in
the
latter
the
unity
manifested
is
not
merely
an
interconnection
and
concordance
but
a
positive
negation
of
difference
which
for
the
first
time
reveals
their
concrete
and
ideal
unity
a
concrete
unity
such
as
this
is
not
the
result
of
harmony
such
concrete
unity
is
for
example
that
which
we
find
in
the
actually
melodious
thing255
which
no
doubt
possesses
harmony
as
its
fundamental
form
but
at
the
same
time
possesses
the
higher
characteristic
of
free
subjectivity
and
by
means
of
song
gives
expression
to
that
harmony
alone
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
appearance
of
subjective
life
as
such
nor
of
that
of
mind
although
it
is
the
highest
manifestation
of
abstract
form
and
stands
in
close
affinity
to
free
subjectivity
such
then
is
our
determination
of
abstract
unity
as
we
find
it
brought
before
us
in
the
specific
modes
of
abstract
form

beauty
as
abstract
unity
of
the
material
medium
the
side
of
abstract
unity
which
we
have
now
to
consider
is
not
that
directly
related
to
form
but
to
the
sensuous
material
simply
in
which
it
is
asserted
the
unity
is
manifested
on
this
side
as
the
entirely
undifferentiated
concordance
of
the
particular
sensuous
material
it
is
the
one
form
of
unity
which
the
material
of
sense
in
its
purely
objective
aspect
is
capable
of
receiving
on
this
plane
and
under
the
above
noted
relation256
the
abstract
purity
of
the
materia
in
its
form
colour
or
tone
constitutes
what
is
most
essential
to
it

us
by

give
pleasure
by
virtue
of
this
unity
we
find
the
same
truth
brought
home
to
us
by
purity
of
tone
the
voice
when
purely
produced
though
taken
quite
by
itself
possesses
an
attraction
for
us
inexpressibly
delightful
vocal
notes
which
are
not
thus
pure
on
the
contrary
by
permitting
us
to
hear
the
organ
of
production
along
with
them
disturb
or
weaken
the
pure
resonance
and
definition
of
their
music
in
much
the
same
way
human
speech
possesses
pure
tones
in
its
vowels
a
e
i
o
u
and
its
compound
vowels
ae

and

popular
dialects
are
particularly
characterized
by
impurity
of
vocalization
and
mediate
tones
such
as
oa
purity
of
tones
consists
further
in
this
that
the
vowels
are
associated
with
consonants
whose
sound
does
not
tend
to
blurr
the
sonority
of
the
vowel
tones
as
is
too
frequently
the
case
with
our
northern
languages
when
contrasted
with
the
way
in
which
their
purity
is
preserved
by
the
italian
a
characteristic
which
makes
that
language
so
adaptable
to
singing
we
experience
an
enjoyment
of
similar
nature
through
the
sight
of
colour
in
its
simplest
purity
of
tint
an
absolutely
pure
red
or
blue
for
example
not
by
any
means
a
common
occurrence
such
pristine
colours
being
often
weakened
through
the
addition
to
them
of
yellow
or
tints
of
each
other257
violet
can
no
doubt
appear
to
us
as
a
pure
colour
but
only
in
an
external
object
not
that
is
to
say
as
a
compounded
colour258
for
it
is
not
itself
an
elementary
colour
belonging
to
colours
essential
differentiation
it
is
these
elementary
or
cardinal
colours
easily
recognized
by
sense
in
their
purity
which
on
account
of
their
crude
opposition
are
most
difficult
to
unite
together
in
harmony
colours
on
the
contrary
which
are
blurred
in
their
transparency
by
many
other
tints
although
not
so
antagonistic
to
general
harmony
fail
to
give
us
such
direct
enjoyment
from
the
very
fact
that
the
energy
of
opposition
in
them
is
weakened
green
for
instance
is
a
compound
of
blue
and
yellow
but
it
is
the
neutralization
of
these
cardinal
colours
and
for
that
reason
less
attractive
to
us
in
its
own
purity
than
blue
and
yellow
in
their
secure259
opposition
such
are
the
points
of
most
importance
we
have
to
remark
upon
in
dealing
with
the
abstract
unity
of
form
no
less
than
the
simplicity
and
purity
of
the
sensuous
material
in
whichever
aspect
we
regard
our
subjectmatter
we
have
to
review
that
which
is
by
virtue
of
its
abstract
character
destitute
of
life
and
a
unity
with
no
true
actuality
ideal
subjectivity
is
inseparable
from
this
and
such
is
entirely
absent
from
the
beauty
of
nature
even
at
the
highest
potency
of
its
manifestation
this
essential
defect
points
us
imperatively
forward
to
the
ideal
which
nature
is
unable
to
reveal
to
us
and
in
contrast
with
which
the
beauty
of
nature
appears
as
a
subordinate
mode
c
defective
aspects
of
the
beauty
of
nature
the
true
object
of
our
inquiry
is
the
beauty
of
art
viewed
as
the
only
reality
adequate
to
the
idea
of
beauty
we
have
hitherto
treated
the
beauty
of
nature
as
the
first
mode
of
the
existence
of
the
beautiful
we
have
now
to
inquire
more
closely
into
that
which
distinguishes
natural
beauty
from
that
of
art
as
an
abstract
proposition
we
may
affirm
that
the
ideal
is
beauty
in
its
rounded
completeness
nature
on
the
contrary
brings
before
us
beauty
in
its
incompleteness
such
abstract
predicates
do
not
however
help
us
much
for
our
real
problem
is
rather
to
explain
exactly
what
it
is
which
makes
the
difference
between
the
completeness
of
the
one
from
the
incompleteness
of
the
other
our
inquiry
therefore
hinges
on
the
question
how
it
comes
about
that
nature
is
necessarily
incomplete
as
a
mode
of
beauty
and
how
this
incompleteness
is
asserted
when
we
have
answered
that
we
shall
be
in
a
better
position
to
deduce
both
the
necessity
and
essential
significance
of
the
ideal
we
have
already
in
following
the
process
of
nature
up
to
its
culminating
manifestation
in
animal
life
drawn
attention
to
the
modes
of
beauty
revealed
in
that
process
it
is
now
of
the
first
importance
that
we
fix
our
attention
more
definitely
on
the
culminating
phase
of
that
evolution
where
we
find
subjectivity
and
individuality
presented
to
us
in
the
living
organism
we
have
already
referred
to
the
beautiful
as
the
idea
in
a
manner
identical
to
that
we
employ
when
we
speak
of
the
good
and
true
as
the
idea
in
the
sense
that
is
to
say
where
we
characterize
the
idea
as
the
wholly
substantial
and
universal
the
absolute
substancewith
no
sensuous
material
therewithof
reality
in
short
the
consistency
of
the
world
determined
more
strictly
however
as
already
pointed
out
the
idea
is
not
merely
substantiality
and
universality
but
the
unity
of
the
notion
and
its
reality
just
that
the
notion
revealed
to
us
as
notion
in
its
coincident
objectivity
it
was
plato
who
as
we
have
remarked
in
our
introduction
posited
the
idea
as
that
which
was
alone
true
and
universal
and
indeed
as
the
one
concrete
universal
the
platonic
idea
is
however
not
itself
as
yet
the
concrete
real
for
apprehended
under
the
notion
and
its
universality
it
is
already
coincident
with
the
real
apprehended
however
only
in
its
universality260
it
is
not
realized
realized
that
is
to
say
as
truth
in
its
selfdeterminate
realization
it
is
still
only
the
potency
of
such
selfrealization
but
just
as
the
notion
is
not
the
notion
of
real
existence
without
its
full
objectivity
in
the
same
way
the
idea
without
its
realization
in
the
objective
world
is
not
the
idea
in
its
truth
as
existent
reality
the
idea
must
proceed
to
such
realization
which
is
only
present
itself
for
the
first
time
in
a
really
existent
subjectivity
adequate
to
the
notion
and
its
ideal
unity
and
selfdetermination
in
the
generic
species
we
find
its
reality
first
manifested
as
free
and
concrete
individuality
life
only
exists
as
a
living
thing
goodness
is
only
realized
in
particular
men
and
all
truth
is
simply
the
consciousness
of
knowledgespirit
which
has
come
to
its
own
vital
inheritance
only
the
concrete
singularity
is
both
true
and
really
existent
mere
abstract
universality
and
particularity
is
not
so
this
selfsubsistent
actuality
this
subjectivity
is
the
point
on
which
everything
turns
and
which
we
must
fully
grasp
in
its
significance
subjectivity
may
be
defined
as
ideal
determination
by
virtue
of
a
principle
of
ideal
unity
which
asserts
itself
through
negation
of
the
differences
presented
to
it
as
consistent
parts
of
one
objective
reality261
the
unity
of
the
idea
and
its
realization
is
the
negative
unity
of
the
idea
as
such
and
its
reality
it
is
at
once
and
at
the
same
time
the
subsumption
and
deposition
in
a
unified
content
of
the
difference
asserted
on
either
side
only
in
this
active
process
is
the
unity
of
the
idea
affirmatively
determined
in
its
full
activity
a
unity
and
subjectivity
whose
process
of
selfdetermination
is
infinite
we
have
consequently
to
apprehend
the
idea
of
the
beautiful
in
its
realized
mode
of
existence
as
essentially
concrete
subjectivity
and
moreover
as
individual
substantiality
by
virtue
of
which
it
is
the
idea
really
existent
possessing
the
form
of
its
reality
in
concrete
and
individual
singularity
but
here
we
must
distinguish
between
two
distinct
modes
of
singularity
or
individuality
namely
that
which
is
immediately
presented
us
by
nature
and
that
which
is
predicated
of
mind
spirit
in
both
forms
it
is
given
determinate
existence
and
consequently
is
in
both
substantive
content
the
idea
in
short
and
in
the
particular
sphere
of
our
inquiry
for
both
forms
the
idea
as
beauty
viewed
in
this
way
we
may
affirm
if
we
please
that
the
beautiful
of
nature
has
a
similar
content
with
that
of
the
ideal
in
contradistinction
however
to
such
a
point
of
view
we
must
not
fail
to
observe
that
the
difference
of
form
in
which
the
idea
herein
attains
reality
that
is
to
say
the
difference
between
the
individuality
which
prevails
in
the
spheres
of
nature
and
spirit
the
difference
asserted
in
its
respective
appearance
this
it
is
which
constitutes
an
essential
distinction
as
we
shall
see
the
real
point
of
our
inquiry
is
this
namely
which
of
these
two
forms
is
really
the
one
most
adequate
to
the
idea
for
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
only
in
the
entirely
adequate
form
that
the
totality
of
the
idea
is
in
its
full
content
explicitly
realized
this
is
the
more
immediate
point
we
have
now
to
examine
in
so
far
as
the
difference
between
natural
beauty
and
the
ideal
falls
into
line
with
the
formal
differentiation
of
singularity
immediate
singularity
is
no
doubt
primarily
found
in
the
domain
of
spirit
no
less
than
in
nature
as
such
for
in
the
first
place
spirit
is
possessed
of
an
external
existence
in
bodily
form
secondly
even
in
spiritual
relations
spirit
in
the
first
instance
only
exists
in
its
union
with
immediate
reality
subdividing
our
inquiry
in
conformity
with
such
facts
we
will
consider
the
nature
of
immediate
singularity
from
three
different
points
of
view
1
a
we
have
already
seen
that
the
animal
organism
preserves
its
determinate
existence
through
a
persistent
evolutionary
process
of
its
own
in
opposition
to
an
environing
inorganic
nature
which
it
assimilates
by
means
of
consumption
and
digestion
compelling
thereby
what
is
external
to
submit
to
that
process
and
asserting
its
own
independent
existence
by
so
doing
we
found
at
the
same
time
that
this
living
process
is
a
system
of
activities
which
is
realized
in
a
system
of
organs
whose
functional
action
consists
in
those
very
activities
the
one
and
single
aim
of
this
homogeneous
system
is
the
selfpreservation
of
the
living
totality
thereof
through
such
a
process
the
animal
life
consists
therefore
in
a
life
of
sensuous
impulses
whose
general
course
and
satisfaction
is
realized
in
the
abovementioned
organic
system
the
living
organism
is
for
this
reason
articulated
in
its
parts
under
a
teleological
principle
and
the
principle
or
end
subserved
is
selfpreservation
life
is
immanent
in
every
member
they
are
united
to
life
and
life
is
one
with
them
and
the
net
result
of
this
animate
process
is
that
the
animal
is
maintained
as
a
thing
conscious
of
itself
as
an
individual
subject
of
feeling
life
and
the
selfenjoyment
its
singularity
procures
for
it
we
have
only
to
compare
animal
life
with
plant
life
to
see
the
difference
implied
in
the
absence
of
such
a
senseconsciousness
the
plant
simply
brings
to
the
birth
new
specimens
of
its
species
without
even
being
able
to
concentrate
any
single
one
on
that
point
of
negation
which
constitutes
selfsingularity
we
must
however
add
that
even
in
the
animal
organism
and
its
life
we
never
have
actually
before
our
eyes
the
true
manifestation
of
this
centre
of
unity
but
rather
simply
the
manifold
of
its
members
life
is
still
too
deficient
on
the
side
of
freedom
and
in
opposition
to
the
mere
caprice
of
senselife
to
manifest
such
a
subjective
individuality
as
is
capable
of
breaking
through
the
external
envisagement
of
its
organic
parts
the
vital
centre
of
such
activities
in
the
animal
organism
still
remains
veiled
from
vision
and
all
that
we
see
are
the
mere
outlines
of
the
figure
and
this
for
the
most
part
concealed
from
our
view
by
feathers
scales
hair
fur
or
spines
there
can
be
no
question
that
coverings
of
this
nature
though
characteristic
of
the
animal
world
are
coverings
which
partake
of
the
form
of
the
vegetable
world
and
it
is
precisely
at
this
point
that
the
beauty
of
animal
life
declares
its
essential
insufficiency
that
which
the
organism
makes
most
visible
to
us
is
not
the
soulprinciple
that
which
is
directed
outward
and
throughout
appears
is
not
the
life
within
but
rather
formations
accepted
from
a
lower
plane
of
existence
than
the
essential
embodiment
of
life
the
animal
is
only
fully
alive
beneath
that
outer
crust
and
consequently
for
this
very
reason
that
its
inwardness262
is
not
wholly
made
real
in
a
form
adequate
to
reveal
it
we
are
unable
to
see
the
principle
of
life
everywhere
shine
freely
through
it
it
remains
only
an
inwardness
and
the
shell
is
external
only
unpermeated
by
the
vital
principle
b
the
human
body
in
virtue
of
its
more
exalted
station
presents
us
with
a
striking
contrast
in
this
we
are
everywhere
reminded
that
man
is
in
possession
of
a
unity
of
feeling
a
soul
the
human
skin
is
not
covered
over
plantlike
with
an
apparently
lifeless
sheath
the
pulsation
of
the
blood
is
visible
throughout
the
entire
surface
the
beating
heart
of
life
is
everywhere
at
the
same
time
apparent
and
we
have
in
this
outward
manifestation
as
it
were
the
real
fount
of
life
made
visible
the
turgor
vitae
as
it
streams
from
its
centre
in
the
same
way
the
human
skin
sensitive
throughout
in
its
minutest
parts
reveals
to
us
the
morbidezza
of
its
colouring
those
tints
of
fleshcolour
and
veincolour
which
are
the
despair
of
an
artist
on
the
other
hand
however
much
the
human
body
presents
as
the
apparent
mirror
of
life
a
contrast
with
that
of
animals
it
undoubtedly
expresses
also
the
natural
process
of
selfpreservation
in
the
subdivision
of
the
skin
and
the
indentations
wrinkles
pores
small
hairs
and
veins
which
we
find
attach
thereto
in
fact
the
skin
itself
though
permitting
the
inner
life
to
shine
through
it
is
none
the
less
an
external
protection
of
that
life
a
means
obviously
intended
for
such
selfpreservation
the
supreme
significance
however
of
the
contrast
here
presented
is
traceable
in
this
extraordinary
sensitiveness
of
the
human
cuticle
which
although
not
absolutely
the
seat
of
feeling
itself
alone
renders
such
feeling
possible
but
at
the
same
time
even
in
this
direction
we
are
made
conscious
of
the
defect
that
this
sensitiveness
does
not
penetrate
as
a
vital
impulse
of
concentrated
emphasis
equally
through
all
the
members
we
find
in
the
human
body
itself
certain
organs
whose
form
is
entirely
appropriate
to
mere
animal
functions
while
others
give
a
more
adequate
expression
to
the
entire
soullife
its
feelings
and
passions
regarded
in
this
way
it
is
obvious
that
even
in
the
human
body
the
inner
life
of
soul
has
not
found
its
complete
reflection
in
all
parts
of
its
external
realization
c
the
same
defect
is
apparent
on
the
higher
plane
of
the
spiritual
world
and
its
organizations
if
we
consider
such
under
the
aspect
of
life
as
immediately
presented
the
more
extensive
and
the
richer
their
configurations
are
the
more
we
shall
find
that
the
fundamental
object
of
the
inner
life
of
such
totalities
requires
other
means
cooperative
with
such
externality
for
its
adequate
expression
such
organizations
no
doubt
appear
in
immediate
reality
as
organic
wholes
in
which
definite
purpose
is
realized
and
the
realization
of
such
purpose
is
manifested
by
the
mediation
of
voluntary
effort
every
centre
of
such
a
spiritual
organism
such
as
the
state
or
the
family
that
is
to
say
each
individual
organic
totality
is
in
possession
of
a
will
capable
of
such
exercise
and
appears
in
unity
with
the
other
members
of
the
same
organism
but
the
one
inner
soul
of
this
nexus
the
freedom
and
reason
of
the
aim
of
all
is
not
visible
in
external
reality
as
such
in
the
absolute
freedom
of
its
subjective
and
universal
principle
of
life
nor
is
it
thus
manifested
in
every
part
the
same
thing
may
be
observed
in
particular
actions
and
events
where
we
find
a
similar
organic
totality
present
the
inner
motive
from
which
they
proceed
is
not
wholly
made
visible
upon
the
external
surface
of
their
actual
presence
what
we
do
find
is
a
total
presentment
of
fact
whose
most
fundamental
ground
of
unity
and
vitality
still
remains
hidden
from
sight
finally
when
we
consider
from
the
same
point
of
view
any
single
individual
we
are
confronted
with
the
same
truth
every
human
person
is
a
selfrounded
totality
held
together
by
the
central
unity
of
life
in
the
immediate
envisagement
of
reality
that
is
in
his
life
action
avoidance
of
action
desires
and
impulses
he
only
appears
in
a
fragmentary
way
none
the
less
it
is
only
from
a
general
survey
of
all
his
actions
or
sufferings
that
we
are
able
to
form
an
estimate
of
character
the
centre
of
unity
which
thus
concentrates
to
a
point
the
entire
subjectmatter
of
our
extended
survey
is
not
as
such
either
visible
or
directly
apprehended
2
the
second
point
of
importance
to
which
we
would
draw
attention
is
this
with
the
immediate
appearance
of
individuality
the
idea
as
we
have
already
indicated
receives
determinate
existence
through
this
very
immediacy
however
it
becomes
interwoven
with
the
complexity
of
the
external
world
is
conditioned
by
the
limitations
of
external
circumstance
and
the
relative
character
of
means
and
ends
which
are
found
there
in
one
word
is
carried
into
the
finitude
of
external
nature
for
though
immediate
singularity
is
in
the
first
place
a
fully
rounded
off
unity
it
is
for
the
same
reason
only
selfexclusive
as
a
centre
of
negation
opposed
to
others
and
is
by
virtue
of
its
immediate
singularity
influenced
by
no
less
than
related
to
a
totality
of
real
existence
other
than
its
own
upon
which
it
is
dependent
in
a
thousand
different
ways
the
idea
in
short
is
in
this
very
immediacy
realized
in
every
direction
as
individual
distinction
it
is
consequently
now
merely
a
reflex
of
the
inherent
energy
of
the
notion
which
binds
all
individual
existence
that
of

to
which

submit
whether

thereby

and
more
than
this
each

not

as

indeed

are
significant
in
a
very
subordinate
degree
if
we
consider
them
as
contributions
to
the
wellbeing
of
all
what
the
majority
may
carry
through
in
contrast
with
the
entire
aggregate
of

and
the
end
applicable
to
all265
to
which
it
furnishes
its
quota
is
after
all
a
mere
patch
nay
even
men
of
eminent
standing
who
feel
and
are
fully
conscious
of
the
universal
passage
of
events266
as
their
own
world
are
for
all
that
clearly
immeshed
in
the
same
net
of
particular
circumstances
conditions
and
a
thousand
other
hindrances
involved
in
their
relative
position
on
all
these
grounds
it
is
plain
that
in
this
sphere
of
exterior
life
the
individual
world
is
unable
to
offer
us
the
vision
of
that
independent
and
complete
freedom
of
the
living
principle
such
as
is
essential
to
the
true
notion
of
beauty
it
is
of
course
true
that
the
immediate
appearance
of
human
reality
and
its
events
and
organizations
is
not
without
system
and
as
such
is
a
totality
of
activities
but
this
whole
is
rather
in
its
appearance
a
mere
mass
of
isolated
fragments
moreover
the
practical
concerns
of
such
activities
are
divided
and
subdivided
into
countless
parts
and
in
such
a
way
that
each
single
part
is
in
touch
with
the
merest
fraction
of
all
and
in
short
however
much
individuals
may
remain
steadfast
to
their
own
purposes
and
only
bring
forth
to
the
light
that
which
their
own
interest
has
employed
as
a
means
the
selfsubsistence
and
freedom
of
their
will
remains
more
or
less
of
a
formal
character
determined
by
external
circumstance
or
accident
and
constantly
thwarted
by
natural
causes267
this
is
the
prose
of
the
world
as
presented
to
our
own
consciousness
no
less
than
to
that
of
others
a
world
of
finitude
and
change
a
world
immeshed
in
relation
and
submerged
beneath
the
pressure
of
necessity
a
world
from
which
no
individual
can
extricate
himself
the
central
paradox
of
life
confronts
every
unit
of
the
living
whole
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
impulse
of
individuality
to
perfect
its
isolated
unity
in
selfexclusion
on
the
other
there
is
the
necessary
condition
of
dependence
on
others
from
which
none
may
claim
immunity
however
prolonged
the
struggle
to
overcome
this
contradiction
may
be
the
effort
of
that
interminable
battle
only
terminates
with
life
itself

thirdly
the
immediate
singularity
of
the
worlds
of
nature
and
mind
is
not
merely
conditioned
by
dependence
on
others
but
is
deficient
in
any
complete
selfsubsistency
owing
to
its
confined
nature
or
with
more
accuracy
because
it
is
particularized
in
its
own
specific
mode
of
manifestation
a
we
will
explain
our
meaning
further
every
single
specimen
of
life
in
the
animal
world
is
from
the
first
fettered
by
a
definite
that
is
to
say
a
restricted
and
constant
species
beyond
the
limits
of
which
it
cannot
pass
there
is
in
the
spiritual
world
no
doubt
a
general
picture
of
life
and
its
organization
which
floats
vaguely
before
our
vision
but
in
the
real
world
which
is
one
with
nature
this
universal
organism
breaks
up
into
a
multitude
of
particulars
each
of
which
possesses
the
determinate
type
of
form
and
grade
of
cultivation
in
which
it
is
related
to
a
definite
portion
of
the
social
organism
in
addition
to
this
and
within
these
insuperable
limits
we
find
the
pressure
of
that
element
of
contingency
as
regards
general
condition
or
external
environment
predominantly
asserted
both
uniquely
and
in
haphazard
fashion
throughout
every
one
of
those
individual
units
such
a
state
of
things
disturbs
our
vision
of
the
selfsubsistency
and
freedom
which
the
idea
of
true
beauty
imperatively
requires
b
as
already
observed
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
spirit
discovers
in
its
own
bodily
organism
the
notion
of
life
completely
realized
this
is
so
much
the
case
that
in
contrast
with
it
the
forms
of
the
animal
world
appear
not
only
as
incomplete
but
in
inferior
species
as
even
pitiable
objects
the
human
organism
is
also
however
broken
up
if
to
a
less
degree
in
racial
subdivisions
and
the
ascending
grades
of
beauty
which
distinguish
such
races
moreover
in
addition
to
this
obviously
very
general
line
of
demarcation
we
have
presented
to
us
all
the
accidental
variety
of
qualities
peculiar
to
distinct
families
and
their
interfusion
with
one
another
such
as
modes
of
life
facial
expression
and
general
demeanour
we
must
further
associate
with
such
characteristic
traits
which
all
of
them
emphasize
a
condition
of
essentially
unfree
particularity
those
peculiarities
which
are
inseparable
from
activity
employed
in
the
endless
round
of
commercial
life
or
professional
career
qualities
which
find
their
ultimate
expression
in
the
specific
habits
or
idiosyncracies
of
any
exceptionally
marked
character
or
temperament

as
the
reverse
side

the
various
confusions

its
indelible
if
quite
incalculable
expression
on
the
varied
surface
of
the
faces
of
mankind
who
has
not
crossed
weatherbeaten
types
of
such
on
which
the
storm
of
all
the
passions
has
imprinted
its
disturbing
wave
or
others
where
the
coldness
and
superficiality
of
the
soul
within
is
all
the
impression
we
receive
or
lastly
as
the
final
verdict
of
selfabsorbed
particularity268
cases
in
which
the
general
type
seems
almost
totally
to
have
disappeared
there
is
no
end
to
the
caprice
of
the
human
features
speaking
generally
we
would
associate
with
this
ground
the
fact
that
the
beauty
of
children
most
arrests
us
in
their
faces
we
find
all
pronounced
idiosyncracies
slumber
as
it
were
beneath
a
quiet
veil
no
dominating
passion
as
yet
ravages
their
soul
not
one
of
the
thousand
interests
of
the
grown
man
has
engraved
for
ever
the
expression
of
its
necessity
on
these
mobile
features
this
envisaged
innocence
of
the
child
however
though
we
may
discover
in
its
flexible
animation
the
possibility
of
lifes
completed
fulness
obviously
fails
to
reveal
those
profounder
indications
of
a
spirit
which
has
been
carried
forward
to
explore
the
range
of
its
own
recesses
and
to
make
its
life
one
with
rational
purpose
we
may
regard
then
immediate
existence
both
in
the
purely
physical
and
spiritual
sense
of
the
term
as
a
finitude
or
more
justly
as
a
finitude
which
does
not
satisfy
its
notion
and
for
this
very
reason
declares
its
finitude
for
the
notion
and
more
concretely
still
the
idea
is
essentially
independent
and
free
purely
animal
life
although
as
life
it
is
the
idea
is
no
manifestation
of
infinity
as
such
or
freedom
this
is
alone
possible
under
conditions
where
we
find
the
notion
penetrate
so
completely
the
reality
which
is
adequate
to
it
that
it
finds
itself
entirely
at
home
therein
with
no
extraneous
matter
to
disturb
its
possession
then
alone
do
we
find
it
a
really
free
and
concrete
individuality
the
natural
life
on
the
contrary
is
unable
to
overcome
the
element
of
feeling
to
which
it
is
attached
and
which
renders
it
incapable
of
penetrating
the
entire
reality
which
enrings
it
it
finds
itself
moreover
immediately
conditioned
in
itself
restricted
in
its
range
and
dependent
a
result
which
is
due
to
the
fact
that
its
freedom
is
not
truly
selfdeterminate
but
conditioned
by
the
external
object
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
immediate
and
finite
reality
of
the
spirit
world
in
its
knowledge
volitional
action
and
fateful
history
for
although
in
this
latter
case
we
find
centres
of
unity
expressed
which
have
a
real
significance
neither
these
any
more
than
the
particularities
they
unite
have
truth
as
they
stand
by
themselves
but
only
that
truth
which
in
their
reciprocal
relation
to
each
other
they
manifest
as
constituent
parts
of
a
whole
and
this
whole

correspond

which
consequently
still
remains
aloof
from
such
envisagement

rather
is
only
apprehended
in
the
ideal
world
of
thought
in
other
words
the
notion
finds
no
fully
adequate
presentation
in
external
reality
such
as
is
powerful
enough
to
marshal
homogeneously
all
the
numberless
fragments
of
particularity
and
to
concentrate
them
into
one
expression
and
one
single
form
c
this
then
is
the
fundamental
reason
which
prevents
spirit
itself
on
the
finite
planes
of
determinate
existence
and
under
the
restricting
conditions
of
its
externality
and
necessity
from
rediscovering
the
immediate
vision
and
enjoyment
of
its
freedom
it
is
consequently
driven
by
its
absence
to
seek
that
vision
in
a
higher
sphere
that
sphere
is
art
and
its
realization
is
the
ideal
we
have
thus
seen
that
it
is
the
defects
of
immediate
reality
which
drive
us
forward
inevitably
to
the
idea
of
the
beauty
of
art
we
are
further
under
an
obligation
to
prove
that
its
fundamental
object270
is
to
manifest
here
on
this
very
plane
of
rational
reality
and
in
its
freedom
the
envisagement
of
life
and
most
important
of
all
the
life
of
spirit
here
then
we
have
at

the
external
revealed
to
us
in
a
form
adequate
to
the
notion
here
for
the
first
time
truth
is
lifted
up
from
its
environment
of
temporal
conditions
from
its
running
to
and
fro
among
the
whirl
of
finite
particularity
and
attains
repose
nay
more
than
this
discovers
an
external
form
from
which
the
hunger
of
nature
and
the
prose
of
life
no
longer
stare
at
us
here
at
last
we
have
a
form
worthy
of
substantial
truth
which
is
wholly
selfcontained
and
selfdependent
determining
with
freedom
its
own
content

not
driven
from
such

the

that

the
beauty
of
art
or
the
ideal
in
our
consideration
of
the
beauty
of
art
we
will
confine
our
attention
to
three
fundamental
points
of
view
first
the
ideal
in
its
essential
import
secondly
the
determination
of
the
ideal
in
a
particular
work
of
art
thirdly
the
creative
subjectivity
of
the
artist
a
the
ideal
simply
or
as
such
1
the
most
general
conclusion
which
may
be
gathered
from
the
examination
we
have
already
made
in
a
merely
formal
way
of
the
ideal
of
art
may
be
thus
summarized
truth
in
its
unravelment
as
external
reality
is
only
fully
in
possession
of
a
true
and
determinate
existence
however
much
it
may
combine
and
retain
in
embracing
unity
a
manifold
content
in
so
far
as
every
portion
of
the
content
thus
unfolded
permits
this
unity
which
may
be
called
either
the
animating
soul
or
the
unified
totality
freely
to
appear
to
take
the
human
form
once
more
under
review
as
the
most
direct
illustration
of
this
we
have
already
remarked
that
it
is
a
totality
of
organic
members
each
of
which
is
penetrated
by
the
notion
differentiated
thus
in
every
particular
organ
by
some
particular
mode
of
activity
and
the
specific
motion
congenial
to
it
if
we
ask
ourselves
now
in
which
particular
organ
the
soul
appears
as
such
in
its
entirety
we
shall
at
once
point
to
the
eye
for
in
the
eye
the
soul
concentrates
itself
it
not
merely
uses
the
eye
as
its
instrument
but
is
itself
therein
manifest
we
have
however
already
stated
when
referring
to
the
external
covering
of
the
human
body
that
in
contrast
with
the
bodies
of
animals
the
heart
of
life
pulses
through
and
throughout
it
and
in
much
the
same
sense
it
can
be
asserted
of
art
that
it
has
to
convert
every
point
of
the
external
appearance
into
the
direct
testimony
of
the
human
eye
which
is
the
source
of
soullife
and
reveals
spirit
take
the
famous
adjuration
of
plato
to
the
stars
in
the
lines
when
thou
gazest
forth
at
the
stars
my
star
would
that
i
were
the
heavens
and
thence
on
thee
could
gaze
forth
out
of
a
thousand
eyes
conversely
we
may
exclaim
that
art
gives
to
her
forms
the
dilation
of
a
thousandeyed
argus
through
which
the
inward
life
of
spirit
at
every
point
breaks
into
view
and
not
merely
is
it
the
bodily
form
the
expression
of
countenance
the
attitude
and
demeanour
which
thus
avails
the
same
appearance
is
everywhere
visible
in
actions
and
events
speech
and
voicemodulation
in
short
under
every
condition
of
life
through
which
it
passes
and
under
which
it
is
possible
for
soul
to
make
itself
recognized
in
its
freedom
and
ideal
infinity
a
and
in
close
connection
with
this
inquiry
into
the
interpenetration
through
all
parts
of
the
animating
soul
we
may
justly
ask
ourselves
what
precisely
we
understand
under
this
conception
of
a
soul
which
is
throughout
visible
or
to
restrict
attention
to
definite
limits
we
may
inquire
what
are
the
specific
characteristics
of
the
soul
whereof
art
reveals
to
us
the
truest
manifestation
for
in
ordinary
parlance
one
refers
to
the
animating
principle271
peculiar
to
metals
stones
wild
animals
to
say
nothing
of
that
belonging
to
every
kind
of
human
character
and
its
expressions
to
natural
objects
however
such
as
stones
and
plants
the
expression
soul
in
the
complete
acceptation
of
the
term
above
mentioned
is
not
strictly
applicable
such
soul
as
purely
natural
objects
possess
is
entirely
finite
transitory
and
rather
a
specific
nature
than
a
soul
the
determinate
individuality
of
such
existences
is
consequently
completely
exposed
in
their
finite
existence
and
inasmuch
as
all
that
is
present
there
is
a
positive
limit
of
restriction
such
appearance
as
there
may
be
of
a
further
claim
to
independence
and
freedom
is
only
an
appearance
ideal
characteristics
which
may
indeed
be
imported
into
them
from
without
by
means
of
art
but
are
not
in
the
nature
of
the
objects
by
themselves
in
the
same
way
the
soul
of
sensefeeling
through
which
nature
manifests
first
the
lifeprinciple
only
betrays
a
subjective
individuality
which
still
remains
shut
within
itself
unable
to
assert
its
reality
in
the
further
sense
of
a
return
upon
itself
in
a
consciousness
which
shall
attach
to
it
the
form
of
infinity
its
content
is
therefore
of
a
restricted
nature
and
its
manifestation
in
part
the
unrest
power
of
motion
sexual
impulse
anxiety
or
fear
of
the
dependent
life
and
in
part
it
is
the
mere
expression
of
an
inwardness
capable
of
overcoming
its
finitude
the
animating
life
of
spirit
mind
brings
us
first
into
contact
with
the
free
infinity
capable
within
its
own
external
and
determinate
existence
of
remaining
constant
to
the
inner
principle
of
unity
and
in
the
act
of
expression
still
reflected
back
upon
its
ideal
substance
to
spirit
consequently
is
it
alone
permitted
to
impress
the
hallmark
of
its
infinity
and
free
selfrecurrence
on
its
external
expression
even
though
by
such
expression
it
enters
the
realm
of
narrow
boundaries
at
the
same
time
we
may
observe
that
spirit
too
is
only
free
and
infinite
in
so
far
as
it
truly
apprehends
its
universality
and
deliberately
posits
for
itself
and
accepts
those
ends
which
are
adequate
to
its
own
notion
consequently
in
so
far
as
it
fails
to
grasp
its
own
freedom
it
can
only
exist
in
a
restricted
content
a
character
that
is
stunted
a
temperament
at
once
crippled
and
superficial
in
combination
with
nullity
of
this
kind
the
manifestation
of
spirit
must
perforce
remain
wholly
formal
we
shall
only
find
here
the
abstract
crust
of
selfconscious
spirit
whereof
the
content
contradicts
the
infinity
of
its
freedom
only
by
virtue
of
a
genuine
and
essentially
substantive
content
through
which
the
restricted
and
mutable
particularity
derives
its
essential
selfsubsistencyso
that
definite
structure
and
intrinsic
worth
determined
limit
and
substantial
content
are
realized
in
one
totalityis
such
existence
thereby
able
through
the
very
mode
of
expression
which
confines
it
to
proclaim
itself
also
in
its
universal
substance
of
selfcontained
soullife
it
is
in
short
the
province
of
art
to
comprehend
and
enunciate
determinate
and
rational
existence
in
its
truth
that
is
to
say
in
the
form
adequate
to
its
substance
the
truly
explicit
content
and
consequently
the
truth
of
art
cannot
consist
in
a
mere
conformity
such
as
that
to
which
we
restrict
the
socalled
imitation
of
nature
external
form
must
express
harmoniously
an
internal
content
which
is
in
itself
harmonious
throughout
and
consequently
can
express
itself
as
such
b
art
then
by
comparing
what
is
otherwise
stained
and
rent
through
the
contingent
elements
of
external
existence
with
the
harmony
that
is
essential
to
its
notional
truth
rejects
that
in
the
world
of
appearance
which
it
is
unable
to
combine
in
such
a
unity
and
for
the
first
time
through
this
purification
reveals
the
ideal
it
is
possible
to
regard
such
a
result
as
the
flattery
of
art
as
we
sometimes
hear
it
said
for
example
that
portraitpainters
flatter
but
even
the
portraitpainter
a
type
of
art
in
which
the
ideal
is
less
prominent
than
in
many
others
should
at
least
flatter
in
this
sense
that
he
is
bound
to
treat
with
indifference
all
that
is
merely
the
external
detail
of
form
texture
and
colour
the
mere
adjuncts
that
is
to
say
of
physical
life
such
as
hairs
pores
scars
and
other
external
accidents
in
his
undivided
effort
both
to
apprehend
and
deliver
the
subject
selected
in
its
universal
character
and
permanent
spiritual
individuality
it
is
one
thing
to
imitate
a
physiognomy
in
the
general
outlines
of
purely
superficial
repose
apparent
at
any
time
it
is
quite
another
to
detect
and
delineate
the
particular
features
which
reveal
the
fundamental
soullife
or
character
of
the
sitter
as
already
remarked
the
ideal
is
only
truly
found
when
the
external
presentment
is
in
itself
a
vehicle
of
the
soul
it
is
one
of
our
latest
fashions
to
attempt
by
means
of
those
socalled
living
pictures
an
intentional
and
gratifying
imitation
of
famous
masterpieces
in
these
we
find
a
fair
reproduction
of
general
accessories
such
as
grouping
and
draping
but
instead
of
the
spiritual
expression
of
the
figures
have
only
too
often
to
put
up
with
faces
absolutely
commonplace
such
a
defect
mars
the
entire
reproduction
the
madonnas
of
raphael
on
the
contrary
in
every
detail
of
their
countenancewhether
it
be
cheeks
eyes
nose
or
mouthexhibit
with
harmonious
consistency
one
supreme
type
of
sacred
joy
the
pious
modest
love
of
a
devoted
mother
we
may
affirm
if
we
will
that
all
women
are
capable
of
such
emotion
but
at
any
rate
not
every
formal
shape
of
feminine
countenance
is
capable
of
expressing
the
depth
of
the
same
so
consummately
c
this
reference
then
of
all
points
of
external
existence
to
their
spiritual
significance
so
that
the
external
appearance
unveils
in
adequate
measure
the
spirit
thereof
is
just
what
constitutes
the
nature
of
the
ideal
it
is
however
a
carrying
back
into
inwardness
in
which
we
do
not
find
the
universal
thus
carried
back
to
its
extremest
limit
to
the
form
of
abstract
thought
that
is
to
say
but
is
rather
suffered
to
rest
halfway
at
the
point
in
which
we
find
the
purely
external
and
the
purely
inward
meet
together
harmoniously
the
ideal
is
consequently
the
reality
selected
out
of
the
mass
of
chance
particulars
in
so
far
as
the
inner
core
in
this
external
totality
thus
raised
in
opposition
to
universality
is
itself
manifested
as
living
individuality272
for
the
individual
subjectivity
which
not
only
carries
in
itself
a
substantive
content
but
permits
the
same
to
appear
in
its
own
external
appearance
stands
in
this
central
position
that
in
it
all
that
is
substantially
the
content
is
not
suffered
in
its
universal
aspect
to
appear
as
an
abstraction
of
itself
but
still
remains
enclosed
within
the
sphere
of
individuality
and
consequently
appears
associated
with
a
determinate
existence
which
now
for
its
part
freed
from
mere
finitude
and
transitory
condition
is
gathered
up
in
a
free
and
harmonious
expression
of
most
intimate
soullife

in

the
spirits
which
rise
up
here
have
lost
in
death
immediate
existence
are
released
from
the
hunger
of
nature
freed
from
the
claims
which
fettered
them
in
subjection
to
external
forces
and
all
the
changes
and
confusions
which
are
linked
together
with
finite
appearance
but
however
much
the
ideal
treads
under
foot
the
mere
object
of
sense
and
natural
form
it
draws
at
the
same
time
the
very
wealth
of
it
to
itself
for
it
is
art
that
is
able
to
assign
the
very
limits
to
all
that
the
external
appearance
required
for
its
selfpreservation
within
which
the
external
thing
may
appear
as
the
manifestation
of
spiritual
freedom
for
this
reason
it
is
the
ideal
which
alone
among
things
envisaged
to
sense
presents
a
free
and
selfcontained
content
reposing
on
its
own
resources
in
complete
sensuous
enjoyment
and
satisfaction
with
itself
the
music
of
this
rapture
may
be
heard
through
every
embodiment
of
the
ideal
however
far
the
external
form
may
be
carried
the
soul
of
the
ideal
is
never
wholly
absorbed
in
it
and
in
truth
such
manifestation
is
only
beautiful
in
so
far
as
its
beauty
not
merely
permeates
the
whole
but
is
a
subjective
unity
by
virtue
of
which
the
subjectmatter
of
the
ideal
must
appear
emergent
from
all
the
fracture
of
its
former
individual
parts
and
their
respective
ends
and
energies
raised
in
the
ideal
itself
to
a
higher
totality
and
selfsubsistence

we
may
in
this
respect
point
to
the
blessed
repose273
this
selfcontentment
in
its
own
selfsecure
consummation
as
the
crown
of
the
ideal
the
ideal
form
of
art
stands
like
some
blissful
god
before
us
for
the
blessed
gods
are
ultimately
above
and
beyond
the
grim
earnest
of
actual
necessity
anger
and
interest
in
finite
existence
and
purely
finite
ends
and
this
positive
withdrawal
involved
in
the
negation
of
all
isolated
particularity
give
them
the
characteristics
of
cheerfulness
and
repose
in
this
sense
we
may
interpret
that
phrase
of
schiller
life
is
earnest
art
is
cheerful
pedants
no
doubt
have
often
enough
cracked
a
joke
over
it
inasmuch
as
poetry
in
general
and
schillers
in
particular
is
a
serious
matter
and
in
truth
no
ideal
art
is
without
such
a
quality
but
for
all
that
in
this
very
earnestness
the
essential
character
of
cheerfulness274
remains
this
force
of
individuality
this
triumph
of
selfconcentrated
freedom
is
that
which
we
recognize
in
an
exceptional
degree
in
ancient
works
of
art
and
the
blithesome
repose
of
their
figures
and
this
is
not
merely
the
case
when
we
face
a
satisfaction
that
involves
no
struggle
but
even
in
an
example
where
the
subject
is
rent
by
some
breach
in
the
entire
content
of
its
existence
for
when
the
heroes
of
tragedy
are
represented
as
subject
to
fate
we
find
that
the
demeanour
they
present
which
may
be
summed
up
in
the
words
it
is
so
still
remains
a
simple
withdrawal
into
personality275
the
subject
thus
depicted
remains
throughout
true
to
himself
he
surrenders
that
which
is
seized
from
him
but
the
aims
he
pursued
are
not
simply
taken
away
he
suffers
them
to
lapse
and
consequently
does
not
lose
his
initiative
the
man
who
is
the
bondman
of
destiny
may
lose
his
life
but
not
his
freedom
this
repose
on
the
essential
birthright
of
spirit
is
that
which
is
able
to
preserve
and
reveal
the
blithe
atmosphere
of
repose
in
grief
itself

in
romantic
art
it
is
true
the
breach
or
dissonance
of
the
subjective
principle
is
carried
further
inasmuch
as
in
it
the
exposed
contradictions
are
emphasized
and
their
division
can
be
preserved
thus
to
take
an
example
we
find
the
art
of
painting
in
its
representation
of
the
passion
not
unfrequently
dallies
round
the
expression
of
ribaldry
visible
in
the
hideous
contortions
and
grimaces
of
tormenting
common
soldiers
and
in
its
attachment
to
such
discordant
emotions
especially
when
depicting
what
is
criminal
shameless
or
evil
permitting
the
glad
serenity
of
the
ideal
to
pass
away
even
when
such
disruption
loses
its
force
we
find
frequently
that
ugliness
or
at
least
the
absence
of
real
beauty
is
set
up
in
its
place
in
another
school
of
the
earlier
flemish
art
of
painting
the
downright
directness
and
truth
of
the
representation
no
less
than
the
inextinguishable
confidence
of
the
faith
to
which
it
testifies
tend
to
assert
in
despite
of
itself
a
reconciliation
in
the
feelings
of
all
who
behold
it276
but
such
an
unyielding
result
falls277
short
of
the
entire
cheerfulness
and
satisfaction
appropriate
to
the
ideal
however
it
is
possible
also
in
romantic
art
albeit
here
the
representation
of
suffering
and
grief
penetrates
the
soul
and
its
emotions
more
deeply
than
is
the
case
with
antique
art
that
the
delineation
may
reveal
to
us
a
spiritual
intimacy
a
delight
in
resignation
a
blessedness
in
pain
a
rapture
in
sorrow
nay
even
a
voluptuous
ecstasy
in
martyrdom278
not
only
in
painting
but
in
the
profoundly
religious
music
of
italian
composers
we
find
this
ecstasy
and
illumination
of
grief
abundantly
expressed
we
may
as
a
summary
definition
in
romantic
art
call
it
the
smile
through
tears
the
tears
have
their
origin
in
affliction
the
smile
in
blithesome
serenity
and
consequently
this
smile
through
weeping
indicates
as
it
were
the
point
of
selfrepose
in
the
midst
of
pain
and
suffering
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
the
smile
indicated
here
is
no
mere
sentimental
emotion
no
mere
vanity
of
the
subject
treated
or
dabbling
with
beauty279
over
painful
effects
and
insignificant
traits
of
subjective
feeling
rather
on
its
artistic
side
it
must
appear
as
the
firm
delineation
and
freedom
of
beauty
in
defiance
of
all
pain
in
the
spirit
of
what
was
said
of
ximenes
in
the
romances
of
the
cid
how
beautiful
she
was
in
tears
in
contrast
to
this
emotional
abandonment
in
men
is
either
ugly
and
repellent
or
actually
ridiculous
children
for
example
break
into
tears
at
the
slightest
provocation
and
we
can
only
laugh
at
them
the
tears
however
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
of
earnest
and
selfcontained
character
under
stress
of
deep
feeling
betray
a
very
different
type
of
emotion
laughter
and
tears
can
however
very
readily
fall
apart
as
unrelated
and
are
as
such
falsely
utilized
as
a
vehicle
of
art
in
such
abstraction
the
laughter
chorus
in
webers
freischtz
may
be
cited
as
an
example
laughter
after
all
is
a
kind
of
explosion
which
it
is
impossible
to
exercise
without
restraint
and
preserve
the
ideal
another
example
of
this
laughter
which
is
nothing
but
laughter
occurs
in
a
duet
of
webers
oberon
throughout
which
we
are
in
a
continual
state
of
anxiety
for
the
prima
donnas
throat
and
lungs
how
very
differently
the
inextinguishable
laughter
of
the
gods
affects
us
in
homer
a
sound
which
breaks
from
the
blessed
repose
of
divinity
and
rather
expresses
gladsome
serenity
than
abstract
and
wanton
abandonment
just
as
little
ought
weeping
devoid
of
all
restraint
to
be
introduced
into
the
ideal
work
of
art
of
such
a
kind
as
that
we
may
hear
in
all
its
comfortlessness
in
another
part
of
the
freischtz
and
speaking
generally
in
music
singing
must
take
to
itself
the
kind
of
joy
and
rapture
which
we
catch
from
the
lark
in
the
open
sky
shrieking
whether
of
pain
or
delight
is
not
music
at
all
even
in
the
expression
of
suffering
the
sweet
tones
of
the
plaint
must
penetrate
and
clarify
the
sorrows
so
that
it
continually
may
seem
to
us
worth
all
the
suffering
to
arrive
at
such
sweetness
of
plaint
in
its
expression
and
this
is
the
sweetness
of
melody
the
singing
of
every
kind
of
art

regarded
in
a
certain
relation
to
this
fundamental
axiom
of
art
we
may
find
some
justification
for
the
principle
of
irony
in
its
modern
sense
but
it
must
not
be
overlooked
that
irony
is
frequently
destitute
of
all
real
seriousness
and
is
particularly
prone
to
expatiate
over
bad
subjectmatter
and
in
another
aspect
of
it
it
is
apt
to
run
to
seed
in
the
mere
yearning
of
emotion
rather
than
actively
participate
in
practical
life
as
is
proved
by
the
case
of
novalis
one
of
the
finer
temperaments
who
have
made
this
point
of
view
their
own
and
for
lack
of
definite
interest
or
through
shrinking
from
the
real
world
are
driven
up
and
down
and
cajoled
into
this
sort
of
spiritual
consumption
this
is
the
kind
of
yearning
which
will
not
descend
to
mere
practical
business
and
production
because
it
is
afraid
of
soiling
itself
with
the
contact
of
finite
things
although
it
already
secretly
feels
the
defects
of
such
exclusion
no
doubt
we
find
in
irony
that
absolute
principle
of
negativity
in
which
the
subject
of
consciousness
becomes
selfcentred
through
the
annihilation
of
definite
relations
and
particulars
but
in
this
case
the
act
of
annihilation
of
definite
relations
and
particulars
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
when
discussing
the
principle
is
not
as
in
comedy
essentially
in
its
right
place
simply
exposing
its
own
want
of
substance
but
is
directed
quite
as
often
against
everything
else
excellent
in
itself
and
of
sterling
worth
whether
we
regard
irony
then
as
this
art
of
universal
destruction
or
as
the
yearning
of
which
we
have
spoken
in
contrast
with
the
true
ideal
it
betrays
a
secret
lack
of
proportion
and
restraint
which
is
detrimental
to
the
artist
substantive
form
is
what
the
ideal
demands
which
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
is
clothed
in
the
form
and
figure
of
external
things
is
unquestionably
qualified
by
particularity
no
less
than
limitation
but
this
limitation
of
its
form
is
at
the
same
time
included
in
such
a
way
that
everything
merely
external
in
its
appearance
is
annulled
and
abolished
only
through
this
negation
of
mere
externality
is
the
determinate
form
of
the
ideal
a
real
exposition
of
the
substantive
content
which
belongs
to
it
in
a
mode
of
appearance
susceptible
to
senseperception
and
the
imagination
2
the
plastic
presentment
of
form
which
is
as
much
a
constituent
feature
of
the
ideal
as
it
is
of
the
essentially
homogeneous
character
of
its
content
and
the
way
these
two
aspects
are
fused
together
render
necessary
an
inquiry
into
the
relation
obtaining
between
the
ideal
representation
of
art
and
nature
for
this
external
aspect
and
its
embodiment
is
closely
associated
with
that
which
we
generally
call
nature
in
this
connection
we
once
more
come
upon
that
old
and
everrenewed
and
still
unsettled
dispute
whether
the
representation
of
art
should
follow
the
objects
of
nature
as
they
appear
strictly
to
sense
or
should
rather
ennoble
and
illumine
them
the
right
of
nature
the
rule
of
beauty
the
ideal
and
the
truth
of
naturewith
indefinite
conceptions
such
as
these
arguments
for
and
against
may
be
bandied
about
for
ever
a
work
of
art
we
are
told
should
unquestionably
be
natural
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
mean
or
ugly
nature
we
must
not
of
course
imitate
that
on
the
other
handand
so
our
disputants
wrangle
on
and
never
come
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
in
recent
times
the
opposition
between
the
ideal
and
nature
has
once
more
been
emphasized
and
received
an
exceptional
significance
through
the
writings
of
winckelmann
winckelmanns
enthusiasm
as
already
pointed
out280
was
first
awakened
by
his
study
of
the
antique
and
its
ideal
forms
this
insight
into
the
peculiar
excellence
of
classic
art
he
thoroughly
mastered
and
only
ceased
from
his
labours
after
making
all
that
he
had
learned
through
his
study
of
such
masterpieces
famous
throughout
europe
from
this
recognition
however
originated
a
kind
of
craze
for
ideal
representation
which
despite
all
its
belief
in
the
discovery
of
beauty
was
really
a
relapse
into
flatness
absence
of
vitality
and
superficiality
it
is
this
kind
of
emptiness
more
particularly
in
the
art
of
painting
which
herr
von
rumohr
had
before
him
in
the
polemical
writings
i
have
already
noticed
the
theory
of
art
has
to
solve
this
difficulty
as
for
its
interest
on
the
practical
side
of
art
we
shall
do
well
to
pass
it
wholly
by
we
may
formulate
principles
as
we

for

and
the
talents
that
express
it
the
result
is
always
the
same
whether
our
theory
is
a
distorted
one
or
unexceptionable
all
we
shall
get
is
something
commonplace
or
weak
at
the
same
time
art
and
more
particularly
painting
has
unquestionably
received
a
stimulus
other
than
that
we
have
deprecated
from
this
very
quest
of
socalled
ideals
and
through
the
renewed
interest
thereby
excited
in
old
italian
and
german
painters
has
at
least
made
an
effort
to
secure
a
profounder
and
more
vital
content
in
its
work
the
world
is
quite
as
tired
of
hearing
the
praises
of
that
equally
exclusive
ideal
in
the
opposite
camp
namely
that
of
undiluted
realism

are
to
take
an
example
close
at

heartily
sick
of
the

question
of

tales

most
of

will
prefer
to
take
where
we
may
at
least
get
them
without
adulterationat
home
in
this
opposition
between
ideal
and
nature
writers
have
been
inclined
to
regard
one
type
of
art
to
the
exclusion
of
others
with
an
especial
predilection
however
for
painting
whose
subjectmatter
is
the
particularity
of
senseperception
we
will
test
our
problem
by
putting
the
question
to
start
with
wholly
in
general
terms
thus
is
art
to
be
prose
or
poetry
now
what
is
truly
poetical
in
art
is
just
that
which
we
have
called
the
ideal
if
the
question
of
difficulty
in
question
is
a
mere
matter
of
terminology
we
are
quite
prepared
to
call
the
ideal
something
else
but
however
called
the
question
remains
what
it
is
which
constitutes
poetry
or
prose
in
art
and
although
the
adherence
to
what
is
in
itself
poetical
in
the
determination
of
it
by
certain
crafts
may
lead
those
arts
into
confusion
and
indeed
has
already
done
so
it
is
contended
that
in
so
far
as
any
subject
has
an
express
affinity
with
poetry
such
has
been
also
the
subject
of
genuine
pictorial
treatment
genuine
for
the
simple
reason
that
such
a
content
is
unquestionably
of
a
true
poetical
nature
well
let
us
examine
a
concrete
case
the
present
exhibition
of
art
1818
contains
several
pictures
all
of
which
are
of
one
school
the
socalled
dsseldorf
every
one
of
these
have
borrowed
subjects
from
poetry
and
indeed
from
the
emotional
side
of
poetry
peculiarly
adapted
to
pictorial
representation
the
more
often
and
carefully
we
examine
these
pictures
the
more
complete
will
be
our
impression
of
their
excessive
sweetness
and
insipidity281
in
the
foregoing
contradiction
there
are
present
the
following
general
characteristics282
a
first
there
is
the
formal
ideality
of
the
work
of
art
that
is
to
say
the
element
of
poetry
in
its
general
signification
which
is
as
the
term
implies
something
composed
and
brought
together
by
man
which
he
has
taken
into
his
imagination283
and
then
actively
worked
into
the
artistic
composition

the
nature
of
the
content
of
such
a
translation
may
however
be
a
matter
of
indifference
or
apart
from
the
artistic
representation
we
thus
obtain
of
common
life
may
only
interest
us
indirectly
for
the
moment
in
this
way
the
dutch
school
of
painting
for
example
has
recreated
as
it
were
by
means
of
human
workmanship
the
evanescent
everyday
appearances
of
natural
objects
in
countless
new
artistic
effects
velvet
armour
light
horses
workfolk
old
cronies
peasants
puffing
their
smoke
from
old
pipe
stumps
the
glitter
of
wine
in
transparent
tumblers
rustics
in
soiled
jackets
playing
with
cards
as
ancientsuch
and
a
hundred
other
subjects
like
them
which
trouble
us
little
enough
in
everyday
life
for
the
best
of
reasons
that
although
we
too
may
have
our
game
at
cards
our
drink
and
our
gossip
we
are
really
occupied
with
quite
another
class
of
interestsall
this
medley
of
objects
is
brought
before
us
in
their
pictures
now
the
claim
of
art
in
the
representation
of
such
things
is
precisely
this
external
show
or
reappearance
of
them
as
a
product
of
spiritual
activity
which
has
transmuted
that
which
was
purely
external
and
sensuously
material
into
a
new
medium
supplied
by
mind
for
instead
of
wool
or
silk
that
are
tangible
instead
of
actual
hair
glasses
flesh
and
metals
all
we
see
now
is
colour
instead
of
the
three
dimensions
which
are
essential
to
external
nature
we
have
only
superficies
and
yet
despite
all
our
losses
we
have
a
representation
identical
with
that
of
reality

in
opposition
to
the
immediate
and
prosaic
reality
of
objects
then
this
show
of
things
which
is
effected
by
the
mind
is
the
wonder
of
ideality
a
jest
if
anyone
cares
to
put
it
so
and
an
irony
directed
against
purely
external
existence
only
contrast
with
it
the
preparations
nature
or
man
has
to
make
in
ordinary
life
the
countless
instruments
of
every
kind
they
have
to
employ
to
effect
the
same
result
what
opposition
the
material
of
such
objectstake
a
metal
for
examplemay
offer
to
any
active
effect
upon
it
the
world
of
ideas
on
the
contrary
out
of
which
art
creates
its
products
is
a
malleable
and
simple
element
which
readily
converts
everything
which
either
nature
or
man
in
his
purely
natural
existence
is
forced
to
leave
bluntly
just
as
they
are
to
the
uses
which
are
appropriate
to
it
in
the
same
way
the
objects
of
ordinary
apprehension
and
man
as
we
meet
him
in
everyday
life
are
of
no
incommensurable
wealth
but
subject
to
limitationsprecious
stones
plants
animals
etc
by
themselves
are
of
a
certain
positive
and
particular
character
but
man
in
his
creative
capacity
is
an
entire
world
of
content
which
he
has
filched
from
nature
and
piled
together
in
the
comprehensive
treasurehouse
of
his
world
of
images
and
which
he
is
now
free
to
give
forth
again
simply
and
without
the
restraint
of
external
conditions
and
the
detailed
processes
of
actual
phenomena
in
this
idealization
art
stands
midway
between
the
purely
objective
and
restricted
existence
and
the
entirely
subjective
world
of
idea
it
gives
indeed
objects
but
they
are
supplied
from
the
life
of
mind
it
offers
them
for
uses
other
than
those
which
belong
to
them
it
concentrates
their
entire
interest
in
the
abstract
form
of
the
ideal
show
which
it
therewith
manifests
to
aesthetic
contemplation
and
to
that
alone

art
consequently
through
the
ideality
above
explained
exalts
objects
otherwise
unimportant
determining
them
despite
their
ordinary
character
in
a
fixed
relation
to
her
own
medium
and
essential
aim
and
by
so
doing
secures
from
us
a
sympathy
in
subjectmatter
which
otherwise
would
not
have
enlisted
our
serious
attention
we
find
the
same
transformation
in
the
relation
of
art
to
time
its
position
is
here
too
frankly
ideal
that
which
in
nature
rapidly
passes
by
in
art
is
secured
with
permanence
the
flash
of
a
smile
the
sudden
curve
of
roguish
merriment
on
the
lips
a
glance
a
gleam
of
sunshine
together
with
all
those
evanescent
traits
of
human
life
events
and
accidents
which
come
and
are
gone
and
are
as
quickly
lost
to
memory
there
is
nothing
which
she
cannot
wrest
from
momentary
existence
and
in
this
respect
even
becomes
the
vanquisher
of
nature
herself
in
this
formal
ideality
of
art
however
it
is
not
the
content
itself
which
makes
the
preeminent
claim
upon
us
but
the
satisfaction
we
derive
from
the
act
of
artistic
reproduction
the
representation
must
certainly
strike
us
as
natural
but
it
is
not
the
reality
of
nature
that
we
require
it
is
rather
that
of
the
process
of
reproduction
this
very
deposition
in
fact
of
material
conditions
which
is
the
poetical
and
ideal
element
of
the
work
in
the
formal
sense
above
indicated284
we
delight
in
a
manifestation
which
appears
to
us
a
product
of
nature
and
which
is
nevertheless
a
product
of
mind
without
the
means
at
natures
disposition
the
objects
charm
us
not
so
much
by
virtue
of
their
approach
to
nature
but
rather
because
the
artist
has
been
able
to
effect
that
approach
b
a
further
and
still
profounder
reason
for
our
interest
in
artistic
products
consists
in
this
that
the
content
is
not
brought
before
us
in
those
forms
in
which
it
is
found
in
immediate
existence
but
being
itself
minted
by
the
mind
is
capable
of
considerable
extension
and
modification
within
such
forms
all
that
exists
in
nature
is
particular
and
indeed
limited
in
every
direction
by
such
particularity
the
creative
faculty285
however
contains
an
intrinsic
determination
of
universal
import
and
all
that
it
produces
possesses
forthwith
a
character
of
universality
distinct
from
the
particularity
of
nature
the
creative
faculty
thereby
secures
this
advantage
that
being
of
a
wider
range
it
is
more
qualified
to
grasp
ideal
significance
and
to
insist
on
that
explicitly
in
all
that
it
shows
us
it
is
quite
true
that
a
work
of
art
is
not
entirely
the
imaginative
concept
in
its
universal
aspect
but
rather
the
determinate
form
of
its
envisagement
it
is
for
all
that
bound
emanating
as
it
does
from
the
creative
medium
and
operations
of
mind
and
despite
the
living
resemblance
to
real
things
we
may
find
upon
it
to
permeate
the
whole
with
this
universal
quality
and
in
this
we
have
that
higher
ideality
of
the
poetical
product
as
contrasted
with
the
purely
formal
ideality
of
the
art
of
production
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
the
task
of
a
work
of
art
to
grasp
the
object
in
its
universal
relations
and
in
the
envisagement
it
presents
to
let
fall
everything
which
stands
in
a
wholly
external
or
indifferent
relation
to
the
content
an
artist
for
this
reason
will
refuse
to
accept
all
forms
and
means
of
expression
offered
him
by
the
external
world
on
the
mere
ground
that
he
finds
them
there
his
main
effort
will
be
if
at
least
his
aim
be
a
real
poetical
creation
to
secure
that
which
will
appropriately
work
in
with
his
own
imaginative
conception
and
if
he
looks
to
nature
for
assistance
in
supplying
him
with
details
or
generally
as
material
to
translate
into
his
work
he
will
utilize
such
not
because
he
finds
them
so
in
nature
but
because
they
fall
in
their
right
place
as
a
part
of
his
composition
and
are
rightly
made
for
him
this
right
of
the
artist
is
a
higher
one
than
the
mere
right
of
immediate
fact
in
his
representation
of
the
human
form
for
instance
an
artist
will
not
attempt
such
imitation
as
we
find
attempted
by
those
restorers
of
ancient
pictures
who
reproduce
old
cracks
which
through
the
swelling
of
either
paint
or
varnish
have
involved
all
the
older
parts
of
the
picture
in
a
kind
of
arabesque
even
on
the
portions
restored
the
portraitpainter
will
rather
permit
the
tracery
of
the
flesh
and
a
fortiori
such
incidents
as
freckles
pustules
warts
and
so
forth
to
disappear
entirely
in
this
respect
the
painter
denner
so
famous
for
his
close
realization
of
nature
is
by
no
means
an
ideal
master
for
the
same
reason
indications
of
muscles
and
veins
may
be
given
but
their
distinction
and
relief
should
be
far
slighter
than
that
we
observe
in
nature
in
all
such
impressions
little
or
nothing
of
spirit
is
manifested
and
the
expression
of
spirit
is
what
is
essential
in
the
human
form286
i
cannot
think
it
therefore
wholly
a
disadvantage
that
we
moderns
have
less
to
do
with
the
nude
in
sculpture
than
the
ancients
on
the
other
hand
the
general
style
of
our
dress
in
comparison
with
the
ideal
drapery
of
classical
times
is
less
artistic
and
more
commonplace
the
object
in
both
cases
is
to
cover
the
form
the
drapery
however
we
find
in
the
antique
is
taken
by
itself
a
more
or
less
formal
smooth
surface
only
so
far
determinate
in
its
adjustment
to
the
frame
by
its
attachment
to
the
shoulder
in
other
respects
the
garment
remains
entirely
formal287
hanging
down
simply
and
freely
by
virtue
of
its
own
immanent
weight
or
only
determined
through
the
position
of
the
body
and
the
pose
and
motion
of
the
limbs
in
the
determination
thus
implied
we
find
the
external
shape
entirely
reflecting
the
mutable
expression
of
the
spirit
which
animates
the
body
the
particular
form
of
the
garment
the
folds
of
it
the
motion
of
it
either
up
or
down
is
clothed
in
the
shape
dictated
direct
from
the
inward
impulse
and
as
each
may
momentarily
appear
appropriate
to
the
particular
pose
or
movementand
it
is
this
form
of
determination
which
constitutes
the
ideality
of
such
drapery
in
the
clothing
we
have
adopted
nowadays
on
the
contrary
the
entire
material
is
from
the
first
cut
out
and
worked
up
stiffly
into
the
forms
of
particular
limbs
so
that
anything
approaching
spontaneity
in
its
rise
and
fall
is
impossible
even
the
character
of
the
folds
is
determined
by
previous
models
and
generally
both
cut
and
fall
are
worked
out
wholly
by
the
technical
rules
and
craftsmanship
of
the
tailor
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
configuration
of
the
limbs
determines
generally
the
form
of
such
clothing
but
in
this
arrangement
of
the
bodily
form
we
merely
have
either
a
perverse
imitation
or
an
enveloping
of
human
limbs
according
to
the
convention
of
fashion
and
the
accidental
taste
of
the
times
the
cut
of
our
cloth
once
made
is
irrevocably
made
and
neither
the
position
of
the
body
nor
the
motion
of
the
limbs
can
appreciably
affect
it
we
may
move
our
arms
and
legs
about
as
much
as
we
please
the
sleeves
of
our
jackets
and
our
trousers
remain
unalterable
folds
or
creases
may
perhaps
appear
in
them
but
even
then
only
on
the
lines
of
the
original
cutting
out
as
we
see
them
for
example
on
the
statue
of
scharnhorst
our
modern
way
of
clothing
is
consequently
as
an
external
cover
not
sufficiently
differentiated
from
the
inner
life
to
appear
on
its
reverse
side
as
the
formal
expression
of
that
life
instead
of
this
we
have
a
false
imitation
of
the
human
form
stereotyped
in
the
preordained
and
unalterable
cut
of
our
tailor
a
criticism
similar
to
that
we
have
directed
to
the
representation
by
art
of
the
human
form
and
its
exterior
clothing
might
be
applied
to
a
whole
multitude
of
things
which
make
up
the
external
show
of
life
or
minister
to
its
wants
such
as
eating
drinking
and
sleepingthings
necessary
enough
in
themselves
and
useful
to
all
men
which
however
much
in
their
manifold
variety
as
constituent
features
of
the
physical
life
of
mankind
they
may
blend
with
those
activities
more
directly
related
to
its
spirit
do
not
themselves
form
part
of
such
activities
or
stand
in
essential
relation
either
to
their
determinations
or
their
interests
and
thereby
contribute
to
what
is
the
truly
ideal
or
universal
element
in
the
content
of
human
life
physical
aspects
of
life
such
as
these
may
no
doubt
receive
poetical
treatment
in
art
and
it
is
generally
admitted
that
the
descriptions
of
a
poet
such
as
homer
in
this
direction
adhere
very
closely
to
nature
yet
we
find
that
even
homer
despite
all
his

all
the
vividness
of
his
presentment
is
forced
to
limit
his
descriptions
to
general
observations
no
one
expects
to
find
in
him
an
entirely
accurate
picture
of
the
facts
in
all
their
detail
as
they
actually
would
occur
in
life
he
may
give
us
no
doubt
in
his
delineation
of
the
bodily
presence
of
achilles
the
lofty
brow
the
prominent
nose
the
long
and
stalwart
legs
but
he
is
not
likely
to
include
in
the
picture
every
detail
of
the
veritable
existence
of
limbs
point
for
point
and
the
relation
in
which
they
stand
to
one
another
in
colour
size
and
so
forth
in
other
words
to
offer
us
natures
reality
instead
of
an
artists
portrait
and
the
reason
is
obvious
inasmuch
as
in
the
art
of
poetry
the
type
of
expression
is
always
the
universal
concept
of
the
imagination
as
distinguished
from
the
bare
particularity
of
nature
instead
of
the
fact
the
poet
always
gives
us
the
denominant
the
word
in
which
the
particular
thing
is
universalized
for
the
word
is
a
product
of
mental
conception
and
as
such
already
carries
in
itself
the
nature
of
a
universal
one
is
entitled
to
say
of
course
that
it
is
natural
in
the
formation
of
concepts
and
speech
to
employ
a
nomenclature
the
word
as
such
an
infinite288
abridgment
of
the
existence
we
find
in
nature
but
if
we
do
so
the
nature
to
which
we
refer
it
would
not
merely
be
opposed
to
the
natural
existence
with
which
we
compare
it
but
would
be
just
that
which
cancels
it
we
are
therefore
confronted
with
the
question
in
what
sense
we
use
the
word
nature
when
we
contrast
it
with
the
characteristic
of
poetry
the
mere
undefined
use
of
the
word
nature
by
itself
tells
us
nothing
at
all
what
poetry
should
always
give
us
is
the
energetic
the
essential
the
truly
characteristic
and
this
fundamental
expressiveness
is
precisely
the
ideal
and
not
the
merely
immediate
to
enumerate
all
the
details
of
which
in
the
narration
of
an
event
or
the
portrayal
of
a
scene
will
render
either
of
these
simply
dull
spiritless
tedious
and
intolerable
in
the
manifestation
of
this
universality
however
one
type
of
art
will
reveal
more
clearly
its
ideal
characteristics
another
will
rather
emphasize
by
a
restricted
use
of
material
form
the
infinite
detail
of
external
reality
sculpture
for
example
is
in
its
presentments
more
abstract
than
painting
in
poetry
the
epic
type
in
its
realization
of
the
external
appearance
of
life
itself
will
not
be
so
complete
as
a
dramatic
poem
should
be
on
the
other
hand
it
will
surpass
the
latter
in
its
portrayal
of
the
fulness
of
its
imaginative
vision
the
epic
poet
being
most
indebted
to
concrete
pictures
his
imagination
borrows
from
past
history
in
contrast
with
him
the
dramatist
is
mainly
restricted
to
the
motives
of
an
action
the
attitude
of
the
will
to
it
the
psychological
problem
in
short
c
it
is
then
mind
spirit
which
gives
external
realization
in
a
particular
form
to
the
inward
world
of
content
which
is
of
essential
interest
to
it
and
it
is
in
close
relation
to
this
fact
that
we
should
consider
the
question
what
precise
significance
we
are
to
infer
from
the
opposition
above
discussed
between
the
ideal
and
naturalness
and
first
we
must
observe
that
from
such
a
point
of
view
the
word
natural
is
not
employed
in
the
most
genuine
signification
of
the
term
as
a
description
of
the
external
form
imposed
upon
facts
by
mind
it
obviously
is
neither
the
immediate
naturality
we
find
in
animal
life
nor
that
presented
in
natures
landscape
rather
its
very
form
of
determination
in
so
far
that
is
to
say
as
we
see
the
mind
here
giving
to
itself
an
embodiment
will
show
us
that
it
is
an
expression
of
mind
an
expression
moreover
suffused
with
ideality
for
this
taking
up
into
the
mind
this
plastic
recreation
of
form
on
the
part
of
mind
is
nothing
less
than
idealization
it
is
sometimes
remarked
of
the
countenances
of
dead
people
that
they
take
on
themselves
once
more
the
lineaments
of
childhood
the
obdurate
expression
of
passion
custom
and
strife
the
characteristic
seal
of
their
life
of
strenuous
action
passes
off
and
the
indeterminacy
of
the
features
of
a
childs
face
reappears
in
life
however
all
traits
whatsoever
the
entire
presentment
in
fact
receive
their
characteristic
expression
from
the
world
of
soul
and
in
much
the
same
way
the
different
races
and
classes
of
mankind
reflect
the
distinguishing
features
of
their
spiritual
tendencies
and
activities
in
their
external
manifestation
in
all
such
organizations
that
which
is
outward
is
visibly
permeated
with
mind
and
by
virtue
of
its
energy
already
confronts
mere
nature
as
an
idealized
creation
only
a
clear
perception
of
this
truth
will
enable
us
to
sift
this
significant
question
of
an
opposition
between
nature
and
the
ideal
to
the
bottom
if
we
do
not
possess
this
we
shall
find
ourselves
maintaining
that
the
forms
in
which
spirit
is
visualized
as
a
part
of
nature
have
already
lost
in
that
real
appearance
which
is
independent
of
arts
imitative
action
such
an
intrinsic
completeness
beauty
and
excellence
that
it
is
quite
impossible
that
there
can
be
another
and
more
exalted
type
of
beauty
which
presents
itself
as
the
ideal
in
contradistinction
to
this
immediate
reality
and
this
all
the
more
for
the
reason
that
art
is
unable
entirely
to
attain
even
to
that
which
is
present
in
nature
herself
or
if
our
thoughts
lean
to
the
opposite
extreme
we
shall
look
to
art
to
supply
us
independently
in
opposition
to
natures
reality
with
more
ideal
modes
of
representation
the
polemics
of
herr
von
rumohr
which
we
have
already
criticized
are
well
worthy
of
attention
in
this
connection
this
writer
at
any
rate
whatever
others
may
say
who
have
the
word
ideal
so
frequently
on
their
lips
in
depreciation
of
the
vulgarity
of
nature
refers
to
the
idea
and
the
ideal
in
phrases
of
respect
and
contempt
with
absolute
impartiality
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
is
rather
this
there
is
in
the
spiritual
world
both
outwardly
and
inwardly
regarded
a
nature
of
vulgar
type
which
testifies
to
its
meanness
outwardly
for
the
simple
reason
that
its
inward
content
is
mean
that
is
to
say
when
all
that
it
can
realize
externally
in
its
activities
are
the
aims
of
envy
jealousy
and
avarice
in
every
detail
of
sensuous
life
such
a
povertystricken
nature
can
no
doubt
form
part
of
the
subjectmatter
of
art
and
has
been
treated
as
such
when
this
is
the
case
however
as
we
have
already
explained
it
is
not
the
subjectmatter
but
wholly
the
artistic
handling
of
it
which
creates
an
interest
of
any
permanent
character
and
the
artist
will
look
in
vain
for
sympathy
in
his
subject
or
rather
the
mere
material
of
his
subject
from
the
true
connoisseur
a
particularly
pertinent
illustration
of
this
type
of
art
is
the
socalled
genre
painting
which
has
not
shown
itself
above
accepting
subjects
of
this
character
the
artistic
treatment
of
which
has
been
carried
by
the
dutch
school
to
the
extreme
limit
of
perfection
it
may
however
be
as
well
to
ask
ourselves
first
what
the
precise
contribution
of
the
dutch
has
been
to
this
genrepainting
what
in
short
is
the
nature
of
content
their
dainty
pictures
express
pictures
which
at
least
have
asserted
an
extraordinary
power
of
attraction
and
obviously
cannot
be
shelved
right
away
beneath
the
common
stigma
of
vulgarity
we
shall
not
improbably
find
on
closer
examination
that
the
subjectmatter
of
these
pictures
is
not
so
contemptible
as
it
is
often
taken
to
be289
the
dutch
have
selected
the
subjectmatter
of
their
artistic
production
out
of
their
own
substance
out
of
the
actual
presence
of
their
daily
life
to
have
once
for
all
realized
that
presence
even
in

is
no
matter
of
reproach

them

estimate
the
character

their
artistic

must
view
them
in
close
connection

the
actual
panorama

their
own
times

is
a
problem

in
great
measure
himself
created
the

he
lives

is
as
much
the
fruit
of
their
own
actions
as
it
is
the
general
content
of
their
artistic
production
such
a
content
as
this
is
no
common
material
though
obviously
it
is
not
of
the
kind
we
must
suppose
we
can
approach
with
the
supercilious
superiority
of
critics
for
whom
the
exalted
taste
of
courts
and
fine
society
is
everything
from
a
sterling
national
selfconsciousness
of
this
sort
rembrandt
painted
his
famous
nightwatch
now
in
amsterdam
van
dyck
so
many
of
his
portraits
wouvermans
so
many
of
his
battlepieces
nor
should
even
those
reflections
of
rustic
drinkingbouts
jovialities
and
other
scenes
of
merriment
be
wholly
excluded
from
the
category
and
in
illustration
of
its
excellence
we
would
point
by
way
of
contrast
to
a
work
in
this
years
exhibition
which
though
not
downright
bad
genrepainting
is
much
inferior
to
the
handling
by
old
dutch
masters
of
similar
subjectmatter
coming
nowhere
near
to
their
freedom
and
joy
of
life
in
this
picture
a
housewife
is
seen
entering
an
alehouse
to
give
her
husband
a
good
scolding
here
we
have
just
a
scene
of
cantankerous
and
waspish
humankind
and
nothing
more
these
dutchmen
painted
their
folk
very
differently
whether
we
find
them
among
their
cups
at
weddings
or
dances
feasting
or
drinking
nay
even
when
the
matter
proceeds
to
ribaldry
and
blows
liveliness
and
lustiness
is
the
prevailing
temper
young
maids
and
women
laugh
with
the
rest
and
a
feeling
of
free
and
abandoned
merriment
carries
all
before
it
this
intimate
delight
in
all
enjoyment
justifiably
human
which
will
even
absorb
itself
wholly
in
animal
life
and
crop
up
at
times
as
mere
satiety
and
grossness
this
freshly
awakened
sense
of
freedom
and
life
fully
grasped
and
embodied
in
composition
and
colour
is
what
constitutes
the
higher
spiritual
import290
of
these
dutch
pictures
on
much
the
same
grounds
the
beggar
boys
of
murillo
in
the
central
gallery
of
the
munich
collection
are
excellent
superficially
regarded
the
subject
here
too
is
of
a
vulgar
character
the
mother
is
scolding
one
of
the
youngsters
as
he
quickly
munches
a
piece
of
bread
two
others
hard
by
ragged
and
poor
are
eating
melons
and
grapes291
but
in
this
very
poverty
of
halfnakedness
what
gleams
forth
from
the
entire
composition
as
the
soul
of
that
beggar
life
is
its
complete
carelessness
and
spontaneity
no
dancing
dervish
himself
could
give
it
us
more
frankly
in
its
impression
of
entire
health
and
jubilant
vitality
this
freedom
from
all
external
care
this
inward
liberty
reflecting
itself
in
that
which
is
visible
is
precisely
that
which
the
notion
of
the
ideal
demands
there
is
in
paris
a
certain
portrait
of
a
boy
by
raphael
the
head
leans
propped
at
leisure
on
one
arm
and
gazes
with
such
ecstasy
of
careless
contentment
into
the
open
landscape
that
we
are
loth
to
turn
away
from
a
picture
expressive
of
such
health
and
exuberant
animation
we
receive
a
delight
of
very
much
the
same
nature
from
these
lads
of
murillo
it
is
obvious
enough
that
neither
their
objects
nor
their
interests
aim
high
but
this
is
no
result
of
stupidity
there
they
chaffer
on
gods
earth
with
we
may
almost
say
the
bliss
and
contentment
of
the
olympian
gods
themselves
they
too
have
their
business
but
though
we
hear
little
about
it
they
are
a
genuine
sample
of
humanity
neither
morose
nor
discontented
with
their
lot
feeling
this
groundroot
in
them
of
all
sterling
performance
we
can
readily
imagine
that
in
favourable
conditions
youth
such
as
this
might
be
capable
of
most
things
a
composition
of
this
kind
is
entirely
on
a
different
level
from
the
one
above
mentioned
of
the
scolding
housewife
or
two
others
we
might
also
contrast
with
it
of
a
certain
peasant
mending
his
whip
and
a
postillion
sleeping
on
a
straw
pallet292
such
paintings
of
genre
should
unquestionably
be
of
small
size
and
indeed
in
their
total
impression
on
the
sense
they
must
be
made
to
appear
of
comparative
insignificance
that
we
may
not
feel
the
character
of
their
subjectmatter
and
its
presentment
has
received
undue
prominence
it
would
be
intolerable
to
have
such
subjects
painted
life
size
as
though
the
fulness
of
the
reality
were
sufficiently
attractive
to
claim
our
attention
such
are
the
principles
which
should
regulate
our
artistic
treatment
of
and
sympathy
with
that
which
it
is
usual
to
stigmatize
as
mean
or
vulgar
in
ordinary
life
there
is
no
doubt
plenty
of
material
for
art
to
appropriate
of
higher
grade
than
the
representation
of
animal
spirits
and
downright
citizenship
in
all
their
essentially
insignificant
detail
man
has
clearly
more
serious
interests
and
objects
than
these
interests
which
have
unfolded
as
his
own
spirit
has
widened
and
deepened
and
in
harmony
with
which
it
is
his
truest
interest
to
remain
an
art
will
take
highest
rank
which
sets
before
itself
the
task
of
giving
adequate
representation
to
this
more
vital
or
at
least
more
profound
content
and
here
at
once
we
are
confronted
with
the
old
question
what
is
the
source
which
will
supply
us
with
the
forms
most
fitting
to
such
creations
of
mind
on
the
one
side
theorists
maintain
the
opinion
that
inasmuch
as
the
artist
creates
these
lofty
ideas
which
he
desires
to
clothe
in
artistic
form
he
must
also
supply
their
artistic
forms
create
for
example
from
his
imagination
the
ideal
figures
of
greek
gods
christ
his
apostles
saints
and
so
on
in
strenuous
opposition
to
this
view
herr
von
rumohr
has
entered
the
lists
this
writer
is
of
opinion
that
art
is
on
a
false
track
in
supposing
that
the
artist
discovers
the
forms
of
his
production
in
himself
rather
than
in
nature
and
it
is
under
this
conviction
that
he
has
reviewed
the
masterpieces
both
of
italian
and
dutch
painters
on
this
head
he
finds
it
a
matter
of
censure
italian
investigations
i
p
105
that
the
theory
of
art
during
the
sixty
years
which
have
elapsed
should
be
at
the
pains
to
prove
that
it
is
an
object
or
rather
the
main
object
of
art
to
improve
upon
creation
as
it
is
particularised
and
by
doing
so
to
substitute
forms
which
have
no
particular
relation
to
anything
which
would
ape
natures
creation
by
going
several
points
beyond
her
and
release
mortal
man
from
all
responsibility
for
the
fact
that
nature
has
not
known
how
to
make
her
appearance
more
beautiful
and
consistently
with
such
a
point
of
view
he
further
advises
the
artist
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
gigantic
task
of
attempting
to
ennoble
or
elucidate
the
natural
form
or
attempt
any
such
exalted
function
of
the
human
spirit
under
what
name
soever
it
may
be
written
down
in
works
upon
art
ibid
p
63
he
is
in
short
wholly
convinced
that
however
exalted
and
spiritual293
the
subject
to
be
treated
may
be
completely
adequate
forms
are
to
be
found
in
nature
as
immediately
perceived
and
consequently
maintains
p
83
that
the
exposition
of
art
even
in
the
case
of
subjectmatter
as
highly
spiritual
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
is
never
indebted
to
a
symbolism
capriciously
created
by
man294
but
depends
wholly
for
its
consistency
upon
what
is
presented
as
significant
by
nature
in
organic
form
no
doubt
in
advancing
this
herr
von
rumohr
has
particularly
under
review
the
ideal
types
of
antique
art
as
they
are
expounded
by
winckelmann
it
is
for
all
that
the
abiding
service
of
winckelmann
to
have
pointed
out
and
set
forth
in
harmonious
relation
these
very
types
although
he
may
doubtless
have
committed
errors
of
judgment
with
regard
to
particular
masterpieces
while
carrying
through
the
same
as
a
possible
example
of
such
an
oversight
herr
von
rumohr
thinks
he
has
made
out
p
115
that
the
increase
of
length
in
the
lower
half
of
the
body
which
winckelmann
has
characterized
as
an
ideal
feature
of
the
antique
is
really
borrowed
from
roman
statuary
and
naturally
enough
as
an
opponent
of
the
ideal
improves
the
occasion
by
insisting
that
the
artist
should
unreservedly
take
nature
into
his
confidence
in
the
study
of
form
here
and
here
alone
he
will
find
the
presence
of
true
beauty
to
quote
this
writer
once
more
it
is
affirmed
p
144
that
the
beauty
of
most
importance
depends
on
a
symbolic
of
forms
rooted
in
nature
rather
than
human
caprice
a
beauty
through
which
these
forms
are
nourished
into
their
characteristic
and
symbolic
relations
in
the
vision
of
which
we
necessarily
have
brought
back
to
our
memory
definite
images
and
conceptions
and
are
made
more
definitely
conscious
of
previously
dormant
feeling295
i
and
so
finally
it
appears
that
in
this
writers
view
p
105
a
mysterious
trait
of
our
spiritual
life
what
many
would
perhaps
call
idea
seems
to
bind
together
the
artist
and
the
appearances
of
nature
in
which
latter
he
is
constantly
and
continuously
learning
to
recognize
the
true
character
of
his
own
artistic
purpose296
and
to
find
himself
in
a
position
through
them
to
give
expression
to
it
there
can
be
no
question
of
course
that
ideal
art
has
no
business
at
all
with
a
symbolism
capriciously
created
and
if
it
really
is
the
case
that
these
ideal
types
of
the
ancients
have
been
composed
only
to
reduce
the
veritable
forms
of
nature
to
false
and
empty
abstraction
we
may
freely
admit
that
herr
von
rumohr
is
justified
in
his
most
trenchant
opposition
for
our
own
part
we
would
emphasize
the
points
of
fundamental
importance
to
be
grasped
in
this
antithesis
between
the
ideal
of
art
and
nature
as
follows
the
forms
which
are
borrowed
from
immediate
nature
to
determine
an
ideal
content
must
be
assumed
to
be
thus
taken
symbolically
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term
namely
that
they
are
not
thus
immediately
significant
in
themselves
but
only
as
the
external
embodiment
of
that
which
is
inward
and
spiritual
the
content
in
fact
they
express
it
is
only
spirit
even
in
the
reality
which
they
possess
outside
the
limits
of
art
which
constitutes
their
ideality
in
its
contrast
with
that
they
entirely
owe
to
nature
simply
as
such
and
which
is
unable
to
reveal
to
us
what
is
essentially
mind
it
is
the
object
of
art
on
its
more
noble
plane
to
give
external
shape
to
the
inward
content
of
spirit
this
content
we
discover
in
the
conscious
life
of
men
realized
in
the
world
as
such
it
possesseswe
include
with
it
our
conscious
human
experience
generallyan
external
semblance
directly
presented
in
and
through
which
it
finds
expression
so
much
may
readily
be
conceded
at
the
same
time
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
it
is
simply
futile
to
inquire
whether
we
ought
to
look
to
the
direct
facts
of
nature
alone
for
objects
and
physiognomical
traits
of
beauty
and
expression
to
serve
as
entirely
adequate
materials
for
arts
representation
shall
we
say
of
the
majesty
repose
and
power
of
a
jupiter
or
of
a
juno
venus
peter
christ
madonna
or
any
other
divinity
or
saint
arguments
may
be
supported
on
either
side
and
the
question
can
only
remain
finally
undecided
being
wholly
empirical
for
the
only
sufficient
way
of
deciding
the
matter
would
be
to
contrast
what
is
borrowed
with
the
realities
it
purports
to
represent
and
this
in
the
assumed
case
of
the
greek
gods
might
be
matter
of
some
difficulty
and
to
take
the
present
day
one
man
will
see
traits
of
beauty
in
their
perfection
where
another
a
thousand
times
more
acute
will
see
nothing
but
over
and
above
such
considerations
we
must
observe
that
the
mere
beauty
of
form
will
never
give
us
that
we
have
named
the
ideal
inasmuch
as
the
individuality
of
the
content
is
a
constituent
part
of
it
and
therein
form
is
necessarily
included
a
human
face
for
example
may
be
both
regular
and
beautiful
in
its
outlines
and
yet
remain
cold
and
devoid
of
all
expression
the
ideal
figures
of
the
greek
gods
are
on
the
contrary
true
individualizations
the
universality
of
their
ideal
conception
does
not
exclude
the
characteristic
determination
which
belongs
to
each
of
them
and
the
vitality
of
the
ideal
consists
just
in
this
that
this
determinate
and
fundamental
spiritual
significance
which
it
is
the
function
of
art
to
exhibit
should
wholly
transfuse
by
appropriate
artistic
treatment
all
the
particular
aspects
of
the
external
embodiment
such
as
composition
pose
motion
physiognomy
and
configuration
of
limbs
so
that
nothing
empty
or
insignificant
should
be
left
but
the
entire
work
should
reflect
that
ideal
significance
all
that
we
have
learned
from
greek
sculpture
in
recent
times
of
a
quality
which
in
fact
emanates
from
the
school
of
pheidias
is
characterized
by
nothing
so
much
as
this
penetrative
vitality
the
ideal
is
preserved
in
all
its
severity
without
any
lapse
in
the
direction
of
mere
grace
softness
elegance
and
exuberance
yet
retains
the
form
in
close
relation
to
the
ideal
significance
which
should
be
embodied
throughout
the
whole
this
supreme
vitality
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
the
great
artist
we
may
call
a
typical
significance
of
this
kind
in
contrast
to
the
particularity
of
the
external
world
essentially
abstract
this
is
preeminently
the
case
in
sculpture
and
painting
arts
which
illuminate
but
a
momentary
state
without
proceeding
to
such
a
varied
development
of
exposition
as
we
find
for
example
in
that
where
homer
is
able
to
depict
the
character
of
achilles
as
mild
and
courteous
no
less
than
severe
and
terrible
to
say
nothing
of
all
his
other
characteristics
no
doubt
it
is
possible
to
find
such
a
significance
expressed
in
purely
immediate
reality
there
are
for
instance
few
countenances
which
cannot
reflect
the
moods
of
piety
devotion
and
cheerfulness
but
such
faces
also
express
countless
other
moods
which
either
are
quite
inappropriate
to
that
ideal
significance
or
are
only
indirectly
related
to
it
for
this
reason
it
is
by
virtue
of
its
particular
realization
that
a
portrait
acquaints
us
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
portrait
in
many
old
german
and
flemish
pictures
we
find
the
patron
of
the
picture
included
in
the
composition
with
his
entire
family
of
sons
and
daughters
all
are
necessarily
painted
as
though
taken
in
an
act
of
devotion
and
this
spirit
illuminates
every
countenance
but
at
the
same
time
we
have
quite
as
clearly
set
before
us
in
the
men
stalwart
warriors
men
of
vigorous
action
disciplined
on
the
strenuous
field
of
life
and
commerce
and
in
the
women
dames
of
an
equally
doughty
lifeexperience
if
we
compare
with
such
facesand
we
may
restrict
our
comparison
wholly
to
these
very
pictures
which
are
famous
for
their
close
approach
to
nature
in
their
delineation
of
physiognomythose
of
the
virgin
mary
and
the
saints
and
apostles
who
surround
her
we
shall
find
in
these
latter
one
preponderating
expression
and
all
the
physical
lineaments
whether
we
look
at
build
of
bone
structure
or
muscle
traits
of
that
express
motion
or
repose
are
concentrated
upon
this
one
artistic
effect
that
which
is
felt
to
be
appropriate
to
the
one
class
and
not
to
the
other
exactly
differentiates
the
distinction
between
the
genuine
ideal
and
mere
portraiture
some
may
imagine
it
possible
for
the
artist
to
compose
the
ideal
content
of
genuine
types
by
a
process
of
sifting
and
selection
from
the
facts
of
immediate
nature
or
quite
possibly
from
the
various
physiognomies
and
compositions
which
collections
of
engravings
from
the
copperplate
or
the
wood
may
furnish
but
a
process
such
as
this
of
mere
collection
and
sifting
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
an
artist
must
maintain
the
creative
impulse
alert
throughout
he
must
himself
in
the
strength
of
his
own
imagination
already
impregnated
with
the
knowledge
of
appropriate
form
and
made
vital
with
profound
experience
and
emotion
give
such
an
embodiment
to
the
significance
which
is
the
inspiring
motive
of
the
work
as
will
make
it
appear
throughout
as
metal
cast
at
one
time
and
is
one
state
of
fusion
b
the
determinacy
of
the
ideal
to
comprehend
the
ideal
in
its
intrinsic
significance
that
is
to
say
according
to
its
fundamental
notion
was
a
comparatively
easy
task
but
the
beauty
of
art
in
so
far
as
it
is
the
idea
is
not
to
be
restricted
to
the
purely
universal
standpoint
of
its
notional
concept
even
as
so
comprehended
it
must
necessarily
include
within
it
determination
and
particularity
and
is
compelled
to
take
definite
embodiment
as
external
reality
the
question
consequently
arises
in
what
way
is
the
ideal
able
still
to
assert
itself
in
this
process
of
objectification
in
the
medium
of
external
things
and
their
finitude
and
despite
all
that
is
antagonistic
to
ideality
and
as
a
corollary
to
this
we
have
to
inquire
how
finite
and
determinate
existence
is
enabled
to
attach
to
itself
the
ideality
of
the
beauty
of
all
art
we
propose
to
regulate
this
inquiry
with
the
following
division
of
our
subject
matter
first
the
determination
of
the
ideal
in
its
simplest
terms
secondly
the
determination
of
it
in
so
far
as
it
proceeds
by
virtue
of
its
particularity
to
a
condition
of
discordant
parts
within
itself
and
to
their
resolution
a
condition
we
may
generally
define
as
action297
thirdly
the
determination
of
the
ideal
from
the
point
of
view
of
it
as
an
external
object
i
the
ideal
definition
as
such
1
we
have
already
observed
that
it
is
the
function
of
art
to
make
the
divine
the
focus
or
centre
of
its
entire
exposition
it
is
however
only
possible
for
thought
in
its
pure
medium
that
is
to
say
apart
from
all
the
sensuous
material
of
the
figurative
imagination
to
comprehend
the
divine
in
its
essential
significance
of
unity
and
universality
to
attempt
to
do
otherwise
by
imagining
a
picture
of
god
more
readily
grasped
by
the
perception
of
the
senses
is
as
we
know
forbidden
both
jews
and
mahommedans
this
cuts
away
the
ground
of
the
figurative
arts
which
absolutely
require
form
as
their
medium
in
all
its
concreteness
of
actual
life
and
we
have
only
lyrical
poetry
left
us
to
celebrate
in
its
exaltation
the
praise
of
his
power
and
glory
2
considered
however
from
the
reverse
point
of
view
we
must
equally
assert
that
however
much
unity
and
universality
are
predicable
of
the
divine
he
is
in
his
essential
substance
determined
and
so
far
as
he
withdraws
himself
from
the
pure
quality
of
such
predicates
in
their
abstraction
is
thereby
an
object
for
the
figurative
sense
and
external
perception
if
the
divine
is
consequently
apprehended
and
figuratively
embodied
for
us
through
the
forms
of
the
imagination
we
are
at
once
confronted
with
a
possible
variety
in
such
determination
and
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
actual
realm
of
ideal
art
finds
its
commencement
for
in
the
first
place
the
one
divine
substance
disunites
and
breaks
itself
up
into
a
multiplicity
of
selfsubsistent
gods
such
as
we
find
presented
by
the
polytheistic
system
of
grecian
art
and
even
in
the
religious
consciousness
of
christianity
god
is
in
opposition
to
his
purely
spiritual
unity
immediately
revealed
on
earth
and
in
the
worldprocess
as
man
and
secondly
the
divine
regarded
generally
in
its
determinate
appearance
and
reality
is
both
present
and
realized
in
emotional
feeling
will
and
the
education298
of
mankind
for
this
reason
and
in
this
sphere
men
who
are
filled
with
the
spirit
of
god
saints
martyrs
and
in
short
all
who
share
in
the
religious
life
are
equally
the
appropriate
subject
of
ideal
art
with
this
principle
of
the
individuality
of
the
divine
and
its
determinate
existence
realized
necessarily
in
the
worldprocess
we
are
face
to
face
withand
this
is
the
third
point
to
be
consideredthe
particularity
of
human
existence
for
the
entire
world
of
human
emotion
with
all
that
stirs
it
most
profoundlyand
what
a
power
is
implied
in
that
open
sea
of
feeling
and
passion
everything
of
deepest
interest
to
the
human
heartthis
entire
content
is
nothing
less
than
its
exposition
and
expression
if
it
is
true
then
that
the
divine
in
its
purest
essence
of
reason
is
only
the
object
of
the
thinking
consciousness
it
is
equally
true
that
spirit
which
takes
to
itself
an
actively
bodily
presence
so
far
that
is
to
say
and
only
so
far
as
we
find
it
reverberate
in
the
heart
of
humanity
all
this
lies
within
the
sphere
of
art
once
admit
this
and
we
must
admit
the
content
of
particular
interests
and
actions
specific
characters
and
momentary
situations
in
short
the
entire
process
of
development
in
the
external
order
and
it
becomes
of
first
importance
to
indicate
under
a
general
principle
in
what
the
relation
between
the
ideal
and
this
positive
determination
consists
3
in
conformity
with
what
we
have
already
advanced
it
is
clear
that
here
too
the
ideal
will
be
most
purely
manifested
in
the
representationwhether
it
be
of
gods
christ
apostles
saints
or
any
other
type
of
devout
personswhich
brings
most
clearly
before
us
the
qualities
of
beatified
repose
and
satisfaction
a
peace
undisturbed
with
that
which
is
earthly
and
subject
to
the
storms
of
lifes
manifolded
complexities
struggles
and
contradictions
we
are
therefore
not
surprised
to
find
that
both
the
arts
of
sculpture
and
painting
have
been
peculiarly
fitted
to
incorporate
under
ideal
form
not
merely
the
ancient
gods
but
christ
as
saviour
of
the
world
and
individual
apostles
and
saints
that
which
is
the
most
essential
truth
in
actual
life
is
concentrated
to
a
focus
on
itself
in
the
determinate
embodiment
of
art
rather
than
continually
forced
from
its
serenity
through
dependence
upon
finite
conditions
this
essential
concentration
is
not
destitute
of
particularity
but
the
divergent
separation
which
is
a
feature
of
the
external
and
finite
state
is
purified
to
one
simple
definition
so
that
it
appears
as
though
all
traces
of
external
influence
and
the
relation
thus
created
were
overcome
this
deedless
and
infinite
selfrepose
this
taking
a
rest
as
we
find
it
for
example
in
certain
statues
of
hercules
is
just
what
constitutes
the
significance
of
the
ideal
if
the
gods
are
represented
in
contact
with
the
process
of
nature
they
must
still
carry
with
them
their
immortal
and
unapproachable
majesty
jupiter
juno
apollo
mars
and
their
like
are
it
is
true
definite
personalities
but
they
are
at
the
same
time
unyielding
potentates
and
powers
which
preserve
within
them
their
selfsubsistent
liberty
even
when
they
are
actively
related
to
the
world
and
for
this
reason
it
is
not
merely
that
a
specific
particularity
must
characterize
the
determinacy
of
the
ideal
but
spiritual
freedom
must
be
manifested
thereby
as
totality
and
in
this
state
of
repose
suggest
the
potency
of
unfettered
freedom
of
action
if
we
turn
now
from
the
gods
to
the
less
exalted
plane
of
temporal
existence
and
human
life
we
shall
find
the
ideal
active
in
its
representation
of
the
substantial
content
of
such
humanity
and
its
dominant
repression
of
wholly
subjective
particularity
by
this
we
mean
that
all
that
is
entirely
isolate
in
feeling
and
action
is
wrested
from
the
element
of
contingency
and
particularity
is
represented
in
its
concreteness
that
is
to
say
in
its
wider
bond
of
relation
with
what
most
truly
and
intimately
belongs
to
its
life
when
for
instance
we
speak
of
the
nobility
excellence
or
perfection
in
particular
men
we
assert
in
so
many
words
that
the
substantial
core
of
what
is
spiritual
ethical
and
divine
has
announced
itself
as
prevailing
in
the
individual
and
man
has
submerged
his
active
life
his
volitions
his
interests
and
passions
wholly
in
this
substantive
basis
that
he
may
thereby
give
full
satisfaction
to
the
most
authentic
necessities
of
his
soul
at
the
same
time
however
much
in
the
case
of
the
ideal
the
determination
of
spirit
and
its
external
presence
appears
to
be
absorbed
in
the
simple
selfrelation
the
principle
of
development
is
likewise
directly
associated
with
the
particularity
unfolded299
in
determinate
existence
and
along
with
this
in
that
relation
to
environment
which
necessitates
both
the
opposition
and
conflict
of
clashing
forces
this
fact
necessitates
a
closer
examination
of
the
determination
of
the
ideal
regarded
in
this
very
aspect
of
differentiation
and
process
an
aspect
which
we
may
in
a
general
way
define
as
action
ii
the
action
the
gracious
innocence
of
beatific
enjoyment
the
inactive
repose
the
majesty

under
which

in

through
this
alone
the
might
of
the

the
ideal

preserved
for
power
consists
precisely
in
this
selfpreservation
through
a
process
of
selfnegation
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
fact
then
that
the
particularity
of
the
ideal
passes
into
a
relation
with
the
external
world
through
such
development
and
by
so
doing
is
made
partaker
in
a
world
which
so
far
from
manifesting
the
ideally
free
association
of
the
notion
and
its
external
reality
presents
an
existence
which
is
just
that
which
it
ought
not
to
be
in
apprehending
the
true
nature
of
this
relation
we
have
to
consider
how
far
the
determinations
which
affect
the
ideal
either
in
themselves
contain
immediately
the
principle
of
ideality
or
are
to
a
more
or
less
degree
susceptible
of
it
in
this
connection
we
would
direct
attention
to
three
fundamental
points
of
view
in
the
first
place
we
have
the
actual
condition
of
the
world
generally
which
is
assumed
as
involved
in
individual
action
and
its
specific
character
secondly
we
have
the
particularity
of
condition
the
determination
of
which
introduces
difference
and
tension
within
the
substantive
unity
which
is
the
motivespring
of
the
action
in
other
words
the
situation
thirdly
we
have
to
consider
the
situation
from
the
side
of
subjectivity
and
furthermore
the
reaction
by
virtue
of
which
the
conflict
and
resolution
of
the
element
of
difference
is
expressly
asserted
in
other
words
the
action
in
its
strict
sense
1
the
general
worldcondition
the
ideal
subjectivity
is
as
such
essentially
a
personal
relation
a
relation
that
is
to
say
of
self
to
every
aspect
of
motion
or
activity
in
which
the
self
has
to
assert
or
perfect
its
own
substance
and
to
effect
this
a
world
environment
is
necessary
as
the
universal
ground
of
its
realization
when
in
reference
to
this
we
speak
of
condition
we
understand
by
this
the
universally
prevailing
mode
under
which
within
the
sphere
of
spiritual
reality
that
which
is
the
substantive
and
essentially
coalescing
fabric
of
the
same
is
present
in
this
sense
we
refer
to
a
condition
of
education
the
sciences
the
religious
sense
or
even
of
finance
administration
of
justice
family
life
and
similar
examples
all
these
objects
of
reference
are
however
merely
aspects
of
one
and
the
same
spiritual
content
which
is
thus
in
and
through
them
rendered
explicit
and
real
in
further
considering
the
general
condition
of
the
world
as
the
universal
mode
of
the
reality
of
spirit
it
will
be
necessary
to
pursue
our
examination
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
will
it
is
through
the
exercise
of
volition
that
spirit
generally
unites
itself
todeterminate
existence
and
the
substantial
nexi
which
are
immediately
present
in
reality
betray
themselves
in
the
specific
modes
in
which
the
determinations
of
will
ethical
and
legal
conceptions
and
indeed
all
that
belongs
to
that
which
we
are
accustomed
in
a
general
way
to
define
as
justice
actively
asserts
itself
the
question
consequently
arises
how
such
a
universal
condition
must
be
characterized
in
order
that
it
may
appear
adequate
to
the
individuality
of
the
ideal
a
pursuant
to
the
foregoing
considerations
we
may
to
begin
with
emphasize
the
following
points

the
ideal
is
essential
unity
not
a
purely
formal
and
external
unity
but
the
immanent
unity
of
the
content
in
itself
this
substantive
repose
on
its
own
resources
we
have
already
characterized
as
the
selfsufficiency
rest
and
beatitude
of
the
ideal
we
will
in
direct
relation
to
the
plane
of
discussion
we
have
now
reached
develop
this
characteristic
of
selfsubsistency300
making
it
a
primary
demand
of
our
argument
that
what
we
have
termed
the
general
condition
of
the
world
appear
in
such
a
selfsubsistent
form
as
will
enable
it
to
accept
the
embodiment
of
the
ideal

now
selfsubsistency
is
an
equivocal
expression
to
start
with
in
ordinary
parlance
that
which
is
essentially
substantial
is
called
simply
selfsubsistent
by
virtue
of
the
element
of
causation
being
implied
within
this
substantiality
we
are
wont
to
use
it
in
this
sense
when
describing
the
intrinsically
divine
and
absolute
but
as
retained
in
this
universality
of
substance
merely
as
such
it
is
not
declared
as
itself
subjective
and
consequently
meets
with
its
irresolvable
contradiction
in
the
particularity
of
concrete
individuality
in
this
bare
antithesis
all
true
selfsubsistency
disappears

on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
such
subsistency
ascribed
to
purely
formal
individuality
consisting
solely
in
its
selfreliance
upon
the
fixed
determinacy
of
its
subjective
characteristics
this
subjectivity
however
in
so
far
as
the
actual
content
of
life
drops
away
from
it
so
that
the
forces
and
substances
which
lie
without
it
acquire
in
themselves
an
independent
stability
and
as
such
confront
the
subject
and
the
inward
life
as
a
content
wholly
unrelated
lapses
through
this
too
into
unequivocable
contradiction
with
the
actual
substantiality
of
determinate
existence
and
forfeits
all
claim
to
selfsubsistency
and
freedom
of
content
true
selfsubsistence
consists
alone
in
the
unity
and
interpenetration
of
both
individuality
and
universality
with
each
other
the
universal
acquires
through
the
individual
a
concrete
existence
the
subjectivity
of
the
particular
thing
discovers
for
the
first
time
in
the
universal
the
unassailable
basis
and
the
most
genuine
form
of
its
realized
totality

consequently
in
making
this
demand
of
the
universal
worldcondition
we
must
ask
for
a
form
of
selfsubsistency
in
the
same
sense
namely
that
the
substantially
universal
in
such
a
condition
must
contain
within
itself
as
the
vehicle
of
its
selfsubsistence
the
form
of
subjectivity
the
most
obvious
presentment
of
this
identity
is
that
of
thought
for
if
thought
is
in
one
aspect
of
it
subjective
in
another
it
possesses
universality
as
the
product
of
its
inherent
activity
and
encloses
both
universality
and
subjectivity
in
unfettered
unity
the
universal
of
thought
is
however
not
that
of
art
whose
object
is
the
beautiful
and
indeed
apart
from
this
distinction
particular
individuality
as
confronted
by
thought
in
its
natural
envisagement
or
form
no
less
than
in
its
active
effects
and
complete
realization
stands
in
no
necessary
correspondence
with
the
universality
of
thought
there
is
for
example
a
clear
distinction
between
the
subject
apprehended
in
its
concrete
content
of
the
actual
world
and
that
which
is
simply
the
thinking
subject
or
at
least
it
is
open
to
such
a
distinction
the
same
kind
of
cleavage
affects
the
form
of
the
universal
itself
in
other
words
the
moment
the
universal
begins
to
assert
itself
in
distinction
from
its
otherwise
related
reality
by
that
act
it
has
in
objective
existence
separated
itself
from
all
the
varied
play
of
its
phenomenal
particularity
and
in
opposition
to
the
same
has
already
established
an
independent
position
assured
and
powerful
in
the
ideal
however
it
is
precisely
the
particular
individuality
which
ought
to
persist
in
inseparable
coordination
with
the
substantive
reality
and
to
the
full
extent
that
freedom
and
the
selfsubsistency
of
the
subjective
principle
may
attach
to
the
ideal
the
worldenvironment
of
conditions
and
relations
should
possess
no
essential
objectivity
independent
of
the
individual
in
the
subjective
aspect
above
referred
to
or
already
presupposed
for
the
ideal
individual
is
a
selfenclosed
totality
which
already
includes
the
objective
principle
and
it
must
not
be
permitted
to
have
independent
motion
and
development
apart
from
the
individuality
of
the
subject
otherwise
the
subject
falls
back
into
a
purely
subordinate
position
in
contrast
to
a
world
whose
independence
is
already
assured
consequently
the
universal
must
indeed
be
actual
in
the
individual
as
that
which
is
in
a
unique
sense
its
own
but
not
so
as
the
property
of
the
individual
as
a
thinker
but
as
that
of
his
character
and
temperament
to
put
the
same
truth
in
another
way
what
is
required
for
this
unity
of
the
universal
and
individual
in
art
as
opposed
to
the
mediation
and
differentiation
of
thought
is
the
form
of
immediacy
and
the
selfsubsistency
which
we
claim
here
is
the
form
of
immediate
selfsubsistency
with
that
however
the
element
of
contingency
is
associated
that
is
to
say
so
long
as
the
universal
and
effective301
constituents
of
spiritual
life
such
as
the
selfsubsistency
of
individuals
exhibits
are
only
presented
to
us
in
the
immediate
guise
of
subjective
feeling
temperament
and
disposition
of
character
and
debarred
any
other
category
of
existence
such
are
thereby
already
given
over
to
the
contingency
of
volition
and
its
realization
all
we
have
left
us
then
is
what
is
peculiar
to
each
individual
viewed
as
such
and
his
sensuous
experience
such
a
possession
of
what
is
nothing
more
than
personal
idiosyncracy
is
unable
to
assert
for
itself
any
further
potency
or
necessity
it
appears
simply
as
inclusion
of
content
fixed
achievement
and
at
the
same
time
arbitrary
commitment
of
the
wholly
selfdependent
subject
to
the
influence
of
feeling

general
ability
cunning
and
talents
instead
of
carrying
out
its
realization
over
and
over
again
according
to
a
principle
of
universal
import
and
acknowledged
stability
this
type
of
contingency
then
is
the
characteristic
quality
of
the
condition
which
we
required
for
the
ground
upon
which
all
the
varied
wealth
of
the
ideal
is
to
appear

in
order
to
make
more
clear
the
actual
character
of
the
reality
which
is
most
adapted
to
artistic
treatment
we
will
contrast
it
with
that
aspect
of
existence
which
is
not
so
adapted

we
find
this
preeminently
where
the
ethical
notion
that
is
justice
and
rational
freedom
have
already
won
for
themselves
and
maintain
a
fixed
position
in
the
social
order
regulated
by
law
so
that
even
in
the
external
world
it
appears
as
a
positive
and
necessary
power
which
is
quite
independent
of
the
individuality
and
subjectivity
of
specific
temperament
and
characters
this
is
the
case
in
the
life
of
the
state
where
that
life
is
manifested

the
position
then
that
isolated

occupy
in

one
which
contracts
them
within
a

subordinates
them
thereto

if
the

they
are

may
either
be
regarded
as
a

subjection
inasmuch
as

possess
as
the
paramount
power
a
constraining
force
or
we
may
see
in
it
merely
the
free
recognition
and
acceptance
of
the
reason
that
underlies
such
a
necessity
of
fact
an
acknowledgment
through
which
the
individual
finds
himself
again
in
that
objective
order

even
in
the

isolated

apart
from
the

of

no
real

themselves
for
substantiality
in
the
sense
we
here
use
the
term
is
by
no
means
only
the
particular
property
of
this

that

a

aspects
of
it
and
down
to
the
merest
detail
in
a
mode
universally
applicable

necessary

that
mere
individuals
can

must
always
remain
in

with
that

their

are
always
only
an
entirely
partial
realization
of
a
single
case
and
moreover
the
realization
of
the

has
no
universal
significance
in
the
sense
that
the

of
it
is
thereby
of
objective
validity
as

or
as
such

its

for
the

reason
to
put
the
matter
the
other
way
it
is
wholly
unimportant
whether
the
validity
of
right
and
justice
is
acknowledged
by
private
individuals
judging
as
individuals
the
validity
is
a
vital
fact
of
state

which
holds
whether
it
be
acknowledged
or
no
no

it
is
a
matter
of
interest
to
the
general
public
that
every
one
should
fall
in
with
the
order
established
and
desire
it
but
the
wishes
of
isolated
individuals
have
no
influence
upon
that
interest
in
the
sense
that
it
is
only
by
virtue
of
the
assent
of
this
or
that
person
that
right
and
a
moral
order
is
preserved
such
require
no
such
isolated
example
of
assent
and
a
breach
of
either
is
followed
by
punishment
the
subordinate
position
of
private
persons
in
the
civilized
state
is
finally
emphasized
in
the
fact
that
whatever
share
any
one
may
have
in
the
general
civic
life
it
is
of
a
definite
and
in
every
case
restricted
character
in
the
real
state
work
must
have
some
relation
to
the
general
good303
just
as
the
active
enterprise
of
the
bourgeoisie
in
the
commercial
business
is
subdivided
in
the
most
varied
way
so
that
the
entire
life
of
the
state
shall
not
appear
as
the
concrete
achievement
of
any
single
person
or
in
general
can
be
entrusted
to
the
arbitrary
wishes
enterprise
courage
resources
and
discretion
of
such
but
on
account
of
the
fact
that
it
comprises
activities
and
trades
of
countless
complexity
and
must
be
carried
out
by
associations
of
business
men
at
least
as
varied
the
punishment
of
a
criminal
is
no
longer
an
affair
of
personal
heroism
or
the
virtue
of
any
one
individual
but
is
throughout
the
entire
process
in
the
investigation
and
discovery
of
the
felonious
act
in
the
pronouncement
of
judicial
sentence
and
its
execution
contributed
to
by
different
persons
nay
every
important
phase
of
such
a
process
is
in
the
same
way
subject
to
some
kind
of
division
of
labour
to
see
that
the
laws
are
properly
administered
then
is
not
within
the
special
province
of
any
one
man
but
results
from
an
organized
effort
of
great
variety
and
the
rules
which
direct
it
add
to
this
every
man
who
assists
in
such
a
process
is
bound
to
follow
certain
general
principles
which
are
laid
down
for
his
guidance
and
all
that
is
carried
out
under
their
direction
is
further
subject
to
the
criticism
and
control
of
yet
higher
officials

in
all
such
civic
relations
then
we
find
that
in
a
truly
regulated
state
the
public
authority
is
not
impressed
with
the
imprimatur
of
any
single
person
but
it
is
the
general
will
which
prevails
here
in
its
universality
a
condition
under
which
the
particular
life
of
the
individual
has
the
appearance
of
vanishing
or
at
least
of
becoming
of
a
quite
subsidiary
importance
in
a
condition
of
things
such
as
this
the
selfsubsistency
we
were
seeking
for
is
out
of
the
question
and
for
this
reason
we
required
for
the
free
embodiment
of
individuality
conditions
which
are
precisely
the
reverse
of
this
in
which
the
validity
of
the
ethical
principle
derives
its
support
from
individuals
and
only
from
individuals
men
who
make
for
themselves
a
great
place
in
the
arena
of
life
through
the
activity
of
exceptional
volitional
power
and
the
inherent
greatness
and
effectiveness
of
their
character
with
such
right
is
simply
that
which
they
choose
to
accept
as
such
and
if
that
which
is
essentially
moral
is
compromised
by
their
action
there
is
no
allconstraining
public
might
which
brings
them
to
judgment
and
exacts
punishment
but
only
the
right
of
that
inner
voice
of
necessity
which
accentuates
itself
as
vital
in
particular
character
and
through
external
circumstance
and
condition
and
only
thus
is
actually
existent
this
is
what
differentiates
punishment
from
revenge
the
punishment
exacted
by
law
asserts
the
validity
of
the
generally
applicable
and
carefully
defined
right
against
the
violation
of
that
right
and
makes
use
of
the
public
power
according
to
a
definite
process
as
its
instrument
in
other
words
it
employs
a
tribunal
and
a
judge
an
instrument
to
which
personality
is
attached
as
something
accidental
even
revenge
may
in
a
similar
way
find
a
justification
but
such
as
it
has
is
based
entirely
on
the
subjective
conscience
of
those
who
deal
with
the
criminal
act
and
in
pursuance
of
their
own
private
convictions
avenge
themselves
on
the
unrighteous
act
and
its
perpetrator
the
revenge
of
orestes
is
for
example
justifiable
but
he
exacted
it
under
the
direction
of
the
law
which
his
own
virtue
prescribed
not
as
the
execution
of
a
judgment
and
a
right
in
the
condition
then
that
we
claim
as
the
most
suitable
for
artistic
treatment
that
which
is
moral
and
just
must
be
throughout
personal
in
the
sense
that
its
source
is
exclusively
in
the
individual
life
and
it
only
is
actual
in
such
dependence
moreover
to
proceed
with
our
contrasted
conditions
in
regulated
states
the
external
environment
of
man
is
made
secure
and
properly
is
protected
and
he
is
only
permitted
to
retain
in
absolute
independence
for
himself
his
private
views
and
opinions
but
in
that
condition
where
the
essential
features
of
a
state
are
not
found
the
protection
of
life
and
property
depends
on
the
isolated
energy
and
courage
of
each
individual
by
himself
who
is
compelled
to
look
after
his
own
security
and
that
of
everything
which
belongs
to
him
such
a
condition
we
are
accustomed
to
identify
with
the
heroic
age
it
is
not
of
course
our
province
here
either
to
discuss
or
decide
which
of
these
two
contrasted
conditions
of
life
is
the
worthier
suffice
it
to
say
that
so
far
as
the
ideal
of
art
is
concerned
it
is
imperatively
necessary
that
this
hard
and
fixed
line
between
the
universal
as
an
independent
existence
and
individuality
should
be
removed
however
much
this
distinction
may
be
necessary
in
other
directions
for
the
realization
of
human
existence
the
reason
of
this
is
that
art
and
its
ideal
is
just
that
universal
in
so
far
as
it
may
be
presented
to
the
perception
of
the
senses
and
by
such
presentment
is
permitted
to
enter
into
the
variety
and
living
forms
of
the
world
of
objects

what
we
were
looking
for
therefore
is
supplied
us
by
the
heroic
age
for
it
is
here
that
virtue

in
the
full
sense
of
that
greek
word
creates
the
rootbasis
of
actions
in
this
connection
it
would
appear
that
we
must
distinguish
between

and
virtus
as
understood
by
the
roman
themselves
the
romans
had
already
their
state
fatherland
and
legal
institutions
and
as
contrasted
with
the
state
as
the
controlling
object
of
all
they
had
surrendered
personality
to
be
simply
a
citizen
of
rome
to
have
one
object
for
the
imagination
and
for
every
other
personal
energy
to
centre
itself
upon
namely
the
fatherland
and
its
sovereign
majesty
therein
lies
the
earnestness
and
grit
of
roman
virtue
heroes
on
the
contrary
are
individuals
who
undertake
and
accomplish
a
complete
enterprise
in
consistent
reliance
upon
their
personal
resources
and
initiative
and
with
whom
it
is
consequently
a
purely
arbitrary
act
of
their
own
when
they
execute
anything
in
accordance
with
the
moral
principle
this
immediate
unity
however
of
what
we
may
call
the
substantive
import
and
individuality
of
inclination
impulse
and
will
is
the
characteristic
of
greek
virtue
according
to
this
view
personality
is
a
law
to
itself
without
any
further
subjection
to
a
law
judgment
and
tribunal
of
independent
subsistence
the
greek
heroes
make
their
appearance
in
an
epoch
anterior
to
legal
enactment
or
they
are
themselves
the
founders
of
states
so
that
right
and
social
order
law
and
ethical
custom
emanate
from
them
and
persist
as
their
own
creation
in
an
indefeasible
relation
to
them
in
this
way
hercules
was
regarded
so
highly
by
the
ancients
themselves
and
represents
an
ideal
of
original
and
heroic
virtue
his
free
and
selfreliant
virtue
with
which
he
championed
the
right
and
battled
against
the
monstrosities
of
men
and
nature
is
not
a
prevailing
characteristic
of
the
age
but
belongs
to
him
as
an
exclusive
and
unique
possession
and
we
may
add
he
was
not
strictly
a
moral
hero
as
his
reception
of
the
fifty
daughters
of
thespius
in
one
night304
clearly
shows
us
neither
would
it
appear
from
the
tale
about
the
augaean
stables
is
he
preeminent
for
gentility
he
is
rather
the
general
type
of
selfreliant
strength
and
resource
in
its
championship
of
right
and
justice
to
exemplify
which
he
elected
summarily
and
from
a
free
choice
to
undergo
countless
toils
and
labours
it
is
true
that
some
of
his
deeds
were
carried
out
at
the
instigation
of
eurystheus
but
this
submission
is
after
all
rather
a
formal
association
than
a
real
one
no
connection
at
least
of
legal
validity
or
inevitable
necessity
through
which
the
strength
of
his
selfreliant
personality
was
diverted
from
its
independent
course
the
homeric
heroes
are
of
a
similar
type
no
doubt
they
have
their
clan
chieftain
but
the
associating
bond
is
no
fixed
relation
already
determined
by
law
which
enforces
their
submission
of
their
own
free
will
it
is
that
they
follow
agamemnon
who
is
no
monarch
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
term
consequently
every
hero
volunteers
his
own
advice
the
enraged
achilles
acts
independently
for
himself
in
his
separation
and
speaking
generally
each
and
all
come
and
go
act
or
take
their
leisure
as
they
please
in
much
the
same
independent
position
that
is
to
say
united
in
no
fixed
organization
to
which
they
are
as
individuals
entirely
subordinate
we
find
the
heroes
of
arabian
poetry
portrayed
and
even
the
shahrameh
of
ferdusi
furnishes
us
with
similar
examples
in
latterday
christendom
the
age
of
feudalism
and
knighthood
supplies
a
fertile
field
for
the
free
growth
of
heroic
enterprise
and
the
type
of
individuality
which
belongs
to
it
of
such
are
the
heroes
of
the
round
table
no
less
than
the
heroic
circle
of
which
charles
the
great
is
the
focus
charles
is
much
like
agamemnon
surrounded
with
independent
chieftains
of
heroic
mould
a
union
which
as
such
is
powerless305
he
is
consequently
always
compelled
to
take
counsel
with
them
however
much
each
of
them
may
be
influenced
by
private
passions
he
may
bluster
like
a
very
olympian
jupiter
and
none
the
less
find
himself
and
his
undertakings
suddenly
left
in
the
lurch
while
his
confederates
are
off
on
some
adventures
of
their
own
the
cid
is
perhaps
the
most
complete
example
of
the
type
he
too
is
the
ally
of
a
confederacy
the
dependent
of
a
king
and
is
bound
to
render
duty
as
vassal
but
in
opposition
to
this
obligation
he
is
preeminently
influenced
by
the
principle
of
honour
the
purely
personal
consideration
of
his
own
glory
nobility
and
reputation306
and
so
in
this
case
also
the
king
can
only
determine
a
fixed
line
of
action
and
make
war
after
consulting
and
obtaining
the
consent
of
his
vassals
if
this
is
not
given
they
do
not
fight
and
moreover
a
mere
majority
of
votes
is
not
sufficient
to
compel
them
every
man
is
independent
of
his
neighbour
and
exercises
his
will
and
steers
his
own
course
as
such
we
find
in
the
accounts
given
us
of
saracen
heroes
an
equally
brilliant
picture
of
selfreliant
and
still
more
inflexible
personality
even
the
reinecke
fuchs
fable
is
a
fresh
example
of
this
state
of
things
here
it
is
true
the
lion
is
master
and
king
but
the
wolf
and
the
bear
sit
in
council
even
reinecke
and
the
rest
do
just
what
they
like
and
when
there
is
a
general
outcry
the
sly
fellow
either
gets
out
of
the
mess
with
his
storytelling
or
manages
to
make
some
particular
interest
of
king
and
queen
work
to
his
own
advantage
and
in
his
own
cunning
way
talks
over
his
sovereign
somehow

moreover
in
much
the
same
way
that
each
individual
example
of
this
heroic
type
of
personality
persists
in
immediate
unity
with
all
that
he
may
will
act
and
accomplish
a
similar
unity
is
further
maintained
in
all
the
consequences
which
flow
from
such
initiative
when
we
ourselves
on
the
contrary
act
or
estimate
a
particular
action
we
assume
that
only
full
responsibility
can
attach
where
the
individual
under
consideration
is
in
complete
possession
of
the
true
nature
of
his
action
and
its
attendant
circumstances
if
the
content
of
those
surrounding
conditions
is
otherwise
than
that
which
is
present
to
the
agents
consciousness
in
such
a
case
a
man
nowadays
will
not
take
upon
himself
the
burden
of
all
that
is
implied
in
his
action
he
will
thrust
on
one
side
that
part
of
it
which
he
would
not
have
done
had
he
known
completely
or
not
misconceived
the
circumstances
and
he
only
accepts
that
which
was
fully
under
his
cognisance
and
carried
out
with
deliberate
intention
in
conformity
thereto
the
heroic
character
makes
no
such
distinction
he
adheres
simply
to
all
the
consequences
and
makes
good
his
personal
responsibility
for
the
whole
dipus
on
his
way
to
consult
the
oracle
meets
a
certain
man
quarrels
with
him
and
strikes
him
in
those
days
such
an
act
was
not
a
crime
at
all
he
only
returned
a
blow
after
being
vigorously
attacked
but
the
stranger
was
his
father
dipus
further
marries
a
royal
lady
his
wife
is
his
mother
without
knowing
it
he
commits
an
act
of
shame
on
learning
the
truth
he
acknowledges
such
enormities
to
their
full
extent
inflicts
a
punishment
on
himself
as
murderer
of
his
father
and
a
man
of
incest
and
this
although
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
true
nature
of
these
acts
or
had
any
intention
of
doing
them
the
selfreliant
stubbornness
and
entirety
of
the
heroic
character
refuses
to
parcel
out
responsibility
and
knows
nothing
of
such
distinctions
as
personal
intention
and
the
objective
act
and
its
consequences
in
the
evolution
and
ramification
of
an
action
as
we
moderns
regard
it
these
opposed
points
of
view
constantly
recur
and
guilt
is
thrown
into
the
background
as
far
as
possible
no
doubt
our
view
of
the
matter
is
more
in
accordance
with
ethical
principle
in
so
far
as
the
condition
of
a
personal
knowledge
of
the
particular
circumstances
or
the
consciousness
of
an
object
good
in
itself
in
short
generally
the
intent
of
an
act
is
what
materially
assists
us
in
our
judgment
but
in
the
heroic
age
where
we
find
the
individual
essentially
indivisible
and
the
objective
act
proceeding
from
himself
as
entirely
his
own
each
person
claims
absolutely
all
that
he
may
do
and
refuses
to
surrender
one
jot
or
tittle
of
responsibility
therefor
to
an
extent
equally
minute
the
heroic
figure
is
separated
from
the
ethical
whole
to
which
he
belongs
and
his
selfconsciousness
is
bound
up
wholly
in
substantial
unity
with
that
whole
according
to
the
views
in
vogue
now
we
draw
a
line
of
distinction
as
private
individuals
between
objects
which
are
wholly
personal
and
those
which
affect
the
community
the
individual
acts
in
all
that
he
does
from
his
own
private
personality
as
distinct
from
others
and
views
even
his
actions
rather
as
relative
to
this
than
as
part
of
all
that
is
farmed
out
by
the
organic
whole
to
which
he
belongs
we
consequently
make
a
distinction
between
individuals
and
their
families
such
is
unknown
in
the
heroic
age
the
guilt
of
ancestors
adheres
to
their
descendants
and
an
entire
family
will
suffer
for
the
original
defaulter
men
inherit
the
fatality
of
guilt
and
transgression
a
condemnation
such
as
this
appears
to
us
unjust
as
an
irrational
subjection
to
a
blind
fate
with
us
the
achievements
of
ancestors
reflect
no
more
honour
on
children
and
descendants
than
the
punishments
and
crimes
of
such
contaminate
those
that
follow
after
them
and
least
of
all
is
their
private
character
thus
affected
nay
modern
opinion
is
already
close
to
the
view
that
the
confiscation
of
family
property
is
a
punishment
which
violates
the
profounder
conception
of
liberty
but
in
the
ancient
and
more
plastic
totality
the
individual
is
not
so
isolated
but
rather
a
member
of
his
family
and
race
for
this
reason
the
character
action
and
fortunes
of
the
family
continue
to
be
the
private
affair
of
each
member
of
it
and
so
far
from
denying
the
actions
of
his
parents
each
man
voluntarily
accepts
them
as
his
own
they
live
in
him
and
he
is
just
that
which
his
fathers
were
suffered
or
transgressed
this
appears
to
us
a
hardship
but
that
which
we
replace
it
with
this
standing
alone
on
our
own
possessions307
and
the
more
subjective
selfstability
thus
acquired
is
also
from
another
point
of
view
only
the
abstract
selfsufficiency
of
each
the
individuality
of
heroic
times
is
none
the
less
of
a
more
ideal
type
because
it
does
not
declare
itself
as
satisfied
with
the
mere
form
of
freedom
and
infinity
but
remains
in
unalterable
and
immediate
unity
with
all
that
is
most
substantial
in
the
relations
of
spirit
which
it
of
itself
endows
with
living
actuality
in
such
an
individuality
the
substantial
is
immediately
individual
and
the
individual
thereby
himself
essentially
substantive

from
considerations
such
as
these
we
conclude
that
the
ideal
figures
of
art
must
be
sought
for
in
the
age
of
mythos
that
is
to
say
speaking
generally
in
past
times
where
we
shall
find
the
soil
most
congenial
to
their
growth
if
such
material
is
taken
from
the
age
we
live
in
whose
most
native
form
as
we
actually
find
it
is
tightly
shut
off
from
the
imagination
it
matters
not
how
we
regard
it
then
the
modifications
which
the
poet
can
hardly
avoid
making
in
it
will
not
readily
escape
the
appearance
of
a
purely
artificial
and
intentional
composition
the
past
entirely
belongs
to
memory
and
memory
perfects
the
infolding
veil
of
character
events
and
actions
in
the
vesture
of
universality
through
which
the
particular
external
or
contingent
detail
is
unable
to
penetrate
many
trifling
circumstances
and
mediating
conditions
many
varied
and
isolated
phases
of
activity
are
inseparable
from
the
actual
existence
of
an
action
or
a
character
in
the
mirror
of
memory
all
these
insignificant
details
are
obliterated
in
this
liberation
of
his
work
from
what
is
accidental
in
the
external
fact
the
artist
has
a
freer
hand
for
his
artistic
powers
of
composition
when
dealing
with
that
which
is
individual
and
particular
in
it
if
the
actions
histories
and
characters
are
borrowed
from
ancient
times
he
has
it
is
true
also
historical
memories
out
of
which
he
must
mould
a
content
conformable
to
the
universal
but
the
picture
of
the
past
possesses
as
already
observed
an
advantage
taken
simply
as
a
picture
of
greater
universality
while
the
manifold
texture
of
mediating
condition
and
circumstance
interwoven
as
it
is
in
the
entire
framework
of
finite
existence
which
surrounds
it
offers
him
material
ample
enough
to
prevent
his
hand
obliterating
the
individuality
which
is
essential
to
his
work
of
art
the
more
closely
we
consider
it
the
clearer
will
be
our
conclusion
that
a
heroic
age
has
the
advantage
over
later
and
more
civilized
times
in
that
the
isolated
character
and
personality
generally
in
such
an
age
does
not
as
yet
find
what
is
substantive
either
in
the
sphere
of
ethical
custom
or
moral
obligation
opposed
to
itself
in
the
necessary
embodiment
of
legal
institution
and
thereby
presents
immediately
to
the
poet
all
that
the
form
of
the
ideal
requires
shakespeare
has
for
example
selected
much
material
for
his
tragedies
from
chronicles
and
earlier
romances
framed
upon
a
condition
of
life
which
has
not
as
yet
received
the
impression
of
a
fully
articulated
social
order
but
in
which
the
energy
of
individuals
as
emphasized
in
personal
resolve
and
achievement
is
still
the
prevailing
characteristic
his
genuine
historical
dramas
have
on
the
contrary
a
vein
of
historical
substance
running
through
them
in
the
strictest
sense
and
for
this
reason
lean
farther
away
from
an
ideal
exposition
although
here
too
both
circumstances
and
actions
are
made
to
fall
in
with
or
are
removed
to
suit
the
unyielding
selfsufficiency
and
wilfulness
of
particular
characters
no
doubt
this
characteristic
remains
for
the
most
part
in
their
case
a
purely
formal
selfinclusion
whereas
if
we
contrast
it
with
the
selfsubsistency
of
heroic
characters
we
find
that
here
the
essential
content
of
all
such
have
proposed
to
accomplish
is
bound
up
therewith
it
is
on
account
of
this
contrast
that
we
should
find
a
reason
for
repeating
the
general
thesis
in
connection
with
the
ideal
to
the
effect
that
the
idyllic
is
exceptionally
adapted
for
its
expression
inasmuch
as
where
that
is
presented
the
cleavage
between
what
is
determined
by
legal
necessity
and
the
living
person
is
wholly
absent
to
this
we
must
reply
that
however
simple
and
original
idyllic
situations
may
be
however
far
removed
they
may
be
from
the
artificial
proseexistence
of
society
such
simplicity
if
we
consider
the
nature
of
its
content
has
in
fact
too
insignificant
an
interest
to
satisfy
the
most
substantial
and
essential
requirements
of
the
ideal
material
of
this
sort
fails
entirely
to
include
the
most
weighty
motives
of
heroic
character
such
as
fatherland
moral
and
family
problems
and
their
development
it
is
a
kind
of
treatment
which
is
apt
to
select
as
the
very
core
of
its
subject
such
a
fact
as
the
loss
of
a
single
sheep
or
the
falling
in
love
of
a
girl
in
this
way
the
idyllic
not
unfrequently
becomes
merely
the
resource
and
recreation
of
our
hearts
to
which
poets
such
as
gessner
for
example
will
add
their
dose
of
sickly
sweetness
and
sentimentalism
the
idyllic
aspect
of
the
days
we
live
in
have
further
this
defect
that
this
navet
this
domesticated
or
rural
atmosphere
in
the
emotional
aspect
of
love
or
the
enjoyment
of
a
good
cup
of
coffee
in
the
open
and
things
of
that
sort
are
not
likely
to
awake
much
interest
when
we
find
in
them
nothing
but
the
country
parson
flavourfind
them
cut
off
that
is
to
say
from
all
wider
relations
with
the
outside
world
and
not
a
trace
of
the
profounder
web
of
purposes
with
which
that
world
is
interwoven
it
is
precisely
here
that
we
have
reason
to
admire
the
genius
of
goethe
when
he
concentrated
his
poetic
talent
on
material
of
this
kind
in
his
poem
of
hermann
and
dorothea
it
is
true
that
he
selects
from
the
life
of
the
present
a
particular
theme
of
very
limited
extension
but
at
the
same
time
he
unfolds
before
us
as
the
background
and
atmosphere
of
the
picture
in
which
his
characters
are
portrayed
the
great
interests
of
the
revolution
and
his
own
native
country
and
in
short
associates
with
a
subjectmatter
necessarily
narrow
in
its
range
facts
of
worldhistory
of
the
widest
and
most
potent
significance
generally
speaking
we
shall
find
that
the
ills
of
life
and
its
evil
war
battles
and
revenge
are
not
excluded
from
the
subjectmatter
of
the
ideal
but
are
frequently
the
very
source
and
substance
of
the
heroic
age
and
its
myths
whose
form
grows
all
the
wilder
and
sterner
in
proportion
to
the
remoteness
of
such
a
period
from
a
fully
developed
society
of
law
and
moral
order
in
the
chivalrous
adventures
of
knighterrantry
we
find
the
heroes
of
such
tales
themselves
often
enough
sharing
the
savage
and
dissolute
characteristics
of
the
times
and
in
much
the
same
way
the
martyrdom
of
the
heroes
of
the
church
presupposes
a
condition
of
ferocious
cruelty
around
them
at
bottom
however
the
christian
ideal
which
is
based
on
the
depth
and
inwardness
of
mans
spiritual
nature
stands
in
a
relation
of
entire
indifference
to
the
external
world
we
have
demonstrated
that
the
condition
of
particular
centuries
is
more
applicable
to
the
ideal
in
the
same
way
art
selects
preeminently
a
particular
class
of
society
for
the
form
under
which
the
ideal
shall
appear
the
order
that
is
to
say
of
princes
and
the
selection
is
made
not
because
art
is
necessarily
aristocratic
or
has
any
predilection
for
gentility308
but
simply
on
account
of
the
perfection
in
which
free
will
and
its
products
may
be
exemplified
imaginatively
through
the
highly
placed
class
we
have
in
the
chorus
of
ancient
tragedy
the
characteristics
and
universal
background
of
general
maxims
modes
of
imaginative
thought
and
emotion
before
which
the
definite
movements
of
the
action
proceed
in
contrast
to
this
appear
the
more
clearly
defined
individualities
of
the
personages
immediately
concerned
in
the
action
men
and
women
of
authority
and
belonging
for
the
most
part
to
royal
families
on
the
other
hand
the
main
impression
forced
upon
us
when
seeing
representatives
of
a
lower
class
carrying
on
pursuits
which
are
of
a
narrower
range
is
one
of
subjection
and
indeed
in
an
artificial309
state
of
society
the
freedom
of
action
of
such
a
class
is
fettered
in
every
direction
and
is
necessarily
involved
with
all
its
passions
and
interests
in
all
the
medley
and
despotic
forces
of
external
circumstance
it
is
in
fact
held
closely
behind
the
invincible
power
of
the
social
order
which
it
is
unable
to
come
out
of
and
is
an
alien
from
the
authority
of
the
dominant
order
even
when
that
is
asserted
in
accordance
with
just
principle
in
this
limitation
of
outlook
through
the
hard
conditions
of
life
all
real
independence
is
wrecked
for
this
reason
both
the
circumstances
and
characters
which
we
find
in
such
a
sphere
of
life
are
more
appropriate
to
the
treatment
of
comedy
everybody
being
permitted
in
comedy
to
rate
themselves
as
they
please
and
to
lay
claims
to
a
selfsufficiency
in
all
that
they
will
and
think
which
is
none
the
less
immediately
negatived
by
the
spiritual
no
less
than
the
external
dependence
of
their
lives
as
a
rule
such
a
false
and
secondhand
selfsubsistency
must
inevitably
fall
to
pieces
when
confronted
with
the
actual
conditions
of
life
and
the
distorted
view
which
is
formed
of
them
the
force
of
circumstances
is
presented
to
the
lower
orders
of
society
on
a
totally
different
level
from
that
in
which
it
acts
upon
rulers
and
princes
in
schillers
braut
von
messina
don
caesar
is
able
to
exclaim
and
justly
there
stands
no
higher
judge
than
myself
and
when
he
has
to
be
punished
he
must
himself
give
judgment
and
execute
it
he
is
in
fact
subject
to
no
external
necessity
of
right
and
law
and
even
when
punishment
is
the
question
is
wholly
dependent
on
himself
the
characters
in
the
shakespearean
drama
do
not
entirely
belong
to
the
princely
order
and
only
partially
are
taken
from
mythical
sources
but
they
are
placed
in
the
era
of
civil
wars
in
which
the
ties
of
social
order
and
legislative
enactment
are
either
weakened
or
shattered
and
they
secure
from
such
a
condition
the
exceptional
independence
and
selfsufficiency
we
are
looking
for
b
if
we
transfer
our
attention
now
from
the
characteristic
conditions
of
society
we
have
hitherto
mainly
considered
to
the
actual
state
of
the
world
around
us
and
its
carefully
articulated
scheme
of
ethical
judicial
and
political
institutions
we
shall
not
fail
to
observe
that
the
material
we
have
here
offered
us
for
figures
of
truly
ideal
type
is
of
a
very
restricted
character
the
province
here
in
which
an
entirely
open
field
is
presented
for
the
display
of
independent
purpose
in
its
fullest
individuality
is
limited
both
in
its
range
and
the
measure
of
opportunity
the
qualities
that
make
a
man
thorough
in
his
relations
to
his
own
family
and
his
business
the
ideals
in
short
of
honest
citizens
and
excellent
wives
in
so
far
as
will
and
activity
are
concentrated
on
the
field
in
which
it
is
still
possible
for
a
man
to
exercise
his
free
personality
to
carry
out
in
short
all
that
he
has
a
mind
to
do
this
is
the
prevailing
feature
of
our
modern
society
such
ideals
inevitably
lack
the
depth
of
a
fuller
content
and
the
most
significant
feature
of
them
is
that
of
the
attitude
of
the
individual
mind
to
their
realization
for
we
find
here
the
content
is
already
presented
by
existing
social
institutions
and
consequently
the
essential
interest
we
take
in
it
depends
on
the
particular
way
in
which
that
content
is
realized
and
appears
in
the
personal
life
its
moral
and
inward
significance
for
this
reason
it
is
not
possible
as
in
the
case
of
former
times
to
create
ideals
from
the
positions
of
judgeship
and
kingship
if
a
man
carries
out
his
judicial
functions
nowadays
in
accordance
with
duty
and
the
requirements
of
his
office
he
merely
is
acting
within
the
bounds
already
marked
out
for
him
by
legislative
enactments
in
the
social
order
as
the
sphere
of
his
responsibilities
all
that
may
characterize
his
tenure
of
office
beyond
this
as
proceeding
from
personal
qualities
such
as
suavity
of
demeanour
or
acuteness
of
judgment
is
not
the
main
point
or
the
substantial
content
but
rather
an
aspect
of
it
which
it
is
possible
to
dispense
with
as
something
accidental
in
the
same
way
the
monarchs
of
our
own
day
are
no
longer
as
was
the
case
with
the
heroes
of
mythical
times
in
themselves
the
embodying
and
culminating
unity
of
society
itself
but
rather
a
more
or
less
unsubstantial
centrum
around
which
all
legal
and
social
institutions
however
moulded
in
the
course
of
time
group
themselves
in
independent
relations
all
the
most
important
functions
of
the
executive
have
nowadays
been
separated
from
the
royal
prerogative
kings
do
not
lay
down
the
law
control
finance
the
preservation
of
social
order
is
not
one
of
their
most
characteristic
functions
peace
and
war
are
determined
through
the
particular
circumstances
of
international
politics
which
it
is
not
within
their
power
exclusively
either
to
direct
or
control
and
if
it
happens
that
any
important
decision
with
regard
to
either
depends
in
the
last
resort
on
their
judgment
such
a
decision
is
not
generally
so
much
in
the
nature
of
its
substance
the
result
of
any
personal
preference
as
it
is
the
formal
seal
of
monarchical
authority
on
what
is
already
determined
on
public
grounds
the
mere
imposition
of
that
which
is
strictly
official
rather
than
personal
in
its
character
in
the
same
way
a
general
or
fieldmarshal
of
our
times
has
unquestionably
great
authority
objects
and
interests
of
profound
importance
are
under
his
control
and
his
circumspection
his
courage
his
determination
and
his
intelligence
are
involved
in
the
weightiest
decisions
nevertheless
whatever
may
be
definitely
traced
to
the
essentially
personal
characteristics
of
the
man
has
little
opportunity
for
display
in
such
a
result
for
in
the
first
place
the
objects
upon
which
his
decisions
turn
are
not
of
his
own
selection
and
arise
out
of
circumstances
which
lie
beyond
the
sphere
of
his
influence
rather
than
are
spontaneously
fixed
by
himself
secondly
the
means
adopted
to
carry
out
such
objects
are
not
the
sole
result
of
his
initiative
on
the
contrary
they
are
supplied
him
from
sources
which
are
not
immediately
under
his
authority
or
personal
influence
but
stand
rather
quite
apart
from
the
sphere
of
his
individual
powers
as
a
general
to
sum
up
then
though
it
is
true
that
under
the
present
condition
of
the
civilized
world
a
man
may
act
independently
for
himself
in
many
directions
the
fact
remains
that
in
whatever
direction
he
may
turn
he
is
still
only
a
member
of
a
fixed
order
of
society
and
appears
as
such
limited
in
his
range
rather
than
the
vital
representative
and
individual
embodiment
of
society
itself
he
acts
necessarily
under
such
a
condition
of
restriction
and
our
interest
in
such
a
personality
no
less
than
in
the
content
of
his
aims
and
activity
is
entirely
devoid
of
completeness
in
the
end
we
are
invariably
driven
to
concentrate
our
attention
on
the
purely
personal
interest
how
far
that
is
to
say
he
attained
success
what
was
the
nature
of
the
obstacles
and
complications
which
in
either
through
untoward
chance
or
necessity
confronted
or
distracted
his
progress
and
if
it
is
moreover
true
that
our
modern
personality
is
of
infinite
significance
when
we
estimate
the
character
thus
manifested
as
a
spiritual
product
in
its
actions
sufferings
moral
opinions
and
conduct
that
is
to
say
it
is
also
true
that
the
moral
content
which
is
realized
in
such
an
individual
is
of
a
restricted
character
rather
than
as
is
the
case
in
the
heroic
times
the
realization
of
universal
right
custom
and
legality
the
individual
is
no
longer
the
exclusive
vehicle
and
actual
embodiment
of
these
powers
as
in
the
previous
times
c
our
interest
however
in
and
need
to
have
presented
us
such
a
completely
realized
individuality
and
living
selfdependence
will
always
persist
however
strongly
we
may
recognize
the
worth
and
reasonable
nature
of
the
more
developed
condition
of
an
organized
and
trained
civic
society
it
is
this
necessity
which
makes
us
regard
with
astonishment
the
youthful
spirit
of
schiller
and
goethe
when
they
sought
to
discover
that
lost
selfsufficiency
in
the
prevailing
conditions
of
modern
times
how
do
we
find
in
particular
this
attempt
is
made
by
schiller
in
his
earliest
works
simply
by
a
rebellion
directed
against
the
whole
organic
framework
of

bind

his

consequently

hesitates
for
long
whether
to

private
inclination

his
duty
he
has

they

isolated

much

of

starts
from
a
dramatic
situation
of
an
analogous
though
somewhat
inverse
type
the
times
of
gtz
and
franz
von
sickingen
belong
to
the
interesting
epoch
in
which
knighterrantry
and
the
selfreliant
individuality
of
the
class
of
nobility
is
being
superseded
by
the
new
creation
of
an
external
and
legally
constituted
social
order
to
have
selected
precisely
this
critical
time
where
we
find
the
heroic
characteristics
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
legalized
fabric
of
modern
society
meet
and
collide
for
the
subject
of
his
first
artistic
production
shows
much
penetration
on
the
part
of
goethe
for
gtz
and
sickingen
are
still
heroes
in
the
genuine
sense
who
are
resolved
to
exercise
their
influence
over
circumstances
whether
immediately
affecting
them
or
of
wider
range
out
of
the
resources
of
their
own
personalities
their
courage
and
their
private
sense
of
right
the
new
order
of
things
involves
gtz
in
acts
of
illegality
and
brings
about
the
catastrophe
of
his
life
it
is
only
in
the
middle
ages
that
knighterrantry
and
the
relations
of
feudalism
will
supply
a
field
entirely
open
to
this
type
of
selfreliant
manhood
when
we
find
moreover
the
legalized
order
coordinated
more
completely
in
its
prosaic
form
the
predominant
authority
in
fact
the
adventurous
selfdependence
of
knighthood
is
left
outside
it
as
an
unrelated
excrescence
and
if
an
attempt
is
made
to
assert
it
as
though
it
were
still
a
valid
means
of
attacking
wrong
and
assisting
the
oppressed
it
becomes
simply
an
object
of
ridicule
such
as
cervantes
illustrates
for
us
in
his
don
quixote
in
this
allusion
to
the
opposition
which
exists
between
two
differently
constituted
rgimes
of
society
and
the
collision
which
results
from
action
in
defiance
of
their
particular
character
we
have
already
indicated
what
we
have
above
defined
generally
as
the
closer
determination
and
differentiation
of
the
universal
state
of
the
world
that
is
to
say
the
situation
as
generally
expressed
2
the
situation
the
ideal
worldcondition
which
it
is
the
function
of
art
to
present
in
contrast
to
prosaic
reality
we
may
conclude
from
our
previous
discussion
to
be
merely
a
general
background
of
society
of
a
specific
kind
it
is
merely
the
possible
condition
necessary
for
the
particular
presentation
not
the
presentation
itself
what
we
have
hitherto
directed
attention
to
is
in
fact
the
general
background
upon
which
the
living
figures
of
art
may
appear
it
is
undoubtedly
fructified
with
individuality
and
is
supported
by
its
selfsubsistency
but
as
a
general
condition
it
is
not
yet
the
active
movement
of
particular
individuals
in
the
very
form
of
life
just
as
we
may
say
that
the
temple
which
art
erects
is
not
as
yet
the
representation
of
the
personal
godhead
but
only
encloses
the
germ
of
the
same
for
this
reason
we
must
in
the
first
instance
regard
this
worldcondition
as
a
kind
of
medium
in
repose
a
harmony
so
to
speak
of
forces
which
are
operative
in
it
and
to
this
extent
it
possesses
a
substantial
consistency
of
uniform
worth
which
however
must
not
be
accepted
as
identical
with
what
has
been
called
the
age
of
innocence
for
it
is
a
condition
in
the
fulness
and
sovereignty
of
whose
ethical
atmosphere
the
terrors
of
division
only
are
slumbering
because
in
our
contemplation
of
it
we
have
before
us
for
the
first
time
the
aspect
of
its
substantial
unity
and
consequently
are
only
presented
with
individuality
in
its
most
universal
terms
a
mode
of
viewing
it
which
makes
it
fade
away
as
though
without
definition
or
any
essential
disturbance
of
its
unity
instead
of
giving
to
it
the
full
value
of
definite
characteristics
but
such
characterization
is
essential
to
individuality
and
if
the
ideal
is
to
appear
as
definite
form
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
escape
from
such
pure
universality
or
in
other
words
for
it
to
give
the
universal
a
particular
expression
and
by
so
doing
impart
to
it
both
existence
and
appearance
art
consequently
has
in
this
connection
not
only
to
translate
into
its
medium
a
universal
worldcondition
but
must
proceed
beyond
this
quite
indefinite
conception
to
the
composition
of
pictures
of
definite
character
and
action
regarded
from
the
aspect
under
which
it
affects
individual
character
this
general
condition
is
the
environment
of
circumstance
which
according
to
its
specifically
detached
form
tends
to
excite
both
collisions
and
development
forcing
thereby
the
individuals
thus
affected
to
express
their
nature
and
exhibit
such
expression
in
a
definite
form
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
worldcondition
this
selfrevelation
of
particular
individuals
appears
as
the
passing
of
its
universality
into
the
distinct
embodiments
of
living
individuality
an
aggregate
over
which
universal
forces
still
assert
the
mastery311
for
the
eternal
powers
operative
in
the
worldprocess
constitute
the
substantive
content
of
the
ideal
as
specifically
defined
in
what
it
essentially
is
the
mode
of
existence
however
which
is
realized
through
the
bare
form
of
external
condition
is
unworthy
of
this
content
for
in
the
first
place
such
a
condition
is
associated
with
habit
and
the
habitual
is
no
adequate
determination
of
those
profounder
interests
which
are
active
in
selfconscious
mind
furthermore
as
we
have
observed
it
was
the
contingency
and
caprice
of
individuality
by
virtue
of
whose
spontaneous
activity
these
very
interests
are
permitted
to
appear
in
life
but
this
unessential
contingency
and
caprice
is
again
quite
as
little
adequate
to
the
substantive
universality
which
constitutes
the
notion
of
essential
actuality
on
these
grounds
respectively
we
are
therefore
compelled
to
seek
an
artenvisagement
more
worthy
and
better
defined
for
the
concrete
content312
of
the
ideal
this
new
configuration
the
universal
powers
can
only
retain
in
its
determinate
existence
in
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
manifested
in
their
essential
modes
of
difference
and
movement
or
to
put
the
matter
more
specifically
through
their
assertion
of
the
contradictions
which
they
relatively
unfold
two
aspects
of
the
process
of
individualization
into
which
the
universal
thus
passes
must
be
here
emphasized
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
substance
as
an
embracing
sphere
of
universal
forces
through
the
differentiation
indicated
which
is
broken
from
its
substantive
unity
into
its
component
parts
secondly
there
are
the
individuals
which
spring
forth
as
the
active
completion
of
these
forces
and
give
to
them
a
specific
objectification
now
what
we
have
characterized
as
the
difference
and
opposition
in
which
the
worldcondition
hitherto
harmonious
with
the
individuals
conditioned
by
it
is
involved
if
we
consider
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
universal
condition
is
the
manifestation
of
the
essential
content
which
it
carries
in
itself
on
the
other
hand
we
observe
that
the
substantive
universal
in
that
condition
is
articulated
through
particular
units
in
such
a
way
that
this
very
universal
procures
for
itself
determinate
existence
albeit
it
is
thus
immersed
in
the
appearance
of
chance
disunion
and
division
an
appearance
which
however
is
rendered
nugatory
by
the
fact
that
it
is
the
universal
which
thus
appears
the
separation
of
these
forces
and
their
objectification313
in
individuals
can
however
further
take
place
under
definite
conditions
and
circumstances
under
which
and
as
a
constituent
aspect
of
which
the
entire
objective
appearance
receives
a
determinate
form
or
as
the
stimulative
impulse
of
this
very
realization
by
themselves
such
circumstances
are
without
interest314
and
it
is
only
through
their
relation
to
mankind
that
they
receive
such
a
significance
through
whose
selfconsciousness
the
content
of
these
spiritual
forces
is
carried
actively
into
objective
appearance
the
external
circumstances
are
consequently
only
to
be
regarded
of
significance
in
so
far
as
they
supply
an
essential
relation
to
spirit
in
so
far
that
is
to
say
as
they
are
comprehended
by
those
individual
units
and
afford
them
a
stimulus
to
actualize
their
inward
spiritual
needs
the
aims
ideas
the
determinate
substance
in
short
of
all
that
requires
an
individual
embodiment
regarded
as
a
stimulating
influence
of
this
kind
particular
circumstances
and
conditions
create
what
we
have
called
the
situation
which
is
specifically
presupposed
in
the
actual
selfexpansion
and
activity
of
all
that
still
lies
undeveloped
in
the
universal
worldcondition
it
is
for
this
reason
we
have
considered
the
previous
determination
of
the
notion
of
the
situation
as
necessary
to
any
inquiry
into
the
true
constituents
of
action
the
situation
expressed
in
general
terms
is
in
one
aspect
of
it
the
circumstance
particularized
to
the
point
of
definite
character
and
under
this
characterization
it
is
to
put
it
another
way
the
stimulating
impulse
to
a
particular
expression
of
content
which
it
is
the
function
of
artistic
presentation
to
transmute
into
a
specific
form
of
existence
looked
at
from
this
latter
point
of
view
especially
the
situation
offers
a
wide
field
for
contemplation
inasmuch
as
it
has
ever
been
one
of
the
most
essential
objects
of
art
to
discover
situations
of
real
interest
that
is
to
say
of
such
a
kind
as
will
present
to
us
the
profound
and
weighty
interest
the
truest
content
of
spiritual
life
the
requirements
of
the
several
arts
in
this
respect
no
doubt
differ
sculpture
for
example
is
preeminently
limited
in
its
reference
to
the
inwardly
detailed
variety
of
situations
painting
and
music
are
already
operative
in
a
freer
and
more
comprehensive
medium
finally
we
are
least
able
among
them
all
to
exhaust
the
possibilities
of
poetry
in
this
respect
since
we
have
not
yet
arrived
at
that
portion
of
our
subject
where
we
deal
directly
with
the
specific
arts
it
will
be
sufficient
here
to
draw
attention
to
a
few
of
the
most
general
aspects
of
that
inquiry
which
we
may
subdivide
in
the
following
manner
first
we
would
observe
that
the
situation
still
retains
the
form
of
universality
and
thereby
of
indeterminacy
so
long
as
it
is
undeveloped
and
without
definite
characterization
we
have
consequently
at
first
present
before
us
a
situation
which
is
without
situation
for
the
form
of
indeterminacy
is
itself
only
one
form
as
opposed
to
its
contradiction
of
determinacy
and
is
shown
to
be
by
virtue
of
this
very
contrast
a
onesided
aspect
which
as
such
possesses
a
determinate
relation
secondly
however
the
situation
passes
in
separation
away
from
this
universality
and
becomes
certainly
determinate
to
that
extent
but
at
first
with
a
determinacy
which
produces
no
destructive
consequences
that
is
to
say
it
is
one
which
offers
no
stimulus
to
active
opposition
and
its
necessary
resolution
thirdly
we
find
the
element
of
disunion
in
all
its
vigour
creating
by
the
definition
of
its
opposed
characteristics
the
essence
of
the
situation
which
thereby
is
carried
into
a
collision
which
again
proceeds
to
reactions
and
as
such
forms
the
point
of
departure
to
the
conception
of
artistic
action
properly
so
called
we
may
in
fact
characterize
the
situation
generally
as
the
intermediate
plane
between
the
universal
worldcondition
still
in
a
state
of
equilibrium
and
the
concrete
action
unfolded
in
all
its
tendency
to
movement
and
reaction
a
position
which
gives
to
it
the
characteristics
of
both
extremes
and
enables
us
to
pass
over
from
the
one
to
the
other
a
the
absence
of
situation315
we
passed
from
the
notion
of
the
universal
worldcondition
in
presenting
to
ourselves
the
form
of
it
as
essentially
individual
selfsubsistency
selfsubsistency
however
regarded
simply
in
its
essential
form
presents
to
us
in
the
first
instance
merely
the
secure
repose
upon
its
own
resources
in
its
bare
tranquillity
the
form
as
thus
defined
is
carried
into
no
relation
with
another
but
remains
at
one
with
itself
in
inclusion
with
its
unity
both
within
and
without
this
presents
us
with
the
situation
which
is
without
situation
an
illustration
of
which
we
may
take
those
ancient
types
of
templebuilding
dating
from
the
earliest
days
of
art
whose
character
of
profound
immutable
seriousness
of
tranquil
nay
even
of
austere
and
grandiose
dignity
has
been
the
object
of
imitation
even
in
more
recent
times
proceeding
on
lines
of
a
similar
type
the
egyptian
and
most
ancient
greek
sculptures
will
further
illustrate
for
us
the
same
kind
of
indeterminate
situation
in
the
plastic
art
of
christianity
especially
if
we
consider
particular
examples
of
early
bustsculpture
we
shall
find
both
god
the
father
and
christ
are
presented
in
a
similar
spirit
indeed
such
a
mode
of
delineation
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
present
us
with
the
secure
substantiality
of
the
divine
whether
such
be
apprehended
as
a
definite
and
particular
godhead
or
is
grasped
as
essentially
absolute
personality
and
this
is
so
in
virtue
of
the
very
defect
of
such
a
representation
that
it
gives
us
portraits
of
persons
of
middleage
which
are
without
any
trace
of
definite
situations
in
which
the
character
of
the
individual
as
such
can
reveal
itself
and
only
the
attempt
is
made
to
express
the
entirety
of
determinate
character
in
its
quality
of
stability316
b
the
situation
defined
in
its
harmlessness317
the
second
point
to
emphasize
is
inasmuch
as
the
situation
generally
is
reached
in
the
definition
of
form
the
passage
from
this
tranquillity
and
blessed
repose
or
from
the
unbroken
severity
and
force
of
selfconsistency
forms
which
subsist
in
unfeatured
equilibrium
that
is
to
say
immutable
both
within
and
without
have
to
be
set
in
motion
and
surrender
their
undressed
simplicity
this
bare
progression
to
a
more
specific
manifestation
in
some
particular
mode
of
expression
is
what
we
may
describe
certainly
as
definite
situation
but
a
situation
which
has
not
yet
asserted
conflicting
elements
in
itself
and
is
fully
ripe
for
collision
this
first
step
in
the
process
of
individualized
expression
is
consequently
of
a
kind
that
carries
with
it
no
further
result
it
is
set
in
no
antagonistic
opposition
to
something
else
in
a
relation
which
evokes
both
collision
and
reaction
it
is
already
in
its
character
of
unconstrainedness
finished
and
complete
in
itself
with
such
a
type
of
situation
we
may
associate
those
which
are
mainly
to
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
play
in
so
far
as
all
that
proceeds
or
is
carried
out
in
them
indicates
no
real
seriousness
of
purpose
for
all
earnestness
in
any
kind
of
activity
is
generally
the
result
of
oppositions
and
contradictions
which
drive
on
their
way
to
the
final
removal
or
victory
of
one
side
or
the
other
for
this
reason
situations
of
this
kind
cannot
themselves
be
identified
with
actions
nor
are
they
the
stimulative
impulse
of
actions
they
are
indeed
in
a
certain
aspect
of
determinate
character
but
they
are
either
circumstances
of
the
most
trivial
significance
or
a
form
of
action
which
is
without
an
essentially
serious
object
which
either
is
the
result
of
conflicts
or
is
able
to
carry
the
action
yet
further
into
conflicts

the
first
thing
to
arrest
us
in
this
process
is
the
passage
generally
from
the
repose
of
the
unfeatured
situation
to
a
condition
of
emotion
and
expression
this
is
asserted
partly
as
purely
mechanical
motion
in
part
also
as
the
first
impulse
and
satisfaction
of
any
internal
want
the
egyptians
for
example
represented
the
gods
in
their
sculpture
with
closely
locked
limbs
the
greeks
on
the
contrary
released
both
arms
and
legs
and
endowed
the
bodily
form
with
all
that
is
appropriate
to
the
advance
and
general
variety
of
movement
permanent
repose
a
seated
attitude
a
tranquil
gaze
are
all
of
them
simple
conditions
under
which
the
greeks
apprehended
their
gods
they
are
modes
which
unquestionably
gave
to
the
selfsubsistent
figure
of
godhead
a
certain
characterization
but
one
nevertheless
which
is
not
carried
forward
into
other
relations
and
oppositions
but
rather
remains
enclosed
within
itself
and
permanently
significant
as
such
situations
of
this
simple
kind
attach
in
a
particular
way
to
sculpture
and
the
ancients
above
all
others
were
inexhaustible
in
discovering
fit
subjects
for
such
a
condition
of
unconstrained
freedom
in
this
respect
they
showed
an
extraordinary
insight
for
it
is
precisely
through
contrast
with
the
insignificance
of
the
particular
situation
that
the
majesty
and
selfsubsistency
of
the
ideal
types
of
the
greek
pantheon
were
made
to
appear
so
striking
it
was
in
fact
through
the
harmlessness
and
insignificance
of
what
appeared
to
be
done
or
left
undone
that
the
blessed
peaceful
tranquillity
and
immutability
of
the
immortal
gods
was
brought
most
clearly
to
consciousness
the
situation
merely
indicates
the
particular
character
of
either
god
or
hero
in
quite
a
general
way
such
as
brings
them
into
no
relation
with
other
gods
or
at
least
into
no
relation
suggestive
of
hostility
or
division

it
is
a
further
step
in
the
direction
of
more
defined
situation
when
we
find
in
such
any
particular
purpose
already
represented
in
it
an
activity
which
stands
in
definite
relation
to
something
external
and
the
selfsubsistent
figure
itself
expressed
as
within
the
sphere
of
such
purpose
or
activity
even
objectification
such
as
these
however
which
have
no
real
disturbing
influence
upon
the
tranquillity
and
cheerful
blessedness
of
the
figures
represented
are
rather
to
be
regarded
as
particular
modes
of
presentation
incidental
to
this
very
quality
of
cheerful
contentment
the
invention
of
the
greeks
was
here
too
exceptionally
thoughtful
and
fruitful
it
is
essential
to
the
unconstrainedness
of
such
situations
that
the
activity
here
presented
should
merely
indicate
an
action
in
its
initial
stage
in
such
a
way
that
no
further
developments
or
oppositions
are
likely
to
proceed
from
it
but
that
all
that
appears
necessary
to
complete
it
should
be
found
enclosed
in
the
action
depicted
as
an
illustration
of
this
the
situation
of
the
belvedere
apollo
is
seized
at
the
moment
when
he
moves
forward
in
wrathful
majesty
after
slaying
the
python
with
his
arrow
a
situation
of
this
kind
has
not
the
grandiose
simplicity
of
the
earlier
greek
sculpture
which
asserts
for
our
intelligence
the
repose
and
open
clarity
of
the
gods
by
means
of
expressed
actions
of
less
significance
take
the
case
of
aphrodite
peacefully
gazing
at
herself
while
emerging
from
her
bath
in
full
possession
of
her
charms
or
of
fauns
and
satyrs
at
play
play
that
is
wholly
absorbed
in
itself
or
of
that
famous
satyr
who
dandled
the
young
bacchus
in
his
arms
while
he
looks
down
upon
him
with
infinite
tenderness
and
grace
to
say
nothing
of
the
endless
variety
of
unconstrained
activities
in
which
eros
is
depicted
such
are
a
few
examples
of
this
type
of
situation
if
the
action
is
of
more
concrete
character
we
are
confronted
with
a
more
involved
situation
which
at
least
for
the
artistic
presentment
of
the
greek
gods
as
selfsubstantive
powers
is
less
appropriate
in
a
case
of
this
kind
the
pure
universality
of
the
individual
god
is
less
able
to
transpierce
the
accumulated
detail
of
the
particular
action
which
he
expresses
the
mercury
of
pigalli
which
is
a
present
of
louis
xv
to
the
exposition
of
statuary
in
sanssouci
is
fastening
on
his
winged
sandals
this
is
a
perfectly
harmonious
action
the
mercury
of
thorwaldsen
on
the
contrary
is
depicted
under
a
situation
which
is
almost
too
complicated
for
sculpture
he
listens
attentively
to
the
flute
of
marsyas
at
the
same
time
he
is
craftily
spying
him
to
see
how
he
may
slay
him
while
his
hand
grasps
maliciously
for
the
dagger
he
has
concealed
in
opposition
to
this
if
we
may
add
one
more
illustration
from
a
more
modern
work
of
art
is
that
representation
by
rudolf
schadow
of
a
maiden
binding
her
sandals
in
much
the
same
simple
manner
as
we
find
in
the
case
of
mercury
in
this
example
the
navet
of
the
situation
does
not
contain
the
interest
we
experience
when
it
is
a
god
who
exhibits
such
unconstrained
action
when
it
is
only
a
maiden
who
fastens
her
sandals
or
spins
there
is
little
else
to
engage
our
attention
but
the
simple
action
which
is
by
itself
of
little
significance
or
importance

we
shall
find
further
if
we
follow
up
the
above
train
of
thought
that
the
more
closely
defined
situation
can
be
treated
more
generally
as
merely
a
more
or
less
definite
stimulus
presenting
the
opportunity
for
further
development
of
expressed
action
of
wider
range
related
to
the
primary
subject
with
varying
degrees
of
affinity
many
lyrical
poems
have
what
we
may
call
an
occasional
situation
of
this
kind
a
particular
mood
or
a
certain
atmosphere
of
emotion
is
a
situation
which
can
be
arrested
poetically
for
consciousness
and
furthermore
in
particular
relation
to
external
circumstances
festivals
or
public
victories
is
able
to
carry
us
forward
to
this
or
that
artistic
expression
either
of
more
comprehensive
or
restricted
range
and
in
every
kind
of
embodiment
of
feeling
and
idea
pindars
odes
of
victory
are
supreme
examples
of
this
type
of
occasional
poetry
goethe
too
has
selected
as
the
subjectmatter
of
his
muse
many
lyrical
situations
of
a
similar
character
and
in
fact
if
we
look
closely
into
the
matter
we
shall
hardly
be
wrong
in
calling
his
werther
a
poem
of
occasion
it
is
through
the
medium
of
werther
that
goethe
has
elaborated
the
convulsions
and
anguish
of
his
own
heart
incorporated
in
short
the
facts
of
his
own
experience
in
a
work
of
art
this
after
all
is
true
of
every
lyrical
poet
he
gives
poetical
expression
to
that
which
nearly
affects
him
and
thereby
throws
the
windows
of
his
heart
open
to
the
fresh
air
that
which
has
hitherto
been
sealed
up
within
is
released
in
the
external
object
from
which
our
humanity
has
freed
itself
just
as
we
are
the
lighter
for
the
rain
of
tears
in
which
the
sorrow
is
wept
away
so
goethe
as
in
fact
he
has
told
us
himself
by
his
composition
of
werther
liberated
himself
from
the
mastery
and
pressure
of
his
heart
troubles
at
the
same
time
we
must
point
out
that
this
lastmentioned
situation
is
not
really
appropriate
to
the
type
with
which
we
are
now
dealing
it
obviously
presents
the
profoundest
contradiction
in
itself
which
calls
for
resolution
no
doubt
in
the
kind
of
lyrical
situation
we
have
identified
with
the
occasional
we
may
have
declared
a
circumstance
objectively
determined
in
other
words
an
activity
in
close
relation
to
the
external
world
but
on
the
other
hand
we
find
the
poetic
temperament
equally
able
to
withdraw
itself
within
the
atmosphere
it
creates
wholly
free
from
its
external
environment
and
to
make
that
inward
world
which
is
the
combined
product
of
circumstance
and
emotion
its
true
point
of
departure
c
the
collision
all
the
situations
to
which
we
have
hitherto
directed
attention
are
as
already
observed
neither
true
actions
in
themselves
nor
indeed
the
stimulative
source
of
such
action
their
determination
was
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
purely
occasional
circumstance
or
condition
or
an
action
in
itself
of
no
significance
in
which
a
substantive
content
was
expressed
in
such
a
way
that
its
specific
character
appeared
as
a
mere
harmless
play
in
which
nothing
of
a
truly
serious
nature
was
implied
the
full
seriousness
and
weighty
import
of
a
situation
can
only
begin
when
we
find
in
it
the
element
of
disruption
where
the
determination
itself
exposes
an
essential
aspect
of
difference
and
by
its
opposition
to
something
else
becomes
the
source
of
a
collision
the
collision
arises
as
we
are
now
considering
it
in
an
act
of
violation
which
is
unable
to
retain
its
character
as
such
but
is
compelled
to
find
a
new
principle
of
unity
it
is
a
change
in
the
previously
existent
condition
of
harmony
a
change
which
is
still
in
process
the
collision
is
however
not
an
action
and
is
to
be
taken
simply
as
stimulus
to
action
to
all
that
characterizes
the
situation
and
this
is
true
although
the
contradiction
in
which
the
collision
is
enclosed
may
be
the
result
of
previous
action
as
an
example
of
this
we
may
cite
the
trilogies
of
the
ancients
which
carry
forward
the
main
theme
by
presenting
at
the
close
of
one
drama
the
collision
which
forms
the
stimulative
impulse
of
the
next
which
in
its
return
renders
necessary
the
resolution
which
is
carried
out
by
the
third
and
moreover
for
this
very
reason
that
the
collision
always
requires
some
resolution
attendant
on
this
conflict
of
opposing
elements
the
more
a
situation
is
full
of
it
the
more
it
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
subjectmatter
of
dramatic
art
it
being
the
especial
claim
of
that
art
to
present
beauty
in
its
completest
and
profoundest
development
sculpture
on
the
contrary
is
not
wholly
suited
to
give
embodiment
to
any
action
through
which
the
great
spiritual
forces
are
manifested
either
in
their
division
or
reconciliation
and
indeed
the
art
of
painting
despite
its
more
extended
spatial
significance
is
only
able
to
objectify
a
single
moment
of
action
these
situations
of
tragic
significance
introduce
a
peculiar
difficulty
in
dealing
with
them
which
is
inherent
in
their
very
conception
for
inasmuch
as
they
obviously
arise
from
violations
of
the
worldcondition
they
offer
to
our
consideration
circumstances
which
are
unable
to
continue
as
they
are
which
render
necessary
something
of
a
remedial
nature
to
reclothe
them
but
the
beauty
of
the
ideal
consists
precisely
in
its
undisturbed
unity
repose
and
consummation
with
itself
the
collision
on
the
other
hand
disturbs
this
harmony
of
what
is
truly
real
and
ethical
and
drives
this
unity
of
the
ideal
into
discord
and
opposition
through
the
representation
of
such
disruption
the
ideal
itself
suffers
violation
the
function
of
art
will
undoubtedly
consist
partly
in
preventing
the
entire
destruction
of
free
beauty
in
this
difference
and
partly
in
only
carrying
this
breach
of
unity
and
the
conflict
it
occasions
to
a
point
in
which
harmony
may
again
be
recovered
as
the
result
of
such
a
conflict
and
its
resolution
and
in
this
way
become
manifest
for
the
first
time
in
its
essential
perfection
it
is
however
impossible
to
determine
on
a
general
principle
the
precise
limit
to
which
such
discordance
may
be
carried
inasmuch
as
the
several
arts
in
this
respect
preserve
their
independent
character
the
medium
of
the
subjective
idea
can
support
a
far
intenser
disruption
than
that
of
the
plastic
arts318
in
other
words
poetry
is
quite
within
its
right
when
it
breaks
up
the
unity
of
the
world
of
the
imagination
even
to
the
point
of
the
extremest
form
of
desperation
and
in
its
delineation
of
external
objects
to
that
of
absolute
ugliness
in
the
case
of
the
plastic
arts
on
the
contrary
in
painting
that
is
to
say
and
even
more
so
in
sculpture
the
external
form
remains
in
unalterable
fixity
it
can
neither
be
removed
nor
lightly
passed
over
in
such
a
way
that
it
again
disappears
under
such
conditions
it
would
be
a
serious
defect
to
represent
once
and
for
all
an
ugliness
which
could
not
possibly
be
transmuted
consequently
all
that
would
be
quite
compatible
in
dramatic
poetry
which
is
able
to
represent
a
momentary
appearance
that
again
vanishes
is
not
within
the
province
of
the
plastic
arts
in
discussing
the
more
obvious
types
of
collision
we
can
only
in
this
portion
of
our
inquiry
indicate
the
most
general
points
of
view
we
would
particularly
draw
attention
to
three
fundamental
aspects
under
which
they
may
be
coordinated
first
there
are
those
collisions
which
proceed
from
purely
natural
that
is
to
say
physical
conditions
in
so
far
as
these
are
characterized
with
qualities
which
are
negative
or
evil
and
consequently
discordant
secondly
we
have
collisions
which
are
of
a
spiritual
nature
but
which
depend
on
natural
conditions
conditions
which
may
in
themselves
have
a
positive319
character
yet
for
the
spirit
contain
within
themselves
the
seeds
of
difference
and
contradiction
thirdly
there
are
divisions
which
are
caused
entirely
by
disruption
in
the
spirit
alone
to
these
alone
we
are
justified
in
attaching
the
peculiar
interest
of
contradiction
which
is
bound
up
with
genuine
human
activity

now
with
reference
to
the
first
type
of
conflicting
forcesfor
the
reason
that
here
it
is
only
external
nature
through
the
maladies
and
other
evils
and
infirmities
which
are
incidental
to
her
creating
conditions
which
destroy
the
preexistent
harmony
of
life
replacing
such
with
a
state
of
antagonismsuch
can
at
most
merely
serve
as
a
stimulus
for
something
outside
them
regarded
wholly
by
themselves
such
collisions
are
of
no
interest
they
are
the
subjectmatter
of
art
simply
for
the
sake
of
the
disruption
which
may
follow
as
a
consequence
of
some
natural
misfortune
the
alcestis
of
euripides
we
may
add
too
that
of
gluck
the
subject
of
whose
opera
is
practically
the
same
are
examples
of
this
in
both
the
sickness
of
admetus
is
necessarily
presupposed
that
sickness
merely
by
itself
could
not
fitly
supply
a
subject
for
artistic
treatment
it
only
becomes
even
in
the
handling
of
euripides
associated
with
it
by
virtue
of
the
individual
characters
who
on
account
of
such
misfortune
are
compelled
to
face
a
further
collision
it
is
the
word
of
the
oracle
that
admetus
must
die
unless
another
will
pass
to
the
underworld
for
his
sake
alcestis
out
of
love
for
her
husband
devotes
herself
to
such
a
sacrifice
resolves
to
die
in
order
to
restrain
death
from
touching
her
beloved
the
father
of
her
children
the
king
in
the
philoctetes
of
sophocles
a
physical
malady
is
also
the
cause
of
the
collision
here
the
greeks
during
their
voyage
to
troy
place
the
man
who
is
suffering
from
a
wounded
foot
caused
by
the
serpents
bite
in
chrysas
on
the
island
of
lemnos
in
this
case
too
the
physical
mishap
is
merely
the
extreme
meeting
point
and
incentive
of
a
further
collision
for
according
to
the
prophecy
troy
can
only
fall
when
the
arrows
of
hercules
are
in
the
hands
of
the
storming
army
philoctetes
refuses
to
give
them
up
because
he
has
been
compelled
for
nine
years
to
suffer
the
martyrdom
of
his
banishment
this
refusal
no
less
than
the
fact
of
his
unrighteous
desertion
from
which
it
springs
could
have
been
followed
by
every
variety
of
result
other
than
that
which
took
place
the
real
interest
accordingly
does
not
centre
in
the
malady
and
its
physical
necessity
but
in
the
opposition
which
arises
from
the
refusal
of
philoctetes
to
surrender
the
arrows
the
case
of
the
plague
in
the
greek
camp
before
troy
is
very
similar
although
this
is
already
represented
entirely
as
the
consequence
of
former
transgression
as
a
punishment
in
short
a
mode
of
statement
more
adapted
to
epic
than
dramatic
poetry
nevertheless
it
is
closely
associated
with
evils
incidental
to
natural
misfortune
such
as
storm
shipwreck
and
drought
as
a
rule
however
art
will
not
represent
such
mischance
as
mere
accident
but
rather
as
an
obstruction
and
misfortune
whose
necessity
simply
consists
in
assuming
precisely
this
particular
form
rather
than
another

but
to
turn
now
to
our
second
type
of
the
collision
inasmuch
as
the
external
powers
of
nature
are
not
that
which
is
most
essential
to
the
interests
and
contradictions
of
human
life
in
cases
where
they
are
found
closely
associated
with
such
spiritual
relations
they
will
present
themselves
merely
as
the
ground
from
which
the
collision
breaks
forth
in
its
true
character
this
is
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
must
regard
all
situations
where
we
trace
the
original
source
of
conflict
in
the
facts
of
natural
birth
we
will
shortly
distinguish
between
three
particular
cases
of
this

in
the
first
place
we
have
the
right
that
is
bound
up
with
natural
condition
that
which
constitutes
relationship
and
inheritance
for
example
which
for
the
very
reason
that
it
stands
in
close
connection
with
nature
carries
with
it
a
number
of
relations
that
are
bound
up
with
her
and
this
though
the
right
the
fact
is
one
and
only
one
the
most
important
example
of
this
is
the
right
of
succession
to
the
throne
it
is
important
to
observe
that
this
right
must
not
as
yet
in
relation
to
the
collisions
which
spring
from
it
be
absolutely
fixed
by
rule
otherwise
the
resultant
conflict
will
be
of
quite
another
character
if
that
is
to
say
the
right
of
succession
is
not
as
yet
entirely
controlled
by
legislation
and
the
social
order
which
it
implies
no
wrong
will
necessarily
attach
to
any
one
of
the
alternatives
namely
whether
it
be
an
older
or
younger
brother
or
any
other
relative
of
the
royal
household
who
obtains
the
sovereignty
but
inasmuch
as
sovereignty
is
a
qualitative
rather
than
a
quantitative
possession
which
cannot
like
gold
and
other
material
goods
be
divided
up
according
to
a
just
principle
dispute
and
contention
is
inevitably
the
result
of
such
a
form
of
succession
when
dipus
for
example
leaves
the
throne
of
thebes
without
a
ruler
he
leaves
his
two
sons
confronting
each
other
with
a
right
and
claim
of
equal
strength
the
brothers
arrange
to
occupy
the
throne
alternately
from
year
to
year
eteocles
however
breaks
the
compact
and
polynices
brings
an
army
against
thebes
to
enforce
his
right
the
antagonism
of
brothers
has
always
been
in
the
history
of
art
a
fruitful
source
of
collision
it
commences
indeed
with
the
story
of
cain
who
slew
his
brother
abel
in
the
tale
of
shahrameh
the
earliest
example
we
have
of
a
persian
book
of
heroic
legend
it
is
a
contention
of
throne
succession
which
is
the
source
of
the
most
varied
conflicts
in
this
feridu
divided
the
earth
among
his
three
brothers
selm
receives
as
his
portion
rum
and
chawer
turan
and
osin
are
given
to
thur
and
fredysh
becomes
lord
of
the
earth
from
iran
all
three
however
claim
the
land
which
belongs
to
his
brothers
and
endless
quarrels
and
wars
are
the
result
in
the
middle
ages
we
find
just
the
same
countless
examples
of
family
and
dynastic
broils
such
dissensions
however
appear
in
themselves
to
be
due
to
accidental
circumstance
it
is
not
necessary
that
brothers
should
be
at
enmity
particular
circumstances
and
more
important
causes
must
be
attached
such
as
the
in
itself
tragic
birth
of
the
sons
of
dipus
or
as
we
find
in
the
bride
of
messina
the
author
is
at
pains
to
shift
the
quarrel
of
the
brothers
on
to
still
more
fateful
circumstances
in
shakespeares
macbeth
a
similar
collision
is
the
foundation
of
the
tragic
dnouement
duncan
is
king
and
macbeth
as
his
nearest
and
oldest
relation
is
consequently
heir
to
the
throne
with
a
right
precedent
even
to
duncans
sons
the
primary
incentive
of
macbeths
crime
is
the
wrong
which
the
king
has
done
him
in
naming
his
own
son
as
heir
to
the
throne
this
justification
of
macbeth
which
is
supported
by
the
chronicles
of
the
time
shakespeare
has
entirely
passed
over
because
it
was
solely
his
object
to
bring
into
startling
relief
the
repulsive
aspect
of
macbeths
ambitious
passion
in
order
thereby
to
make
his
work
agreeable
to
king
james
who
would
be
naturally
interested
in
finding
the
crime
of
macbeth
depicted
without
extenuating
circumstances
as
a
consequence
we
can
find
no
sufficient
reason
why
under
shakespeares
handling
of
the
subject
macbeth
fails
to
murder
the
sons
of
duncan
no
less
than
their
father
lets
them
escape
in
fact
nor
can
we
understand
why
they
are
wholly
overlooked
by
the
nobles
however
the
entire
collision
upon
which
the
drama
of
macbeth
turns
carries
us
beyond
the
particular
type
which
we
are
now
mainly
considering

in
the
second
of
our
examples

the

of
collision320
we
are
now
discussing
we
find
the
reverse
situation
to
that
just
discussed
and
it
consists
in
this
that
difference
of

moreover
through
ethical
custom

within
the
chains
of
an
insuperable
barrier
so
that
it
receives
at
the
same
time
the
appearance
of
an
innate
wrong

consequently

between

are
all
of
them
cases
for
consideration
under
this
head
the
conflict
here
consists
in
this
that
on
the
one
hand
humanity
has
rights

and
requirements
which
belong
to
it

in

of
its
fundamental
idea

nevertheless
in
each
one
of
the
above
mentioned
examples
meet
with
dangerous
restriction
and
obstruction
owing
to
the
compulsive
necessity
of
natural
birth
on
this
type
of
collision
we
have
the
following
remarks
to
offer
the
differences
which
obtain
between
classes
such
as
the
ruled
and
the
rulers
are
no
doubt
essential
to
the
notion
of
statelife
and
are
founded
on
reason
for
they
are
caused
by
the
inevitable
articulation
of
the
organic
community
and
assert
themselves
as
such
through
the
specific
forms
of
occupation
disposition
modes
of
life
and
general
levels
of
education
in
all
their
branches
it
is
another
matter
however
when
these
differences
as
they
affect
individuals
are
determined
absolutely
by
the
accident
of
birth
so
that
the
individual
man
from
the
very
start
is
not
on
account
of
any
quality
in
himself
but
solely
through
the
accident
of
nature
irrevocably
relegated
to
a
particular
class
or
caste
in
such
a
case
it
is
obvious
these
differences
appear
as
innate
and
are
moreover
though
purely
external
girt
with
force
in
its
highest
and
most
aggressive
mode
we
are
not
bound
to
ask
ourselves
how
this
fixity
and
compulsive
restraint
came
originally
into
existence
for
the
nation
may
originally
have
been
united
and
the
natural
distinction
between
freeman
and
serf
been
only
evolved
at
a
later
time
or
the
difference
between
castes
classes
and
privileged
persons
may
have
grown
out
of
earlier
distinctions
of
nations
and
races
as
many
are
inclined
to
think
is
the
explanation
of
the
caste
distinctions
of
india
all
this
is
a
matter
of
no
moment
to
us
here
the
main
point
simply
consists
in
this
that
vital
relations
of
this
kind
which
regulate
the
entire
course
of
human
existence
have
their
source
in
natural
conditions
on
general
principles
no
doubt
distinctions
of
class
can
be
justified
but
at
the
same
time
no
individual
should
be
wholly
robbed
of
his
right
to
determine
as
his
choice
may
direct
to
which
particular
class
he
shall
belong
natural
capacity
talents
adaptability
and
education
are
the
only
right
means
to
direct
the
way
and
decide
in
this
respect
when
however
the
right
of
choice
is
debarred
from
birth
onwards
and
a
man
is
made
thereby
dependent
on
nature
and
its
contingency
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
conflict
within
the
sphere
of
this
necessity
between
the
states
thus
enforced
on
the
individual
by
natural
conditions
and
the
measure
of
spiritual
education
which
he
may
acquire
and
the
higher
demand
which
it
may
justly
make
this
is
a
pathetic
and
unfortunate
type
of
collision
which
has
its
source
in
an
essential
wrong
which
the
freedom
of
art
is
quite
unable
to
respect
in
the
social
condition
of
our
own
days
distinctions
of
class
with
a
few
exceptions
are
not
determined
by
birth
the
ruling
dynasty
and
the
peerage
are
the
only
exceptions
and
these
depend
on
a
higher
conception
of
the
state
altogether
for
the
rest
the
mere
fact
of
birth
creates
no
essential
distinction
that
can
ultimately
determine
the
class
to
which
a
man
may
belong
if
he
is
otherwise
competent
to
join
it
for
this
reason
however
we
must
condition
the
demand
for
entire
liberty
of
choice
with
the
requirement
that
in
education
knowledge
ability
and
general
tastes
the
individual
is
equal
to
the
particular
society
with
which
he
may
desire
to
associate
if
on
the
contrary
the
fact
of
a
mans
birth
presents
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
such
claims
which
he
would
otherwise
be
quite
competent
to
satisfy
by
virtue
of
his
own
vigorous
activity
then
such
a
situation
must
appear
to
us
not
merely
a
misfortune
but
essentially
a
wrong
under
which
he
is
compelled
to
suffer
injury
he
is
thus
separated
by
a
purely
natural
partition
wall
which
is
essentially
unjust
that
is
to
say
one
beyond
which
his
talents
sentiments
and
general
education
have
already
raised
him
from
that
which
he
was
competent
to
reach
and
a
purely
natural
condition
whose
legalized
fixity
has
been
determined
wholly
by
caprice
presumes
to
oppose
insuperable
barriers
to
the
freedom
rightly
demanded
by
all
spiritual
life
to
examine
more
closely
the
nature
of
this
type
of
collision
we
shall
do
well
to
look
at
it
from
three
different
points
of
view
each
of
which
are
of
essential
importance
in
the
first
place
it
is
necessary
that
the
individual
should
in
the
strength
of
his
own
spiritual
resources
already
really
have
passed
beyond
the
natural
barriers
whose
opposition
is
to
give
way
before
his
aims
and
desires
otherwise
the
demand
is
simply
an
act
of
folly
if
for
example
a
domestic
servant
whose
education
and
ability
is
merely
that
of
a
menial
falls
in
love
with
a
princess
or
a
lady
of
high
society
or
inversely
either
of
these
with
him
such
a
love
affair
is
both
absurd
and
devoid
of
all
taste
and
this
is
so
even
if
the
artistic
representation
of
this
passion
display
all
the
depth
and
interest
of
which
an
ardent
heart
is
capable
in
such
a
case
it
is
not
so
much
the
difference
of
birth
which
creates
the
obstacle
this
is
rather
to
be
found
in
the
entire
content
of
interests
education
aims
of
life
requirements
and
mode
of
sentiment
which
distinguish
in
status
material
resources
and
social
qualifications
a
lady
in
high
position
from
a
domestic
servant
if
love
is
as
in
the
case
assumed
the
one
and
only
bond
of
a
union
and
is
associated
with
nothing
else
throughout
the
entire
sphere
of
all
that
men
and
women
have
to
live
through
in
just
accordance
with
that
which
a
particular
status
requires
from
their
intelligence
and
experience
it
must
necessarily
remain
devoid
of
content
and
is
simply
a
union
of
the
senses
love
to
be
wholly
complete
is
nothing
less
than
a
real
harmony
of
the
entire
conscious
life
in
which
the
full
nobility
of
sentiment
can
be
shared
and
appreciated
the
second
case
we
wish
to
examine
is
that
in
which
the
dependence
of
birth
surrounds
an
essentially
free
human
life
and
the
objects
it
may
rightly
set
before
itself
with
legalized
fetters
of
obstruction
this
collision
also
presents
an
element
unadapted
for
artistic
treatment
opposed
that
is
to
say
to
the
notion
of
the
ideal
despite
its
love
to
make
use
of
it
and
the
facility
with
which
it
may
attempt
to
do
so
if
distinctions
of
birth
through
positive
laws
and
the
powers
which
support
them
create
a
persistent
wrong
as
doubtless
may
be
the
case
where
a
man
is
born
an
outcast
or
a
jew
he
obviously
from
one
point
of
view
is
entirely
right
in
holding
with
all
the
strength
of
his
inward
life
which
rebels
before
such
a
barrier
that
the
same
is
dissolvable
that
he
in
fact
recognizes
his
individuality
as
apart
from
it
to
oppose
such
restraint
appears
to
be
wholly
justifiable
but
in
so
far
as
it
becomes
impossible
through
the
force
of
existing
circumstances
to
overcome
such
a
barrier
which
is
consequently
converted
into
an
irrevocable
necessity
a
situation
of
this
kind
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
misfortune
which
itself
is
not
without
an
element
of
falsity
for
the
rational
man
is
inevitably
forced
in
so
far
as
he
is
unable
to
subjugate
the
opposing
necessity
to
submit
to
the
same
it
is
not
in
reason
to
continue
to
fight
against
the
inevitable
but
rather
quietly
to
let
it
pass
over
him
he
must
in
fact
abandon
the
sense
of
interest
in
and
need
of
that
which
is
by
virtue
of
this
barrier
swept
from
his
reach
and
suffer
what
he
fails
to
overcome
with
the
quiet
courage
of
passive
endurance
where
a
struggle
is
of
no
avail
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
be
quit
of
it
in
order
at
the
least
to
retire
into
the
formal
independence
of
personal
liberty
by
doing
so
the
forces
of
wrong
have
no
longer
power
over
him
if
on
the
contrary
he
battles
against
them
he
must
necessarily
experience
his
dependence
in
its
fullest
extent
at
the
same
time
it
remains
unquestionable
that
neither
this
abstraction
of
formal
independence
any
more
than
that
content
which
can
lead
to
no
result
are
truly
beautiful
when
artistically
considered
there
is
a
third
type
of
collision
which
while
being
immediately
connected
with
that
we
have
just
considered
is
equally
removed
from
the
genuine
ideal
it
is
to
be
found
affecting
that
class
of
persons
who
attempt
to
assert
some
privilege
which
the
mere
fact
of
birth
concedes
them
and
supports
with
the
full
weight
of
a
religious
title
positive
enactments
and
the
prevailing
conditions
of
society
in
such
a
case
it
is
true
we
have
an
independent
position
in
harmonious
relation
with
what
is
externally
realized
in
positive
institutions
but
when
considered
as
the
mere
consistency
of
that
which
is
in
itself
unjust
and
irrational
it
is
quite
as
much
as
in
our
former
example
a
purely
formal
independence
and
the
notion
of
the
ideal
disappears
we
may
no
doubt
very
possibly
persuade
ourselves
that
the
ideal
is
retained
because
we
have
here
an
appearance
as
though
the
personal
life
is
in
full
union
with
the
universal
and
its
legalized
constitution
remaining
consistently
in
such
unity
but
it
will
be
observed
that
here
the
universal
does
not
assert
its
dominating
power
in
the
particular
person
as
we
found
the
heroic
ideal
demanded
but
only
in
and
through
the
public
authority
of
positive
laws
and
their
administration
moreover
what
the
individual
here
asserts
is
assumed
to
be
essentially
wrong
and
he
loses
in
consequence
the
substantive
significance
which
we
have
seen
to
be
also
essential
to
the
ideal
an
affair
in
which
the
ideal
subject
of
art
is
concerned
must
itself
be
at
bottom
true
and
justifiable
to
this
type
belong
the
legalized
lordship
exercised
over
slaves
or
serfs
the
right
to
rob
a
foreigner
of
his
liberty
or
to
sacrifice
the
same
to
the
gods
no
doubt
it
is
quite
possible
that
such
a
right
may
be
sustained
by
individuals
with
unquestioning
belief
that
they
are
justified
in
so
doing
as
in
india
for
example
the
higher
castes
make
use
of
their
privileges
or
as
thoas
ordered
the
sacrifice
of
orestes
or
in
russia
the
lords
are
wont
to
flout
their
serfs
in
fact
those
who
are
in
authority
are
very
likely
to
execute
such
rights
as
legalized
rights
on
account
of
the
interest
they
may
have
in
preserving
them
but
in
a
case
of
this
kind
their
right
will
be
merely
the
unrighteous
right
of
the
barbarian
and
they
must
themselves
appear
to
us
in
the
category
of
barbarians
at
least
who
resolve
to
carry
out
and
perfect
what
is
essentially
injustice
the
legalized
form
under
which
the
individual
shelters
himself
is
for
the
time
to
which
it
belongs
and
its
spirit
and
the
educational
standard
adapted
to
it
no
doubt
to
be
respected
and
justified
but
if
we
reflect
upon
it
rationally
and
apart
from
that
it
is
wholly
positive321
containing
no
intrinsic
claims
or
authority
moreover
if
the
individual
makes
use
of
his
privileges
for
purely
personal
objects
under
the
mastery
of
particular
passions
and
the
aims
of
mere
selfishness
in
addition
to
our
barbarian
we
get
a
bad
character
to
boot
poets
have
frequently
sought
to
arouse
our
pity
and
it
may
be
our
fear
as
well
through
the
presentation
of
conflicts
of
this
kind
following
the
rule
of
aristotle
who
lays
it
down
that
fear
and
compassion
are
objects
of
tragedy
strictly
speaking
we
experience
neither
fear
nor
reverence
when
confronted
with
rights
which
only
exist
among
barbarians
and
are
the
misfortune
of
uncivilized
times
any
compassion
which
such
situations
are
likely
to
arouse
is
almost
immediately
converted
into
a
spirit
of
indignant
hostility
the
only
true
artistic
dnouement
of
such
a
conflict
is
one
where
we
find
such
illegitimate
rights
are
not
carried
into
execution
as
for
example
neither
iphigenia
nor
orestes
are
respectively
sacrificed
in
aulis
and
tauris

the
third
and
last
class
of
that
type
of
collision
which
is
based
on
purely
natural
condition
is
that
which
is
duetto
personal
passion
caused
by
natural
peculiarities
of
temperament
and
character
the
jealousy
of
othello
is
a
supreme
example
of
this
ambition
avarice
nay
even
love
itself
in
certain
aspects
will
furnish
other
illustrations
collision
of
this
kind
is
only
properly
referred
to
such
passions
in
so
far
as
individuals
seized
and
dominated
exclusively
by
the
power
of
such
emotions
are
thereby
forced
into
antagonism
with
the
truly
ethical
constitution
and
inherently
justifiable
course
of
human
existence
and
consequently
are
plunged
into
a
still
more
serious
conflict
this
carries
our
inquiry
into
the
consideration
of
that
third
subdivision
of
our
original
classification
of
general
types
of
collision
the
type
of
which
is
based
exclusively
upon
the
conflict
of
spiritual
forces
in
so
far
as
such
opposition
is
the
result
of
human
activity

we
have
already
observed
when
dealing
with
purely
natural
collisions
that
they
only
form
the
startingpoint
as
it
were
for
further
states
of
contradiction
and
the
same
is
more
or
less
true
of
the
second
type
of
conflict
already
adverted
to
all
these
in
artistic
compositions
of
really
profound
significance
are
unable
to
remain
in
such
forms
of
opposition
as
we
have
hitherto
discussed
such
disturbances
and
conflicting
elements
merely
substantiate
the
opportune
moment
out
of
which
the
true
and
essential
forces
of
spiritual
life
will
clash
together
in
opposition
and
contend
for
the
mastery
that
which
is
spiritual
can
only
be
set
in
activity
by
virtue
of
spirit
consequently
the
oppositions
of
spirit
can
only
win
reality
in
actual
human
deed
can
only
thus
manifest
themselves
in
their
true
character
the
position
we
have
arrived
at
then
is
this
we
have
on
one
hand
a
difficulty
an
obstacle
a
violation
effected
through
something
human
life
has
carried
out
in
action
we
have
on
the
other
a
violation
of
interests
and
forces
intrinsically
just
and
right
by
treating
these
two
forms
of
determination
in
close
juxtaposition
we
for
the
first
time
are
able
to
gauge
the
full
depth
of
this
last
type
of
collision
we
may
distinguish
between
the
prominent
examples
which
fall
within
the
consideration
of
this
class
of
cases
as
follows

in
passing
from
the
sphere
of
that
type
of
conflict
which
we
have
pointed
out
rests
for
its
primary
basis
on
what
is
entirely
due
to
nature
we
observe
that
the
first
class
of
cases
which
confronts
us
on
crossing
the
boundary
to
the
consideration
of
a
new
type
is
closely
related
to
that
we
have
just
left
behind
us
if
then
human
action
is
assumed
to
be
responsible
for
the
collision
it
will
follow
that
what
is
carried
out
as
natural
through
human
action
that
is
to
say
in
so
far
as
humanity
is
not
entirely
spiritual
will
consist
in
this
that
a
particular
action
is
performed
unconsciously
and
without
purpose
which
will
be
found
afterwards
to
be
a
positive
infraction
of
the
forces
of
selfrespecting
and
civilized
society
the
consciousness
which
any
man
latterly
acquires
of
the
injurious
nature
of
an
action
of
which
he
was
previously
unaware
will
drive
him
who
still
accepts
the
responsibility
of
such
an
action
into
division
and
conflict
the
ground
of
such
a
conflict
in
fact
consists
in
the
opposition
with
which
the
mind
is
confronted
between
that
which
was
actually
before
it
when
the
action
took
place
and
the
subsequent
discovery
of
all
that
was
really
implied
in
the
act
itself
the
cases
of
dipus
and
ajax
will
at
once
suggest
themselves
as
examples
the
action
of
dipus
if
viewed
simply
with
reference
to
his
will
and
knowledge
amounted
merely
to
the
fact
that
he
killed
a
perfect
stranger
in
a
quarrel
the
unconscious
act
was
the
reality
in
its
full
significance
that
is
to
say
the
murder
of
his
own
father
ajax
in
a
fit
of
frenzy
slaughtered
the
cattle
of
the
greeks
believing
them
to
be
the
greek
chieftains
on
regaining
his
senses
and
discovering
what
he
really
did
he
is
seized
with
a
sense
of
shame
which
drives
him
into
collision
with
himself
we
must
however
observe
that
what
has
been
unconsciously
violated
by
a
man
in
the
type
of
collision
we
are
now
examining
ought
to
be
something
which
he
himself
when
fully
in
a
position
to
judge
would
both
honour
and
revere
if
such
a
reverential
attitude
has
its
roots
merely
in
personal
idiosyncrasy
or
superstition
such
a
collision
can
arouse
to
say
the
least
no
really
profound
interest

further
inasmuch
as
in
the
cases
we
are
now
discussing
the
conflict
arises
from
a
spiritual
violation
of
spiritual
forces
through
human
action
the
collision
more
generally
appropriate
to
the
type
will
consist
in
a
violation
which
is
perpetrated
with
full
consciousness
proceeding
out
of
such
and
the
intention
it
implies
the
point
of
departure
here
may
centre
again
in
passion
violence
folly
and
other
similar
qualities
the
trojan
war
for
example
originates
in
the
rape
of
helen
agamemnon
afterwards
sacrifices
iphigenia
and
so
violates
the
feelings
of
her
mother
slaying
thus
the
darling
of
her
womb
clytemnestra
in
consequence
murders
her
spouse
orestes
avenges
the
murder
of
his
father
and
king
by
assassinating
his
mother
in
a
similar
way
in
hamlet
the
father
is
sent
to
his
grave
by
a
stratagem
and
the
mother
of
hamlet
insults
the
manes
of
the
dead
man
by
a
precipitate
marriage
with
his
murderer
in
the
case
of
these
collisions
as
in
those
already
considered
the
main
point
is
this
that
humanity
is
engaged
in
a
selfimposed
conflict
with
what
is
intrinsically
moral
true
and
worthy
of
reverence
if
this
is
not
so
then
for
all
who
are
really
conscious
of
what
is
moral
and
right
such
a
conflict
can
only
appear
without
worth
or
material
significance
as
is
the
case
for
example
in
the
famous
episode
of
the
mahbhrata
with
reference
to
nalas
and
damayanti
king
nalas
marries
the
princess
damayanti
who
is
allowed
the
privilege
of
making
a
free
choice
among
her
sisters
all
the
other
suitors
are
genii
floating
in
the
air
nalas
stands
on
the
earth
alone
as
a
man
and
she
has
the
good
sense
to
select
him
the
genii
are
consequently
much
enraged
and
watch
for
the
moment
when
they
may
find
king
nalas
tripping
for
many
years
they
can
bring
to
his
charge
no
offence
as
he
is
capable
of
none
at
last
however
they
obtain
power
over
him
for
he
commits
a
great
crime
the
crime
is
this
namely
that
after
making
water
he
treads
with
his
foot
upon
the
earth
thus
watered
according
to
indian
ideas
this
is
a
severe
offence
which
cannot
escape
punishment
from
that
moment
the
genii
have
him
in
their
power
one
renders
all
his
amatory
desires
abortive
another
excites
his
brother
against
him
and
finally
poor
nalas
after
forfeiting
his
throne
and
being
reduced
to
beggary
is
driven
forth
a
wanderer
in
wretchedness
with
damayanti
at
length
he
is
even
compelled
to
part
with
her
until
as
the
tale
will
have
it
after
many
adventures
he
is
once
more
set
on
the
throne
of
his
original
happiness
the
real
conflict
upon
which
for
the
indians
of
old
days
the
whole
of
this
story
was
supported
was
an
essential
desecration
of
a
sacred
thing
according
to
our
notions
the
tale
is
absurd
from
beginning
to
end

thirdly
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
disruption
should
be
direct
or
in
other
words
that
the
action
taken
solely
by
itself
should
be
an
act
of
collision
the
fact
of
collision
may
well
appear
out
of
relations
and
circumstances
of
opposition
and
antagonism
which
are
forced
upon
the
mind
during
the
process
of
that
actions
execution
juliet
and
romeo
are
in
love
with
one
another
in
the
mere
fact
of
their
love
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
disunion
but
they
are
aware
that
their
families
are
living
in
mutual
hate
and
hostility
that
their
parents
will
never
consent
to
the
marriage
and
they
are
carried
into
collision
by
virtue
of
this
preassumed
situation
of
antagonistic
forces
we
must
content
ourselves
here
with
these
very
general
remarks
upon
the
relation
which
the
determinate
situation
occupies
in
its
opposition
to
the
universal
worldcondition
were
we
to
extend
our
inquiry
into
all
the
divergent
aspects
modifications
and
nuances
of
the
subject
attempting
thereby
to
express
an
opinion
upon
every
possible
form
of
situation
this
chapter
would
alone
present
us
with
sufficient
matter
for
discussions
of
endless
prolixity
and
diffuseness
the
discovery
of
different
situations
implies
a
content
of
exhaustless
possibilities
and
in
every
particular
example
the
essential
question
involved
is
how
such
may
be
adapted
to
the
treatment
of
any
specific
art
in
true
subordination
to
the
principles
and
character
of
such
an
art
to
the
fairy
story
much
is
permitted
which
is
forbidden
to
a
more
stringent
mode
of
artistic
representation
and
we
may
say
that
generally
the
discovery322
of
the
situation
is
a
critical
point
in
the
process
of
artproduction
which
often
presents
great
difficulty
to
artists
in
our
own
days
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
a
suitable
subjectmatter
as
a
source
for
the
circumstances
and
situations
which
the
artist
requires
is
a
common
complaint
at
first
sight
it
may
appear
to
us
more
in
keeping
with
our
notion
of
poet
if
he
borrow
from
his
own
resources
and
invent
situations
himself
but
such
independence
does
little
to
increase
his
claims
as
a
creative
artist
for
the
situation
does
not
directly
constitute
the
spirituality
of
his
work
nor
indeed
give
us
its
true
artistic
form
all
that
it
does
is
to
supply
the
external
material
in
which
as
its
appropriate
medium
a
character
or
temperament
is
unfolded
before
us
it
is
only
after
working
into
this
external
material
in
which
actions
and
characters
find
their
startingpoint
that
the
true
genius
of
the
artist
is
actively
displayed
the
poet
consequently
has
little
or
no
claim
to
our
thanks
for
merely
having
himself
invented
this
least
of
all
poetical
aspects
of
his
production
he
is
in
fact
fully
entitled
to
draw
as
much
and
as
frequently
as
he
pleases
from
anything
that
comes
to
his
hand
whether
it
be
history
saga
mythos
or
chronicle
nay
even
from
material
and
situations
which
have
already
been
artistically
treated
just
as
we
find
in
the
art
of
painting
the
external
matter
of
the
situation
is
borrowed
from
legends
of
saints
and
the
process
has
been
repeated
on
similar
lines
over
and
over
again
to
discover
the
real
artistic
significance
of
such
artistic
work
we
must
penetrate
far
beyond
the
mere
invention
of
particular
situations
the
same
remarks
will
apply
in
full
force
to
the
entire
wealth
of
the
circumstances
and
developments
artistically
handled
in
reference
to
this
it
is
frequently
claimed
as
a
virtue
of
modern
art
in
contrast
with
that
of
the
ancients
that
we
find
in
it
an
infinitely
more
exuberant
imagination
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
find
in
the
artistic
creations
of
the
middle
ages
and
our
modern
world
the
most
extraordinary
variety
and
interfusion
of
situations
events
and
occurrences
whether
tragic
or
otherwise
this
fulness
of
detail
however
does
not
take
us
far
in
spite
of
it
all
we
have
very
few
dramas
or
epics
of
the
first
excellence
for
the
main
point
is
not
the
external
course
and
interchange
of
a
variety
of
events
when
we
find
such
events
and
histories
merely
complete
the
entire
content
of
our
work
of
art
rather
it
is
the
ethical
and
spiritual
form
which
embodies
them
and
the
masterful
movements
of
temperament
and
character
which
are
exposed
and
unveiled
during
the
entire
process
of
this
artistic
embodiment
glancing
now
at
the
main
position
we
have
arrived
at
and
from
which
our
inquiry
will
proceed
we
have
found
that
circumstances
conditions
and
relations
whether
determined
with
a
reference
to
the
external
world
or
the
subjective
consciousness
only
create
the
situation
by
virtue
of
the
temperament
or
passion
which
experiences
them
and
derives
its
nutriment
through
them
we
have
further
seen
that
the
situation
breaks
up
this
determinate
form
in
opposition
obstruction
development
and
disruption
so
that
the
emotional
life
feels
itself
compelled
by
the
force
of
the
affecting
circumstances
to
react
with
energy
against
this
disturbing
and
restraining
influence
which
stands
in
the
way
of
its
objects
and
passions
it
is
here
in
truth
that
the
action
strictly
speaking
commences
when
that
is
to
say
the
contradiction
has
fully
asserted
itself
which
was
already
implied
in
the
fully
defined
situation
inasmuch
as
however
the
action
which
is
based
on
this
collision
disturbs
the
unity
of
that
which
is
opposed
to
it
it
calls
into
being
by
its
antagonism
the
opposing
force
of
that
which
it
confronts
and
consequently
the
action
is
immediately
associated
with
the
reaction
with
this
analysis
of
the
forces
rendered
necessary
by
dramatic
action
we
have
at
length
arrived
at
the
notion
of
the
ideal
as
a
fully
defined
process
for
we
are
here
presented
with
two
distinct
spheres
of
interest
both
of
which
have
been
rent
as
it
were
from
the
harmony
they
originally
possessed
and
confront
each
other
in
conflict
such
by
the
contradiction
which
is
involved
in
them
make
a
resolution
of
the
discord
necessary
this
movement
regarded
as
a
homogeneous
whole
belongs
no
more
to
the
province
of
the
mere
situation
and
its
conflicts
we
are
carried
now
into
that
portion
of
our
inquiry
to
which
we
have
already
given
the
name
of
the
genuine
action
3
the
action
in
the
development
of
the
subject
under
consideration
the
action
immediately
follows
after
the
universal
worldcondition
and
the
particular
situation
in
considering
the
action
in
its
external
relation
to
that
portion
of
our
inquiry
we
have
just
concluded
it
will
be
well
to
bear
in
mind
the
result
we
arrived
at
that
it
presupposes
circumstances
which
necessitate
collisions
action
and
reaction
it
is
impossible
to
determine
at
what
point
in
the
circumstances
thus
presupposed
the
action
will
begin
for
that
which
in
one
aspect
will
appear
as
commencement
will
very
possibly
present
itself
in
another
as
the
result
of
earlier
developments
and
to
that
extent
will
postpone
the
real
startingpoint
and
in
like
manner
this
too
we
may
regard
as
a
fact
resulting
from
former
collisions
to
take
an
example
in
the
house
of
agamemnon
iphigenia
in
tauris
expiates
the
guilt
and
misfortune
of
her
family
the
commencement
here
of
this
deliverance
on
the
part
of
iphigenia
is
the
fact
that
diana
carries
her
to
tauris
this
circumstance
is
however
merely
the
result
of
earlier
stages
of
the
story
such
as
the
sacrifice
in
aulis
which
is
again
conditioned
by
the
injury
done
to
menelaus
in
the
rape
of
helen
by
paris
and
so
on
ever
backward
until
we
come
to
the
famous
egg
of
leda
in
the
same
way
the
events
which
are
the
subjectmatter
of
the
iphigenia
in
tauris
presuppose
the
murder
of
agamemnon
and
all
the
crimes
associated
with
the
house
of
tantalus
an
analysis
of
much
the
same
character
might
be
applied
to
the
theban
circle
of
mythos
if
an
action
is
to
be
represented
with
all
the
facts
that
condition
it
poetry
is
the
only
real
art
that
can
attempt
this
such
a
complete
exposition
of
historical
fact
has
already
become
as
a
certain
proverb
reminds
us
rather
a
wearisome
business
it
is
in
fact
more
within
the
province
of
simple
prose
and
in
contrast
with
such
completeness
poetry
will
rather
consider
its
true
function
to
be
that
of
taking
its
audience
at
once
into
the
heart
of
the
matter
there
is
a
further
important
reason
why
it
should
not
be
to
the
interest
of
art
to
make
its
commencement
from
that
point
where
we
find
the
action
under
consideration
is
in
the
first
instance
externally
conditioned
and
it
is
this
such
a
point
of
departure
is
after
all
only
related
to
the
process
regarded
as
natural
or
historical
fact323
the
association
of
the
action
with
this
commencement
merely
concerns
the
empirical
unity
of
its
appearance
it
may
however
in
itself
be
of
no
significance
at
all
to
the
real
content
of
the
action
this
external
unity
of
historical
sequence
remains
just
as
it
was
however
it
may
chance
that
one
particular
person
is
affected
by
the
involved
threads
of
a
varying
series
of
fact
no
doubt
the
entirety
of
the
facts
of
life
its
actions
and
fatalities
tends
to
make
the
individual
what
he
is
but
for
all
that
his
true
nature
the
real
core
of
his
thoughts
and
capacities
is
manifested
in
one
great
situation
and
action
independently
of
them
it
is
the
progress
of
these
which
reveals
to
us
really
what
a
character
is
made
of
a
character
which
previously
to
their
occurrence
had
been
known
merely
in
a
nominal
way
that
is
the
name
of
one
more
fact
among
the
external
facts
of
experience
we
must
therefore
not
look
for
the
commencement
of
the
action
in
that
empirical
source
of
it
we
must
rather
centre
the
attention
upon
those
circumstances
which
have
taken
a
hold
upon
the
particular
nature
with
which
we
are
dealing
and
created
or
satisfied
its
needs
we
must
in
fact
reveal
the
particular
collision
in
whose
conflict
and
resolution
the
action
in
question
consists
homer
for
example
in
the
iliad
makes
a
start
at
once
with
the
particular
fact
on
which
his
entire
epic
is
founded
that
is
to
say
with
the
wrath
of
achilles
he
tells
us
nothing
of
earlier
history
of
the
life
of
achilles
but
emphasizes
at
once
the
critical
collision
and
moreover
does
it
in
a
way
which
unfolds
a
background
of
the
greatest
interest
to
his
picture
the
representation
then
of
the
action
as
a
process
complete
in
itself
in
which
action
reaction
and
resolution
are
constituent
elements
is
above
all
the
function
of
the
poetic
art
all
the
other
arts
can
at
most
only
seize
upon
and
secure
in
their
presentation
one
moment
of
this
process
it
is
quite
true
that
if
we
direct
our
attention
to
that
aspect
of
the
medium
they
employ
which
is
richest
they
may
appear
to
have
an
advantage
over
poetry
in
painting
especially324
we
find
a
control
asserted
not
merely
over
the
entire
external
form
but
also
over
the
expression
of
external
demeanour
and
the
play
of
such
relatively
to
other
objects
grouped
around
it
such
a
means
of
expression
however
cannot
compare
as
an
interpreter
of
truth
with
human
speech
the
action
itself
is
the
clearest
means
of
unfolding
to
us
individual
character
whether
we
view
it
relatively
to
the
entire
emotional
life325
or
the
objects
of
mind
all
that
a
man
is
at
the
very
root
of
his
nature
is
first
revealed
to
us
through
his
acts
and
action
for
the
reason
that
it
is
an
expression
of
spirit
finds
its
ultimate
expression
as
such
most
clearly
and
concisely
in
speech
alone
when
we
speak
in
general
terms
of
human
action
we
are
apt
to
figure
to
ourselves
an
incalculable
variety
of
mode
for
art
however
the
sphere
of
action
suitable
to
artistic
representation
is
generally
speaking
limited
her
province
is
wholly
restricted
to
the
type
of
action
which
is
conformable
to
the
necessary
configuration
of
the
idea
there
are
three
points
of
essential
importance
necessary
to
grasp
in
connection
with
such
action
as
is
capable
of
artistic
representation
and
which
we
may
emphasize
as
follows
the
situation
and
the
resulting
conflict
is
that
which
generally
stimulates
it
the
active
movement
however
taken
by
itself
the
element
of
difference
that
is
to
say
of
the
ideal
in
its
activity
is
made
apparent
first
by
virtue
of
the
reaction
this
movement
may
be
resolved
into
the
following
component
features
first
we
have
the
universal326
forces
which
constitute
the
essential
content
and
object
for
the
sake
of
which
the
action
takes
place
secondly
we
have
the
realization327
of
these
forces
in
the
individuals
who
act
thirdly
the
two
aspects
above
mentioned
have
to
unite
themselves
in
that
which
in
default
of
any
better
generic
term
we
will
here
call
character
a
the
universal
forces
of
action
a
however
much
we
have
finally
arrived
in
our
consideration
of
the
action
at
a
point
where
the
definition
and
differentiation
of
the
ideal
is
of
the
first
importance
nevertheless
the
very
notion
of
art
renders
it
necessary
that
in
the
sphere
of
true
beauty
be
the
aspect
of
it
whatsoever
it
may
it
must
still
have
upon
it
the
stamp
of
the
ideal
it
cannot
that
is
to
say
maintain
itself
without
rationality
and
the
justification
it
implies
interests
of
an
ideal
character
must
inevitably
be
in
conflict
with
another
so
that
might
is
opposed
to
might
these
interests
are
in
fact
the
eternal
and
universal
forces
of
spiritual
existence
the
essential
cravings
of
the
human
heart
the
spontaneous
and
inevitable
objects
of
human
action
justifiable
and
rational
in
virtue
of
their
own
character
and
consequently
the
very
universal
powers
to
which
we
have
referred
they
are
indeed
not
the
absolute
divine
itself
but
rather
the
sons
of
the
one
absolute
idea328
and
consequently
dominant
and
valid
they
are
the
children
of
the
one
universal
truth
albeit
only
determinate
particular
moments
of
the
same
through
their
very
distinction
it
is
true
they
can
fall
into
contradiction
or
disunion
yet
despite
all
the
element
of
difference
contained
they
must
possess
the
original
essentiality
within
them
in
order
to
appear
as
the
determinate
ideal
such
are
the
supreme
motive
forces
of
art
they
are
the
eternal329
religious
and
ethical
modes
of
relationship
status
personal
character330
and
in
the
world
of
romance
before
everything
else
honour
and
love
in
the
particular
grade
of
their
significance
these
powers
differ
but
all
are
essentially
the
product
of
reason
at
the
same
time
it
is
these
powers
in
the
human
heart
and
mind
which
man
by
virtue
of
his
humanity
is
bound
to
recognize
to
give
free
play
to
and
to
actualize
at
the
same
time
they
ought
not
directly
to
appear
as
rights
in
positive
legislation
for
to
take
one
reason
the
form
of
positive
legislation
as
we
have
seen
is
already
in
partial
conflict
with
the
notion
and
content
of
the
ideal
furthermore
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
content
of
positive
rights
may
contribute
to
that
which
is
essentially
unjust
albeit
entirely
clothed
in
the
attributes
of
law
the
relations
we
have
above
referred
to
however
are
not
merely
the
supreme
stable
embodiment
of
the
external
world331
but
the
essentially
substantive
powers
which
for
the
very
reason
that
they
contain
in
themselves
the
actual
content
of
human
existence
continue
to
be
the
stimulating
source
of
its
activity
and
ultimately
all
that
ever
carried
it
forward
to
perfection
of
this
kind
are
the
interests
and
objects
which
contend
against
each
other
in
the
antigone
of
sophocles
creon
the

as
ruler
of

decree
couched
in
the
severest
terms
forbade
the
right
of
burial
to
the
son
of
dipus
who
had
proved
himself
an
enemy
of
his
country
by
bringing
an
army
against
thebes
this
proclamation
was
so
far
justifiable
that
it
expressed
care
for
the
weal
of
the
entire
city
antigone
however
is
animated
by
an
ethical
principle
of
equal
authority
in
other
words
by
her
love
for
her
brother
whom
she
finds
it
impossible
to
leave
unburied
the
prey
of
carrion
birds
to
leave
such
a
duty
unfulfilled
would
be
in
direct
opposition
to
the
sacred
instincts
of
her
personal
relationship
she
consequently
violates
the
decree
of
creon

collisions
of
the
type
with
which
we
are
now
dealing
may
be
introduced
in
every
possible
way
the
necessity
of
the
reaction
however
must
not
be
occasioned
by
means
of
anything
out
of
place
or
at
cross
purposes332
with
the
main
action
but
through
that
which
is
in
itself
reasonable
and
justifiable
for
example
in
the
wellknown
german
poem
of
hartmann
von
der
aue
the
poor
henry
the
collision
is
repulsive
the
hero
in
this
poem
is
visited
by
a
fatality
that
is
to
say
an
incurable
disease
he
turns
for
assistance
to
the
monks
of
salermo
they
state
as
the
condition
of
his
cure
that
a
human
being
must
willingly
surrender
his
or
her
life
on
the
ground
that
the
necessary
salve
can
alone
be
forthcoming
from
a
human
heart
a
poor
maiden
who
is
in
love
with
the
knight
offers
freely
her
own
life
and
accompanies
him
into
italy
this
is
pure
barbarism
and
the
silent
love
and
pathetic
devotion
of
the
maiden
are
unable
consequently
to
produce
their
full
effect
it
is
true
that
we
find
the
injustice
of
human
sacrifice
presented
us
by
the
ancients
as
the
ground
of
the
collision
the
famous
example
is
that
of
the
story
of
iphigenia
who
is
first
offered
as
such
a
sacrifice
and
afterwards
is
on
the
point
of
offering
up
her
brother
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
these
examples
the
conflict
is
in
close
connection
with
other
relations
which
are
in
themselves
justifiable
secondly
the
artistic
principle
is
really
satisfied
as
we
have
already
observed
by
the
fact
that
both
iphigenia
and
orestes
are
finally
delivered
and
the
power
of
a
collision
which
is
opposed
to
our
notion
of
right
is
thus
destroyed
and
indeed
this
is
also
the
case
in
the
above
mentioned
poem
of
hartmann
in
so
far
as
we
may
acknowledge
the
dnouement
offered
us
in
which
on
henry
refusing
to
accept
the
sacrifice
god
releases
him
from
his
malady
and
the
maiden
is
rewarded
for
her
true
love333
in
apparent
association
with
the
positive
powers
we
have
enumerated
must
be
added
others
set
over
against
them
that
is
to
say
the
forces
of
that
which
is
negative
and
bad
evil
in
short
that
which
is
purely
negative
however
ought
not
to
be
taken
in
the
ideal
representation
of
an
action
as
the
essential
groundmotive
for
the
necessary
reaction
the
reality
of
the
purely
negative
case
it
is
true
corresponds
to
the
negative
and
its
appropriate
character
but
if
the
implied334
notion
and
object
is
already
in
itself
rendered
nugatory
it
is
even
less
possible
that
the
ugliness
which
is
exposed
in
the
inward
life
should
manifest
any
genuine
beauty
upon
its
external
reality
the
sophistry
of
passion
can
indeed
by
means
of
the
capacity
strength
and
energy
of
a
character
make
the
attempt
to
graft
positive
characteristics
upon
the
negative
but
we
only
obtain
thereby
the
vision
of
a
whitewashed
grave
for
that
which
is
purely
negative
is
generally
flat
and
stale
and
leaves
us
consequently
either
void
or
drives
us
back
whether
it
be
used
as
the
motive
force
of
an
action
or
merely
as
a
means
to
promote
a
reaction
in
another
the
horrible
unfortunate
the
harshness
of
dominion
and
the
obduracy
of
superior
power
may
form
part
of
the
content
and
burden
of
the
imagination
when
such
characteristics
are
exalted
and
carried
by
the
abundant
greatness
of
a
particular
character
or
object
evil
however
taken
simply
for
what
it
is
envy
cowardice
and
meanness
is
merely
repulsive
the
devil
if
we
take
him
for
what
he
really
ought
to
be
is
consequently
a
bad
subject
or
rather
a
figure
for
which
art
has
no
uses
at
all
he
is
just
a
falsehood
and
nothing
more
and
consequently
an
extremely
prosaic
personality
in
the
same
way
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
furies
of
hate
and
many
other
allegorical
figures
of
later
times
are
potencies
of
a
kind
but
they
are
without
affirmative
subsistency
and
holdfastness335
unfavourable
to
ideal
representation
although
in
this
respect
a
wide
margin
of
difference
is
permissible
in
the
several
arts
respectively
and
in
the
particular
mode
in
which
they
may
immediately
visualize
such
objects
evil
is
to
express
it
in
most
general
terms
essentially
cold
and
devoid
of
content
because
as
such
it
is
merely
the
source
of
negation
discord
and
misfortune
all
art
however
which
is
true
to
its
essential
notion
should
reflect
on
us
the
vision
of
a
harmony
meanness
above
all
is
despicable
for
it
is
a
quality
which
arises
from
the
envy
and
hatred
of
all
that
is
noble
and
does
not
shrink
from
distorting
even
a
power
that
is
essentially
based
upon
the
good
into
a
means
conformable
to
its
own
perverse
and
shameless
passion
the
great
poets
and
artists
of
the
classical
world
have
in
consequence
never
presented
us
with
the
vision
of
absolute
evil
and
depravity
shakespeare
on
the
contrary
in
his
tragedy
of
king
lear
unfolds
before
us
the
spectacle
of
wickedness
in
all
its
horrors
the
old
lear
divides
his
kingdom
among
his
daughters
and
while
doing
so
is
foolish
enough
to
believe
in
their
false
and
flattering
speeches
and
to
misinterpret
the
silent
and
faithful
cordelia
there
is
already
folly
and
madness
in
this
and
it
is
followed
by
the
most
outrageous
ingratitude
and
worthlessness
of
the
elder
daughters
and
their
husbands
to
the
point
of
absolute
craze
as
an
antithesis
of
this
the
heroes
of
the
french
school
of
tragedy
are
stretched
and
puffed
out
with
every
sort
of
grandiose
and
sublime
motive
and
make
a
great
parade
of
their
honour
and
nobility
and
yet
despite
of
it
all
destroy
the
very
meaning
of
such
motives
by
the
mere
fact
of
what
they
really
are
and
accomplish
but
it
is
in
modern
times
more
especially
that
we
find
this
unstable
dissolution
of
everything
spiritual336
which
forces
its
way
through
every
dissonance
however
repulsive
become
quite

la
mode
moreover
it
has
even
given
us
what
we
may
describe
as
the
humour
of
the
abominable
thing
a
kind
of
burlesque
simulation
of
irony
an
atmosphere
in
which
a
theodor
hoffmann
for
example
has
found
himself
so
much
at
home

we
may
conclude
then
that
it
is
the
essentially
positive
and
substantive
powers
in
the
spiritual
world
which
supply
the
real
content
of
the
ideal
action
these
sources
of
energy
however
in
their
artistic
embodiment
must
not
appear
in
their
inherent
universality
albeit
within
the
reality
of
the
action
they
are
essential
phases
of
the
idea
rather
they
must
receive
the
form
of
independent
individuals
if
this
were
not
so
they
would
remain
as
merely
the
universals
of
thought
or
abstract
conceptions
which
do
not
properly
fall
within
the
province
of
art
though
in
their
origin
they
should
be
held
as
intact
as
it
is
possible
to
hold
them
from
mere
caprices
of
the
fancy
it
is
equally
necessary
that
in
their
development
they
should
acquire
determinacy
no
less
than
selfconsistency337
and
in
this
way
appear
as
essentially
particularized
such
definition
as
they
possess
ought
not
to
be
carried
to
the
point
of
the
particularity
of
external
objects
nor
should
their
concentration
be
carried
to
that
of
the
subjective
selfconsciousness338
otherwise
the
individuality
of
those
universal
powers
is
necessarily
involved
in
all
the
developments
of
finite
existence
in
this
respect
we
may
say
then
that
the
determinacy
of
their
individuality
is
not
to
be
taken
too
seriously
the
gods
of
the
greek
pantheon
are
the
most
conspicuous
example
of
this
manifestation
and
sway
of
the
universal
forces
we
have
just
discussed
in
their
selfsubsistent
form
however
they
may
be
brought
before
us
their
blessedness
and
cheerfulness
remains
unaffected
regarded
separately
as
particular
gods
no
doubt
they
engage
in
conflict
but
in
all
their
battles
we
shall
ultimately
find
they
are
not
really
serious
in
the
sense
that
they
concentrate
themselves
on
any
definite
object
with
the
entire
consequential
energy
of
their
character
and
passion
fully
prepared
to
stake
their
existence
upon
the
result
they
engage
in
this
affair
or
that
wherever
it
may
take
place
identify
particular
interests
in
concrete
examples
with
their
own
they
are
however
equally
ready
to
leave
the
matter
at
any
point
and
wing
their
way
back
happily
to
olympus
such
is
the
view
we
get
of
the
gods
when
they
engage
in
warfare
on
the
pages
of
homer
the
determinacy
of
their
characterization
is
capable
of
conflict
but
they
remain
for
all
that
the
purely
universal
determinations
which
at
bottom
they
are
a
battle
begins
to
rage
heroes
advance
singly
one
against
another
then
we
lose
sight
of
individuals
altogether
in
the
universal
storm
and
crush
it
is
no
longer
the
specific
qualities
of
individuals
which
are
now
set
in
relief
against
each
otherit
is
the
universal
rush
of
the
fight
the
daemon
of
war
loosed
and
roaring
and
now
it
is
that
the
universal
powers
the
gods
themselves
step
forth
on
the
scene
of
battle
from
such
a
temporary
display
of
the
contrasts
of
their
characterization
they
ever
withdraw
themselves
into
the
solitude
of
their
selfsubsistency
and
repose
for
though
the
individuality
of
their
form
carries
them
perforce
into
the
region
of
time
and
contingency
nevertheless
inasmuch
as
the
universal
they
claim
as
gods
is
that
which
ultimately
must
prevail
the
individual
characteristic
shrinks
away
into
the
determination
of
external
form
only
they
are
unable
in
their
personality
to
penetrate
the
true
arcana
of
conscious
spirit339
their
physical
definition
is
in
fact
either
more
or
less
only
the
accommodating
form
of
their
divinity
but
this
selfsubsistency
and
careless
repose
is
precisely
that
which
gives
to
them
their
plastic
individuality
and
relieves
them
of
any
anxiety
and
constraint340
in
relation
to
earthly
objects
and
events341
for
this
reason
we
find
in
the
gods
of
homer
no
final
result
when
actively
occupied
with
the
concrete
facts
of
human
life
although
such
activity
is
displayed
for
us
in
many
and
diverse
directions
the
material
and
interest
of
human
events
which
happen
in
time
is
that
which
gives
them
something
to
do
and
nothing
more
and
in
like
manner
we
may
remark
other
peculiar
characteristics
attached
to
the
greek
gods
which
we
can
only
regard
as
essentially
unrelated
to
the
general
notion
of
divinity
which
each
god
respectively
connotes
mercury
is
for
example
the
slayer
of
argus
apollo
that
of
the
hydra
of
the
love
affairs
of
zeus
we
have
countless
tales
and
among
other
things
he
hangs
his
wife
on
an
anvil
these
and
many
other
stories
like
them
are
merely
supplementary
additions
which
attach
to
the
gods
in
their
aspect
of
natural
forces
by
virtue
of
symbol
and
allegory
the
origin
of
which
we
propose
to
discuss
more
fully
later
on
in
modern
art
we
shall
it
is
true
find
certain
indications
which
point
to
a
conception
of
definite
and
at
the
same
time
universal
powers
these
are
however
for
the
most
part
simply
cold
and
frostlike
allegories
of
hate
envy
hope
love
faithfulness
that
is
to
say
generally
of
virtues
and
vices
in
the
actual
truth
of
which
we
can
retain
no
belief
for
with
us
moderns
it
is
the
concrete
subjectivity
alone
for
which
we
in
the
representations
of
art
feel
that
profounder
interest
wherein
abstractions
such
as
these
do
not
appear
in
their
isolation
but
are
made
to
appear
merely
as
phases
or
aspects
of
human
character
whether
we
regard
it
in
its
particularity
or
as
a
concrete
whole
in
much
the
same
way
the
angels
possess
no
essential
universality
and
selfsubsistency
such
as
characterize
mars
venus
and
apollo
or
even
oceanus
and
helios
they
are
it
is
true
objects
of
imaginative
conception
but
their
specific
character
is
that
of
vassals
of
the
one
divine
and
essential
substance
which
is
not
in
this
case
broken
up
into
selfsubsistent
individualities
as
we
find
it
in
the
greek
pantheon
for
this
reason
we
have
here
no
imaginative
vision
of
many
objective
powers
dwelling
in
a
state
of
tranquillity
which
may
be
represented
as
essentially
divine
personalities
we
find
on
the
contrary
the
essential
content
of
such
either
as
subsisting
in
the
godhead
or
realized
in
a
mode
which
is
both
particular
and
subjective
in
wholly
human
characters
and
actions
nevertheless
it
was
precisely
in
the
conception342
of
selfsubsistency
and
individualization
that
the
ideal
representation
of
the
gods
originated
b
the
individuals
in
the
action
in
the
cases
we
have
just
discussed
of
the
ideal
gods
it
is
not
a
difficult
matter
for
art
to
secure
the
ideality
she
requires
but
in
approaching
the
concrete
action
ideal
representation
is
confronted
with
a
real
difficulty
for
though
it
is
here
that
the
gods
and
in
general
terms
the
universal
powers
may
be
identified
with
a
principle
which
stimulates
and
compels
activity
we
are
not
therefore
on
the
plane
of
reality
entitled
to
find
in
them
the
source
of
genuine
individual
action
action
is
rather
essentially
the
manifestation
of
human
life
consequently
there
are
in
this
connection
two
distinct
aspects
of
the
problem
to
be
considered
on
the
one
hand
we
have
these
universal
forces
in
their
selfsubsistent
repose
and
for
that
reason
more
abstract
substantiality
on
the
other
there
is
the
individuality
of
men
in
which
we
must
seek
the
final
spring
and
determinating
impulse
to
action
no
less
than
its
actual
accomplishment
it
is
of
course
only
the
simple
truth
that
these
eternally
dominant
powers
are
immanent
in
the
identical
nature
of
mankind
constituting
in
fact
the
substantive
core
of
its
character
but
in
so
far
as
they
are
comprehended
in
their
divine
nature
themselves
as
individuals343
and
thereby
in
an
exclusive
way
their
relation
to
the
subject
of
human
consciousness
must
remain
an
external
one
and
this
fact
enables
us
to
see
the
essential
difficulty
we
noticed
above
there
is
in
truth
a
contradiction
immediately
involved
in
this
relation
between
the
gods
and
men
it
is
quite
true
that
the
content
of
the
gods
is
that
which
belongs
to
humanity
and
announces
itself
as
his
passion
resolve
and
will
it
is
however
equally
true
that
the
gods
must
not
only
be
assumed
to
be
and
comprehended
as
independent
from
man
individually
considered
in
their
actual
existence
but
furthermore
as
the
forces
at
the
root
of
all
his
activity
and
determination
and
this
too
in
such
a
way
that
we
are
forced
to
consider
the
same
determinations
at
one
time
as
personified
in
the
selfsubsistent
and
divine
personality
and
at
another
that
which
appears
most
essentially
to
belong
to
the
human
heart
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
free
selfsubsistency
of
the
gods
no
less
than
the
freedom
of
human
individuals
in
their
activity
is
seriously
compromised
if
to
the
detriment
of
human
independence
which
we
have
already
stated
to
be
of
most
essential
importance
to
the
ideal
of
art
we
ascribe
an
exclusive
power
of
command
to
the
gods
and
we
may
observe
this
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
difficulty
which
confronts
us
in
the
form
of
the
religious
conceptions
of
christianity
it
is
stated
in
terms
that
the
spirit
of
god
leads
up
to
god
taken
strictly
such
a
phrase
can
only
imply
that
the
inward
life
of
man
is
regarded
as
a
purely
passive
ground
upon
which
the
spirit
of
god
labours
in
such
a
conception
the
human
will
disappears
as
a
free
will
and
at
the
same
time
the
divine
purpose
which
motives
the
in
working
above
mentioned
can
only
appear
to
man
as
a
kind
of
fate
under
which
he
fails
to
come
by
his
own
true
personality344

if
however
this
question
of
mutual
relation345
is
so
understood
that
man
in
his
action
is
conceived
as
standing
in
a
purely
external
opposition
to
god
here
posited
as
eternal
substance
the
relation
of
both
is
one
of
pure
matter
of
fact346
god
gives
a
command
and
man
is
obliged
to
hearken
even
great
poets
have
found
themselves
unable
to
dispense
with
this
conception
of
external
opposition
between
gods
and
men
in
the
philoctetes
of
sophocles
for
example
we
find
that
philoctetes
after
he
has
confounded
the
deceit
of
odysseus
persists
in
his
determination
not
to
return
to
the
grecian
camp
until
heracles
appears
at
length
as
deus
ex
machina
and
orders
him
to
yield
to
the
entreaty
of
neoptolimus
the
content
of
this
apparition
is
no
doubt
sufficiently
motived
and
answers
to
our
own
expectation
the
catastrophe
itself
however
is
for
all
that
not
rightly
homogeneous
but
rather
outside
the
action
and
in
his
noblest
tragedies
sophocles
makes
no
such
use
of
this
kind
of
representation
according
to
which
if
we
but
carry
it
one
step
further
the
gods
are
reduced
to
lifeless
machines
and
individual
men
simply
to
the
instruments
of
a
foreign
caprice
in
a
similar
way
we
constantly
in
epic
poetry
meet
with
the
active
intervention
of
the
gods
represented
in
a
mode
which
is
external
to
human
freedom
hermes
for
example
conducts
priam
to
achilles
apollo
gives
patroclus
the
blow
between
the
shoulders
which
ends
his
life
we
also
frequently
find
mythological
traits
treated
in
such
a
way
that
they
appear
as
wholly
external
to
the
actual
lives
of
the
individuals
thus
affected
achilles
for
example
is
dipped
by
his
mother
in
the
styx
and
thereby
rendered
invulnerable
and
invincible
to
the
one
point
of
his
heels
if
we
reflect
on
this
rationally
it
is
obvious
that
all
real
bravery
disappears
and
all
that
is
heroic
in
the
character
of
achilles
is
converted
from
a
real
trait
of
his
essential
manhood
to
a
purely
physical
advantage
such
a
mode
of
representation
is
however
far
more
permissible
to
the
epic
than
it
is
to
the
dramatic
type
of
poetry
for
the
good
reason
that
in
the
epic
that
aspect
of
spiritual
life
which
is
directly
concerned
with
the
intention
implied
in
the
execution
of
objects
falls
into
the
background
and
a
larger
field
is
in
general
offered
for
the
play
of
external
characteristics
such
a
criticism
of
the
prosaic
understanding
as
the
one
above
which
charges
a
poet
with
the
absurdity
that
his
heroes
are
no
heroes
at
all
should
only
be
advanced
with
the
greatest
caution
for
it
is
partly
in
such
traits
as
will
appear
shortly
that
the
poetical
relation
between
gods
and
men
is
preserved
it
is
another
matter
and
we
have
nothing
left
us
but
prose
when
in
addition
the
powers
which
are
posited
as
substantive
individuals
are
mere
empty
shadows
the
creations
of
the
caprice
of
fancy
and
the
arbitrariness
of
a
false
originality
they
are
then
for
the
most
part
only
the
adjuncts
of
superstition
or
imbecility

the
truly
poetic
relation
of
ideality
consists
then
in
the
identity
of
gods
and
men
and
this
must
assert
itself
even
though
the
universal
powers
are
presented
as
independent
and
free
from
the
particularity
of
human
beings
and
passions
in
other
words
all
that
we
attribute
to
the
gods
must
at
the
same
time
establish
itself
as
that
which
is
essentially
cognate
with
the
spiritual
life
of
particular
men
in
this
sense
that
while
the
dominating
powers
appear
as
essentially
personified
yet
at
the
same
time
all
that
is
thus
posited
in
an
external
relation
to
man
is
none
the
less
clearly
that
which
is
immanent
in
his
own
spirit
and
character
the
true
function
of
the
artist
is
therefore
to
introduce
a
mediating
link
between
the
difference
involved
in
these
two
aspects
to
bind
them
in
short
by
a
finely
conceived
thread
of
relation
which
while
clearly
emphasizing
their
springs
in
the
spiritual
life
of
man
shall
make
no
less
visible
the
universal
and
essential
element
which
is
therein
implied
and
present
such
to
the
imagination
in
individual
form
the
emotional
life
of
man
must
reveal
itself
in
the
gods
who
in
fact
are
the
selfsubsistent
and
universal
embodiments
of
that
which
is
active
and
dominant
in
his
own
spiritual
experience
then
alone
are
the
gods
at
the
same
time
gods
in
cognate
relation
with
his
own
heart
and
emotions
when
for
example
we
are
told
by
the
ancients
that
venus
or
amor
has
put
a
constraint
upon
the
heart
no
doubt
in
the
first
place
these
divinities
are
apprehended
as
external
powers
but
human
love
is
equally
a
stimulus
and
a
passion
which
is
implanted
in
the
heart
and
is
part
of
that
it
independently
contains
in
much
the
same
sense
is
the
frequent
reference
to
the
eumenides
we
have
to
picture
in
the
first
instance
no
doubt
these
avenging
maidens
as
furies
who
pursue
the
transgressor
in
an
external
form
but
this
pursuit
is
but
another
aspect
of
the
fury
which
drives
through
the
soul
of
the
perpetrator
of
crime
and
sophocles
in
the
dipus
colonus
i
1434
actually
refers
to
them
in
this
sense
of
inward
spiritual
forces
as
the
eumenides
of
dipus
himself
that
is
to
say
who
signify
the
fathers
curse
as
the
result
of
the
stress
of
emotion
caused
by
the
conduct
of
his
sons
we
have
then
and
equally
have
not
reason
on
our
side
whether
we
identify
the
gods
with
powers
external
to
man
or
find
in
them
that
which
belongs
exclusively
to
his
spiritual
life
they
are
in
fact
both
in
homer
for
example
the
activity
of
gods
and
men
is
a
constantly
involved
skein347
the
gods
appear
to
accomplish
what
is
foreign
to
human
activity
and
yet
for
all
that
execute
only
that
which
is
in
vital
coordination
with
his
own
emotional
life
in
the
iliad
for
example
when
achilles
in
the
stress
of
controversy
is
about
to
raise
his
sword
against
agamemnon
athene
steps
forth
behind
him
and
takes
hold
of
his
head
of
flaxen
hair
visible
only
to
himself
hero
who
is
equally
anxious
over
achilles
and
agamemnon
sends
for
them
from
olympus
and
their
admission
there
appears
to
be
wholly
independent
of
the
desire
of
achilles
on
the
other
hand
we
have
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
sudden
appearance
of
athene
the
wisdom
which
puts
constraint
upon
the
heros
wrath
is
simply
a
reflection
of
internal
conflict
that
the
entire
description
but
states
in
imaginative
form
what
was
experienced
in
the
heart
of
our
hero
in
fact
homer
himself
points
this
out
a
few
verses
previously
iliad
i
v
190
when
he
relates
about
the
debate
that
took
place
in
his
heart
in
the
following
terms



















348
this
inward
breaking
up
of
anger
into
a
divided
self
this
constraint
for
it
is
in
opposition
to
the
anger
and
achilles
appears
at
first
to
be
wholly
filled
with
wrath
the
epic
poet
has
a
perfect
right
to
represent
at
the
same
time
as
an
external
event
in
a
similar
case
in
the
odyssey
we
find
minerva
acting
the
part
of
escort
for
telemachus
this
attendance
is
rather
more
difficult
to
grasp
as
a
personal
experience
of
the
emotional
life
of
telemachus
although
we
can
readily
fix
on
certain
points
of
contact
between
the
external
image
and
the
emotion
experienced
and
this
it
is
we
may
generally
say
which
constitutes
the
cheerful
buoyancy
of
the
homeric
gods
and
the
irony
implied
in
the
honour
paid
to
them
their
selfconsistency
and
seriousness
are
characteristics
which
tend
to
dissolve
like
a
cloud
precisely
to
the
extent
that
they
unfold
themselves
as
the
very
powers
which
are
native
to
mans
emotional
life
and
thereby
in
their
manifestation
leave
humanity
alone
with
its
own
possessions
however
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
so
far
abroad

a
complete
example
of
the
conversion
of
a
purely
mechanical
conception
of
divine
activity
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
subjective
consciousness
the
sphere
that
is
of
freedom
and
ethical
beauty
in
his
iphigenia
in
tauris
goethe
has
in
this
connection
carried
the
process
through
with
a
beauty
that
we
cannot
sufficiently
admire
in
the
drama
of
euripides
orestes
in
complicity
with
iphigenia

simply
an
act
of
stealing

on
the

and
orders
their
pursuit
and
the
recovery
of
the

in
very
prosaic
fashion
athene
appears
and
orders
thoas
to
stay
his
hand
on
the
ground
that
she
has
independently
commended
orestes
to
the
charge
of
poseidon
and
he
in
deference
to
her
wishes
has
already
carried
orestes
far
over
seas
thoas
submits
to
her
advice
and
replies
to
it
in
the
following
terms

on

a
fool
for
how
could
it
be
right
and
fit
to
contend
with
the
mighty
gods
in
this
relation
we
can
only
see
the
bare
external
command
of
athene
on
the
one
side
and
an
equally
futile
submission
of
thoas

the
other

treatment
of
the

hear
the
wise
voice
of

hearts
humane
when
atreus
of

still
failed
to

with
the
gentlest
purest
trust
nay
all
thus
hear
beneath
whatever
sky
their
birth
was
laid
all

must
hear
for
whom
the
springs
of
life
flow
without
let
and
purely
through
the
soul
then
it
is
she
makes
the
final
call
upon
her
greatness
of
soul
and
the
tenderness
of
her
faith
at
its
highest
point
of
effort
her
entreaty
touches
then
masters
and
wrings
from
him
in
a
way
that
must
appeal
to
every
heart
the
permission
to
return
to
her
own
this
alone
is
necessary
she
has
no
need
of
the
statue
of
the
goddess
she
can
depart
on
her
journey
without
deceit
or
betrayal
of
trust
and
it
is
with
the
finest
sense
of
beauty
that
goethe
refers
here
to
the
oracular
word
of
the
god
bring
but
to
greece
again
the
sister
who
all
loth
at
heart
in
holy
temple
bides
on
shores
of
tauris
and
the
curse
is
gone
the
very
human
reconciliation
disclosed
in
these
words
is
clearly
that
the
pure
and
holy
iphigenia
the
sister
is
in
fact
the
divine
personification
and
the
protectress
of
the
house
noble
and
beautiful
i
wot
in
sooth
all
that
the
goddess
counselled
seemed
to
me
exclaims
orestes
to
thoas
and
iphigenia
like
to
a
holy
picture
the
fate
unalterable
which
walled
our
town
by
one
mysterious
word
one
word
divine
is
banished
now
that
city
takes
thee
back
who
art
the
true
protectress
of
our
home
reserve
thyself
in
holy
quietness
a
blessing
to
thy
brother
and
thine
own
it
seemed
that
all
deliverance
on
earth
had
passed
away
and
all
comes
back
with
thee
in
the
spirit
of
these
healing
words
of
reconciliation
iphigenia
has
already
revealed
herself
to
orestes
by
virtue
of
the
purity
and
ethical
beauty
of
her
inner
life
it
is
true
that
her
discernment
drives
him
half
mad
who
in
the
convulsion
of
his
spirit
has
lost
all
faith
in
peace
but
the
pure
love
of
the
sister
does
not
fail
to
heal
him
from
every
pang
with
which
he
is
tortured
by
the
furies
of
his
soul
within
thine
arms
the
evil
clawed
me
with
its
direst
clutch
for
the
last
time
and
to
the
very
marrow
i
shuddered
horribly
and
then
it
vanished
een
as
a
serpent
to
its
lair
anew
and
all
through
thee
the
days
breadth
i
enjoy
here
as
elsewhere
throughout
it
we
can
hardly
emphasize
sufficiently
our
admiration
for
the
profound
beauty
of
this
poem
the
material
which
has
the
impress
of
christianity
upon
it
is
more
open
to
criticism
than
that
which
was
the
subjectmatter
of
antique
art
in
the
sacred
legends
and
generally
speaking
where
the
religious
conceptions
of
christendom
prevail
no
doubt
we
may
find
the
appearance
of
christ
the
virgin
mary
and
other
saints
the
subject
of
universal
belief
but
along
with
them
the
imagination
has
clothed
itself
with
fanciful
aberrations
in
every
direction
so
that
witches
ghosts
and
every
sort
of
spectral
apparition
are
yet
more
conspicuous
objects
in
the
face
of
such
conceptions
so
far
at
least
as
they
appear
foreign
powers
to
our
human
nature
and
man
submits
himself
unreservedly
to
the
charm
seduction
and
influence
of
their
illusions
artistic
representation
is
wholly
given
up
to
every
kind
of
folly
and
caprice
of
mere
contingency
it
is
of
unique
importance
that
in
the
treatment
of
such
material
the
artist
take
care
that
the
freedom
and
independence
of
judgment
are
in
no
way
impaired
shakespeare
has
shown
us
how
to
do
this
in
most
noble
fashion
the
witches
in
macbeth
for
example
appear
as
external
powers
who
foretell
for
macbeth
his
future
destiny
what
they
do
foretell
however
is
precisely
that
which
is
his
own
most
secret
wish
which
is
reflected
back
on
him
and
declared
in
this
merely
in
appearance
external
form349
with
a
still
closer
regard
to
beauty
yet
profounder
insight
is
the
ghost
in
hamlet
treated
as
the
purely
objective
embodiment
of
hamlets
own
intuitions
we
find
hamlet
in
the
first
instance
overpowered
with
a
vague
feeling
that
something
horrible
has
taken
place
his
fathers
ghost
then
appears
and
gives
definite
form
to
these
awful
premonitions
we
naturally
expect
that
hamlet
after
receiving
the
facts
set
forth
in
his
fathers
warning
will
at
once
proceed
with
energy
and
bring
the
murderer
to
book
a
revenge
which
appears
to
have
ample
excuse
but
he
delays
and
delays
critics
have
made
this
inactivity
a
matter
of
reproach
to
shakespeare
blamed
him
in
fact
as
though
for
this
reason
the
play
to
some
extent
never
gets
properly
off
but
we
must
remember
hamlet
is
not
a
strongly
practical
nature
rather
a
finely
strung
one
with
emotions
held
in
persistent
reserve
a
nature
which
finds
it
difficult
to
tear
itself
from
its
internal
harmony
melancholy
too
prone
to
subtleties
hypochondriacal
with
emotions
deeply
rooted
for
this
reason
it
is
obvious
that
he
is
prima
facie
indisposed
to
prompt
action
and
this
is
fundamentally
goethes
conception
of
him
when
he
tells
us
that
what
shakespeare
sought
to
represent
was
the
imposition
of
some
supreme
action
on
a
soul
whose
growth
was
unadapted
to
its
execution
he
in
fact
interprets
the
entire
drama
relatively
to
this
conception
of
hamlet
we
have
here
he
maintains
an
oak
tree
planted
in
an
exquisite
vase
which
ought
really
only
to
contain
and
shelter
the
fair
flowers
the
roots
spread
the
vase
is
shattered
but
it
should
be
noticed
that
shakespeare
when
referring
to
the
apparition
of
the
ghost
contributes
a
far
profounder
trait
of
character
in
explanation
of
this
debated
point
hamlet
delays
because
he
does
not
right
off
wholly
believe
in
the
ghost
the
spirit
that
i
have
seen
may
be
a
devil
and
the
devil
hath
power
to
assume
a
pleasing
shape
yea
and
perhaps
out
of
my
weakness
and
my
melancholy
as
he
is
very
potent
with
such
spirits
abuses
me
to
damn
me
ill
have
grounds
more
relative
than
this
the
plays
the
thing
wherein
ill
catch
the
conscience
of
the
king
in
this
passage
it
is
obvious
that
the
apparition
as
such
does
not
leave
hamlet
merely
devoid
of
all
stability350
but
that
he
entertains
a
reasonable
doubt
and
is
determined
to
make
his
conviction
a
certainty
by
his
own
experiments
before
he
proceeds
to
act
upon
it

as
a
summary
description
of
these
universal
powers
which
appear
not
merely
in
their
external
independence
but
are
the
vital
and
moving
forces
in
the
human
heart
and
all
that
is
implied
in
its
most
intimate
life
we
may
borrow
an
expression
in
use
among
the
ancients
that
is
to
say
pathos

to
translate
this
word
adequately
is
not
easy
passion
almost
always
implies
as
its
concomitant
an
element
of
meanness
or
baseness
we
contend
in
ordinary
parlance
that
a
man
should
not
surrender
himself
to
his
passions
it
must
therefore
be
understood
that
we
use
the
expression
pathos
in
a
nobler
and
more
universal
sense
than
this
without
the
slightest
implication
of
anything
blameworthy
or
egotistic
the
devoted
love
of
the
sister
antigone
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
pathos
in
the
full
significance
of
the
greek
use
of
the
term
pathos
in
this
sense
is
a
power
of
the
emotional
life
which
completely
justifies
itself
an
essential
part
of
the
content
of
rationality
and
the
free
will
orestes
for
example
kills
his
mother
not
so
much
on
account
of
any
force
of
his
emotional
life
which
we
strictly
can
call
passion
rather
it
is
a
pathos
in
itself
fully
considered
upon
and
essentially
sane
which
carries
him
on
to
the
awful
deed
thus
understood
we
may
add
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
the
gods
possess
pathos
they
are
merely
the
universal
content
of
that
which
is
the
stimulating
energy
in
the
resolves
and
actions
of
human
individuality
the
gods
as
such
continue
in
their
repose
and
freedom
from
passion
and
however
much
they
may
quarrel
or
contend
among
themselves
there
is
nothing
really
serious
in
it
all
or
their
strife
possessed
merely
a
symbolical
significance
in
the
view
we
may
take
of
it
as
a
universal
war
of
the
gods
we
must
therefore
strictly
limit
pathos
to
the
actions
of
mankind
and
conceive
thereunder
the
essential
or
rational
content
which
is
present
in
the
human
consciousness
identical
with
itself
and
throughout
suffuses
the
emotional
life

we
may
say
then
that
pathos
constitutes
the
true
mediating
link351
the
veritable
domain
of
art
the
representation
of
it
is
the
most
truly
effective
part
of
a
work
of
art
as
it
is
its
influence
upon
those
who
look
at
it
pathos
sets
a
string
in
motion
which
vibrates
through
every
human
heart
every
one
must
know
the
type
of
worth
and
reason
which
underlies
the
content
of
a
genuine
example
of
pathos
must
recognize
it
at
once
when
he
sees
it
and
the
cause
of
this
is
that
pathos
moves
us
because
it
is
that
which
is
essentially
the
vital
force
of
our
human
existence
and
it
equally
follows
that
that
which
is
wholly
external
the
natural
environment
and
particular
scene
in
its
active
support
of
the
effect
of
pathos
need
only
be
treated
quite
subordinately
nature
must
in
consequence
be
drawn
upon
as
a
fact
essentially
symbolical
and
suffer
the
pathos
to
reecho
from
her
walls
which
is
the
most
real
subjectmatter
of
artistic
representation
landscape
is
for
example
a
type
or
genre
of
painting
of
less
importance
than
historical
painting
but
even
there
we
find
that
the
school
of
landscape
most
independent
should
not
be
without
a
general
harmonic
relation
to
human
feeling
and
in
fact
possesses
a
certain
type
of
pathos
in
this
sense
we
are
told
art
generally
ought
to
touch
the
emotions
before
accepting
this
principle
however
we
ought
first
to
inquire
through
what
means
this
peculiar
effect
of
art
must
be
brought
about
to
touch
the
emotions
is
in
general
the
activity
of
something
in
union
with
feeling
and
mankind
more
particularly
the
mankind
of
today
are
or
a
more
considerable
portion
of
them
are
only
too
readily
open
to
such
experiments
the
man
who
showers
tears
on
us
starts
the
seeds
of
tears
which
grow
up
fast
enough
in
art
however
only
that
ought
to
move
us
which
contains
in
itself
the
real
import
of
pathos

for
such
reasons
we
may
affirm
that
neither
in
comedy
nor
in
tragedy
ought
pathos
to
be
that
which
is
only
folly
or
personal
idiosyncracy
shakespeares
timon
for
example
is
on
purely
material
grounds
a
misanthrope
his
friends
have
eaten
him
up
consumed
his
substance
and
when
he
himself
requires
their
gold
desert
him
he
consequently
becomes
a
passionate
enemy
of
mankind
the
situation
is
both
conceivable
and
consistent
with
nature
but
it
contains
no
pathos
that
can
be
justified
on
principle
even
to
a
more
striking
extent
is
the
hate
we
find
in
the
misanthrope
that
play
of
schillers
apprenticeship
purely
a
vagary
of
modern
ideas
for
in
this
latter
case
the
misanthrope
is
in
addition
a
thoughtful
perspicacious
and
entirely
noble
man
greathearted
towards
his
peasants
whom
he
has
freed
from
their
villeinage
and
devoted
to
his
daughter
who
is
apart
from
her
beauty
in
all
respects
worthy
of
his
love
in
much
the
same
way
in
that
novel
of
august
lafontaine
quintius
heimeran
von
flaming
is
worried
with
the
follies
of
mankind
it
is
however
our
most
latterday
poetry
which
above
all
loves
to
wind
itself
into
every
conceivable
knot
of
fantastical
falsehood352
attempting
thereby
to
secure
an
effect
through
mere
oddity
but
failing
to
find
the
slightest
response
in
any
sane
person
for
the
reason
that
every
vestige
of
what
is
really
present
in
human
life
has
vanished
from
such
refinements
of
mental
athletics
in
another
direction
we
may
remark
that
everything
which
depends
solely
that
is
to
say
in
so
far
as
scientific
apprehension
is
the
main
requirement
upon
instruction
testimony
to
the
truth
and
insight
of
what
is
offered
as
such
is
no
fit
subjectmatter
for
the
representation
of
a
genuine
pathos
the
facts
of
scientific
knowledge
are
a
part
of
this
material
and
the
reason
of
this
is
that
science
demands
a
particular
form
of
education
an
effort
towards
and
a
knowledge
of
the
specific
forms
of
science
and
their
relative
importance
of
exceptional
variety
and
extension
an
interest
in
this
type
of
study
is
by
no
means
a
universally
moving
influence
in
the
hearts
of
men
but
is
limited
and
must
ever
remain
limited
to
a
narrow
circle
of
votaries
the
treatment
of
purely
religious
instruction
presents
similar
difficulty
if
we
mean
by
that
the
development
of
the
same
in
its
profoundest
import
no
doubt
the
universal
content
of
religion
such
as
the
belief
in
god
and
similar
theses
is
of
the
deepest
interest
to
anyone
worthy
of
it
art
is
however
not
directly
concerned
either
in
the
exposition
of
religious
dogmas
nor
indeed
in
any
exceptional
insight
into
their
truth
it
is
consequently
of
importance
that
she
should
be
held
aloof
front
such
disquisitions
it
is
all
the
more
necessary
that
we
should
through
art
entrust
every
type
of
pathos
to
the
human
heart
every
motive
of
ethical
significance
which
are
of
practical
and
vital
interest
the
influence
of
religious
ideas
is
rather
upon
the
subjective
world
of
emotion
the
heaven
of
the
heart
the
everrepeated
consolation
and
uplifting
of
the
individual
life
than
upon
direct
action
in
the
strict
sense
for
that
which
is
divine
in
religion
on
its
practical
side
is
morality
and
the
powers
which
are
potent
in
the
ethical
life
these
powers
however
in
contrast
with
the
heaven
of
religion
in
its
purest
form
are
in
definite
relation
to
the
world
and
that
which
is
entirely
human
among
the
ancients
this
worldly
content
was
fundamentally
included
in
their
conception
of
deity
and
consequently
their
gods
could
be
related
directly
to
human
action
and
its
artistic
presentation
from
all
this
it
will
readily
appear
that
the
significant
moments
of
volitional
activity
which
present
to
us
the
pathos
we
have
just
endeavoured
to
define
are
numerically
small
and
the
range
of
them
restricted
in
the
opera
especially
it
is
inevitable
that
the
sphere
from
which
such
may
be
selected
is
a
narrow
one
we
consequently
have
for
ever
dinned
in
our
ears
the
plaints
and
delights
the
misfortunes
and
happiness
of
love
fame
honour
friendship
maternal
and
marital
devotion

now
a
pathos
of
this
kind
requires
for
its
display
not
merely
the
power
of
exposition
but
also
that
of
perfected
elaboration353
and
what
is
more
the
soul
which
entrusts
to
its
pathos
the
spiritual
wealth
it
possesses
must
be
one
with
real
wealth
to
dispose
of
and
not
one
that
can
rest
in
a
condition
of
purely
intensive
selfconcentration
it
must
in
short
be
ready
to
give
an
outward
semblance
to
its
selfexpression
and
rise
to
the
finished
perfection
of
that
the
distinction
between
this
power
of
selfconcentration
and
that
of
selfrevelation
is
of
great
importance
and
we
shall
find
that
in
this
respect
the
types
of
individuality
such
as
generically
represent
different
races
offer
essential
points
of
contrast
nations
whose
reflective
consciousness
has
been
highly
trained
are
more
eloquent
in
the
expression
of
their
passions
than
others
who
are
not
so
the
ancients
for
example
were
accustomed
to
unfold
the
pathos
which
is
the
animating
principle
of
human
personality
in
its
profoundest
significance
without
running
off
into
cold
generalities
or
empty
tattle
the
french
also
in
this
respect
are
naturally
gifted
and
their
eloquence
in
the
expression
of
passion
is
not
by
any
means
always
merely
a
piling
up
of
words
as
we
germans
following
the
bent
of
our
national
reserve
to
which
the
repeated
expression
of
emotion
appears
to
be
a
kind
of
wrong
inflicted
upon
it
are
only
too
ready
to
think
it
is
in
fact
we
have
gone
so
far
in
this
direction
that
we
could
mention
a
distinct
phase
in
our
poetical
history
when
the
younger
spirits
at
any
rate
sick
to
death
of
that
which
they
dubbed
the
flush
of
french
rhetorical
waterdrops
yearned
to
such
an
extent
after
the
simplicity
of
nature
that
their
artistic
energy
could
only
express
itself
for
the
most
part
in
interjections
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
however
that
we
shall
arrive
at
no
open
sesame
with
ahs
and
ohs
a
damn
here
and
there
thrown
in
or
any
other
random
note
of
storm
and
bluster
the
inspiration
of
mere
interjections
is
a
feeble
one
or
rather
is
simply
the
way
in
which
the
still
unrefined
nature
expresses
itself
the
spirit
which
is
to
reveal
to
us
pathos
must
be
a
spirit
which
is
full
to
running
over
which
is
able
to
spread
itself
abroad
and
give
expression
to
its
virtue
we
may
add
too
that
in
this
respect
goethe
and
schiller
present
a
most
marked
contrast
goethe
is
less
pathetic
than
schiller
makes
use
of
a
mode
of
artistic
expression
which
is
more
intensive
more
especially
in
his
lyrics
we
are
struck
by
this
characteristic
of
selfreserve
his
songs
and
this
is
the
true
quality
of
the
pure
lyric
go
naturally
on
their
way
without
entirely
giving
us
all
that
they
contain
schiller
on
the
contrary
is
clearly
anxious
to
unfold
the
pathos
of
his
subject
to
its
furthest
limit
and
with
all
the
clearness
and
force
of
expression
he
can
muster
claudius
in
wandsbecker
boten354
has
contrasted
voltaire
and
shakespeare
in
much
the
same
fashion
maintaining
that
the
one
is
what
the
other
only
appears
to
be
master
arouet
tells
us
i
weep
shakespeare
really
weeps
to
this
we
can
only
reply
that
it
is
precisely
with
such
telling
and
appearance
that
art
is
concerned
and
not
with
the
mere
positive
fact
if
shakespeare
merely
wept
while
voltaire
made
others
think
he
wept
so
much
the
worse
for
the
poet
shakespeare
to
conclude
then
it
is
necessary
that
pathos
in
order
to
be
in
itself
concrete
as
it
should
be
in
ideal
art
be
presented
in
its
artistic
manifestation
as
the
pathos
issuing
from
a
spiritual
nature
rich
and
comprehensive
and
this
result
carries
us
forward
to
that
third
aspect
of
our
consideration
of
the
action
already
adverted
to
that
is
to
say
an
inquiry
into
what
is
implied
by
character
in
this
connection
c
character
we
will
summarize
the
proceeding
argument
our
point
of
departure
was
the
universal
and
substantive
powers
which
are
the
original
stimulus
to
action
such
require
as
the
medium
of
their
active
realization
human
individuality
in
which
they
then
appear
as
affecting
pathos355
but
furthermore
the
universal
inherent
in
these
powers
must
in
particular
individuals
acquire
the
concentrated
unity
and
concreteness
of
a
whole
and
a
single
whole
this
totality
is
man
apprehended
in
his
fulfilled
spiritual
content
and
the
subjectivity
therein
comprised
in
one
word
the
entire
selfcontained
human
individuality
which
we
designate
as
character
the
gods
are
born
into
the
pathos
of
men
and
pathos
in
its
more
concrete
form
of
activity
is
human
character
in
character
then
we
find
the
real
focus356
of
the
ideal
exposition
of
art
that
is
to
say
in
so
far
as
the
embodiment
unites
in
itself
the
separate
aspects
of
it
already
developed
as
consistent
phases
in
the
construction
of
its
own
totality
for
the
idea
as
ideal
by
which
we
mean
as
clothed
in
a
form
within
the
grasp
of
sensuous
imagination
and
perception
and
in
its
activity
as
action
and
accomplishment
is
if
we
define
it
strictly
just
this
selfrelation
of
the
subjective
individuality
the
individuality
however
which
is
truly
free
and
nothing
short
of
this
will
satisfy
the
ideal
has
not
merely
to
declare
itself
as
universality
but
at
the
same
time
to
assert
its
nature
as
concrete
singularity
as
the
mediating
bond
which
unites
and
transpierces
both
sides
thus
related
which
in
their
selfrelated
actuality
subsist
as
unity
and
this
is
precisely
what
we
understand
by
character
the
ideal
form
of
which
consists
in
the
wealth
of
energy
with
which
all
the
constituent
aspects
of
the
subjective
life
are
welded
in
one
whole
we
will
now
inquire
rather
more
closely
into
the
nature
of
this
conception
of
character
viewed
under
three
distinct
aspects
first
as
coextensive357
individuality
that
is
to
say
with
our
attention
directed
to
the
wealth
of
substance
contained
in
it
secondly
with
direct
reference
to
its
particularity
the
form
in
which
it
is
bound
to
appear
albeit
still
a
totality
as
one
that
is
more
defined
or
specific
thirdly
in
our
final
apprehension
of
it
as
a
unity
which
is
fully
identified
with
its
own
determinate
form
that
is
which
is
throughout
fused
with
the
same
by
virtue
of
its
own
principle
of
subjective
selfidentity
and
thereby
attaches
to
the
whole
the
significance
of
an
essentially
assured
character
we
will
now
develop
and
elucidate
more
fully
what
we
conceive
to
be
implied
in
the
above
general
propositions

and
first
we
would
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
pathos
though
an
essential
feature
in
the
development
of
completed
individuality
is
not
in
the
specific
form
of
its
appearance
the
sole
or
exclusive
interest
of
the
individuality
portrayed
it
is
in
fact
merely
one
aspect
of
the
efficient358
character
if
one
of
paramount
importance
to
put
it
in
rather
a
strong
way
the
human
soul
does
not
merely
carry
within
it
one
god
as
the
original
of
its
pathos
on
the
contrary
the
spiritual
scope
of
humanity
has
wider
borders
and
we
may
affirm
that
many
gods
make
their
dwelling
in
one
true
man
or
rather
all
the
powers
which
are
scattered
throughout
the
heaven
of
the
gods
are
enclosed
within
that
one
breast
it
is
coextensive
with
the
entire
field
of
olympus
in
this
sense
one
of
old
has
said
out
of
thine
own
passions
o
man
hast
thou
created
the
gods
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
proportion
as
the
intelligence
of
the
hellenic
folk
quickened
the
number
of
their
gods
increased
and
furthermore
the
gods
of
their
earliest
days
were
less
intelligent
that
is
to
say
they
were
godlike
figures
deficient
both
in
individuality
and
determinate
character
in
this
wealth
of
content
accordingly
it
is
necessary
that
the
character
adequate
to
ideal
art
should
display
itself
and
this
is
just
that
which
creates
the
interest
we
feel
in
a
character
namely
that
a
totality
such
as
that
we
have
above
described
emerges
from
it
and
the
character
while
reposing
on
its
abundance
nevertheless
persists
in
perfect
equality
with
itself
as
one
secure
and
selfexcluding
subject
if
the
character
however
be
not
conceived
and
depicted
as
this
rounded
and
subjective
unity
is
abstract
in
the
sense
that
it
is
entirely
the
sport
of
one
passion
such
must
then
appear
as
selfdestructive359
or
at
least
cracked
weak
and
without
real
fibre
for
the
weakness
and
inertness
of
individuals
is
just
this
very
thing
that
the
eternal
forces
of
which
we
have
spoken
never
assert
themselves
in
them
as
a
real
part
of
their
most
essential
substance
as
to
put
it
logically
predicates
which
adhere
to
them

the

achilles

the
most
youthful
hero

his
youthful
exuberance
is
represented
as
quite
compatible
with
all
other
entirely
human
qualities

homer
unfolds
before
us
this
variety
through
situations

the
finest
contrast

him

treated
with
the
highest
deference

honour

in
contrast
to
all
this

is
represented
as
inflammable

a
degree
effervescent
revengeful
and
full
of
the
most
brutal
austerity

us

the
mere
diversion

freak

suggestion
of
an
excited
fancy

as
we
see
in

will
take
up
everything

immersed

throughout

the

the

that
distinguish

the
form
of
its

and
alert
subjectivity
intact
for
the
representation
of
such
exhaustive
types
of
character
epic
poetry
is
above
all
others
adapted
dramatic
and
lyrical
poetry
are
less
so

art
however
will
not
be
content
to
remain
at
the
point
which
the
course
of
our
inquiry
has
reached
namely
the
notion
of
character
as
a
mere
congeries
of
traits
for
the
object
we
have
before
us
now
is
the
ideal
in
its
specific
determination
and
singularity
or
rather
concrete
individuality
are
both
of
them
prominent
and
necessary
features
action
more
than
anything
else
in
its
conflict
and
reaction
is
impossible
without
some
restriction
and
clear
definition
of
form
for
this
reason
the
heroes
of
dramatic
poetry
are
for
the
most
part
of
simpler
definition
than
those
of
epic
poetry
and
the
way
we
get
at
a
clear
definition
is
through
some
pathos
out
of
the
ordinary
which
is
so
portrayed
as
to
make
some
essential
trait
of
character
stand
out
in
bold
relief
and
itself
to
be
the
stimulus
to
particular
objects
resolves
and
actions
if
however
this
simplification
is
carried
so
far
that
any
character
appears
as
though
it
were
pared
down
to
a
mere
shadowlike
semblance
of
any
form
of
pathos
such
as
love
or
honour
all
real
vitality
and
spiritual
depth
must
necessarily
vanish
and
the
representation
as
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
in
the
french
school
of
drama
for
this
very
reason
can
only
offer
us
a
cold
and
jejune
result
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
in
this
aspect
of
particularity
the
prominent
feature
which
asserts
itself
preeminently
will
be
this
that
within
the
borders
of
this
very
limitation
the
fulness
of
life
is
completely
preserved
so
that
the
personality
in
question
has
free
scope
allowed
it
for
further
expansion
in
many
directions
a
power
to
adapt
itself
to
every
variety
of
situation
and
in
short
is
able
to
unfold
and
express
in
every
possible
way
the
wealth
of
a
truly
complete
spiritual
life361
despite
the
supreme
simplicity
of
their
pathos
the
characters
in
the
sophoclean
drama
possess
this
intrinsic
vitality
we
may
indeed
compare
them
in
their
plastic
selfseclusion
to
the
figures
of
sculpture
for
it
is
also
quite
possible
that
sculpture
express
very
various
delineations
of
character
despite
all
the
tenacity
of
its
definition
in
contrast
to
the
bluster
of
overpowering
passion
which
concentrates
all
its
forces
upon
one
single
point
it
exhibits
out
of
its
tranquillity
and
speechlessness
that
predominant
neutrality
which
peacefully
envelops
all
powers
within
itself
but
this
unperturbed
unity
does
not
however
persist
in
any
indissoluble
union
with
mere
formal
definition
but
rather
in
virtue
of
its
beauty
suffers
at
the
same
time
the
birththroes
of
all
that
pertains
to
it
to
disrobe
itself
as
through
a
cloud
of
immediate
possibility
into
fresh
relations
of
every
variety
in
the
finest
figures
of
sculpture
we
behold
a
tranquil
depth
which
unfolds
as
it
were
the
pregnant
womb
from
which
all
other
potencies
may
be
born
in
contrast
with
sculpture
it
is
yet
of
more
vital
importance
to
the
arts
of
painting
music
and
poetry
that
they
should
display
the
inmost
complexity
of
character
and
real
artists
of
every
age
have
recognized
this
in
shakespeares
romeo
and
juliet
for
example
the
most
pathetic
characteristic
of
romeo
is
his
love
but
he
is
also
placed
before
us
under
relations
of
the
greatest
contrast
whether
it
be
in
reference
to
his
parents
his
friends
his
love
troubles
or
his
affair
of
honour
in
which
he
fights
with
tybalt
his
attitude
of
deference
and
trust
to
the
monk
nay
even
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
his
conversation
with
the
apothecary
from
whom
he
purchases
the
poison
throughout
he
is
the
same
worthy
and
noble
man
of
deep
emotions
in
the
same
way
the
character
of
juliet
is
unfolded
throughout
the
range
of
her
relations
to
father
mother
nurse
the
count
paris
and
father
lawrence
and
despite
of
this
she
is
as
deeply
immersed362
in
her
one
preoccupation
as
she
is
in
every
one
of
these
situations
and
her
entire
character
is
transpierced
with
and
carried
away
by
the
one
single
emotion
her
passionate
love
for
her
lover
which
is
as
deep
and
broad
as
the
unbounded
sea
so
that
it
is
but
the
simple
truth
when
she
exclaims
the
more
i
give
the
more
i
possess
both
are
infinite
from
all
this
it
appears
that
even
when
there
is
but
one
pathos
visible
it
must
unfold
itself
as
the
wealth
of
all
it
possesses
and
this
is
what
really
happens
even
in
lyrical
poetry
where
we
find
the
pathos
is
not
attached
to
actions
determined
by
positive
circumstances
and
conditions
for
in
this
latter
case
the
pathos
can
only
assert
itself
as
the
spiritual
state
of
an
emotional
nature
otherwise
complete
in
itself
which
is
that
is
to
say
free
to
express
itself
in
any
other
conceivable
circumstance
and
situation
which
may
confront
it
the
use
of
words
of
vital
significance
an
imagination
which
can
associate
itself
with
all
the
world
can
restore
the
past
to
the
present
can
transform
the
entire
external
environment
of
mans
life
to
a
symbolical
expression
of
his
spirit
can
bravely
adventure
into
the
depths
of
comprehensive
thought
and
while
doing
so
reveal
an
exuberant
capacious
clear
exalted
and
noble
naturea
wealth
of
character
such
as
this
freely
expressing
such
a
world
is
a
prize
indeed
for
the
lyric
muse
no
doubt
a
purely
logical
reflection
may
find
it
impossible
that
such
variety
of
character
should
coexist
with
a
masterful
clearness
of
type
we
may
be
asked
for
instance
in
reference
to
the
heroic
character
of
achilles
whose
strength
of
youth
is
the
preeminent
trait
of
his
beauty
how
it
is
possible
to
reconcile
the
tender
heart
so
manifest
in
his
relations
to
his
father
and
his
friend
with
the
cruel
act
of
revenge
wherewith
he
drags
hector
round
the
walls
precisely
the
same
kind
of
inconsequence
is
to
be
met
with
in
shakespeares
clowns
they
are
with
scarcely
an
exception
bubbling
over
with
wit
and
the
humour
of
genius
and
no
doubt
there
will
always
be
fools
enough
to
ask
us
how
men
thus
spiritually
gifted
could
ever
betake
themselves
to
such
tomfooleries
the
truth
is
that
the
reflection
of
the
formal
logic
is
sure
to
emphasize
one
aspect
of
a
character
and
conclude
that
the
entire
man
is
minted
under
its
impression
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
to
such
everything
that
asserts
itself
as
alien
to
the
hallmark
of
its
beggarly
mintage
can
only
appear
as
an
inconsequence
in
the
truely
rational
contemplation
of
the
whole
as
distinct
from
the
parts
and
thereby
of
the
living
thing
that
which
appears
as
inconsequent
will
be
precisely
that
which
brings
all
into
fit
coordination
for
our
humanity
is
just
this
very
paradox
we
have
not
merely
to
carry363
the
contradictions
of
our
complex
nature
but
to
suffer
the
load363
with
patience
and
throughout
prove
staunch
to
our
burden

we
may
conclude
then
that
character
must
fuse
together
its
particularity
in
the
element
of
its
spiritual
substance
it
should
possess
a
definite
type
and
at
the
same
time
retain
in
this
distinction
the
force
and
stability
of
a
single
fully
selfconsistent
pathos
where
we
find
our
humanity
represented
without
such
a
centre
of
unity
the
different
aspects
of
such
variety
it
may
possess
will
lose
all
relative
meaning
or
significance
and
fall
away
from
each
other
in
art
we
shall
find
that
what
we
distinguish
in
our
conception
of
personality
as
infinite
or
the
divine
is
just
this
selfconsistency
in
unity
if
this
view
be
a
just
one
it
is
obvious
that
such
characterizations
as
stability
and
determination
are
of
great
importance
in
the
ideal
representation
of
character
and
we
shall
only
obtain
such
a
result
as
already
observed
in
so
far
as
the
universality
of
the
powers
inherent
in
our
humanity
are
permitted
to
transpierce
the
mere
particularity
of
the
individual
character
and
by
virtue
of
the
unity
thus
set
up
create
a
subjective
and
at
the
same
time
individual
life
which
supplies
its
own
principle
of
unity
and
selfidentity
such
a
condition
is
all
important
and
we
must
now
advert
to
a
number
of
artistic
compositions
more
particularly
of
later
times
in
express
relation
to
it
in
the
cid
of
corneille
for
example
the
collision
between
the
opposing
principles
of
love
and
honour
is
a
match
no
doubt
of
brilliant
effects
a
pathos
of
this
kind
involved
as
it
is
in
the
opposition
of
distinct
forces
may
no
doubt
be
the
operative
ground
of
conflicts
but
when
we
find
such
portrayed
as
the
spiritual
struggle
of
one
and
the
same
character
though
such
antagonism
may
very
readily
supply
us
with
the
material
for
brilliant
rhetoric
and
effective
monologue
the
cataclysm
which
is
here
presented
in
the
emotional
life
of
one
person
driven
thus
by
turns
from
its
abstract
subjection
to
honour
into
the
equally
abstract
one
of
love
and
forthwith
hounded
back
again
is
not
favourable
to
the
portrayal
of
a
character
of
genuine
stability
and
homogeneousness
it
is
equally
inconsistent
with
the
delineation
of
resolute
personality
when
a
leading
character
already
under
the
predominant
influence
of
some
specific
pathos
is
portrayed
as
one
overmastered
by
the
direction
or
persuasion
of
a
subordinate
character
such
is
thus
enabled
to
shift
the
responsibility
upon
other
shoulders
this
is
what
actually
takes
place
in
the
phedra
of
racine
when
the
mind
of
phedra
is
depicted
as
entirely
motived
by
the
words
of
oenone
a
character
of
real
distinction
acts
out
of
its
own
initiative
and
will
not
suffer
the
views
of
a
mere
stranger
to
be
that
which
determines
its
own
resolution
only
when
action
is
the
direct
result
of
its
own
reflections
do
we
get
that
clear
relation
between
personal
initiative
and
the
consequent
result
which
carries
with
it
the
full
weight
of
guilt
or
responsibility
we
find
yet
another
type
of
this
instability
of
character
as
quite
a
peculiar
possession
of
the
more
recent
literary
output
of
germany
it
is
a
type
of
character
in
which
a
kind
of
flatulence
in
emotion
is
the
rule
no
less
than
the
source
the
classic
example
is
the
werther
of
goethes
romance
a
thoroughly
morbid
type
of
character
without
any
vestige
of
real
manliness
such
as
might
carry
him
beyond
the
egotism
of
his
lovepassion
what
makes
him
interesting
is
the
passion
and
beauty
of
his
emotional
life
the
intimate
fellowship
between
himself
and
nature
which
the
course
of
his
spiritual
experience
and
the
pliability
of
his
temperament
accentuate
this
effeminacy
has
yet
more
recently
embodied
itself
in
many
other
forms
of
expression
which
descend
with
increasing
rapidity
to
the
lowest
circle
of
jejune
and
tasteless
egotism
we
must
not
even
omit
for
instance
to
include
in
our
list
that
illustration
of
the
lovely
soul
which
we
find
in
jacobis
woldemar
in
this
romance
we
are
made
a
present
of
the
glory
of
emotional
volubility
in
all
its
pretensions
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
to
cite
a
better
example
of
the
selfdeceptive
illusion
of
personal
virtue
and
excellence
here
we
have
all
that
sublimity
and
divinity
of
soul
which
relates
itself
crookedly
to
every
possible
aspect
of
the
actual
world
that
type
of
feebleness
which
is
wholly
unable
to
share
in
or
tolerate
any
portion
of
the
labours
or
interests
of
practical
life
as
it
really
is
so
rooted
is
it
in
its
own
consciousness
of
superiority
it
passes
everything
as
unworthy
of
it
on
the
other
side
it
is
in
fact
a
peculiar
feature
of
this
type
of
lovely
soul
that
even
when
face
to
face
with
the
truly
ethical
interests
and
wholly
sane
objects
of
life
instead
of
meeting
them
frankly
it
retires
into
the
seclusion
of
itself
where
it
weaves
its
own
threads
of
finery
and
passes
its
time
in
hatching
out
its
exquisite
brood
of
religious
and
moral
reflections
and
connected
closely
with
this
personal
enthusiasm
for
our
superabundant
excellence
which
we
set
forth
in
front
of
ourselves
with
such
a
brave
show
there
will
always
be
an
intense
sensitiveness
for
all
other
beings
who
may
appear
at
any
moment
to
sympathize
with
comprehend
and
appreciate
this
beauty
of
the
solitary
life
if
such
fellowfeeling
is
not
forthcoming
we
find
the
very
heart
of
us
troubled
to
its
depths
and
infinitely
bruised
we
have
lost
at
one
stroke
all
humanity
friendship
and
love
we
are
unable
to
put
away
with
whatever
act
of
pedantry
or
rudeness
may
be
in
question
some
trivial
circumstance
or
stupidity
over
which
the
vision
of
any
character
of
breadth
or
strength
would
pass
without
a
tremor
it
whirls
away
the
thought
of
everything
else
and
that
which
is
by
itself
of
least
significance
proves
to
be
that
which
finally
most
reduces
us
to
despair
such
is
the
source
of
all
that
endless
train
of
melancholy
trouble
heartache
peevishness
sickness
dejection
and
poverty
of
spirit
which
follows
such
the
spring
of
all
those
selftorturing
reflections
one
on
the
top
of
another
that
cramp
and
obstinacy
nay
finally
that
cruelty
of
soul
through
which
the
wretchedness
and
weakness
of
the
spiritual
content
of
such
a
type
of
loveliness
consummates
and
declares
itself
no
heart
that
is
truly
sound
can
wish
to
unite
itself
with
such
an
emotional
hermitage
for
it
is
a
fundamental
characteristic
of
all
genuine
character
that
it
carries
within
itself
both
the
courage
and
the
strength
to
do
and
to
will
some
actual
thing
the
interest
therefore
that
such
natures
which
are
for
ever
revolving
round
themselves
may
arouse
in
us
is
after
all
an
empty
interest
and
necessarily
so
despite
all
the
conviction
with
which
such
natures
may
assure
us
that
they
belong
to
a
higher
and
purer
sphere
than
our
own
a
sphere
which
has
revealed
to
our
vision
that
peculiar
type
of
the
divine
they
have
uncovered
from
their
secret
parts
and
finally
present
to
us
to
borrow
an
apt
figure
en
neglige
this
want
of
genuine
solidity
of
character
appears
in
yet
another
form
where
we
find
the
particular
manifestations
of
this
world
of
fine
feelings
turned
as
it
were
upside
down
and
hypostatized
as
independent
forces
much
that
passes
for
magic
magnetism
spiritualism
the
apparitions
of
clairvoyance
the
morbid
condition
of
sleepwalking
is
attributable
to
this
source
the
living
person
in
question
is
placed
in
a
relation
to
these
abstruse
powers
which
from
one
point
of
view
identifies
him
with
them
and
in
another
makes
them
appear
as
something
foreign
to
his
spiritual
life
which
determines
and
controls
it
it
is
assumed
that
underlying
these
undefined
forces
there
is
some
inexplicable
truth
which
borders
on
the
marvellous
or
at
any
rate
passes
comprehension
from
the
world
of
art
however
all
such
powers
of
darkness
should
be
banished
in
art
there
is
no
darkness
at
all
but
all
is
lucid
and
transparent
and
in
adventuring
after
such
types
of
myopy
speech
merely
flounders
into
spiritual
disease
or
plays
loose
as
poetry
with
the
nebulous
empty
and
trivial
a
good
example
of
which
is
the
verse
of
hoffmann
and
that
piece
by
henry
von
klust
entitled
the
prince
of
homburg
the
truly
ideal
character
has
nothing
in
his
composition
or
the
pathos
which
expresses
it
of
another
world
and
its
ghosts
but
only
actual
interests
in
which
he
finds
himself
at
home
more
particularly
is
this
feature
of
clairvoyance
become
a
trivial
and
vulgar
recipe
of
our
more
modern
poets
in
schillers
tell
on
the
contrary
when
the
old
attinghausen
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
foretells
the
destiny
of
his
country
the
prophetic
instinct
is
quite
in
its
right
place
it
is
always
however
a
misfortune
for
an
artist
to
find
himself
forced
to
exchange
the
sanity
of
a
character
with
some
malady
of
the
soul
whether
it
be
to
motive
the
collision
or
excite
interest
for
this
reason
he
should
only
avail
himself
of
the
condition
of
insanity
in
quite
exceptional
cases
in
conclusion
we
may
connect
with
these
distortions
of
a
sane
vision
which
are
so
much
opposed
to
all
real
unity
and
consistency
of
character
the
principle
of
our
latterday
irony
this
false
theory
has
betrayed
the
poet
into
grafting
upon
his
characters
qualities
so
essentially
diverse
that
they
are
incapable
of
all
homogeneous
relation
the
essential
unity
of
every
character
is
thus
confounded
according
to
this
theory
a
character
is
first
presented
as
characterized
in
a
certain
way
and
immediately
after
we
have
that
very
determination
converted
into
its
opposite
and
the
character
itself
is
propounded
to
us
as
nothing
more
than
the
negation
of
what
it
was
and
is
moreover
this
very
futility
is
accepted
by
this
irony
as
the
supreme
discovery
of
art
an
audience
should
not
in
short
be
carried
away
by
an
essentially
positive
interest
but
should
be
pulled
up
at
the
critical
moment
much
as
the
irony
itself
is
no
sooner
launched
upon
anything
than
it
is
off
again
they
would
even
explain
the
characters
of
shakespeare
according
to
such
a
principle
we
are
informed
that
lady
macbeth
was
an
irreproachable
wife
of
the
tenderest
feeling
despite
the
fact
that
she
not
only
falls
in
with
the
suggestion
of
the
murder
but
actually
eggs
her
husband
on
to
its
execution
but
if
the
signet
mark
of
shakespeare
is
conspicuous
on
any
one
quality
it
is
on
the
firm
and
decisive
delineation
of
his
characters
even
when
it
is
only
the
formal
greatness
and
consistency
of
evil
that
is
in
question
hamlet
it
is
true
is
a
case
of
mental
indecision
but
even
he
is
only
in
doubt
as
to
the
way
he
shall
carry
out
his
purpose
not
at
all
as
to
what
has
to
be
done
yet
nowadays
they
would
assimilate
even
shakespeares
characters
to
a
world
of
ghosts
and
appear
to
think
that
this
futility
and
indecision
of
ups
and
downs
this
general
squeamishness364
in
short
can
by
itself
contribute
to
our
interest
the
ideal
however
is
centred
in
this
that
idea
is
made
actual
and
our
humanity
is
associated
with
such
actuality
as
subject
and
consequently
as
a
unity
which
is
essentially
firmrooted
we
may
here
so
far
at
least
as
this
portion
of
our
inquiry
is
concerned
bring
our
observations
upon
the
individuality
which
is
consistent
with
real
character
to
a
close
that
which
we
have
mainly
sought
to
emphasize
is
a
pathos
which
is
at
once
selfdetermined
and
essential
the
possession
of
a
rich
and
complete
nature
the
spiritual
world
of
which
such
a
pathos
transfuses
under
such
a
form
that
this
process
of
transfusion
no
less
than
the
pathos
itself
receives
its
artistic
presentment
at
the
same
time
this
pathos
must
not
be
allowed
to
come
into
conflict
with
itself
in
the
hearts
of
men
so
as
to
stultify
its
very
nature
and
consistency
as
pathos
iii
the
external
determination
of
the
ideal
our
consideration
of
the
determination
of
the
ideal
was
in
the
first
instance
occupied
with
the
general
inquiry
why
it
was
and
how
it
came
about
that
the
ideal
ever
received
at
all
the
definite
embodiment
of
a
particular
form
following
after
this
we
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
inherent
process
was
essential
to
our
notion
of
it
that
in
fact
the
element
of
difference
was
only
by
this
means
asserted
within
it
and
that
this
process
viewed
as
a
whole
is
presented
us
in
the
action
we
discovered
however
that
in
virtue
of
the
action
the
ideal
passes
over
into
actual
relations
with
the
external
world
we
have
therefore
and
this
is
the
third
important
step
to
solve
the
further
question
what
kind
of
form
this
its
final
aspect
as
associated
with
external
reality
the
ideal
will
receive
under
adequate
artistic
representation
we
would
recall
the
fact
that
the
ideal
is
the
idea
under
a
form
which
is
in
union
with
its
own
actuality
up
to
the
present
point
of
our
inquiry
our
attention
has
been
exclusively
occupied
with
that
aspect
or
phase
of
this
actuality
which
we
may
call
in
general
terms
human
individuality
and
its
character
man
is
however
also
in
possession
of
a
concrete
and
external
existence
in
separation
from
this
it
is
true
he
concentrates
his
spiritual
life
to
a
point
in
selfconsciousness
but
he
remains
for
all
that
even
in
this
subjective
unity
immediately
related
to
the
external
world
to
the
actual
existence
of
mankind
the
surrounding
sphere
of
a
world
is
as
indispensable
as
the
protection
of
a
temple
is
to
the
statues
of
the
god
it
contains
and
for
this
very
reason
we
must
now
advert
to
all
or
some
of
those
many
diverse
threads
whereby
the
ideal
is
woven
in
with
this
external
environment
and
is
shown
in
relief
against
it365
this
opens
to
our
view
a
practically
immeasurable
expanse
of
relations
and
modes
under
which
the
process
of
the
external
and
relative
world
is
determined
for
in
the
first
place
we
are
confronted
at
once
with
the
bare
facts
of
external
nature
such
as
particular
locality
situation
whether
habitable
or
not
temporal
condition
the
nature
of
the
prevailing
climate
whether
in
our
earths
northern
or
southern
hemispheres
and
in
fact
in
whatever
direction
we
advance
we
have
a
fresh
picture
before
us
moreover
external
nature
is
made
use
of
by
man
to
satisfy
his
own
needs
and
purposes
and
all
the
ways
under
which
he
converts
her
to
that
use
that
is
to
say
the
adroitness
with
which
he
discovers
and
then
equips
himself
with
tools
and
a
home
to
live
in
with
weapons
with
seats
to
recline
upon
carriages
to
ride
in
nay
all
that
the
art
of
cooking
may
bring
with
it
for
his
food
the
entire
apparatus
of
his
luxury
no
less
than
his
comfort
all
this
and
much
more
fall
within
the
limits
of
our
inquiry
add
to
this
the
further
and
yet
more
important
consideration
that
every
man
lives
within
a
comprehensive
and
equally
real
world
of
spiritual
relations
which
itself
too
presents
to
his
view
all
the
different
modes
under
which
command
and
submission
is
maintained
that
is
to
say
the
family
bloodrelationship
property
country
and
town
life
the
cultus
of
religion
the
organization
of
defence
and
offence
civic
and
political
associations
private
society
in
short
every
conceivable
form
under
which
ethical
customs
and
usages
are
organized
in
the
institutions
and
permanent
activities
which
contribute
to
the
actual
environment
of
human
existence
in
all
the
directions
enumerated
above
the
ideal
is
in
immediate
contact
with
the
reality
of
the
practical
world
in
its
everyday
dress
or
in
other
words
with
the
commonplace
prose
of
life
and
impressed
by
this
fact
we
may
easily
be
led
to
the
conclusion
if
we
have
already
accepted
the
nebulous
conception
of
idealism
elaborated
recently
that
art
can
have
no
alternative
but
to
dissever
herself
absolutely
from
all
connection
with
this
world
of
relative
appearances
such
at
least
can
only
be
logically
inferred
from
a
theory
which
assumes
that
this
relation
of
externality
is
one
of
pure
indifference
or
rather
in
contrast
to
the
subjective
world
of
spirit
is
of
no
substantive
significance
or
worth
agreeably
to
this
view
art
is
a
spiritual
dominion
whose
sole
object
is
to
exalt
us
above
the
sphere
of
material
wants
necessities
and
dependence
and
to
liberate
us
from
the
logic
and
we
may
add
the
comedy
of
facts
which
in
this
field
claim
the
exclusive
attention
of
our
humanity
for
apart
from
any
other
consideration
all
that
meets
us
upon
this
terra
firma
of
lifes
prose
is
for
the
most
part
of
a
purely
conventional
character
and
conditioned
as
it
is
by
time
space
and
custom
simply
a
congeries
of
contingent
facts
which
it
is
derogatory
to
the
nature
of
art
to
accept
this
view
of
ideality
which
is
really
an
illusive
one
is
in
part
due
to
one
of
those
highly
flavoured
abstractions
of
our
latterday
thinking
in
which
we
merely
find
that
the
thinkers
courage
has
failed
him
to
come
to
terms
with
the
external
world
in
question
in
part
also
it
is
due
to
that
type
of
prepossession
which
drives
a
man
to
assert
summarily
his
independence
of
practical
necessities
when
the
advantages
of
birth
status
and
social
position
have
not
already
effected
this
for
him
for
such
a
man
the
only
relief
available
is
a
complete
withdrawal
into
the
secret
world
of
the
emotions
a
prisonhouse
of
unreality
he
steps
out
of
never
here
he
remains
in
what
he
conceives
to
be
the
temple
of
wisdom
gazing
ecstatic
at
what
he
takes
to
be
the
stars
and
naturally
values
at
the
price
of
a
nutshell
all
that
is
found
on
the
earth
the
real
ideal
however
is
not
confined
to
the
shadowlike
world
of
the
emotions
but
in
its
perfected
whole
must
freely
borrow
from
the
definite
structure
of
external
objects
of
sight
in
every
direction
and
the
reason
of
this
is
that
man
himself
whose
nature
is
the
central
source
that
gives
to
that
ideal
all
its
significance
is
alive
and
his
life
is
only
actual
in
a
particular
place
and
time
as
one
with
the
present
as
the
individualized
type
of
infinity366
and
in
short
the
opposition
of
an
external
garland
of
nature
is
a
fundamental
characteristic
of
his
life
and
its
association
with
him
and
his
activity
is
imperative
it
follows
that
if
this
activity
is
to
be
apprehended
by
art
not
merely
as
belonging
to
man
alone
but
in
the
specific
form
it
may
take
in
that
world
of
appearance
the
mode
of
its
existence
there
will
assert
itself
as
the
mobility
reaction
and
animating
force
of
life
itself
in
contact
and
transfusion
with
the
material
complex
which
surrounds
it
man
is
however
in
virtue
of
his
selfconsciousness
a
world
in
himself367
and
as
such
is
differentiated
from
the
external
world
of
nature
which
confronts
him
and
this
external
world
is
equally
with
himself
a
rounded
whole
whose
unity
asserts
itself
in
the
principle
of
causality
this
selfexclusion
of
these
two
worlds
is
however
only
apparent
they
are
in
their
separation
essentially
related
and
it
is
precisely
this
association
which
constitutes
concrete
reality
whose
artistic
embodiment
is
the
content
of
the
ideal
and
this
brings
us
once
more
to
the
question
already
mooted
namely
in
what
semblance
or
form
the
external
material
which
we
find
in
this
mutually
related
world
we
have
referred
to
as
concrete
reality368
can
be
presented
to
us
by
art
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
ideal
of
art
we
will
once
more
accept
the
triple
division
of
our
subjectmatter
and
examine
a
work
of
art
from
three
distinct
points
of
view
first
there
is
the
material
of
externality
accepted
in
the
bare
abstractness
of
its
forms
such
as
space
figure
time
colour
which
we
must
consider
relatively
to
the
artistic
form
most
adapted
to
it
secondly
we
must
consider
externality
in
its
full
and
actualized
concreteness
as
above
explained
a
mode
of
reality
which
imperatively
requires
in
a
work
of
art
that
it
should
be
in
close
affiliation
with
the
subjective
content
of
the
spiritual
life
of
man
immediately
related
to
it
thirdly
our
consideration
will
be
directed
to
the
important
fact
that
a
work
of
art
is
created
for
the
delight
of
human
perceptions
for
a
public
in
short
which
justly
claims
that
the
objects
of
art
should
bring
home
to
it
the
interests
of
its
spiritual
life
its
real
beliefs
emotions
and
ideas
so
that
it
may
enter
with
a
genuine
response
into
their
artistic
presentation
1
the
condition
of
externality
in
its
simple
abstractness
the
ideal
in
passing
out
of
the
bare
image
of
its
essential
form
into
external
or
determinate
existence
secures
for
itself
a
reality
which
presents
two
distinct
aspects
from
one
point
of
view
we
see
that
a
work
of
art
discloses
necessarily
in
the
content
of
the
ideal
the
concrete
semblance
of
reality
that
is
to
say
it
presents
that
content
as
a
definite
situation
or
particular
circumstance
action
event
or
character
and
presents
it
moreover
in
the
mode
of
external
existence
from
another
it
is
equally
obvious
that
art
makes
some
specific
and
sensuous
material
the
vehicle
of
the
particular
content
in
its
entirety
of
all
that
we
have
above
summarized
it
creates
in
short
a
new
world
sensible
to
eye
and
ear
the
world
of
art
under
both
these
aspects
we
may
further
observe
that
art
penetrates
to
the
remotest
limits
of
externality
which
are
compatible
with
its
form
as
the
selfincluding
unity
of
the
ideal
and
conformable
to
its
appearance
as
a
concrete
whole
permeated
with
the
energy
of
spirit369
a
work
of
art
moreover
itself
may
as
an
object
qualified
by
externality
be
viewed
in
two
distinct
ways
we
may
regard
it
simply
as
an
external
thing
and
as
such
only
conformable
to
a
unity
that
is
external
in
the
sense
external
objects
are
such
in
considering
it
from
this
latter
point
of
view
we
have
once
more
to
consider
that
relation
of
externality
which
we
found
it
necessary
to
discuss
in
our
examination
of
the
beauty
of
nature
and
for
this
reason
we
shall
again
have
to
make
use
of
those
specific
determinants
which
we
previously
discussed
and
even
then
primarily
in
their
connection
with
art
the
modes
under
which
external
form
was
in
the
previous
section
exhaustively
considered
were
then
treated
in
a
twofold
way
first
we
analysed
such
conceptions
as
uniformity
symmetry
and
conformity
to
rule
we
then
examined
unity
itself
regarded
as
the
simplicity
and
purity
of
the
sensuous
material
which
art
makes
use
of
as
the
external
medium
for
the
existence
of
her
expositions
a
we
will
start
our
inquiry
by
examining
the
position
in
which
we
now
find
ourselves
relatively
to
such
conceptions
as
uniformity
and
symmetry
it
is
obvious
that
these
expressing
as
they
do
the
entirely
lifeless
unity
of
the
geometrical
logic
can
by
no
means
exhaust
the
nature
of
a
work
of
art
even
when
entirely
regarded
as
an
external
object
such
determinations
are
only
exhaustive
in
their
relation
to
what
is
in
itself
lifeless
such
as
time
and
the
configuration
of
space
confined
in
this
way
though
they
be
to
the
barest
forms
of
externality
they
are
then
true
witnesses
both
to
the
power
and
substance
of
reason
and
consequently
we
find
they
assert
themselves
in
a
twofold
manner
even
in
art
in
the
first
of
these
it
is
this
very
quality
of
their
abstractness
which
operates
by
way
of
contrast
to
the
living
pulse
of
art
which
is
forced
even
in
the
confines
of
its
sensuous
material
to
raise
itself
over
and
beyond
mere
symmetry
into
the
freedom
of
the
ideal
in
this
process
of
liberation
which
may
be
exemplified
in
the
melodies
of
the
art
of
music
we
do
not
however
find
that
the
conformity
to
rule
disappears
altogether
it
is
merely
made
subservient
as
a
foundation
in
the
second
this
principle
of
measure
and
rule
in
its
application
to
the
indefinite
and
unlimited
is
the
one
and
only
qualifying
principle
which
certain
arts
can
accept
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
media
which
those
arts
make
use
of
in
such
cases
uniformity
is
itself
and
alone
raised
to
the
ideal
significance
of
the
art
the
principal
example
of
an
art
of
this
type
is
that
of
architecture
and
the
reason
of
this
is
that
a
work
of
art
which
is
wholly
architectonic
is
directed
to
the
one
object
of
reconstituting
by
means
of
an
artistic
form
that
which
is
essentially
the
external
and
inorganic
environment
of
spirit
in
this
art
consequently
all
that
is
rectilinear
rightangled
circular
or
presents
uniformity
of
pillars
windows
arches
piers
vaults
and
so
forth
is
the
dominant
principle
of
unity
the
artistic
structure
of
architecture
is
not
erected
entirely
as
an
object
in
itself
but
rather
as
an
external
frame
embellishment
and
local
habitation
for
something
else
which
it
subserves
a
building
is
not
complete
until
it
has
received
the
statue
of
the
god
or
the
society
of
human
beings
who
make
their
dwelling
therein
an
artistic
work
of
this
kind
should
not
therefore
receive
all
or
indeed
the
main
attention
holding
this
in
our
minds
it
will
appear
obviously
to
the
purpose
that
uniformity
and
symmetry
should
be
here
the
prevailing
characteristic
of
the
structure
the
mind
passes
over
very
readily
one
that
is
throughout
uniform
and
will
not
trouble
itself
about
it
for
any
length
of
time
of
course
we
cannot
here
discuss
the
symbolical
significance
which
in
addition
to
that
above
examined
may
attach
to
architectural
form
in
its
immediate
relation
to
the
spiritual
content
it
envelops
and
emphasizes
with
a
positive
localization
the
same
principle
applies
to
the
art
of
making
gardens
which
we
may
define
as
a
specific
mode
of
architecture
in
so
far
at
least
as
an
artistic
conformation
is
imposed
on
external
nature370
in
the
garden
no
less
than
in
the
building
man
himself
is
the
main
object
there
are
two
distinct
types
in
this
art
of
gardenconstruction
the
one
adopts
as
its
main
principle
uniformity
and
symmetry
the
other
those
of
variety
and
irregularity
as
an
artistic
product
the
former
is
to
be
preferred
labyrinths
however
numerous
and
intricate
gardenbeds
in
endless
alternation
of
spiral
lines
bridges
over
water
usually
stagnant
with
every
conceivable
surprise
that
gothic
church
temples
chinese
pagodas
hermitages
urns
summerhouses
mounds
statues
may
claim
to
afford
usone
glance
and
only
one
glance
at
such
things
is
sufficient
the
vulgar
and
artificial
pretensions
of
it
all
is
too
patent
and
we
do
not
seek
for
another
it
is
quite
another
matter
when
we
cross
any
actual
situation
of
real
natural
beauty
which
has
not
at
least
been
exploited
expressly
for
our
enjoyment371
and
by
its
own
exceptional
merit
makes
an
irresistible
appeal
to
our
love
of
nature
and
our
sense
of
her
beauty
a
garden
laid
out
with
strict
reference
to
the
other
extreme
of
regularity
makes
no
such
attempts
at
surprises
but
permits
human
beings
to
appear
as
the
principal
object
in
the
external
framework
of
natural
beauty372
and
this
is
really
what
a
garden
should
be
again
in
the
art
of
painting
the
principle
of
uniformity
and
symmetry
is
clearly
visible
in
the
coordination
of
the
whole
the
grouping
of
the
figures
their
place
and
pose
in
the
composition
but
inasmuch
as
in
painting
the
animation
of
life
can
assert
itself
through
objects
in
a
far
profounder
degree
than
is
possible
in
architecture
we
find
that
it
presents
much
less
scope
for
the
purely
formal
unity
of
the
symmetrical
and
the
rule
of
uniformity
in
all
its
severity
is
for
the
most
part
to
be
traced
only
as
the
fundamental
principle
of
composition
in
the
earliest
phases
of
art
making
way
in
its
more
advanced
forms
to
the
freer
line
which
is
associated
in
our
minds
with
organic
form
rather
than
such
we
meet
with
in
the
pyramid
and
similar
geometrical
shapes
conformity
to
rule
and
symmetry
are
further
important
factors
in
the
composition
of
music
and
poetry
owing
to
the
incident
of
duration
in
the
length
of
tones
we
find
in
these
arts
an
aspect
of
what
is
intrinsically
a
purely
external
relation
which
is
incompatible
with
any
other
more
concrete
mode
of
presentation
if
we
take
the
spatial
condition
it
is
obvious
that
here
everything
which
lies
in
juxtaposition
can
be
seen
at
a
glance
it
is
otherwise
with
that
which
occurs
in
time
here
we
have
merely
a
succession
of
moments
every
one
of
which
takes
the
place
of
another
and
in
this
vanishing
procession
they
flow
on
for
ever
and
it
is
precisely
this
indeterminacy
which
it
is
the
function
of
musical
time
or
beat
to
inform
by
adding
thereto
a
real
definition
capable
of
uniform
repetition
in
this
way
the
indefinite
progression
is
subordinated
to
a
rational
principle
in
musical
time
we
have
a
power
which
exerts
such
a
fascination
upon
us
that
so
far
from
being
able
to
treat
it
with
indifference
we
not
unfrequently
find
ourselves
beating
time
quite
unconsciously
with
it
while
listening
this
constant
recurrence
of
equal
lengths
of
time
according
to
a
definite
measure
has
nothing
to
do
with
tones
and
their
duration
as
we
find
them
in
nature
tone
simply
as
musical
sound
and
time
abstractly
regarded
are
both
of
them
equally
indifferent
to
such
uniform
divisions
and
repetitions
musical
time
is
consequently
something
wholly
created
by
the
human
mind
and
indeed
there
is
more
than
a
suggestion
of
this
in
the
fact
that
in
listening
to
musical
time
we
are
at
once
impressed
with
the
conviction
that
we
have
in
this
control
of
time
according
to
fixed
rule
nothing
less
than
a
real
reflection
of
our
spiritual
nature
or
rather
that
of
the
fundamental
truth
of
selfidentity
an
illustration
absolutely
precise
of
the
way
in
which
the
subject
of
consciousness
applies
this
very
principle
of
uniformity
unity
with
itself
that
is
to
say
in
constant
recurrence
throughout
all
the
variety
and
most
intricate
multiplicity
of
experience
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
beat
of
musical
time
meets
with
such
a
startling
response
in
the
very
depths
of
our
being
gripping
hold
as
it
does
of
that
selfidentity
which
is
the
fundamental
abstract
principle
of
our
inmost
life
considered
in
this
relation
it
is
not
the
spiritual
content
not
the
concrete
soul
of
our
emotions
any
more
than
it
is
the
musical
tone
as
tone
which
appeals
to
us
so
intimately
it
is
simply
the
formal
unity
which
the
unity
of
consciousness
transfers
to
the
temporal
process
and
which
is
thus
reechoed
back
to
our
conscious
life
and
the
same
remarks
apply
to
the
measure
and
rhyme
of
poetry
the
sensuous
medium
is
here
too
in
the
same
way
carried
out
of
the
sphere
of
that
which
is
external
to
ourselves
and
at
once
asserts
there
the
presence
of
something
over
and
above
that
which
is
expressed
by
our
ordinary
consciousness
which
in
its
general
use
treats
the
timedivisions
of
tones
with
indifference
or
caprice
a
uniformity
of
similar
character
if
not
so
consistently
defined
may
be
traced
still
further
and
is
involved
in
the
living
content
of
poetry
itself
although
the
relation
here
is
quite
an
external
one
by
this
we
mean
that
in
an
epic
poem
or
a
drama
both
of
which
have
their
particular
subdivisions
cantos
or
acts
whatever
may
be
the
specific
term
applicable
there
is
an
approximate
principle
of
equality
apparent
in
the
division
of
subjectmatter
and
the
same
characteristic
is
generally
true
in
the
grouping
of
the
subject
in
pictures
although
such
should
not
appear
to
be
a
necessary
result
of
the
nature
of
the
subjectmatter
itself
nor
create
the
impression
that
this
uniform
distribution
is
due
to
any
controlling
principle
of
first
importance
conformity
to
rule
and
symmetry
which
are
the
abstract
unity
and
definition
of
all
that
is
essentially
spatial
and
its
configuration
no
less
than
of
all
which
is
external
under
temporal
condition
are
mainly
the
coordinating
principles
of
quantity
and
size
as
we
have
already
noticed
in
our
consideration
of
the
beauty
of
nature
all
that
which
does
not
in
virtue
of
its
own
specific
medium373
strictly
form
part
of
external
extension
is
consequently
freed
from
the
range
of
those
principles
which
assert
themselves
exclusively
in
the
relations
of
quantity
and
are
determined
through
relations
of
deeper
significance
and
the
unity
which
coordinates
them
it
follows
from
this
that
the
further
art
embraces
subjectmatter
which
is
independent
of
the
external
condition
so
much
the
less
significant
the
principle
of
uniformity
becomes
in
the
coordination
of
that
arts
subjectmatter
and
the
more
completely
is
it
restricted
to
a
subordinate
position
it
will
be
perhaps
advisable
here
to
close
the
above
discussion
of
symmetry
with
a
few
general
observations
upon
harmony
the
relation
of
harmony
is
no
longer
one
to
mere
quantity
but
rather
one
to
essential
distinctions
of
quality
differences
of
tone
that
is
to
say
which
do
not
persist
against
each
other
in
their
native
opposition
but
as
harmony
or
music
have
to
be
brought
into
concord
in
music
we
find
that
the
relation
of
the
tonic
to
the
mediant
and
dominant
notes
of
the
scale
is
no
relation
of
bare
quantity374
but
implies
the
presence
of
tones
whose
difference
is
essentially
a
qualitative
difference
which
that
is
to
say
combine
naturally
in
a
unity
rather
than
continue
to
assert
their
distinguishing
timbre
in
all
its
glaring
antithesis
and
contradiction
the
true
discord
on
the
contrary
requires
its
harmonic
resolution
the
same
qualitative
consistency
is
to
be
found
in
the
harmony
of
colour
in
reference
to
which
it
is
likewise
one
of
the
requirements
of
art
that
it
should
neither
manifest
itself
in
a
picture
as
a
motley
and
haphazard
juxtaposition
of
pigments
nor
as
a
neutral
surface
whereon
all
fundamental
distinction
is
dissolved375
but
as
the
artistic
expression
of
a
whole
in
which
essential
contrast
is
mediated
through
some
principle
of
harmonious
unity
furthermore
we
observe
that
harmony
contains
in
itself
a
definite
number
of
contrasted
differences
which
have
naturally
a
particular
significance
of
their
own
thus
we
find
under
the
differentiation
of
colour
a
definite
number
known
as
the
cardinal
colours
which
are
primary
derivatives
of
the
fundamental
notion
of
colour
and
are
not
due
to
accidental
composition
harmony
consists
in
bringing
together
a
number
of
positive
colours
such
as
this
classification
implies
and
uniting
them
in
concordant
unity
we
must
that
is
to
say
have
in
a
picture
not
merely
all
the
primary
colours
yellow
blue
green
and
red
present
but
also
a
harmonious
scheme
under
which
they
are
related
and
the
old
masters
have
without
direct
consciousness
of
the
principle
involved
paid
express
attention
to
this
completeness
of
effect
and
arrived
at
artistic
results
which
flowed
out
of
it
and
furthermore
for
the
very
reason
that
we
find
in
harmony
the
beginnings
of
a
release
from
the
bare
condition
of
externality
it
is
duly
qualified
to
absorb
and
express
a
spiritual
content
of
wider
significance
we
may
mark
an
illustration
of
this
in
the
way
the
old
masters
distinguished
between
the
drapery
of
their
principal
figures
and
of
those
of
less
importance
painting
that
of
the
former
in
elementary
colours
of
absolute
purity
but
only
conceding
to
that
of
the
rest
compound
varieties
the
mantle
of
the
virgin
mary
is
almost
always
blue
blue
in
its
assuaging
sense
of
tranquillity
is
accepted
as
the
counterfeit
of
the
repose
and
tenderness
of
the
heart
it
is
only
rarely
that
we
find
her
in
a
drapery
of
emphatic
red
b
the
second
aspect
of
externality
is
the
relation
it
occupies
directly
in
the
various
material
which
art
employs
in
the
various
media
of
its
presentations
the
unity
here
consists
in
the
clear
definition
and
homogeneousness
of
the
material
which
ought
not
to
deviate
in
the
direction
of
a
vague
characterization
and
mere
confusion
or
speaking
generally
give
us
the
impression
of
dirtiness
this
determinacy
is
also
entirely
dependent
upon
the
spatial
condition
that
is
to
say
upon
the
purity
of
its
delineation
the
distinctness
of
its
rectilinear
and
circular
lines
and
so
on
no
less
than
upon
a
consistent
definition
of
time
such
as
we
find
in
the
accurate
measure
of
the
musical
beat
it
depends
furthermore
on
the
translucency
both
of
specific
tones
and
colours
in
a
good
picture
we
shall
find
that
there
is
nothing
unclean
or
dirty376
in
the
colours
employed
but
everything
is
clear
and
asserts
itself
openly
for
what
it
is
the
directness
of
its
purity
is
in
fact
that
which
constitutes
the
lovely
impression
of
colour
upon
our
sense
and
those
colours
which
are
most
direct
in
their
simplicity
such
as
a
yellow
which
has
no
dash
of
green
in
it
or
a
red
that
is
wholly
independent
of
blue
or
yellow
produce
the
most
emphatic
effect
on
the
other
hand
it
is
obviously
more
difficult
to
maintain
a
harmony
of
the
whole
when
colours
are
thus
contrasted
in
all
their
pristine
simplicity
yet
in
despite
of
this
these
essentially
simple
colours
form
the
foundation
of
every
true
colour
scheme
and
although
it
may
be
impossible
to
dispense
with
a
considerable
use
of
their
compounds
even
these
should
not
be
allowed
to
appear
in
one
dead
and
dull
interfusion
but
with
their
simple
and
luminous
derivations
shining
through
them377
otherwise
instead
of
the
clear
lambency
of
colour
we
shall
get
nothing
but
a
muddy
residuum
we
shall
find
that
the
same
thing
is
necessary
in
the
timbre
of
musical
tone
in
the
case
of
strings
whether
of
metal
or
catgut
it
is
the
vibration
of
the
material
and
moreover
of
a
material
of
definite
tension
and
length
which
educes
the
musical
note
if
the
tension
is
insufficient
or
the
length
of
the
string
which
is
struck
is
not
the
right
one
the
tone
inevitably
loses
its
clearness
of
definition
rings
false
as
we
say
owing
to
the
interfusion
with
it
of
other
tones378
we
have
the
same
kind
of
result
when
a
purely
mechanical
fretting
or
scraping
is
suffered
to
interfere
with
the
purity
of
the
vibratory
motion
and
so
to
render
the
emitted
sound
confused
and
harsh
in
the
same
way
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
the
art
of
singing
that
the
human
voice
should
be
produced
from
throat
and
chest
freely
and
with
purest
intonation
the
voice
should
be
heard
without
the
least
indication
of
its
organic
instrument
or
as
in
the
case
of
hoarseness
with
an
obstructive
accompaniment
the
singer
fails
to
repress
we
may
conclude
then
that
this
translucency
and
purity
free
from
all
admixture
with
anything
foreign
to
it
and
consistent
throughout
in
its
clearness
is
that
which
creates
the
beauty
of
tone
as
immediately
apprehended
by
our
senses
and
which
distinguishes
it
from
every
kind
of
mere
noise
and
we
may
add
further
it
is
this
which
in
human
speech
conspicuously
applies
to
the
articulation
of
the
vowels
a
language
which
enunciates
the
five
vowels
with
distinction
and
purity
as
is
strongly
the
case
in
the
italian
is
essentially
musical
and
adapted
to
song
the
diphthongs
on
the
contrary
always
produce
a
confused
tone
in
literature
little
attention
is
paid
to
the
direct
reproduction
of
folkdialects
we
find
them
rather
reduced
to
the
simplest
form
of
expression
in
actual
speech
however
this
clearness
of
intonation
only
too
often
entirely
disappears
so
that
we
find
and
markedly
so
in
the
case
of
dialects
such
as
the
south
german
swabian
and
swiss
men
actually
speak
with
an
articulation
of
sound
it
is
quite
impossible
to
write
down
we
do
not
regard
this
however
to
be
necessarily
a
defect
in
human
speech
but
rather
a
reflection
of
the
rawness
of
the
common
folk
and
here
we
must
close
our
observations
upon
that
external
aspect
of
art
which
from
the
fact
that
it
is
external
and
nothing
more
is
only
capable
of
receiving
an
external
and
abstract
unity
now
according
to
its
more
comprehensive
definition
it
is
the
concrete
individuality
of
the
ideal
impregnated
with
reason
which
takes
to
itself
externality
as
the
form
of
its
embodiment
and
moreover
in
such
a
way
that
the
external
semblance
which
is
thus
the
medium
of
its
expression
is
throughout
suffused
with
the
mind
inherent
in
this
concrete
individual
form
in
consequence
of
this
such
modes
of
relation
as
uniformity
symmetry
and
harmony
or
in
other
words
the
more
simple
determinations
of
the
sensuous
material
are
no
longer
adequate
this
defect
naturally
extends
our
inquiry
to
that
second
aspect
of
the
external
determination
of
the
ideal
already
stated
2
the
coalescence
of
the
concrete
ideal
with
its
external
reality
the
fundamental
truth
which
we
shall
endeavour
to
substantiate
before
everything
in
the
matter
which
now
immediately
engages
our
attention
is
this
that
man
is
under
an
obligation
to
make
himself
at
peace
and
at
home
in
the
environment
of
the
world
or
to
put
it
rather
differently
his
individuality
must
live
itself
into
nature
and
all
the
conditions
of
that
external
world
and
by
doing
so
assert
its
freedom
visibly
and
moreover
this
must
take
place
in
such
a
way
that
these
two
related
factors
that
is
on
the
one
side
the
entirety
of
his
inward
life
and
the
character
it
possesses
or
displays
in
all
conditions
or
actions
whatsoever
and
on
the
other
that
objective
entirety
of
external
existence
which
confronts
him
must
wholly
lose
the
appearance
of
two
worlds
which
are
either
indifferent
to
or
not
homogeneous
with379
each
other
and
forthwith
proclaim
themselves
as
harmoniously
related
and
identical
in
substance
this
externally
objective
world
must
in
so
far
as
it
is
the
reality
of
the
ideal
surrender
the
semblance
of
its
own
objective
selfsubsistency
and
stubbornness
in
order
that
its
fundamental
unity
with
that
to
which
it
supplies
the
external
and
particular
embodiment
may
be
exhibited
in
truth
to
establish
this
unity
with
more
conclusiveness
we
propose
now
to
examine
our
subject
under
three
different
heads
of
discussion
first
we
may
investigate
the
same
from
the
point
of
view
that
this
unity
which
binds
the
two
factors
already
defined
is
merely
a
bond
which
possesses
no
positive
reality380
but
is
merely
a
mysterious
and
secret
connection
both
in
its
origin
and
appearance
by
virtue
of
which
our
humanity
is
looped
together
with
its
environment
secondly
however
as
a
deduction
from
the
fact
that
it
is
the
concrete
spiritual
life
of
man
and
the
individuality
which
pertains
to
it
which
constitutes
the
point
of
departure
or
rather
the
essential
content
of
the
ideal
we
shall
further
examine
this
association
as
in
truth
the
creation
of
human
activity
itself
and
only
possible
as
such
a
creation
finally
we
shall
prove
that
this
unified
world
created
by
the
human
spirit
is
itself
a
complete
entirety
which
in
the
determinate
form
of
its
existence
is
objectively
valid
and
in
essential
relation
with
which
every
unit
of
our
common
humanity
who
is
actively
engaged
with
the
vital
concerns
of
art
must
infallibly
remain
in
opening
our
discussion
of
the
position
we
proposed
first
we
would
at
once
point
out
an
important
conclusion
involved
in
it
we
have
here
posited
that
the
environment
of
the
ideal
is
not
directly
due
to
human
activity
it
can
therefore
only
be
regarded
in
this
first
step
of
our
inquiry
as
something
external
to
man
that
is
to
say
nature
how
then
is
this
something
outside
man
to
be
exhibited
in
the
ideal
work
of
art
we
will
discuss
this
at
least
in
its
more
general
terms
and
here
too
draw
attention
to
three
aspects
of
importance

in
the
first
place
external
nature
so
far
as
the
reproduction
of
its
external
form
is
concerned
is
in
every
respect
a
reality
which
is
embodied
in
some
definite
shape
if
our
representation
is
in
every
respect
to
satisfy
really
all
that
is
implied
in
this
condition
it
must
be
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
phenomenal
truth
of
nature
we
have
however
already
drawn
attention
to
material
points
of
difference
between
the
truth
of
nature
and
its
reproduction
by
art
which
cannot
be
disregarded
we
may
however
observe
that
it
is
an
almost
universal
characteristic
of
the
great
masters
that
they
are
conspicuously
true
in
their
delineation
and
elaboration
of
the
broad
facts
of
nature
and
this
is
not
so
much
due
to
a
love
of
imitation
as
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
nature
is
not
merely
in
a
general
way
the
objective
facts
of
a
heaven
and
an
earth
with
humanity
suspended
as
it
were
in
a
vacuo
between
them
but
rather
that
the
emotional
life
and
activity
of
man
can
only
be
rightly
conceived
as
alive
and
operative
in
a
given
place
with
all
its
associations
of
streams
rivers
hills
mountains
plains
dales
and
forests
take
the
case
for
example
of
homer
who
is
not
at
all
a
poet
of
the
picturesque
in
natural
scenery
as
we
now
understand
it
we
shall
nevertheless
find
even
in
him
the
descriptions
and
indications
he
gives
us
of
actual
places
or
natural
features
such
as
the
rivers
scamander
or
simois
the
coast
and
bays
of
the
sea
and
so
forth
correspond
with
such
truth
to
nature
that
geographical
investigators
only
quite
recently
have
been
able
to
map
out
the
locality
to
which
he
refers
in
entire
accordance
with
his
descriptions
the
balladsingers
of
the
middle
ages
present
a
sordid381
contrast
to
him
in
this
respect
no
less
than
in
their
power
of
depicting
character
the
effect
of
their
productions
either
way
is
bald
jejune
and
nebulous
even
in
the
case
of
the
meistersingers
though
they
versify
old
biblical
stories
which
they
locate
in
jerusalem
and
elsewhere
it
is
little
more
than
the
bare
names
which
we
get
in
the
book
of
heroes382
the
effect
is
precisely
similar
otnith
rides
through
the
pineforest
fights
with
the
dragon
but
it
is
no
world
of
men
or
distinct
locality
we
can
recognize
and
our
imagination
is
consequently
in
this
respect
left
without
any
support
even
in
the
nibelungenlied
there
is
no
real
increase
of
local
interest
it
is
true
the
names
of
worms
the
rhine
and
the
danube
are
mentioned
but
practically
all
further
detail
is
omitted
and
the
result
is
as
barren
as
before
and
yet
it
is
clearly
through
this
very
clearness
of
definition
that
our
narration
becomes
individual
and
real
without
this
it
is
a
mere
abstraction
which
directly
gives
the
lie
to
the
concrete
reality
it
proposes
to
present

in
addition
to
these
fundamental
requirements
of
clear
definition
and
correspondence
with
the
natural
facts
a
certain
elaboration
of
detail
will
frequently
much
assist
us
in
presenting
the
external
aspects
of
a
picture
which
our
perception
or
imagination
can
readily
seize
unquestionably
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
particular
medium
in
which
the
several
arts
express
themselves
there
will
be
a
marked
difference
of
range
to
which
in
any
particular
case
this
process
may
be
carried
if
we
take
the
art
of
sculpture
for
example
we
shall
find
that
the
repose
and
universality
which
are
the
fundamental
features
of
its
characterization
are
less
consistent
with
this
elaboration
of
external
detail
than
is
the
case
in
some
other
arts
externality
is
here
neither
defined
as
a
particular
place
nor
a
particular
environment
but
is
entirely
concentrated
upon
such
details
as
drapery
arrangement
of
hair
dress
weapons
of
war
mode
of
seat
and
the
like
nay
more
the
actual
definition
of
many
figures
in
antique
sculpture
is
only
obtained
through
an
entirely
conventional
arrangement
of
drapery
or
hair
or
other
distinguishing
accessories
this
is
not
however
the
place
to
discuss
further
the
significance
of
the
conventional
it
is
obviously
outside
the
sphere
of
natural
fact
and
rather
related
to
the
contingent
or
to
put
the
matter
in
this
particular
case
more
fully
it
is
the
means
through
which
we
arrive
at
that
which
is
more
universal
and
persistent
in
our
final
artistic
effect
as
a
reverse
case
to
that
of
sculpture
the
subjectmatter
of
lyrical
poetry
is
preeminently
mans
emotional
life
for
this
reason
it
is
not
so
necessary
in
this
type
of
poetry
to
lay
stress
on
the
detail
of
actual
facts
even
when
reference
is
made
to
the
external
world
it
is
on
the
other
hand
part
of
the
function
of
epic
poetry
to
state
events
as
actual
facts
to
be
precise
as
to
the
place
where
actions
occurred
and
in
what
manner
they
were
performed
and
in
short
of
all
types
of
poetry
it
is
the
one
to
which
the
widest
latitude
and
the
closest
accuracy
of
local
detail
is
most
essential
and
furthermore
if
we
contrast
all
the
arts
together
in
this
respect
we
shall
find
that
not
one
of
them
is
by
virtue
of
its
medium383
so
exclusively
occupied
with
the
detail
of
external
nature
as
that
of
painting
at
the
same
time
we
must
add
a
word
that
applies
equally
to
all
of
them
whatever
the
definition
of
nature
may
be
it
never
ought
to
give
the
erroneous
impression
of
natures
prose
reality
that
is
to
say
as
the
immediate
imitation
of
such
nor
should
that
fulness
of
detail
which
is
devoted
to
the
spiritual
aspect
of
individual
life
and
its
events
be
carried
by
enthusiasm
out
of
the
due
relation
of
its
importance
to
the
whole
and
generally
we
may
affirm
of
both
that
such
exclusive
definition
ought
not
to
be
all
that
is
anywhere
presented
inasmuch
as
everywhere
in
a
work
of
art
that
which
is
a
natural
fact
should
only
receive
its
artistic
embodiment
in
close
relation
to
mans
spiritual
life

we
have
here
struck
the
very
note
we
wish
particularly
to
emphasize
we
have
already
remarked
that
there
are
two
essential
conditions
to
any
effective
presentation
of
a
real
personality
we
must
have
before
us
both
the
reflection
of
the
mans
inner
life
and
the
natural
environment
which
surrounds
him
and
in
order
that
this
external
surrounding
appear
as
one
that
is
truly
his
own
an
essential
bond
of
relation
must
be
established
between
him
and
it
one
which
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
is
part
of
his
own
spiritual
substance
where
we
may
doubtless
cross
many
traces
of
contingent
matter
and
yet
find
the
spiritual
bed
of
this
nexus
still
maintained
throughout
the
entire
spiritual
apparatus
of
the
heroes
of
epic
poetry
for
example
their
mode
of
life
that
is
opinions
emotions
and
all
that
they
do
we
ought
to
be
able
to
recognize
a
subtle
homogeneousness
a
harmonious
en
rapport
which
fuses
the
two
aspects
of
such
a
life
into
one
concordant
whole
the
arab
is
thus
united
with
nature
and
indeed
apart
from
his
sky
his
stars
his
torrid
deserts
his
tents
his
camels
and
his
horses
is
unintelligible
he
is
only
truly
himself
and
at
home
under
such
conditions
in
the
same
way
the
heroes
of
ossian
possess
in
the
highest
degree
an
intense
inward
life
but
in
their
very
gloominess
and
melancholy
they
appear
as
the
genuine
growth
of
their
hills
of
heather
whose
thistles
are
swept
by
the
wind
of
their
rainclouds
mists
mountains
and
dark
caves
the
physiognomy
of
the
conditions
under
which
they
live
reveals
to
us
as
nothing
else
can
the
secret
of
that
inner
life
of
emotion
which
is
lived
through
with
all
its
sadness
mourning
its
pains
its
battles
and
its
mistlike
apparitions
in
such
a
natural
setting
they
are
in
short
entirely
at
home
in
it
and
in
it
alone
such
considerations
supply
us
with
ample
ground
for
the
statement
we
let
fall
previously
unsupported
that
the
subjectmatter
of
history
offers
unrivalled
opportunities
for
perfecting
this
intimate
relation
between
the
two
aspects
of
human
life
we
have
been
discussing
and
enabling
us
to
carry
the
same
directly
into
the
minutest
particulars
very
rarely
indeed
are
we
likely
to
find
that
the
imagination
can
simply
through
its
own
initiative
create
such
a
harmony
although
we
ought
to
feel
its
presence
throughout
however
little
it
may
in
fact
have
produced
of
the
raw
material
it
combines
into
artistic
completeness
no
doubt
there
is
a
common
tendency
to
rate
what
we
fancy
is
the
free
creation
of
imaginative
genius
above
the
effort
of
assimilating
in
artistic
form
a
material
which
is
borrowed
but
it
is
for
all
that
quite
impossible
that
the
imagination
should
alone
create
that
harmonious
entente
the
unity
of
the
ideal
requires
in
the
consistent
and
defined
form
which
lies
before
us
in
actual
existence
where
national
traits
to
cite
the
examples
above
are
the
veritable
growth
of
such
a
harmony
and
here
we
close
our
consideration
of
the
principle
accordant
with
which
we
have
rendered
more
clear
that
aspect
of
the
unity
of
the
inner
life
with
its
natural
environment
which
we
posited
as
secret
or
potential
not
at
any
rate
directly
due
to
human
activity
b
the
second
phase
of
this
harmonious
relation
may
be
explained
more
positively
being
expressly
due
to
mans
own
activity
and
his
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
for
man
adapts
external
objects
to
his
own
uses
and
by
means
of
the
satisfaction
which
his
work
supplies
places
himself
in
a
harmonious
relation
to
them
in
contrast
therefore
to
our
first
indefinite384
and
in
fact
entirely
general
type
of
harmonious
association
the
present
one
is
directly
concerned
with
what
is
particular
as
exemplified
in
the
particular
needs
of
man
and
their
satisfaction
by
his
converting
to
his
use
such
natural
objects
as
he
may
require
the
range
of
his
wants
and
the
consequent
impulse
of
their
satisfaction
is
of
a
practically
unlimited
variety
yet
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
variety
of
nature
herself
simplification
is
therefore
inseparable
from
the
task
whereby
our
humanity
imposes
on
the
facts
of
nature
its
own
vital
purposes
and
interpenetrates
the
external
world
with
its
own
volitions
in
this
way
mans
environment
is
humanized
he
proves
by
his
own
acts
that
it
is
capable
of
satisfying
his
nature
and
is
unable
to
preserve
any
predominant
independence
over
against
him
here
at
last
by
virtue
that
is
of
his
own
productive
exertions
we
find
him
no
longer
in
a
merely
general
sense
of
the
term
but
actually
in
every
detail
of
his
particular
surroundings
a
real
centre
of
his
own
substance
and
at
home
the
fundamental
conception
which
it
is
most
important
to
emphasize
as
that
which
affects
art
throughout
in
its
relation
to
all
we
have
above
considered
may
be
thus
stated
if
we
look
closely
at
the
relative
position
man
occupies
in
all
the
infinite
variety
of
his
material
wants
desires
and
aims
we
shall
find
that
it
is
not
one
merely
of
general
significance
but
one
of
actual
dependence
the
absence
of
freedom
implied
in
this
relative
position
is
antagonistic
to
the
ideal
and
in
order
that
man
may
become
a
suitable
object
for
art
he
must
have
already
released
himself
from
the
travail
of
this
enforced
condition
and
thrown
off
the
chains
of
his
dependence
moreover
this
act
of
mutual
accommodation
when
we
trace
it
to
its
origin
may
strike
us
in
one
of
two
different
ways
either
he
may
conclude
that
nature
in
all
friendliness
on
her
own
part
supplies
man
with
what
he
needs
and
so
far
from
throwing
obstacles
in
the
path
of
his
interests
and
objects
rather
freely
gives
them
him
as
one
who
meets
him
half
way
wherever
he
goes
or
on
the
contrary
we
shall
not
fail
to
observe
that
our
humanity
has
wants
and
desires
whose
immediate
satisfaction
nature
is
quite
unable
to
secure
in
cases
that
fall
under
the
second
type
it
is
obvious
that
man
can
only
work
out
the
selfsatisfaction
vital
to
him
through
his
own
energies
he
must
take
possession
of
that
which
nature
possesses
set
to
rights
the
defects
which
appear
modify
their
form
removing
all
that
stands
in
his
way
with
adroitness
and
in
short
convert
natures
raw
material
into
means
through
which
he
will
be
able
to
attain
all
that
he
proposes
the
relation
in
which
the
unity
between
man
and
his
environment
will
be
most
conspicuous
must
be
sought
for
in
an
example
where
there
is
already
a
real
contact
between
them
where
that
is
to
say
human
ability
is
on
such
good
terms
with
the
amenability
of
nature
that
all
the
severity
of
a
conflict
between
them
as
unreconciled
forces
disappears
and
we
have
forthwith
the
completed
symphony
under
our
eyes
for
the
reasons
then
already
advanced
the
ideal
province
of
art
must
be
held
secure
from
the
bare
necessities
of
life
property
and
the
favour
of
circumstances
in
so
far
as
they
supply
a
condition
under
which
poverty
and
labour
vanish
not
merely
for
this
or
that
hour
but
for
the
most
part
altogether
are
for
this
reason
we
will
not
say
incompatible
with
art
but
rather
in
full
concurrence
with
the
ideal
yet
it
would
only
betray
a
real
lack
of
comprehension385
if
in
cases
where
the
conditions
of
our
art
compelled
us
to
consider
the
facts
of
life
in
all
their
multifold
variety
we
nevertheless
omitted
from
our
composition
all
reference
to
the
relation
in
which
human
life
is
placed
to
these
very
natural
constraints
it
is
true
enough
that
such
are
purely
finite
conditions
but
art
is
not
therefore
able
to
dispense
with
them
they
must
not
in
fact
even
be
treated
by
her
as
something
merely
bad
it
is
rather
her
function
to
reconcile
them
with
the
real
in
her
embracing
unity
and
indeed
the
finest
actions
and
opinions
which
she
reflects
on
her
mirror
if
we
consider
the
particular
form
of
the
determination
and
content
alone386
are
necessarily
limited
and
consequently
finite
that
i
find
it
necessary
to
provide
myself
with
nourishment
food
and
drink
a
house
to
live
in
and
clothing
to
wear
seats
to
sit
upon
and
everything
else
incidental
to
domestic
life
is
no
doubt
an
inevitable
concomitant
of
the
fact
that
i
live
in
the
world
but
the
life
that
only
i
myself
experience
within
me
permeates
this
external
aspect
of
my
life
so
completely
that
men
are
fain
to
clothe
and
arm
the
very
gods
themselves
and
to
picture
them
under
conditions
inseparable
from
a
variety
of
things
they
seek
to
possess
and
find
their
satisfaction
in
obtaining
in
short
for
art
to
be
possible
this
satisfaction
of
the
necessities
of
life
must
be
assured
to
us
or
to
take
an
example
where
this
is
not
so
there
is
that
of
adventurous
knights
who
only
secure
their
immunity
from
external
hardship
through
the
continued
success
of
their
enterprise
which
is
therefore
itself
but
a
contingency
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
prosperity
of
savages
is
contingent
upon
the
amenities
of
nature
the
conditions
in
both
cases
are
not
favourable
to
art
her
true
ideal
is
not
merely
to
be
found
where
our
humanity
is
barely
lifted
above
the
most
rigorous
condition
of
dependence
upon
the
smiles
or
frowns
of
nature
but
is
most
of
all
at
home
in
that
superfluity
which
suffers
it
in
conjunction
with
natures
bounty
to
expatiate
with
freedom
no
less
than
delight
the
above
remarks
are
obviously
of
very
general
application
two
considerations
however
of
a
somewhat
more
restricted
interest
may
be
deduced
from
them

the
first
of
these
relates
to
the
kind
of
use
to
which
mankind
put
the
objects
of
nature
in
seeking
for
a
satisfaction
which
is
wholly
aesthetic
or
due
to
some
habit
of
the
mind
everything
in
the
nature
of
ornament
and
finery
or
in
general
terms
everything
that
men
convert
to
their
use
for
the
sake
of
mere
show
comes
under
this
head
and
the
point
to
which
we
draw
attention
is
this
that
when
we
find
men
thus
decorating
themselves
no
less
than
their
immediate
surroundings
we
ought
not
so
much
to
conclude
that
all
that
they
thus
collect
together
from
natures
most
costly
and
beautiful
storehouse
whatever
may
most
attract
their
eyes
in
the
samewhether
it
be
gold
precious
stones
pearls
ivory
or
precious
raimentthat
all
this
unrivalled
rarity
and
brilliancy
in
short
is
that
which
for
its
own
sake
and
primarily
as
a
product
of
nature
interests
them
rather
their
interest
in
it
all
is
essentially
personal
as
a
thing
suitable
for
the
houses
they
live
in
or
for
that
which
they
most
love
and
honour
whether
it
be
their
rulers
their
temples
or
their
gods
a
man
selects
in
this
way
that
which
already
appears
to
him
as
externally
beautiful
pure
translucent
colour
glitter
of
metals
fragrant
woods
marble
and
all
the
rest
poetry
and
particularly
oriental
poetry
makes
a
willing
use
of
such
wealth
a
fact
we
may
even
illustrate
from
such
a
poem
as
the
nibelungenlied
and
generally
it
is
true
enough
that
art
in
such
matters
is
not
merely
content
with
a
general
description
of
the
beauty
or
value
of
such
fine
things
but
where
the
artistic
form
and
the
occasion
allows
will
describe
such
works
in
all
the
detail
of
their
workmanship
with
as
royal
a
bounty
as
the
works
themselves
there
was
no
stint
of
either
gold
or
ivory
on
the
statue
of
pallas
at
athens
or
that
of
zeus
at
olympia
and
the
temples
of
the
ancient
gods
the
churches
of
christendom
the
pictures
of
saints
and
the
palaces
of
kings
are
notable
illustrations
among
all
nations
that
possess
any
of
them
to
what
kind
of
service
splendour
and
brilliant
show
may
be
devoted
thus
have
nations
in
every
age
delighted
in
seeing
upon
their
gods
the
visible
presence
of
their
own
wealth
precisely
as
they
have
found
delight
in
the
splendour
of
their
princes
as
a
glory
they
still
possessed
though
ravished
from
themselves
we
all
know
of
course
that
type
of
moralist
who
is
only
too
ready
to
disturb
the
vision
of
such
an
enjoyment
we
shall
no
doubt
be
reminded
how
many
poor
athenians
the
aegis
of
pallas
could
have
supplied
with
a
hearty
meal
or
how
many
slaves
could
have
thus
been
liberated
and
doubtless
we
must
admit
that
in
the
case
of
the
ancient
world
no
less
than
in
days
more
near
to
our
own
wealth
all
that
has
been
lavished
on
temple
cloister
or
cathedral
or
other
objects
of
public
utility
has
been
expended
under
social
conditions
of
the
direst
need
to
many
nay
we
may
carry
such
melancholy
reflections
yet
further
and
find
in
them
a
condemnation
not
merely
of
particular
works
of
art
but
of
art
herself
and
all
that
she
gives
us
what
sums
of
money
are
involved
in
the
building
by
the
state
of
an
academy
of
arts
or
the
purchase
of
ancient
and
modern
works
of
art
and
the
appropriate
embellishment
of
public
galleries
theatres
and
museums
but
whatever
the
effect
of
such
reflections
may
be
upon
us
whether
ethical
or
otherwise
such
is
after
all
only
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
once
more
reminded
of
those
very
constraints
and
hardships
whose
removal
is
a
vital
condition
of
the
appearance
of
fine
art
the
appropriation
of
a
unique
sphere
in
its
life
for
the
exposition
of
its
artistic
treasures
which
stands
safe
above
the
stress
of
that
reality
to
which
it
contributes
so
largely
can
therefore
only
redound
to
the
glory
and
supreme
honour
of
any
people

but
further
mankind
is
not
merely
interested
in
the
adornment
of
individuals
and
the
environment
of
their
life
but
is
actively
employed
in
adapting
the
objects
of
nature
to
its
practical
needs
and
purposes
it
is
on
this
plane
that
we
come
into
contact
for
the
first
time
with
all
the
labour
and
struggle
which
the
dependence
of
our
humanity
upon
the
prose
of
its
finite
life
implies
and
the
question
inevitably
arises
how
far
all
that
is
involved
in
this
practical
effort
is
suitable
to
artistic
presentation

in
attempting
some
answer
to
this
problem
we
would
draw
attention
to
the
historical
fact
that
the
earliest
way
in
which
art
attempted
to
banish
all
the
prose
reality
of
human
life
was
the
conception
of
the
wellknown
golden
age
or
if
we
care
to
call
it
so
the
idyllic
state
in
this
we
have
nature
depicted
as
satisfying
mans
every
want
with
no
trouble
to
himself
while
he
for
his
part
enjoys
in
a
state
of
innocence
all
that
mead
wood
flocks
garden
shelter
and
so
forth
can
supply
him
with
nourishment
dwelling
and
all
other
comforts
incidental
to
such
a
life
of
the
passions
of
ambition
or
avarice
indeed
of
every
impulse
that
may
appear
to
run
counter
to
the
nobility
of
mans
spiritual
nature
we
hear
no
word
at
all
at
first
blush
no
doubt
a
state
of
this
description
may
strike
us
more
or
less
as
ideal
and
certain
types
of
art
limited
in
their
range
may
find
definite
satisfaction
in
presenting
us
with
a
picture
of
it
but
we
have
only
to
penetrate
further
below
the
surface
and
we
shall
quickly
have
enough
of
such
a
vision
the
writings
of
gessner
are
little
read
nowadays
and
when
we
do
read
them
we
find
in
such
little
satisfaction
the
truth
is
that
a
restricted
state
of
life
such
as
the
above
described
presupposes
a
very
elementary
stage
in
human
development
manhood
which
has
attained
to
any
real
fulness
of
spiritual
stature
is
moved
by
impulses
of
loftier
range
and
is
not
likely
to
be
satisfied
with
the
life
which
clings
closest
to
nature
and
its
immediate
products
in
such
idyllic
poverty
of
soul
no
man
ought
to
live
but
rather
to
accept
his
birthright
of
toil
that
which
his
spiritual
impulse
urges
him
forward
to
that
he
must
secure
through
his
own
activity
once
regard
the
matter
in
this
way
and
these
very
physical
wants
of
man
will
be
found
to
bring
into
being
a
wide
and
diverse
range
of
activities
implanting
in
him
the
conscious
sense
of
his
own
powers
from
the
heart
of
which
the
profounder
interests
and
forces
of
his
life
can
slowly
unravel
themselves
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
necessary
that
here
too
the
harmonious
relation
between
the
outward
and
inner
life
should
be
maintained
as
the
fundamental
principle
of
artistic
presentation
few
things
are
more
offensive
to
our
aesthetic
taste
than
to
find
in
a
work
of
art
the
severity
of
some
physical
disaster
portrayed
through
every
detail
of
horror
dante
flashes
on
us
the
starvation
of
ugolino
in
a
few
trenchant
strokes
when
a
gerstenberg
in
his
tragedy
of
ugolino
wrings
out
every
detail
of
the
catastrophe
to
the
last
drop
telling
us
precisely
how
first
ugolinos
two
sons
and
after
them
their
father
were
done
to
death
by
starvation
we
feel
at
once
that
the
subject
as
thus
handled
is
entirely
at
variance
with
the
principles
of
fine
art

we
shall
however
find
that
the
condition
of
life
which
offers
the
strongest
contrast
to
that
we
have
described
as
the
idyllic
state
we
will
call
it
the
generally
civilized
life387
presents
though
on
other
grounds
difficulties
to
an
ideal
exposition
which
are
equally
serious
in
a
culturestate
the
complexus
of
social
wants
and
labour
of
interests
and
all
that
may
go
to
satisfying
the
same
is
throughout
and
in
all
its
comprehensiveness
completely
evolved
every
individual
here
is
immersed
in
an
infinite
network
of
relations
with
other
units
of
the
whole
and
with
so
much
loss
to
his
complete
independence
what
he
himself
requires
for
himself
is
either
nothing
at
all
or
only
in
a
quite
insignificant
fraction
of
it
the
result
of
his
own
labour
add
to
this
the
tendency
of
all
a
mans
normal
activities
is
to
become
more
and
more
mechanical
we
find
too
at
the
heart
of
this
industrial
development
and
the
interchange
of
employment
and
rejection
of
human
labour
which
it
implies
on
the
one
hand
the
most
ruthless
conditions
of
poverty
and
on
the
other
a
class
which
raised
as
it
is
above
the
bare
necessities
of
existence
stands
out
in
relief
as
wealthy
entirely
released
from
all
toil
for
the
sake
of
a
subsistence
able
at
any
rate
to
devote
individual
attention
to
the
finer
interests
of
life
and
its
pathetic
contrasts
no
doubt
the
possession
of
such
a
superfluity
may
create
an
impression
as
though
for
the
favoured
few
the
constant
recurrence
of
a
position
of
dependence
had
passed
away
and
a
man
is
just
so
much
the
more
released
from
the
accidents
incidental
to
property
because
his
hands
are
at
length
free
from
the
grime
which
soils
them
in
securing
it
but
such
a
consolatory
reflection
will
never
make
a
man
thoroughly
at
home
in
all
that
immediately
surrounds
him
in
the
real
sense
that
such
is
the
garland
of
his
own
labour
for
he
is
the
centre
of
that
to
the
upraising
of
which
he
has
not
himself
been
instrumental
it
has
come
there
out
of
that
provision
store
which
was
already
full
without
him
which
quite
other
persons
and
for
the
most
part
in
a
quite
mechanical
and
therefore
formal
way
have
provided
and
to
which
he
is
only
introduced
after
a
long
series
of
effort
and
struggle
wholly
strange
to
himself

we
are
consequently
led
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
rather
a
third
type
of
human
society
a
society
which
we
may
place
halfway
between
the
idyllic
golden
age
and
the
burgher
state
in
its
fully
developed
industrial
form
which
is
most
fitted
to
be
the
subject
matter
of
ideal
art
we
have
already
analysed
this
state
of
society
in
another
connection
under
the
description
of
the
heroic
and
preeminently
ideal
worldcondition
the
heroic
age
is
no
longer
restricted
to
that
idyllic
garden
of
spiritual
attenuation
but
includes
within
its
borders
passions
and
aims
of
deeper
moment
and
yet
withal
that
which
in
the
circle
of
the
individual
life
touches
closest
the
satisfaction
of
each
mans
immediate
wants
is
still
the
entire
product
of
his
own
activity
moreover
the
means
of
nourishment
such
as
honey
milk
and
wine
are
less
complex
and
consequently
lend
themselves
more
readily
to
ideal
treatment388
a
diet
which
includes
coffee
brandy
and
such
like
luxuries
is
associated
in
our
minds
with
countless
industries
which
are
necessary
to
their
preparation
our
heroes
on
the
contrary

and
roast
their
own
food
break
in
their
own
chargers

the
makers
to
a
considerable
extent
of
all
their
household
gods
ploughs
armour
for
defence
shields
coats
of
mail
swords
spears
all
are
either
the
work
of
the
possessor
or
are
made
directly
under
his
supervision
in
a
condition
of
life
of
this
kind
a
man
necessarily
feels
that
in
all
the
things
he
makes
use
of
and
in
all
that
encircles
him
he
is
in
touch
with
something
produced
by
himself
that
in
contact
with
external
objects
he
is
in
contact
with
his
own
substance
rather
than
with
objects
which
emanate
from
a
world
strange
to
himself
and
outside
that
in
which
he
is
himself
master
it
is
of
course
assumed
that
all
the
energy
he
expends
upon
working
up
the
material
into
forms
adapted
for
his
use
is
not
so
much
troublesome
labour
but
a
work
which
through
the
satisfaction
it
brings
him
falls
easy
from
his
shoulders
a
work
in
short
which
he
can
carry
over
every
obstacle
to
success
we
find
a
society
of
this
type
in
homer
agamemnons
sceptre
is
a
family
staff
which
his
ancestor
himself

an
heirloom
to
his
descendants
odysseus

together
with
his
own

the
mighty

with
penelope
and
if
the
famous
weapons
of
achilles
are
no
work
of
his
own
we
only
find
the
various
and
interfused
array
of
his
own
activities
abated
that
a
god
hephaestus
himself
may
provide
them
at
the
request
of
his
mother
thetis
in
a
word
we
meet
everywhere
the
youthful
delight
in
novel
discovery
the
freshness
of
personal
possession
the
victorious
sense
of
enjoyment
everything
is
in
its
place
and
at
home
in
everything
a
man
discovers
the
energy
of
his
own
sinew
the
adroitness
of
his
own
hand
the
cunning
of
his
own
spirit
or
somewhat
that
follows
from
his
own
courage
and
bravery
in
this
way
and
by
this
alone
the
instruments
which
satisfy
our
human
sense
are
not
as
yet
relegated
to
a
merely
external
relation
but
men
have
before
them
the
living
process
of
the
instruments
themselves
the
vital
consciousness
of
the
human
worth
they
attach
to
them
and
they
find
it
there
inasmuch
as
for
them
they
are
not
mere
lifeless
things
or
things
which
habit
has
made
lifeless
but
creations
impregnated
with
their
own
energies
and
for
the
same
reason
we
find
here
an
idyllic
condition
of
things
it
is
true
but
not
in
that
restricted
sense
of
the
term
that
the
earth
and
her
streams
seas
forests
and
cattle
supply
to
mankind
their
sustaining
substance
while
man
himself
is
only
visible
to
us
as
a
passive
creature
limited
by
the
active
powers
which
support
him
and
their
enjoyment
rather
we
already
see
within
this
morningtime
of
human
life
deep
interests
at
work
in
relation
to
which
the
great
world
itself
is
but
a
subordinate
realm
the
ground
and
the
instrument
for
bringing
into
being
the
higher
aims
which
are
present
as
a
ground
and
environment
however
over
which
that
harmonious
concord
yet
withal
independence
of
both
sides
of
our
human
world
prevails
and
which
does
prevail
in
the
sight
of
all
for
this
reason
that
everything
there
exists
as
the
product
and
for
the
use
of
human
life
is
at
the

time
the
creation
and
enjoyment
of
the
man
who
creates
and
enjoys
its
use389

apply
such
a
mode
of

presentation

material
borrowed
from
more
recent
times
whose
completed
culture
offers
the
strongest
contrast
to
the
heroic
age
abovementioned
is
always
beset
with
extreme
difficulty
and
liable
to
failure
yet
for
all
that
goethe
in
his
hermann
and
dorothea
has
furnished
us
in
this
respect
with
an
admirable
masterpiece
here
an
attempt
will
only
be
made
to
elucidate
a
few
significant
points
by
contrasting
the
same
with
a
composition
of
similar
type
voss
in
his
famous
romance
louise
had
depicted
on
much
the
same
idyllic
lines
our
human
life
and
activity
in
a
quiet
circle
of
narrow
range
if
also
marked
with
independent
characteristics
of
its
own
the
country
parson
the
tobaccopipe
the
dressinggown
the
gardenbench
and
finally
our
coffeepot
have
all
of
them
here
important
parts
to
play
coffee
and
sugar
are
however
products
which
are
really
here
out
of
place
they
belong
to
an
entirely
different
world390
throughout
associated
with
all
the
varied
ramifications
of
commercial
and
textile
industries
this
circle
of
country
life
is
consequently
not
selfinclusive
in
the
beautiful
picture
of
hermann
and
dorothea
we
are
on
the
contrary
under
no
necessity
to
demand
such
a
consistency
as
we
already
have
pointed
out
in
another
connection
we
find
interwoven
with
the
main
threads
of
this
poem
which
is
no
doubt
in
its
prevailing
atmosphere
entirely
idyllic
the
great
political
interests
of
the
time
the
struggles
of
the
french
revolution
the
defence
of
the
fatherland
asserted
in
a
worthy
way
no
less
than
with
decision
the
more
limited
scope
of
family
life
in
a
little
country
town
is
not
so
presented
us
as
a
whole
which
can
even
possibly
remain
in
total
ignorance
of
that
mighty
wave
of
the
great
world
under
stress
of
a
real
cataclysm
of
events
which
is
the
view
we
are
given
of
the
pastor
in
the
louise
of
voss
in
goethes
poem
we
have
on
the
contrary
by
means
of
the
interfusion
of
these
great
worldmovements
within
which
the
idyllic
characters
and
events
are
portrayed
the
picture
of
a
life
with
a
typical
character
of
its
own
set
in
the
frame
of
a
world
of
more
significant
content
and
the
apothecary
who
is
here
presented
as
the
outandout
philistine
and
who
merely
lives
within
the
more
narrow
borders
of
that
country
lifes
surroundings
affected
by
that
only
is
excellently
sketched
for
us
with
the
good
heart
but
at
the
same
time
peevish
isolation
which
we
find
so
natural
add
to
this
in
that
which
most
closely
touches
the
life
of
the
characters
thus
portrayed
we
find
a
particular
emphasis
laid
on
the
fundamental
aspect
of
this
idyllic
life
as
previously
indicated
in
our
former
discussion
of
it
to
mention
one
point
only
we
may
observe
that
the
host
does
not
by
any
means
drink
coffee
with
his
guests
the
parson
and
the
apothecary
on
the
contrary
to
cite
a
line
or
two
carefully
brought
in
the
mother
the
sparkling
and
glorious
redwine
poured
in
the
clearcut
glasses
with
rimlets
all
polished
of
pewter
brought
in
the
greencoloured
rummers
those
goblets
most
fit
for
the
rhinewine
they
drink
in
the
fresh
air
what
has
been
grown
at
home
of
the
83
vintage
and
withal
in
glasses
that
as
homemade
are
just
the
right
ones
for
rhinewine
a
few
lines
further
on
our
fancy
is
yet
further
kindled
with
the
streams
of
the
rhine
river
and
its
dearlyloved
banks
and
we
are
even
introduced
to
the
vineyard
of
the
host
behind
the
house
itself
and
in
short
there
is
nothing
to
arrest
our
attention
outside
the
typical
circle
of
a
selfcontented
life
which
of
its
own
bounty
provides
for
its
wants
c
in
addition
to
both
these
types
of
human
environment
we
must
mention
yet
another
in
close
association
with
which
we
all
necessarily
live
it
is
no
other
than
the
universally
prevailing
spiritual
surroundings
of
our
life
whether
they
be
religious
legal
or
moral
the
organization
of
the
state
that
is
to
say
the
constitution
of
the
government
the
judicial
institutions
the
family
the
institutions
of
both
public
and
private
life
and
all
other
social
relations
for
the
ideal
character
is
not
merely
to
be
portrayed
in
its
relation
to
all
that
satisfies
material
wants
but
as
itself
a
focus
of
spiritual
interests
it
is
certainly
true
that
all
that
is
truly
substantive
divine
and
essentially
necessary
in
all
these
relations
is
fundamentally
an
envisagement
of
one
reality
in
the
objective
world
however
the
forms
under
which
this
reality
is
manifested
are
various
and
they
are
one
and
all
involved
in
that
which
is
wholly
contingent
in
particular
examples
and
the
conventional
usages
which
are
only
valid
for
definite
periods
of
time
and
distinct
nations
in
this
variety
of
form
all
the
interests
of
mens
spiritual
life
receive
an
external
embodiment
of
reality
with
which
every
man
is
confronted
in
the
customs
usages
and
habits
of
society
every
man
thereby
in
addition
to
possessing
a
selfexclusive
individuality
of
his
own
becomes
in
virtue
of
his
association
with
such
spiritual
realities
even
more
a
member
of
a
whole
cognate
with
and
vital
to
himself
than
as
a
unit
of
that
external
world
of
nature
with
which
he
is
similarly
conjoined
speaking
generally
we
may
attach
to
this
spiritual
association
of
human
life
very
much
the
same
terms
and
significance
we
have
already
discussed
in
the
foregoing
sections
consequently
we
will
for
the
present
pass
over
the
more
detailed
consideration
of
it
whose
most
important
features
will
apply
more
strictly
to
another
aspect
of
our
inquiry
and
will
then
be
more
appropriately
discussed
3
the
externality
of
the
ideal
work
of
art
in
its
relation
to
a
public
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
art
as
the
representation
of
the
ideal
must
embody
this
ideal
in
all
the
relations
to
external
reality
we
have
above
described
and
thereby
associate
the
inward
possessions
of
character
with
the
objective
world
a
work
of
art
however
much
in
form
it
may
be
a
selfincluding
and
harmonious
world
by
itself
exists
none
the
less
as
such
an
object
both
real
and
particular
not
for
itself
but
for
such
as
behold
and
enjoy
it
that
is
the
public
actors
for
example
in
the
representation
they
give
us
of
a
particular
drama
do
not
merely
enter
into
converse
with
one
another
but
appeal
directly
to
ourselves
their
audience
and
it
is
equally
important
that
they
make
themselves
intelligible
under
both
these
aspects
every
work
of
art
is
in
fact
a
direct
appeal
to
the
intelligence
of
everyone
who
confronts
it
now
it
is
indeed
true
that
the
real
ideal
as
envisaged
for
us
in
the
universal
interests
and
passions
of
its
gods
and
men
is
so
far
intelligible
to
everyone
as
it
gives
us
a
view
of
its
characters
within
some
typical
external
world
of
customs
usages
and
everything
else
that
characteristically
distinguishes
it
but
the
condition
of
art
we
have
above
formulated
makes
it
further
necessary
that
this
element
of
external
reality
is
not
merely
one
with
which
the
characters
thereby
represented
are
harmoniously
associated
but
must
be
also
one
within
which
we
ourselves
to
whom
the
work
is
addressed
feel
equally
at
home
the
appropriateness
of
the
external
environment
to
the
characters
enfolded
within
it
must
apply
with
equal
force
to
our
own
attitude
of
mind
in
regarding
both
but
it
so
happens
that
from
whatever
period
of
the
worlds
history
the
subjectmatter
of
a
work
of
art
may
be
borrowed
it
will
be
sure
to
contain
essential
features
which
are
quite
distinct
from
those
which
specifically
determine
other
nations
and
periods
in
other
words
artists
of
every
description
whether
they
be
poets
painters
sculptors
or
musicians
select
subjectmatter
from
the
past
which
in
their
particular
state
of
culture
and
intelligence
ethical
customs
usages
and
the
form
of
their
government
differ
from
the
civilization
of
the
times
they
live
in
moreover
as
we
have
already
observed
this
return
upon
the
past
possesses
the
considerable
advantage
that
in
having
thus
recourse
to
memory
instead
of
being
face
to
face
with
all
the
facts
of
the
present
there
is
an
appreciable
diminution
of
the
material
from
which
the
artist
selects
his
subject
and
this
he
cannot
readily
dispense
with
at
the
same
time
the
artist
belongs
only
to
his
own
century
and
it
is
in
the
ethical
customs
modes
of
conception
and
generally
the
intellectual
outlook
of
that
he
lives
the
homeric
poems
homer
to
take
him
for
once
as
the
individual
creator
of
both
iliad
and
odyssey
may
have
actually
lived
through
or
he
may
not
but
in
any
case
they
are
at
least
four
hundred
years
later391
than
the
time
of
the
trojan
war
and
further
a
period
twice
as
long
separates
the
great
greek
tragedians
from
the
days
of
the
ancient
heroes
who
as
translated
into
the
atmosphere
of
their
own
time
form
the
subjectmatter
of
their
poetry
it
is
just
the
same
in
the
case
of
the
niebelungenlied
and
the
artist
who
finally
fused
together
the
various
saga
which
that
poem
contains
into
one
homogeneous
work
we
may
no
doubt
admit
that
the
artist
finds
himself
entirely
on
congenial
ground
when
dealing
with
everything
truly
pathetic
either
in
the
history
of
gods
or
men
but
the
external
and
actual
conditions
of
that
ancient
world
whose
characters
and
actions
he
endeavours
to
portray
have
altered
in
essential
features
and
become
consequently
strange
to
him
and
further
than
this
a
poet
creates
for
the
sake
of
a
public
and
primarily
for
his
own
nation
and
his
time
both
of
which
should
be
able
to
enter
into
such
a
work
of
art
with
intelligence
and
feel
at
home
in
it
the
most
genuine
works
of
art
no
doubt
assert
a
further
claim
to
immortality
a
hope
that
they
may
continue
to
be
a
source
of
delight
to
all
times
and
nations
but
even
in
the
case
of
works
of
the
highest
class
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
nations
and
times
situated
far
away
from
those
which
produced
them
can
only
fully
apprehend
them
with
the
assistance
of
an
extensive
apparatus
of
geographical
historical
and
it
may
be
even
philosophical
knowledge
and
the
results
of
much
critical
investigation
bearing
in
mind
these
fundamental
and
to
some
extent
incompatible
differences
which
characterize
the
various
points
of
view
from
which
a
work
of
art
must
be
regarded
the
question
arises
what
kind
of
form
relatively
to
its
external
framework
of
locality
custom
usage
and
generally
any
and
every
condition
of
religious
political
or
ethical
significance
a
particular
work
of
art
should
receive
should
an
artist
suffer
his
own
times
to
pass
from
his
mind
altogether
and
attempt
only
to
secure
the
substantial
appearance
of
the
past
and
what
actually
then
existed
so
that
his
work
become
simply
a
true
portrayal
of
that
or
is
he
not
merely
justified
but
rather
under
an
obligation
to
pay
an
exclusive
attention
to
his
own
nation
and
the
life
around
him
elaborating
his
work
with
express
regard
to
the
principle
that
it
should
stand
in
harmonious
relation
to
his
own
times
or
to
put
the
same
thing
in
rather
more
technical
language
we
may
propound
the
problem
thus
is
the
subjectmatter
of
a
work
of
art
to
be
objectively
valid
in
its
content
as
one
entirely
appropriate
historically
considered
or
should
such
matter
be
treated
subjectively
that
is
in
complete
subordination
to
the
artists
personal
standpoint
relatively
to
the
culture
and
social
conditions
of
his
own
time
we
would
rather
observe
that
both
these
positions
if
thus
pressed
unduly
land
us
in
extreme
conclusions
equally
false
and
we
propose
now
to
examine
them
briefly
that
we
may
by
their
means
elucidate
a
more
satisfactory
theory
and
we
would
consider
three
fundamental
aspects
which
this
problem
suggests
we
will
first
examine
what
is
implied
in
the
above
subjective
assertion
of
the
particular
culture
of
the
artists
own
time
secondly
there
is
the
question
what
may
be
regarded
as
exclusively
and
objectively
true
when
we
refer
to
the
past
thirdly
we
have
to
consider
what
may
still
be
objectively
valid
in
the
true
sense
though
we
still
have
a
representation
and
appropriation
of
material
borrowed
from
a
time

to
that
of
the
artists
a
now
to
start
with
if
we
consider
this
purely
subjective
assertion
it
is
obvious
that
when
we
press
the
position
closely
we
are
finally
driven
to
exclude
the
objective
embodiment
of
the
past
altogether
and
to
maintain
that
artistic
representation
is
exclusively
concerned
with
the
appearance
of
present
times

such
a
result
may
be
doubtless
under
one
aspect
of
it
presented
by
mere
ignorance
of
the
past
it
is
then
rather
the
result
of
a
navet
which
is
unable
to
feel
the
contradiction
between
the
object
itself
and
the
representation
given
or
at
least
fails
to
bring
the
same
to
consciousness
such
a
form
of
artistic
presentation
is
therefore
fundamentally
due
to
lack
of
sufficient
culture
we
could
hardly
wish
for
a
more
vivid
illustration
of
this
than
we
find
in
the
nave
productions
of
hans
sachs
who
has
no
doubt
with
a
vivid
freshness
of
imaginative
vigour
and
spirit
as
we
may
truly
say
domesticated
among

as

a
school
in
which

of

the

as
any
pedagogue
of

might
have
done

catechizes
them
upon
the
ten
commandments

abel

his
lesson

and
good

replies
to
his

think
of

when
it
is

honour

father
and

and
so
forth
a
representation
of
much
the
same
crude
simplicity
having
for
its
subject
the
tale
of
our
lords

to
be
carried
out
in

since

been
resuscitated

portrayed
in
the
character
of
an
insolent
rough
and
arrogant
official
the
common
soldiers
much
in
the
same
familiar
way
our
own
might
offer
christ
surreptitiously
a
pinch
of
tobacco
he
disdains
it
and
they
flatten
it
out
on
his
nose
vulgarity
finds
all
the
more
jest
in
such
an
incident
for
the
reason
that
it
wholly
conforms
to
its
notions
of
piety
and
reverence
indeed
calls
up
such
feelings
all
the
more
readily
through
its
immediate
reference
to
that
which
it
finds
in
its
own
world
thereby
making
more
vivid
its
own
sense
of
devotional
fervour
no
doubt
there
is
a
certain
justification
for
this
mode
of
translating
so
to
speak
the
appearance
and
form
of
objective
history
into
modern
equivalents
such
as
we
have
found
in
our
literature
and
we
may
even
attach
a
kind
of
greatness
to
the
courage
of
hans
sachs
in
making
himself
so
familiar
with
god
almighty
and
those
old
religious
ideas
that
without
the
least
vestige
of
impiety
he
could
rivet
them
deep
within
the
conditions
of
our
most
commonplace
life
at
the
same
time
such
an
attempt
is
none
the
less
a
rude
intrusion
upon
our
feelings
and
indicates
lack
of
cultivation
inasmuch
as
it
not
merely
disallows
to
the
object
itself
a
right
to
assert
itself
as
it
really
is
but
forces
upon
it
a
mode
of
appearance
so
directly
contrary
to
that
which
it
possesses
that
the
result
can
only
impress
us
as
an
emphatic
caricature

as
an
antithesis
to
the
above
type
of
subjectivity
we
find
another
equally
supreme
asserting
itself
out
of
sheer
pride
in
its
own
culture
under
the
belief
that
the
views
peculiar
to
its
own
times
its
ethical
customs
and
social
conventions
are
those
alone
worth
preservation
or
acceptance
owing
to
a
bias
of
this
kind
it
is
quite
unable
to
enjoy
the
content
of
a
work
of
art
until
such
a
form
of
culture
prevails
in
it
an
illustration
of
this
latter
type
is
the
socalled
classical
good
taste
of
the
french
school
everything
that
is
here
attempted
must
forthwith
be
frenchified
and
all
that
it
presents
under
the
form
of
any
other
nationality
and
more
particularly
with
any
reference
to
the
middle
ages
is
voted
incorrect
and
barbarous
and
is
cast
on
one
side
with
absolute
contempt
voltaire
expressed
anything
but
the
truth
when
he
said
that
the
french
have
improved
the
works
of
the
ancient
world
what
they
have
done
is
to
nationalize
them
and
by
this
process
of
recasting
have
corrupted
them
with
every
kind
of
foreign
and
angular
quality
of
their
own
that
such
a
taste
as
theirs
could
develop
to
any
extent
requiring
as
it
did
throughout
a
culture
absolutely
based
on
court
etiquette
and
a
conformity
to
conventional
rule
and
generalization
in
both
the
meaning
and
mode
of
any
dramatic
work
indeed
we
shall
find
the
trail
of
this
abstraction
of
a
superfine
culture
visible
in
the
very
diction
of
their
poetry
not
a
poet
among
them
dare
venture
to
use
the
word
cochon
or
add
their
own
nomenclature
to
spoons
forks
and
a
thousand
other
simple
objects
consequently
we
have
roundabout
definitions
and
circumlocutions
we
cannot
have
our
spoons
and
forks
we
get
instead
an
instrument
of
the
hand
which
conveys
our
victuals
in
a
liquid
or
arid
state
to
the
mouth
and
this
by
no
means
stands
alone
and
with
all
its
refinement
their
taste
is
vulgar
to
a
degree
for
the
simple
truth
is
that
genuine
art
so
far
from
planing
away
and
polishing
its
content
to
one
flat
and
unruffled
surface
of
generalities
is
most
of
all
anxious
to
set
in
full
relief
all
that
makes
toward
the
welldefined
characterization
of
life
it
is
on
account
of
this
very
taste
that
the
french
can
make
less
of
shakespeare
than
any
other
poet
and
when
they
have
attempted
to
work
him
up
to
their
graces
they
have
clipped
off
from
him
precisely
that
portion
which
we
germans
find
nearest
to
our
hearts
for
the
same
reason
voltaire
makes
merry
over
pindar
because
he
has
made
the
remark


393
and
consequently
in
their
works
of
art
they
find
it
necessary
to
make
chinese
americans
or
the
heroes
of
greek
or
roman
antiquity
all
speak
in
one
tongue
and
in
one
mannerthat
of
their
french
court
achilles
for
instance
in
the
iphigenie
en
aulide394
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
french
prince
and
if
we
had
no
name
to
help
us
no
one
could
conceivably
discover
one
particle
of
achilles
in
him
it
is
true
that
in
the
theatrical
representation
of
this
drama
he
was
habited
as
a
greek
appeared
at
least
in
helmet
and
coat
of
mail
but
at
the
same
time
his
hair
was
curled
and
powdered
with
broad
hips
through
poschen395

red
claws

on

fastened
on
the
foot
with
coloured
ribbons
and
what
is
more
the
esther
of
racine
was
expressly
popular
in
the
time
of
louis
xiv
for
the
particular
reason
that
ahasuerus
on
his
first
entrance
on
the
stage
copied
the
appearance
of
louis
xiv
himself
when
he
entered
the
great
hall
of
audience
no
doubt
in
this
transcript
there
was
a
considerable
admixture
of
the
oriental
luxuriance
but
a
ahasuerus
he
was
none
the
less
fully
powdered
and
wearing
the
royal
mantle
of
ermine
and
followed
by
a
complete
retinue
of
curled
and
powdered
chamberlains

the
writing
of
history
in

is
not
unfrequently
conducted
on
very
much
the
same
principle
that
is
to
say
history
itself
and
the
real
objects
of
history
are
not
the
main
purpose
of
the
historian
whose
interest
is
rather
concentrated
either
on
giving
the
government
in
vogue
a
lesson
or
teaching
others
how
they
ought
to
detest
it
and
in
the
same
way
there
are
a
host
of
dramas
which
either
expressly
throughout
their
entire
content
or
in
passing
episodes
divert
the
attention
to
the
events
of
the
day

if
passages
occur
in
pieces
which
refer
to
former
times

anything
which
may
bear
on
matters
of
contemporary
interest
the
parallel
or
the
contrast
is
deliberately
emphasized
with
every
expression
of
enthusiasm

a
third
type
of
this
personal
treatment
by
the
artist
of
his
subjectmatter
may
be
sufficiently
described
as
the
separation
of
the
same
from
all
genuine
artistic
form
whether
it
be
characteristic
of
past
or
present
works
of
art
a
mode
of
production
in
fact
which
simply
presents
us
with
the
entirely
evanescent
colour
of
the
man
in
the
street
in
his
ordinary
everyday
action
and
vocation
without
adding
aught
to
the
same
in
other
words
we
may
describe
it
as
the
bare
counterpart
of
what
the
man
of
commonsense
is
conscious
in
the
prosaic
facts
of
life
that
and
nothing
more
in
such
an
atmosphere
of
prose
no
doubt
everyone
finds
himself
at
home
readily
enough
or
rather
he
will
only
not
find
himself
at
home
who
takes
up
such
a
work
with
some
definite
conception
of
that
which
the
very
conditions
of
a
work
of
art
demand
and
consequently
is
aware
that
it
is
precisely
from
this
type
of
handling
that
art
undertakes
to
liberate

kotzebue
in
his
day
obtained
all
his
popular
effects
through
compositions
of
this
kind
which
aimed
at
nothing
else
but
letting
the
general
public
both
see
and
hear
lifes

and
vexations

pocketing
of

in
their
naked
colours
everyone
might
here
recognize
his
own
household
or
at
least
that
of
some
relation
or
friend
might
see
at
a
glance
where
in
his
own
precious
circumstances
and
aims
of
life
the
shoe
pinched
an
originality
of
this
sort
necessarily
fails
to
stir
any
real
sense
or
idea
of
that
which
is
the
vital
content
of
a
work
of
art
however
much
it
may
awake
an
interest
for
its
productions
in
hearts
that
are
wont
to
ask
for
so
little
and
are
so
ready
to
put
up
with
the
commonplaces
of
socalled
ethical
reflections
we
may
conclude
then
that
the
artistic
presentation
of
the
facts
of
external
reality
under
any
one
of
these
three
types
just
examined
is
subjective
in
a
onesided
way
that
is
to
say
it
wholly
fails
to
present
us
with
any
adequate
form
of
that
objective
world
as
it
really
exists
b
we
next
propose
to
examine
a
mode
of
presentation
the
reverse
of
the
above
one
which
endeavours
to
restore
us
the
characters
and
events
of
the
past
so
far
as
may
be
with
every
local
detail
of
their
former
environment
no
less
than
any
and
every
ethical
or
other
particular
characteristic
which
formerly
distinguished
them
we
germans
have
particularly
come
to
the
front
in
this
class
of
work
as
a
rule
we
are
in
striking
contrast
to
the
french
the
most
painstaking
recorders
of
all
that
is
peculiar
in
nations
other
than
our
own
and
consequently
make
fidelity
to
the
characteristic
usages
dress
weapons
and
all
such
antiquarian
detail
appropriate
to
particular
epochs
and
localities
a
first
requisite
of
our
art
add
to
this
we
have
the
necessary
patience
to
put
ourselves
to
no
end
of
trouble
in
the
way
of
hard
study
in
order
that
we
may
thoroughly
enter
into
the
modes
of
thought
and
perception
which
belong
to
foreign
nations
and
centuries
distant
from
our
own
and
make
ourselves
thoroughly
conversant
with
all
their
peculiarities
this
power
of
looking
at
facts
from
many
and
diverse
points
of
view
in
order
to
both
apprehend
and
comprehend
the
spirit
of
every
kind
of
national
existence
makes
us
not
merely
tolerant
in
our
art
towards
all
that
strikes
us
as
exceptionally
strange
in
foreign
customs
but
clamorous
even
to
a
painful
degree
in
our
insistence
that
we
have
before
us
accurate
correspondence
with
objective
truth
down
to
the
most
insignificant
detail
the
french
are
no
doubt
full
of
resource
and
energetic
but
however
highly
educated
and
practical
men
they
may
be
such
qualities
do
not
increase
but
rather
diminish
the
patience
which
they
possess
for
quiet
and
exhaustive
study
criticism
is
always
of
first
importance
with
them
we
germans
on
the
contrary
are
by
nature
inclined
to
accept
any
picture
of
real
truth
for
what
it
is
and
particularly
this
is
so
with
foreign
works
of
art
from
whatever
part
of
natures
storehouse
such
may
come
whether
it
is
plants
or
other
creations
of
foreign
growth
implements
of
any
kind
or
form
dogs
and
cats
even
absurdities
we
accept
them
all
genially
and
the
result
of
this
is
we
are
able
to
be
on
excellent
terms
with
modes
of
thought
the
most
removed
from
our
own
ay
sacrificial
customs
legends
of
the
saints
and
all
the
extraordinary
follies
that
go
with
them
to
say
nothing
of
a
host
of
other
marvels
equally
surprising
and
for
the
same
reasons
it
only
appears
essentially
rational
that
in
attempting
to
represent
characters
in
action
we
should
make
their
conversation
and
pursuits
conformable
to
their
own
substance
that
is
to
say
in
strict
accord
with
the
times
when
they
lived
and
their
own
national
characteristics
whether
regarded
individually
or
in
association
with
each
other
this
fundamental
idea
that
the
objective
truth
of
a
work
of
art
is
established
by
virtue
of
the
type
of
historical
accuracy
above
described
has
obtained
currency
in
comparatively
recent
times
mainly
that
is
to
say
since
the
literary
work
of
frederick
von
schlegel
from
that
time
the
importance
of
a
first
principle
in
literary
criticism
has
attached
to
it
and
further
than
this
it
is
asserted
that
our
purely
personal
interest
should
above
all
restrict
itself
to
the
enjoyment
we
may
derive
from
historical
accuracy
of
this
kind
and
the
life
it
thus
reproduces
once
accept
these
hard
and
fast
rules
and
the
conclusion
is
obvious
that
we
are
allowed
no
additional
interest
of
any
superior
quality
which
an
enquiry
into
the
essential
significance
of
any
artistic
content
may
or
may
not
provide
for
us
any
more
than
we
are
permitted
to
derive
any
interest
more
vital
to
ourselves
from
aspects
of
such
a
work
directly
associated
with
the
culture
and
aims
of
our
own
times
it
is
much
on
these
lines
that
we
find
also
in
germany
where
the
enthusiasm
of
herder
in
this
direction
started
a
closer
attention
on
all
sides
to
the
volkslied
a
poetic
inundation
of
national
folksongs
imitating
native
tones
of
every
sort
of
nationality
whether
it
be
the
iroquois
latterday
greek
lap
turk
tartar
mongol
and
many
another
and
of
course
it
is
assumed
to
be
indicative
of
nothing
less
than
firstrate
genius396
to
possess
the
power
of
thus
diving
into
the
ways
and
ideas
of
other
folk
and
converting
all
we
discover
into
poetry
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
however
completely
your
poet
may
work
his
way
into
and
emotionally
realize
all
this
strange
kind
of
world
it
remains
and
must
continue
to
remain
for
that
public
to
whose
enjoyment
these
songs
are
addressed
as
something
very
much
aloof
from
it
the
truth
is
that
such
a
theory
if
pressed
to
its
abstract
logical
conclusion
limits
its
boundaries
solely
to
the
truth
of
history
in
its
formal
accuracy
and
by
doing
so
neglects
all
consideration
of
the
nature
of
arts
content
and
questions
relative
to
its
essential
significance
just
as
it
disregards
every
aspect
of
it
in
which
the
culture
and
resources
of
modern
thought
and
contemporary
life
are
asserted
but
it
is
as
impossible
to
detach
ourselves
from
the
truth
implied
in
this
theory
as
it
is
from
equally
important
truths
which
it
neglects
all
equally
claim
satisfaction
and
imperatively
force
upon
us
the
necessity
of
finding
a
further
solution
in
which
the
claims
of
historical
truth
may
be
reconciled
with
these
rival
aspects
of
truth
in
a
very
different
way
to
that
just
examined
and
this
brings
us
to
the
third
question
we
proposed
as
to
the
nature
of
that
objectivity
and
subjectivity
which
can
be
fully
sustained
together
as
the
reality
to
which
a
genuine
work
of
art
conforms
c
the
point
of
essential
importance
which
we
should
before
all
others
wish
to
emphasize
here
is
this
that
no
one
of
those
various
aspects
of
truth
we
have
above
indicated
should
be
allowed
a
predominant
significance
such
as
would
impair
the
relative
force
of
the
others
and
further
or
rather
notwithstanding
this
historical
accuracy
pure
and
simple
in
external
matters
such
as
local
conditions
customs
usages
and
social
institutions
generally
must
receive
in
a
work
of
art
their
due
place
if
a
subordinate
one
it
being
only
right
that
the
interest
of
mere
historical
truth
should
give
way
before
that
of
a
vitally
true
and
imperishable
content
for
the
present
no
less
than
the
past
we
cannot
perhaps
do
better
by
way
of
explaining
what
we
consider
to
be
the
true
form
of
artistic
representation
than
by
setting
up
in
contrast
a
few
examples
of
some
we
take
to
be
defective

now
to
start
with
the
presentation
of
the
characteristic
features
of
a
given
period
may
be
entirely
just
accurate
and
impregnated
with
life
nay
more
wholly
intelligible
to
a
modern
audience
and
notwithstanding
fail
to
escape
the
ordinary
atmosphere
of
prose
and
present
us
with
the
real
substance
of
poetry

trivial
to
a
degree
and
essentially
prosaic
all
we
get
from

just
the
ordinary
mans
way
of
seeing
things
and
reality
as
it
appears
to
him
or
rather
all
of
us
to
some
extent
we
find
the
same
tendency
in
many
another
of
goethes
youthful
productions
which
no
doubt
were
deliberately
directed
against
everything
which
previously
had
passed
for
the
rule
of
the
guild
and
which
sought
for
their
most
impressive
effect
by
means
of
the
nearness
made
clear
to
ourselves
an
impression
gained
by
the
extraordinary
grasp
with
which
the
poets
imagination
and
feeling
seized
upon
everything
but
the
nearness
was
itself
too
near
and
the
vital
content
in
part
so
petty
that
such
compositions
ran
constantly
into
mere
triviality
we
are
most
conscious
of
this
kind
of
triviality
in
dramatic
works
when
we
see
them
on
the
stage
it
is
then
that
after
being
worked
up
to
some
excitement
by
all
the
concomitants
of
a
theatrical
performance
lights
welldressed
folk
and
the
rest
of
it
we
expect
to
see
something
more
than
a
couple
of
peasants
and
troopers
and
a
glass
of
schnapps
thrown
in398
this
phase
has
mainly
found
its
admirers
in
readers
it
never
had
a
long
run
on
the
stage

if
we
now
consider
our
subject
from
an
opposite
point
of
view
it
may
be
admitted
that
we
can
sufficiently
make
ourselves
acquainted
with
and
assimilate
the
historical
content
of
a
former
mythology
and
all
that
is
most
strange
to
ourselves
in
earlier
conditions
of
statelife
and
national
custom
to
secure
through
such
an
intimacy
with
the
general
culture
then
prevailing
a
varied
knowledge
of
the
past
in
fact
this
acquaintance
with
the
art
mythology
literature
cultus
and
usages
of
antiquity
is
the
starting
point
of
our
present
system
of
education
every
schoolboy
knows
something
about
the
gods
and
heroes
of
greece
and
the
prominent
characters
in
ancient
history
it
is
therefore
quite
possible
in
so
far
as
they
really
enter
into
the
imaginative
life
of
our
own
times
that
we
may
find
enjoyment
in
the
imaginative
representation
of
such
characters
and
interests
it
is
further
impossible
to
predict
whether
or
no
such
an
intimacy
may
not
be
eventually
carried
equally
as
far
in
the
case
of
the
indian
egyptian
and
scandinavian
mythologies
we
may
further
observe
that
in
the
religious
conceptions
of
all
these
peoples
the
universal
god
is
presented
the
determinate
form
however
of
such
conceptions
that
is
to
say
the
particular
gods
of
greece
or
india
are
no
longer
true
for
us
as
so
personified
we
do
not
believe
in
their
existence
and
the
pleasure
we
take
in
them
is
derived
from
their
appeal
to
our
imagination
for
this
reason
they
stand
entirely
apart
from
our
deepest
emotional
life
and
we
can
imagine
nothing
more
empty
and
cold
than
such
exclamations
we
hear
only
too
often
in
opera
o
ye
gods
or
o
jupiter
or
even
o
isis
and
osiris
and
the
folly
of
it
all
reaches
its
height
when
we
have
the
wretched
saws
of
oracular
wisdom
thrown
inand
the
opera
can
seldom
get
along
without
thema
position
of
dignity
which
nowadays
for
the
first
time
in
tragic
drama
is
occupied
by
pure
folly
and
clairvoyance
the
same
criticism
applies
with
equal
truth
to
all
other
historical
material
relating
to
national
customs
laws
and
the
like
such
historical
fact
is
excellent
in
its
way
but
it
belongs
to
the
past
and
when
it
has
once
ceased
to
have
anything
in
common
with
present
life
it
necessarily
ceases
in
spite
of
all
our
knowledge
of
it
to
belong
to
us
we
have
in
short
no
interest399
in
what
has
passed
away
on
the
mere
ground
that
it
once
existed
what
is
historical
can
only
truly
be
said
to
belong
to
us
when
it
is
the
possession
of
the
nation
to
which
we
ourselves
belong
or
when
we
are
able
to
regard
the
present
as
in
a
general
way
casually
connected
with
the
events
in
question
to
whose
continuous
series
the
characters
or
actions
represented
are
united
by
a
bond
of
essential
membership
for
if
we
carefully
consider
the
matter
we
shall
find
that
the
mere
fact
of
being
formerly
bound
together
with
the
same
external
environment
and
people
to
which
we
ourselves
belong
is
not
sufficientrather
the
very
part
of
our
nation
must
present
features
in
still
closer
relation
to
the
conditions
life
and
existence
of
our
own
times
to
take
an
example
of
what
we
mean
we
find
ourselves
in
the
niebelungenlied
geographically
on
a
soil
that
belongs
to
us
still
but
the
burgundians
and
king
etzel
are
so
absolutely
cut
off
from
all
that
touches
our
present
civilization
and
every
interest
which
is
now
coincident
with
patriotism
that
without
borrowing
anything
from
the
learning
of
the
subject
it
is

simple
truth
to
say
we
feel
infinitely
more
at

no
doubt
in
his
enthusiasm
for
everything
that
concerned
the
fatherland
was
prompted
to
substitute
his
scandinavian
gods
for
those
of
hellenic
mythology
but
for
all
his
zeal
wotan
walhalla
and
freja
remain
mere
names
for
us
which
appeal
to
our
imaginations
and
patriotic
emotions
even
less
than
zeus
and
his
compeers
of
olympus
the
point
above
all
we
desire
to
emphasize
is
this
works
of
art
are
not
composed
primarily
for
the
mere
student
or
the
professor
but
with
the
express
purpose
that
they
shall
be
intelligible
on
their
face
and
a
source
of
enjoyment
without
any
one
having
to
undertake
first
a
circuitous
route
of
extensive
historical
investigation
for
art
is
not
addressed
to
a
small
and
select
circle
of
the
privileged
few
but
to
the
nation
at
large
what
moreover
is
generally
valid
for
a
work
of
art
applies
also
to
the
external
form
of
the
historical
reality
therein
portrayed
such
exposition
also
must
express
itself
with
clearness
open
to
the
common
apprehension
requiring
no
considerable
research
to
make
it
intelligible
must
be
clear
to
ourselves
as
representations
of
our
century
and
our
own
people
so
that
we
may
be
able
to
find
ourselves
entirely
at
home
in
it
and
not
have
before
us
a
world
foreign
to
that
we
live
in
if
not
actually
unintelligible

considerations
such
as
the
foregoing
have
already
brought
us
within
reach
of
the
truer
conception
of
the
objective
truth
of
art
and
the
mode
under
which
it
assimilates
the
material
of
past
history
we
propose
now
to
offer
further
illustrations
in
support
of
the
same

and
we
may
start
at
once
by
drawing
attention
to
a
characteristic
which
is
common
alike
to
the
genuine
national
poetry
of
all
peoples
and
in
every
period
of
past
history
namely
that
the
historical
and
formal
aspect
of
that
poetry
is
entirely
national
that
is
to
say
it
retains
nothing
incongruous
to
the
people
for
whom
it
is
composed
this
is
a
feature
shared
alike
by
the
great
epics
of
india
the
homeric
poems
and
the
greek
drama
sophocles
never
made
his
philoctetes
antigone
ajax
orestes
dipus
his
choregi
and
choruses
speak
in
the
speech
and
manner
that
would
have
been
entirely
appropriate
to
their
own
times
the
spaniards
have
written
their
romances
of
the
cid
under
the
same
guiding
principle
tasso
in
his
jerusalem
liberated
celebrated
the
universal
interests
of
catholic
christendom
camoens
the
poet
of
portugal
depicted
the
discovery
of
the
seaway
to
the
east
indies
round
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
all
the
infinitely
various
adventures
of
the
sea
heroes
that
made
it
possible
and
these
acts
of
daring
were
the
acts
of
his
own
people
shakespeare
threw
into
dramatic
form
the
tragic
history
of
his
own
country
and
even
a
voltaire
wrote
his
henriade
far
indeed
have
we
germans
strayed
from
the
path
thus
marked
for
us
when
we
hope
to
work
up
into
national
epics
histories
remote
from
our
own
which
carry
no
longer
with
them
a
national
interest
of
any
kind
bodmers
noachide
and
kloptocks
messias
have
started
a
new
fashion
of
their
own
ay
as
they
have
overturned
that
old
one
which
taught
us
that
it
redounds
to
a
nations
glory
to
have
its
homer
to
say
nothing
of
its
pindar
and
sophocles
those
biblical
stories
it
is
true
present
points
of
special
affinity
with
the
national
imagination
owing
to
our
close
acquaintance
with
the
old
and
new
testaments
but
the
historical
material
in
its
association
with
ancient
custom
and
the
like
remains
for
all
that
only
intelligible
to
the
savant
and
all
the
most
of
us
can
pick
up
from
such
epics
is
the
prosaic
interfusion
of
events
and
characters
which
in
such
a
process
of
translation
have
merely
some
novel
form
of
speech
thrust
into
their
mouths
and
the
final
result
can
only
impress
us
as
hollow
and
artificial

at
the
same
time
art
cannot
be
restricted
wholly
to
material
borrowed
from
one
nation
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
more
nationalities
have
come
into
contact
with
one
another
the
more
their
poets
have
looked
abroad
among
all
nations
and
times
for
the
subjectmatter
of
their
poems
but
however
this
may
be
the
case
it
is
none
the
less
an
error
to
suppose
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
poet
is
able
so
to
speak
to
live
into
times
aloof
from
his
own
at
once
stamps
him
as
a
man
of
creative
genius
it
is
more
to
the
point
to
recollect
that
this
historical
framework
must
in
the
coordination
of
a
poem
be
retained
only
in
strict
subordination
and
as
a
means
of
expressing
that
which
permanently
belongs
to
our
humanity
precisely
in
this
way
the
middle
ages
long
ago
borrowed
much
from
antiquity
but
so
absolutely
suffused
it
with
the
content
of
its
own
epoch
that
in
this
respect
verging
on
the
opposite
extreme
we
really
get
nothing
from
that
antiquity
but
the
bare
names
of
alexander
aeneas
and
the
emperor
octavius
first
in
importance
then
is
this
permanent
condition
of
true
art
immediate
intelligibility
it
will
be
found
an
invariable
truth
that
all
nations
have
emphasized
precisely
that
in
this
life
which
was
most
agreeable
to
their
artistic
sense
their
desire
being
always
to
find
what
was
most
intimate
to
themselves
their
life
and
existence
in
their
art
it
was
this
independent
flavour
of
patriotism
which
calderon
worked
into
such
characters
as
his
zenobia
and
semiramis
and
shakespeare
in
the
same
way
was
able
to
imprint
upon
the
most
varied
subjectmatter
the
hallmark
of
his
english
ancestry
although
he
knew
how
to
preserve
along
with
it
the
essential
traits
of
historical
characters
belonging
to
nations
foreign
to
his
own
the
roman
for
example
in
a
far
profounder
degree
than
was
possible
to
the
spanish
poets
even
the
greek
tragedians
had
their
eyes
constantly
directed
to
the
actual
conditions
of
their
times
and
the
particular
city
in
which
they
lived
the
dipus
colonus
in
its
local
references
is
not
merely
in
a
peculiar
way
associated
with
athens
but
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
dipus
dies
in
this
locality
at
once
indicates
him
as
the
future
preserver
of
that
city
in
somewhat
other
associations
the
eumenides
of
aeschylus
is
owing
to
the
decisive
sentence
of
the
areopagus
marked
by
an
interest
of
more
vital
interest
to
the
athenians401
on
the
other
hand
greek
mythology
despite
all
the
varied
and
oft
repeated
use
that
has
been
made
of
it
since
the
revival
of
the
arts
and
learning
has
never
fully
come
home
to
the
general
sense
of
modern
emotions
and
in
various
degrees
in
the
plastic
arts
and
still
more
in
poetry
despite
its
very
extensive
influence
here
has
failed
to
arouse
real
enthusiasm
no
one
thinks
now
of
writing
an
ode
to
venus
zeus
or
pallas402
sculpture
it
is
true
can
hardly
get
along
even
in
modern
times
without
the
assistance
of
the
greek
pantheon
but
for
that
very
reason
it
is
mainly
only
appreciated
by
and
intelligible
to
a
select
circle
of
cultivated
men
who
are
either
connoisseurs
or
critics
as
one
of
these
goethe
spared
no
pains
in
his
endeavour
to
arouse
in
contemporary
artists
an
enthusiasm
which
should
go
so
far
as
to
imitate
the
pictures
of
philostratus
but
for
the
most
part
his
pains
were
thrown
away
such
examples
of
the
work
of
antiquity
on
account
of
the
very
flavour
of
past
time
and
a
life
that
has
vanished
which
clings
to
them
remain
as
strange
to
contemporary
art
as
they
do
to
the
general
public
as
a
contrary
example
of
real
success
on
the
part
of
goethe
we
may
instance
the
far
profounder
insight
he
has
shown
us
during
the
later
period
of
his
poetic
activity
in
fusing
by
means
of
his
weststlicher
divan
the
colour
of
the
east
with
the
poetry
that
really
appeals
to
us
today
giving
to
the
orient
in
fact
its
modern
embodiment
in
this
process
of
assimilation
he
has
clearly
shown
himself
alive
to
the
fact
that
he
is
a
poet
of
the
west
and
a
german
as
well
and
consequently
while
preserving
the
fundamental
keynote
of
the
oriental
spirit
in
his
delineation
of
characters
and
situations
to
which
it
was
appropriate
was
able
at
the
same
time
fully
to
satisfy
the
claims
of
the
modern
spirit
and
those
of
his
own
personality
subject
to
such
reservations
it
is
undoubtedly
in
the
province
of
a
poet
to
borrow
his
material
from
remote
regions
past
centuries
and
foreign
nations
maintaining
in
their
broad
and
most
characteristic
outlines
the
historical
form
of
ancient
mythology
custom
and
institution
at
the
same
time
he
will
take
care
to
utilize
such
forms
only
as
the
external
frame
of
his
delineations
never
permitting
the
essential
content
of
such
productions
to
fall
into
any
disharmony
with
the
profounder
instincts
of
his
own
native
world
as
the
most
extraordinary
example
of
this
goethes
iphigenia
still
stands
without
a
rival
in
their
relation
to
such
a
transformation
the
several
arts
dispose
of
their
material
very
differently
in
the
lovepoems
of
lyrical
poetry
very
little
use
is
made
of
local
associations
depicted
with
historical
accuracy
the
emotional
situation
and
the
movement
of
sentiment
is
here
the
main
thing
we
receive
for
example
in
the
sonnets
of
petrarch
a
very
small
substratum
of
natural
fact
relatively
to
laura
hardly
anything
more
than
her
name
which
might
just
as
well
have
been
another
of
local
interest
we
get
the
barest
scraps
and
that
entirely
of
general
significance
such
as
the
existence
of
the
fountain
of
vaucluse
and
things
of
that
kind
epical
poetry
on
the
contrary
requires
the
greatest
detail
in
its
natural
descriptions
and
we
are
most
readily
pleased
with
their
historical
truth
provided
always
that
the
picture
is
both
clear
and
intelligible
the
use
of
the
external
truth
of
historical
facts
presents
the
greatest
pitfalls
to
dramatic
art
more
particularly
in
reference
to
its
theatrical
presentation
where
everything
is
directly
addressed
to
an
audience
or
purports
to
strike
upon
sense
with
the
vividness
of
life
so
that
we
are
willing
to
recognize
and
entrust
ourselves
therein
with
equal
directness
here
the
delineation
of
historical
truth
in
its
external
aspects
must
for
the
most
part
be
of
subsidiary
importance
in
fact
retain
little
more
than
the
framework
of
it
it
must
in
short
remain
true
to
that
natural
relation
we
find
in
lovepoetry
in
which
at
the
same
time
that
we
are
able
completely
to
sympathize
with
the
feelings
expressed
in
every
way
another
name
is
given
to
the
beloved
than
that
of
the
lady
most
loved
by
ourselves403
it
does
not
here
in
the
least
signify
whether
or
no
our
critics
fail
to
discover
absolute
precision
in
the
picture
presented
of
the
particular
manners
culture
and
emotional
expression
of
the
time
in
shakespeares
historical
dramas
we
find
a
great
deal
that
remains
strange
to
us
and
of
no
considerable
interest
we
are
contented
enough
on
a
mere
reading
but
in
the
theatre
our
enjoyment
ceases
critics
and
men
of
learning
no
doubt
stick
fast
to
their
idea
that
such
exquisite
scraps
of
genuine
history
should
be
presented
on
the
stage
on
their
own
merits
and
come
down
severely
upon
the
wretched
taste
of
the
public
when
it
lets
us
see
how
bored
it
is
over
such
things
unfortunately
a
work
of
art
and
the
direct
enjoyment
we
receive
from
it
is
in
no
sense
particularly
for
critics
or
savants
but
for
this
very
public
critics
have
really
no
reason
to
give
themselves
such
airs
they
are
after
all
but
units
of
this
public
and
the
mere
attention
to
historical
detail
can
be
of
as
little
serious
interest
to
them
as
any
other
members
of
it
for
this
reason
the
english
nowadays
in
their
theatrical
performances
only
include
such
scenes
from
the
shakespearean
drama
which
require
nothing
further
to
make
them
clear
and
intelligible
being
happily
free
from
the
pedantry
of
our
aesthetic
professors
who
held
that
all
that
is
most
remote
in
historical
incident
from
the
apprehension
of
an
average
audience
should
be
thrust
before
their
eyes
it
follows
also
from
our
view
of
the
matter
that
when
foreign
dramas
are
reproduced
on
the
stage
the
public
is
clearly
entitled
to
have
them
considerably
remodelled404
even
that
which
is
excellent
in
itself
may
require
some
alteration
no
doubt
it
will
be
contended
that
what
is
essentially
firstrate
art
retains
its
excellence
for
all
times
but
a
work
of
art
has
also
an
aspect
of
transitory
worth
which
yields
to
the
years
and
it
is
this
of
course
which
requires
remodelling
as
people
change
so
too
the
sense
of
beauty
alters
and
it
is
important
that
the
particular
public
before
whom
any
work
is
represented
should
feel
themselves
quite
at
home
in
the
whole
of
such
a
work
including
that
aspect
which
derives
all
its
significance
from
external
history
it
is
this
conditional
acceptance
of
historical
truth
which
at
once
explains
and
justifies
that
which
is
generally
known
in
art
as
anachronism
and
which
is
usually
attributed
to
artists
as
a
serious
defect
primarily
such
examples
of
anachronism
will
be
found
to
attach
to
matters
of
purely
external
interest
that
a
falstaff
should
talk
about
pistols
is
no
matter
of
consequence
whatever
the
case
is
more
serious
when
we
have
a
violin
placed
in
the
hands
of
orpheus
for
here
the
association
of
such
prehistorical
times
with
an
instrument
so
essentially
modern
as
the
violin
one
which
everybody
knows
was
not
invented
in
those
days
presents
too
glaring
a
violation
of
truth
for
this
reason
it
is
now
the
fashion
in
theatrical
circles
to
bestow
incredible
pains
and
care
upon
the
historical
accuracy
of
details
in
the
matter
of
costume
and
the
getting
up
of
a
piece
as
for
example
the
infinite
trouble
lavished
upon
the
historical
procession
in
the
maid
of
orleans405
such
efforts
are
in
the
majority
of
eases
lost
labour
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
only
concern
matters
of
relative
interest
or
points
that
might
be
wholly
passed
over
the
more
important
type
of
anachronisms
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
stage
costume
and
all
that
with
which
stage
business
is
concerned
but
consists
in
making
characters
express
their
emotions
and
ideas
venture
upon
soliloquies
and
actions
in
a
form
or
of
a
substance
which
absolutely
contradicts
the
conditions
of
their
times
and
culture
their
religious
and
general
preconceptions
it
is
common
to
apply
the
conception
of
natural
truth
to
such
examples
of
anachronism
in
other
words
to
say
that
it
is
unnatural
for
characters
to
speak
or
act
otherwise
than
they
would
have
spoken
and
acted
in
their
own
days
if
we
stick
however
too
closely
to
the
logic
of
this
naturalism
we
shall
only
land
ourselves
in
further
complications406
for
an
artist
in
depicting
the
emotional
life
with
all
that
results
from
it
and
the
fundamental
passions
that
belong
to
it
being
mainly
interested
in
the
affirmation
of
individuality
ought
not
merely
to
repeat
that
life
under
its
ordinary
daily
dress
it
is
rather
his
business
to
show
every
true
manifestation
of
pathos
in
the
particular
light
which
best
reveals
its
real
quality
the
whole
object
of
his
attainment
as
an
artist
is
not
merely
to
understand
what
is
of
vital
significance
in
the
truth
he
faces
but
to
be
able
to
give
it
the
precise
form
which
will
best
direct
our
own
eyes
and
ears
and
heart
to
his
own
discovery
to
attain
this
it
is
obvious
that
he
must
keep
in
view
the
particular
culture
of
his
own
time
no
less
than
all
its
various
powers
of
expression
in
the
time
of
the
trojan
war
the
kind
of
speech
in
general
use
and
indeed
the
whole
fabric
of
social
life
was
as
far
removed
from
the
type
of
culture
which
is
reflected
on
us
from
the
pages
of
the
iliad
as
the
mass
of
the
nation
and
the
preeminent
worthies
of
the
royal
houses
then
reigning
in
greece
were
separated
from
the
fully
developed
form
of
ideas
and
expression
such
as
arouse
our
wonder
when
we
read
our
aeschylus
or
behold
the
perfected
beauty
of
the
style
of
sophocles
a
violation
of
the
socalled
path
of
nature
of
this
kind
is
in
art
an
anachronism
implied
in
her
laws
the
inward
kernel
of
that
which
she
reveals
remains
unaffected
but
the
more
developed
power
at
the
artists
command
in
revealing
and
disclosing
this
essential
core
of
his
subject
renders
some
change
in
the
mode
of
its
expression
inevitable
it
is
a
wholly
different
matter
when
a
modification
of
this
kind
proceeds
so
far
as
to
impose
ideas
and
conceptions
of
a
later
form
of
the
religious
and
moral
consciousness
on
a
century
or
a
nation
whose
entire
spiritual
outlook
is
opposed
to
such
more
recent
conceptions
the
christian
religion
has
gathered
in
its
train
forms
of
the
moral
life
which
were
entirely
foreign
to
the
moral
consciousness
of
ancient
greece
that
inward
introspection
of
conscience
for
example
ever
on
the
alert
to
decide
the
ethical
significance
of
action
with
its
accompanying
remorse
and
repentance
first
appears
in
the
moral
culture
of
a
more
modern
date
the
heroic
character
knows
nothing
of
a
repentance
which
sets
itself
in
hostility
to
its
past
what
it
has
done
it
abides
by
orestes
does
not
repent
of
his
mothers
murder
the
furies
that
rise
out
of
the
shadow
of
his
action
pursue
him
no
doubt
but
the
eumenides
are
at
the
same
time
represented
as
universal
powers
and
not
as
voices
that
cry
out
to
him
from
his
own
conscience
simply
this
very
heart
and
substance
of
a
given
period
of
mans
history
a
poet
must
master
and
only
when
we
find
him
interfusing
with
this
central
core
of
reality
matter
that
directly
contradicts
it
is
he
guilty
of
any
truly
grave
anachronism
in
conclusion
then
we
may
say
that
it
is
indeed
part
of
the
poets
function
to
live
into
the
spirit
of
past
times
and
foreign
peoples
for
this
substance
of
their
life
if
it
be
truly
such
remains
a
possession
for
all
time
but
to
attempt
to
reflect
with
every
accuracy
of
detail
all
the
definition
of
that
external
show
now
buried
beneath
the
rust
of
antiquity
is
merely
the
effort
of
a
learning
essentially
childish
intent
on
preserving
what
is
itself
shadow
rather
than
substance
no
doubt
even
in
this
direction
the
truth
of
general
outlines
should
be
carefully
respected
but
never
to
such
lengths
as
would
compel
art
to
forfeit
her
claim
of
drawing
upon
the
fiction
of
her
invention
and
the
truth
of
fact
with
equal
impartiality

we
are
now
in
a
better
condition
to
understand
all
that
is
really
implied
in
the
assimilation
by
art
of
that
which
is
strange
in
the
external
features
of
remote
history
and
the
true
conception
of
the
objective
life
of
her
creations
a
work
of
art
must
primarily
enclose
for
us
within
its
embrace
the
higher
interests
of
spirit
and
volitional
power
all
that
is
essentially
human
and
possesses
real
weight
the
depths
that
is
to
say
of
mans
emotional
life
the
main
thing
of
all
is
that
this
embodied
content407
should
transpierce
all
purely
external
conditions
of
manifestation
should
ring
as
it
were
through
all
that
is
less
vital
in
its
significance408
this
fundamental
chord
of
truth
the
real
objectivity
therefore
unfolds
as
from
a
sheath
the
pathos
that
is
the
substantive
content
of
a
situation
unfolds
moreover
the
rich
and
powerful
personality
in
which
the
essential
phases
of
spirit
are
alive
and
find
their
realization
and
expression
for
such
embodiment
all
that
is
absolutely
indispensable
is
a
definition
and
determination
of
the
real
which
is
generally
suitable
to
the
object
thus
defined
and
which
requires
nothing
further
to
explain
it
if
we
have
once
got
hold
of
such
a
form
unfolded
in
strict
accordance
with
our
ideal
principle
then
we
have
a
work
of
art
essentially
objective
in
the
true
sense
and
the
question
whether
each
and
every
historical
detail
is
justified
is
of
no
further
importance
we
have
before
us
a
work
of
art
which
appeals
directly
to
our
inner
life
and
one
which
is
our
own
possession
once
possessed
of
that
and
we
may
take
as
much
as
we
please
of
that
element
of
the
form
which
lay
more
closely
to
periods
of
life
which
have
passed
but
the
eternal
foundation
is
that
which
appeals
to
all
men
in
all
places
which
is
carried
forward
with
a
power
that
never
wanes
or
fails
to
influence
us
and
it
does
so
because
the
objective
life
it
reveals
is
the
same
that
abounds
in
and
overflows
our
own
souls
that
which
is
merely
historical
in
the
appearance
is
on
the
contrary
the
element
that
vanishes
and
in
dealing
with
works
of
art
created
in
days
remote
from
our
own
we
must
do
our
best
to
resolve
the
discordance
and
indeed
must
be
fully
prepared
to
blot
out
from
our
vision
similar
defects
in
works
that
spring
from
our
own
times
thus
it
is
that
the
psalms
of
david
with
their
immortal
celebration
of
the
lord
in
his
goodness
and
the
wrath
of
his
almightiness
no
less
than
the
profound
sorrows
of
the
hebrew
prophets
as
they
face
babylon
and
zion
touch
men
with
the
same
force
today
as
they
did
of
old
time
nay
even
a
moral
diatribe
such
as
is
sung
by
sarastro
in
the
zauberflte
may
come
home
to
the
hearts
of
us
all
including
the
sons
of
egypt409
owing
to
the
soul
and
vitality
which
rings
through
its
melodies
and
we
may
add
that
every
individual
to
whom
a
work
of
art
objective
in
this
the
true
sense
is
presented
must
on
his
part
discard
his
own
false
prepossessions
wherein
he
merely
wishes
to
find
his
own
idiosyncrasies
repeated
on
the
first
reproduction
of
william
tell
it
appears
not
a
single
swiss
among
the
audience
was
satisfied
in
much
the
same
way
when
the
most
beautiful
lovesongs
have
been
sung
many
another
failing
to
find
therein
his
own
passions
reflected
has
presumed
to
think
the
beauty
untrue
to
life
just
as
so
many
more
whose
knowledge
of
love
is
confined
to
the
perusal
of
romances
have
imagined
that
the
lovegod
would
only
then
be
their
immortal
possession
when
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
precisely
the
same
emotions
and
situations
their
favourite
studies
had
propounded
c
the
artist
we
have
in
this
first
part
of
our
aesthetical
philosophy
examined
as
a
first
step
the
universal
idea
of
beauty
we
then
proceeded
to
inquire
in
what
respects
it
was
defective
in
its
existence
as
the
beauty
of
nature
and
after
thus
clearing
the
way
we
were
in
a
position
to
grasp
the
complete
notion
of
the
ideal
as
the
adequate
realization
of
beauty
we
developed
the
ideal
first
as
conceived
abstractly
according
to
the
general
notion
of
it
and
having
determined
that
were
assisted
thereby
to
elucidate
the
modes
of
its
particular
manifestations
inasmuch
however
as
a
work
of
art
has
its
origin
in
the
human
spirit
it
requires
the
pregnant
activity
of
an
individual
life
from
which
it
proceeds
and
as
the
creation
of
the
same
exists
for
others
that
is
a
public
which
is
emotionally
receptive
this
spiritual
and
informing
activity
is
the
imagination
of
the
artist
we
have
consequently
now
and
this
is
the
third
and
last
aspect
of
the
ideal
to
which
we
shall
refer
to
raise
the
question
how
it
comes
about
that
this
product
of
mens
inner
world
is
not
the
direct
and
native
growth410
of
that
world
but
receives
its
due
form
through
the
creative
impulse
of
particular
men
in
other
words
by
virtue
of
the
genius
and
talent
of
the
artist
at
the
same
time
we
must
admit
that
the
question
is
only
raised
that
we
may
be
able
to
add
the
statement
that
it
really
is
excluded
from
the
sphere
of
scientific
investigation
or
at
the
most
we
can
only
furnish
a
few
general
remarks
towards
its
solution
yet
it
is
undoubtedly
a
question
frequently
raised
this
namely
from
what
source
an
artist
receives
the
gift
and
faculty
of
conception
and
execution
with
which
he
creates
his
work
we
should
all
of
us
like
no
doubt
to
have
a
ready
prescription
a
recipe
of
what
we
must
exactly
do
what
conditions
we
must
impose
on
ourselves
to
produce
something
as
wonderful
we
would
emulate
cardinal
von
este
when
he
asked
ariosto
with
reference
to
his
raging
roland
but
master
louis
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
all
this
damned
stuff
from
raphael
replied
to
a
similar
question
in
a
letter
we
still
possess
that
he
was
hunting
after
a
certain
idea
the
more
obvious
aspects
of
artistic
activity
we
propose
to
examine
under
the
following
heads
of
discussion
first
we
will
give
our
definition
of
the
general
conception
of
artistic
genius
and
the
inspiration
it
implies
secondly
we
will
make
a
few
observations
on
the
objective
character
of
this
creative
activity
thirdly
we
will
endeavour
to
ascertain
in
virtue
of
what
real
artistic
originality
consists
1
imagination
genius
and
inspiration
before
inquiring
more
closely
into
the
meaning
of
the
term
genius
we
must
obviously
limit
the
field
within
which
we
propose
to
discuss
it
genius
is
an
expression
of
very
wide
connotation
and
is
used
not
merely
in
its
application
to
artists
but
equally
when
we
refer
to
great
generals
and
kings
as
also
to
the
heroic
captains
of
scientific
discovery
for
the
sake
of
simplification
we
would
once
more
discuss
the
distinctions
involved
under
a
triple
division
of
our
subjectmatter
a
the
imagination411
the
most
conspicuous
faculty
of
an
artist
which
arrests
our
attention
when
we
direct
it
expressly
upon
the
capacities
implied
in
artistic
productivity
is
the
imagination
and
we
must
be
careful
here
not
to
confuse
it
with
a
visionary
fancy
which
is
wholly
passive
the
imagination
creates

and
in
the
first
place
we
shall
find
that
this
creative
activity
carries
with
it
in
possession
and
endowment
a
peculiar
power
of
grasping
reality
and
the
forms
it
presents
all
that
through
the
channels
of
alert
eyes
and
ears
imprints
pictures
of
infinite
variety
caught
from
the
external
world
upon
the
mind
and
further
implies
an
exceptionally
retentive
memory
wherein
to
store
up
this
varied
world
of
innumerable
reflections
the
artist
therefore
in
this
initial
stage
of
our
analysis
is
not
merely
thrown
back
upon
images
of
his
own
creation
but
is
rather
compelled
to
turn
aside
from
the
dull
level
of
ideals
falsely
so
called
and
to
boldly
enter
the
fields
of
nature
and
life
to
attempt
art
or
poetry
merely
with
fanciful
ideas
of
our
own
is
always
a
suspicious
way
of
starting
on
our
journey
for
the
artist
must
mould
his
creations
from
the
abundance
of
his
life
and
by
no
means
from
the
overplus
of
abstract
generalities
it
is
not
as
in
philosophy
thoughts
but
the
real
external
forms
of
what
actually
exists
which
furnishes
the
material
for
artistic
production
in
contact
with
this
raw
material
to
work
upon
the
artist
must
feel
thoroughly
at
home
he
must
have
seen
much
heard
much
and
stored
away
a
great
deal
as
well
and
in
illustration
of
this
we
almost
invariably
find
that
a
great
personality
is
distinguished
by
a
capacious
memory
all
that
interests
mankind
he
will
lay
hold
of
and
the
more
profound
his
spirit
the
more
it
will
enlarge
the
field
of
its
interests
in
countless
directions
this
was
the
way
in
which
we
find
the
genius
of
goethe
first
opened
its
wings
and
throughout
his
life
the
circle
of
his
spirits
restless
horizon
broadened
and
broadened
this
peculiar
gift
of
receptiveness
this
interest
in
the
comprehension
of
facts
after
their
true
definitions
and
colour
their
steadfast
adherence
to
the
truth
of
experience
is
the
first
thing
we
look
for
in
a
great
artist
and
this
accurate
knowledge
of
the
truth
of
form
must
be
accompanied
in
equal
measure
by
a
proved
acquaintance
with
the
souls
of
men
the
passions
that
rise
in
the
heart
and
everything
that
it
yearns
and
strives
for
and
in
addition
to
this
twofold
armory
of
knowledge
he
must
understand
yet
further
all
the
various
ways
that
this
world
of
the
human
soul
expresses
itself
on
the
face
of
the
reality
which
confronts
his
senses
transpiercing
thus
the
outer
veil

but
in
the
second
place
this
imaginative
power
is
not
exhausted
with
merely
receiving
that
which
is
presented
to
the
senses
or
is
inferred
as
the
content
of
the
human
soul
the
ideal
work
of
art
does
not
merely
embrace
the
outward
semblance
of
the
inward
spirit
as
clothed
in
the
forms
of
its
actual
existence
but
should
rather
succeed
in
manifesting
the
essential
truth
and
reason
of
the
real
itself
this
element
of
reason
as
determined
in
the
particular
object
the
artist
has
selected
must
not
merely
be
pressed
in
his
own
consciousness
as
an
active
influence
but
must
already
have
been
reflected
upon
in
that
essential
and
rich
significance
which
brings
it
into
relation
with
the
entire
breadth
and
depth
of
reality
without
reflection
no
man
can
grasp
fully
the
wealth
that
is
in
him
and
it
is
consequently
an
inseparable
feature
of
any
great
work
of
art
that
everything
which
attaches
to
it
both
as
a
whole
and
in
its
detail
has
been
long
and
deeply
weighed
and
thought
out
no
artistic
work
of
real
sterling
value
can
be
thrown
off
with
any
mere
imaginative
tour
de
force412
we
do
not
of
course
suggest
that
the
artist
must
therefore
comprehend
in
the
form
of
philosophical
thought
this
essential
core
of
reason
in
his
experience
albeit
such
is
the
fundamental
rock
upon
which
religion
no
less
than
philosophy
and
art
is
based
philosophy
is
by
no
means
essential
to
his
outfit
and
in
fact
if
he
once
begins
to
think
about
things
as
a
philosopher
he
busies
himself
with
modes
of
thought
which
are
diametrically
opposed
to
that
which
should
engage
an
artists
attention
for
what
the
imagination
undertakes
to
do
and
only
to
do
is
not
to
bring
to
consciousness
this
inner
core
of
reason
in
the
form
of
general
propositions
and
conceptions
but
to
apprehend
it
clothed
in
the
concrete
form
of
actual
existence
and
individuality
all
that
ferments
within
his
life
the
artist
must
reproduce
in
the
body
and
envisagement
whose
connected
picture
and
general
outlines
he
has
already
assimilated
from
the
world
outside
making
such
so
far
subservient
to
his
creative
effort
that
they
in
their
turn
may
participate
in
the
truth
of
his
own
substance
and
enable
him
to
crown
it
with
complete
expression
in
this
interfusion
of
an
intelligible
content
with
an
embodiment
received
from
actual
existence
the
artist
will
avail
himself
of
the
ever
wakeful
circumspection
of
his
reflective
faculties
no
less
than
the
deep
resources
of
emotional
life
which
leave
the
stamp
of
vitality
on
his
work
it
is
consequently
but
one
more
sample
of
critical
aberration
to
imagine
that
poems
such
as
the
homeric
were
introduced
to
our
poet
in
his
sleep
without
intelligent
alertness
division
and
distinctions
of
each
part
as
related
to
the
whole
an
artist
will
be
unable
to
assert
his
mastery
over
any
form
whatsoever
that
he
may
wish
for
only
fools
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
genuine
artist
does
not
in
the
least
know
what
his
hands
and
senses
are
about
moreover
the
concentration
of
the
artists
emotional
life
on
each
aspect
of
his
work
is
also
as
necessary
to
its
success
as
the
concentration
of
his
mind
for
it
is
mainly
through
the
impression
of
emotion
which
permeates
and
gives
a
vital
colour
to
the
entire
work
that
the
artist
asserts
his
claim
to
the
substance
and
embodiment
of
his
creation
as
a
part
of
his
own
spiritual
substance
as
something
he
a
given
personality
may
peculiarly
call
his
own
for
the
external
aspect
of
his
work
the
mere
picture
of
it
as
we
may
say
tends
rather
to
place
us
outside
it
and
apart
it
is
the
emotional
energy
it
expresses
which
primarily
unites
it
with
affinity
to
our
very
souls
only
when
thus
understood
shall
we
be
able
to
realize
the
truth
that
an
artist
must
not
merely
have
much
looked
about
him
in
the
world
and
assimilated
a
rich
knowledge
both
of
its
outward
show
and
the
very
substance
of
its
life
but
further
must
himself
have
experienced
many
things
and
great
things
things
that
have
moved
him
to
the
quick
and
left
their
liferoots
in
his
own
heart
and
spirithe
must
as
we
say
have
gone
through
much
and
lived
abundantlybefore
he
will
find
himself
able
to
build
from
his
stores
in
the
concrete
types
of
his
art
something
approaching
lifes
unsounded
repletion
and
this
will
at
once
explain
and
justify
the
bluster
and
ferment
of
genius
in
its
youth
as
amply
reflected
in
the
lives
of
goethe
and
schiller
but
only
the
age
of
maturity
and
gray
hairs
will
bring
us
the
perfect
work
of
art
in
all
its
rounded
ripeness413
b
talent
and
genius
this
productive
activity
of
the
imagination
by
means
of
which
the
artist
gives
by
a
process
of
elaboration
to
that
which
is
essentially
rational
in
its
nature
a
real
embodiment
a
creation
more
his
own
than
anything
elsethis
is
what
is
usually
summarized
as
genius
and
talent

we
have
already
drawn
attention
to
those
characteristics
which
are
most
obviously
referable
to
genius
genius
is
the
general
capacity
of
creating
a
genuine
example
of
fine
art
no
less
than
the
energy
implied
in
the
execution
and
elaboration
of
the
same
moreover
this
capability
and
the
power
which
goes
with
it
is
essentially
the
property
of
a
human
soul
that
is
to
say
selfconscious
individuality
alone
is
able
to
create
in
this
sense
that
a
spiritual
creation
of
this
quality
is
just
what
it
sets
before
itself
to
produce
critics
intent
on
closer
definition
are
wont
to
distinguish
sharply
between
genius
and
talent
and
in
fact
they
are
not
absolutely
the
same
things
although
it
is
necessary
to
find
them
united
in
the
artist
who
would
give
us
artistic
work
of
the
highest
class
to
be
more
exact
art
in
so
far
as
it
generally
becomes
a
particular
art
and
is
exemplified
for
us
in
the
real
and
definite
appearance
of
its
products
requires
various
accomplishments
appropriate
to
the
peculiar
modes
of
its
realization
such
forms
of
executive
versatility
we
may
call
with
propriety
talent
as
we
may
say
that
anyone
possesses
a
talent
for
perfect
playing
on
the
violin
or
anyone
else
for
singing
but
a
mere
talent
for
this
or
that
can
only
effect
for
us
anything
really
good
in
the
so
to
speak
insulated
nooks
and
corners
of
art414
it
moreover
itself
requires
for
its
true
perfection
something
of
more
universal
artcapacity
as
also
that
soulanimation
something
more
which
is
essentially
the
hallmark
of
genius
talent
in
short
without
the
vital
spark
of
genius
never
gets
much
beyond
a
purely
mechanical
facility

it
is
also
an
opinion
very
commonly
held
that
superior
talent
and
genius
are
inborn
here
again
we
must
distinguish
for
if
there
is
a
sense
in
which
this
is
true
from
another
point
of
view
it
is
equally
mistaken
no
doubt
every
man
by
virtue
of
his
humanity
receives
at
his
birth
the
potential
gifts
of
religion
thought
and
science
in
other
words
he
would
not
strictly
be
a
man
if
he
did
not
already
possess
a
capacity
to
grasp
the
idea
of
a
supreme
being
and
generally
to
become
the
subject
of
a
thinking
consciousness
all
that
he
requires
to
gain
these
things
in
addition
to
the
fact
of
his
human
birth
are
education
culture
and
perseverance
with
art
however
the
matter
stands
differently
art
requires
specific
aptitude415
in
which
unquestionably
natural
endowment
plays
an
essential
part
as
that
is
to
say
beauty
is
itself
the
idea
realized
in
that
which
is
apprehended
as
real
by
the
senses
and
a
work
of
art
embodies
the
workings
of
spirit
in
a
form
of
existence
immediately
cognized
by
the
eye
and
the
ear
in
the
same
way
the
artist
must
discover
and
embody
the
content
of
his
art
not
in
the
exclusively
spiritual
form
of
thought
but
within
the
sphere
of
sensuous
perception
and
feeling
and
indeed
as
creator
in
actual
relation
to
a
given
sensuous
material
and
within
the
limits
of
the
same
this
artistic
creativeness
consequently
encloses
within
itself
as
art
does
throughout
the
aspect
of
immediacy
envisaged
with
the
directness
of
natures
own
creations
and
it
is
this
appearance
which
the
individual
is
unable
to
evolve
from
himself
but
has
to
find
it
if
he
finds
it
at
all
as
immediately
presented
to
him
herein
lies
the
significance
of
the
statement
and
herein
alone
that
genius
and
talent
are
innate
in
much
the
same
way
the
several
arts
adapt
themselves
as
by
a
kind
of
natural
affinity
to
particular
nations
song
and
melody
are
we
may
almost
say
the
birthgift
of
an
italian
with
our
northern
peoples
on
the
contrary
music416
and
the
opera
though
seriously
cultivated
and
with
great
success
are
as
far
from
being
a
real
home
growth
as
the
orange
trees
the
greeks
are
conspicuous
for
the
native
and
elaborate
beauty
of
their
epic
poetry
and
most
of
all
for
the
unique
perfection
of
their
sculpture
the
romans
never
possessed
an
art
that
was
in
any
strict
sense
exclusively
their
own
all
that
grew
into
blossom
on
their
soil
was
transplanted
from
the
gardens
of
greece
the
art
whose
growth
has
the
widest
natural
range
is
that
of
poetry
and
the
reason
of
this
is
that
in
it
we
require
least
to
draw
upon
a
sensuous
vehicle
for
its
expressed
presentment
within
the
province
of
poetry
the
folksong
is
most
of
all
native
to
a
people
and
inseparably
yoked
with
their
natural
conditions
for
this
very
reason
the
folksong
breaks
into
blossom
even
in
times
of
the
rudest
culture
and
for
the
most
part
retains
the
unconscious
simplicity
of
nature
herself
of
this
goethe
himself
is
an
example
though
he
produced
works
in
every
type
of
poetical
expression
his
first
songs
still
go
deepest
and
carry
least
dust
from
the
study
in
them
too
there
is
least
the
flavour
of
culture
the
latterday
greek
is
still
a
living
witness
to
a
people
whose
native
gift
it
is
both
to
write
poetry
and
sing
fauriel
has
published
a
collection
of
modern
greek
songs
taken
for
the
most
part
just
as
women
nurses
and
schoolgirls
were
heard
singing
them
who
could
not
for
the
world
understand
what
he
found
so
wonderful
in
them
and
this
is
a
good
illustration
of
the
way
that
we
find
art
and
its
specific
appearance
associate
itself
with
a
particular
national
type
in
the
same
way
the
art
of
improvization
is
more
than
anywhere
else
the
native
growth
of
italy
and
exemplified
there
with
quite
extraordinary
talent
an
italian
will
even
today
improvize
for
you
a
fiveact
drama
and
not
a
word
of
it
is
committed
to
memory
all
grows
up
out
of
his
experience
of
human
passions
and
situations
and
the
deeplyexcited
inspiration
of
the
moment
as
an
example
we
mention
the
fact
that
a
certain
poor
improvizer
after
rhapsodizing
in
this
way
for
a
considerable
time
and
then
finally
trudging
off
on
his
round
to
collect
his
pence
from
the
bystanders
in
a
battered
hat
was
still
in
such
a
fume
of
poetic
frenzy
that
he
could
not
bring
his
declamations
to
a
stop
waved
about
in
fact
so
lustily
with
his
arms
and
hands
that
in
the
end
all
the
money
he
had
begged
was
shaken
to
the
winds

it
is
thirdly417
a
characteristic
of
genius
that
it
should
possess
and
indeed
it
is
a
part
of
this
natural
endowment418
facility
in
creating
that
which
it
is
impelled
to
create
and
in
adapting
itself
to
the
technical
requirements
of
all
the
subsidiary
aspects
of
artistic
work
we
talk
for
instance
of
the
fetters
with
which
the
verse
measure
and
rhyme
shackle
a
poet
or
when
referring
to
a
painter
of
the
endless
difficulties
that
draughtsmanship
knowledge
of
tints
chiaroscuro
and
the
rest
fling
in
the
way
of
invention
and
execution
unquestionably
a
long
course
of
study
is
a
necessary
condition
of
success
in
all
the
arts
a
perseverance
that
never
tires
a
facility
that
is
continually
assisted
by
repetition
the
greater
the
native
strength
however
of
the
genius
or
superior
gift
and
the
richer
its
resources
the
less
it
will
feel
the
weight
of
its
effort
in
securing
all
the
necessary
accomplishments
involved
in
creative
excellence419
a
really
firstrate
artist
has
the
lust
of
work
born
in
him
and
an
imperative
impulse
akin
to
any
other
natural
want
to
give
artistic
form
to
his
emotional
and
imaginative
life
that
is
in
him
his
emotional
life
and
his
ideas
irresistibly
run
into
this
artistic
mould
he
finds
as
it
were
the
instrument
already
within
him
made
to
the
hand
so
fitted
to
express
his
soullife
that
all
the
pains
it
takes
him
to
learn
it
are
as
nothing
a
musician
can
thus
unfold
to
us
in
his
melodies
the
depths
of
all
that
stirs
and
moves
his
soul
and
only
by
this
means
what
he
feels
is
at
once
wafted
into
melody
just
as
the
life
of
a
painter
is
impressed
upon
form
and
colour
or
that
of
a
poet
is
transmuted
into
the
creations
of
his
imagination
that
poetry
which
clothes
his
ideas
in
the
beauty
and
music
of
the
written
word
and
this
gift
of
vital
form
the
artist
does
not
merely
possess
as
an
imaginative
power
a
phantasy
an
emotional
impulse
that
leaves
not
a
wrack
behind
but
as
a
direct
stimulus
of
feeling
to
active
enterprise
as
a
gift
that
is
of
real
executive
accomplishment
both
of
these
aspects
are
united
in
the
real
artist
what
springs
to
life
in
his
imagination
is
immediately
alert
upon
his
mobile
fingers
precisely
as
the
sudden
thought
of
our
mind
breaks
into
word
from
the
tips
or
as
our
most
intimate
thoughts
ideas
and
emotions
are
reflected
on
the
outward
man
and
his
demeanour
genius
of
the
real
stamp
whenever
and
wherever
found
is
easily
quit
of
the
difficulties
presented
by
the
technical
workshop
and
indeed
has
found
the
most
beggarly
and
apparently
impracticable
material
to
accept
and
embody
as
it
pleased
the
inward
shapes
of
imagination
no
doubt
the
endowment
which
the
artist
finds
as
a
direct
gift
to
himself
must
be
kept
alive
and
alert
by
indefatigable
recourse
to
it
but
he
must
also
possess
naturally
a
practical
power
of
immediate
execution
without
this
all
the
facility
he
may
have
acquired
in
imaginative
conception
will
never
produce
an
essentially
creative
work
of
art
the
very
notion
of
art
demands
of
us
that
both
things
should
go
together
hand
in
hand
the
productive
energy
of
the
soul
and
its
technical
realization
in
the
forms
of
art
c
inspiration
the
activity
of
the
imagination
then
and
the
power
of
technical
execution
taking
both
together
as
the
inseparable
antecedents
of
a
real
artist
are
commonly
understood
as
inspiration420

the
first
question
that
presents
itself
to
us
for
solution
with
regard
to
it
is
under
what
conditions
it
arises
as
to
which
many
different
views
have
been
held

there
is
for
instance
the
strange
notion
to
some
extent
arising
from
the
general
truth
of
the
peculiar
intimacy
with
which
genius
attaches
itself
to
the
worlds
of
conscious
life
and
nature
that
inspiration
can
be
conjured
up
through
mere
excitation
of
the
senses
but
making
our
blood
dance
will
not
carry
us
far
we
are
still
a
long
way
off
from
the
muses
despite
the
champagne
bottle
such
at
least
was
the
experience
of
marmontel
for
he
tells
us
that
he
tried
it
in
a
winecellar
with
six
thousand
bottles
of
champagne
to
choose
from
but
not
a
breath
of
the
muses
passed
over
him421
ay
your
genius
may
be
as
great
as
he
lists
and
for
all
that
stretch
himself
many
a
time
morning
and
evening
on
the
green
grass
while
the
fresh
breeze
floats
over
him
and
stare
up
into
the
sky
and
not
a
whisper
shall
the
inspired
muses
breathe
in
his
ear

just
as
little
is
it
likely
that
we
shall
make
the
charmed
gates
of
inspiration
spring
open
by
merely
presenting
ourselves
before
them
with
a
desire
to
enter
whoever
fondly
imagines
that
he
is
in
the
right
mood
to
compose
a
poem
or
paint
a
picture
or
run
off
a
firstrate
melody
without
already
possessing
the
stuff
in
him
to
quicken
that
spark
into
vital
form
and
has
first
to
hunt
about
for
something
to
say
despite
all
his
talent
will
find
himself
no
better
off
for
his
best
intuitions
quite
unable
at
any
rate
to
conceive
any
complete
thing
of
beauty
or
perfect
a
really
sterling
work
of
art
neither
the
mere
tickling
of
our
senses
nor
any
act
of
will
or
determination
can
father
on
us
true
inspiration
to
attempt
such
things
simply
proves
that
both
the
emotional
life
and
the
imagination
have
as
yet
no
real
object
of
artistic
interest
when
once
we
have
the
artistic
impulse
of
the
real
kind
we
may
conclude
the
interest
there
has
already
its
fixed
seal
and
object
a
content
that
it
intends
to
master

true
inspiration
consequently
is
fixed
in
the
presence
of
a
specific
content
which
the
imagination
takes
up
in
order
to
give
artistic
expression
to
it
it
is
in
fact
the
object
of
this
active
process
of
giving
form
both
as
inwardly
made
visible
to
the
mind
and
as
outwardly
reproduced
in
the
execution
of
a
work
of
art
inspiration
is
equally
necessary
for
both
these
aspects
of
artistic
activity
the
question
once
more
presents
itself
to
us
in
what
way
such
a
material
will
come
to
an
artist
in
order
to
bring
about
this
inspiration
we
find
many
various
opinions
expressed
on
this
head
on
the
one
hand
it
is
frequently
required
of
an
artist
that
the
material
of
his
work
should
be
drawn
up
from
the
world
within
him
no
doubt
this
may
be
so
when
the
poet
sings
as
a
bird
from
the
bough
his
own
cheerfulness
of
spirit
is
then
the
incentive
which
enables
him
to
represent
a
particular
mood
of
his
own
as
the
content
of
his
production
and
by
this
very
expression
of
it
he
gives
vent
to
his
enjoyment
of
the
same
a
song
of
this
kind
straight
from
the
heart422
is
indeed
a
rich
reward
but
quite
as
often
however
the
greatest
works
of
art
are
created
from
the
suggestion
of
objects
wholly
external
to
himself
the
odes
of
pindar
were
frequently
the
result
of
direct
commissions
and
in
the
same
way
the
object
and
subject
has
times
without
number
been
given
to
artists
both
for
buildings
and
pictures
and
they
have
been
able
to
arouse
in
themselves
an
enthusiasm
for
such
indeed
it
is
only
too
frequently
the
express
complaint
of
artists
that
they
have
not
the
subjectmatter
on
which
to
work
such
a
reference
to
things
outside
and
its
stimulus
to
artistic
production
presents
just
that
relation
of
the
artist
to
nature
and
her
immediacy
which
is
essential
to
the
notion
of
superior
executive
gifts423
and
is
at
the
same
time
a
condition
to
the
appearance
of
genuine
inspiration
if
we
consider
the
artist
from
this
point
of
view
we
shall
find
that
it
is
here
that
this
natural
endowment
relates
itself
immediately
to
a
material
already
found
for
him
and
through
the
incentive
thereby
offered
him
through
the
inspiration
of
actual
fact
or
as
for
example
was
the
case
with
shakespeare
through
that
which
was
presented
by
old
tales
ballads
romances
and
chronicles
proceeds
to
embody
such
material
in
artistic
form
and
thereby
generally
to
express
his
own
personality
the
impulse
to
production
can
therefore
be
given
by
something
entirely
outside
the
artists
life
and
the
only
condition
essential
to
a
successful
result
is
that
the
interest
which
fixes
the
artists
attention
should
be
of
real
artistic
significance
and
that
he
is
able
to
reproduce
the
same
in
all
its
vitality
such
conditions
virtually
imply
the
presence
of
rare
inspiration
and
an
artist
who
is
really
alive
and
awake
himself
by
reason
of
this
very
vitality
of
his
own
powers
discovers
endless
opportunities
for
actively
asserting
the
same
and
feeling
inspired
while
doing
so
opportunities
which
pass
over
other
people
without
similarly
affecting
them

if
we
ask
further
viz
of
what
precisely
this
artistic
inspiration
consists
we
may
perhaps
best
describe
it
by
saying
that
it
is
the
capacity
of
being
entirely
absorbed
in
a
given
subject
a
capacity
not
merely
wholly
to
realize
it
but
incapable
of
resting
until
the
same
is
completely
minted
anew
and
rounded
off
in
its
artistic
form

moreover
when
an
artist
has
thus
entirely
appropriated
his
subject
it
is
but
saying
the
same
thing
the
other
way
to
affirm
that
he
must
know
how
to
forget
his
own
individual
idiosyncrasies
and
all
that
accidentally
attaches
to
them
he
must
in
short
on
his
part
lose
himself
in
the
matter
on
hand
he
must
make
his
artistic
personality
the
pure
form
under
which
the
content
he
has
assimilated
is
clothed
and
embodied
an
inspiration
in
which
the
particular
individual
receives
too
emphatic
a
predominance
and
assertion
rather
than
being
the
vitally
active
instrument
which
displays
the
ideal
significance
of
the
material
worked
upon
is
an
inferior
type
of
inspiration
this
truth
opens
the
way
to
a
fuller
consideration
of
what
is
generally
understood
as
the
objective
character
of
artistic
production
2
the
objective
character
of
the
representation
a
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
we
understand
objectivity
to
mean
that
the
content
in
any
work
of
art
necessarily
receives
the
form
of
the
reality
already
given
and
in
its
artistic
embodiment
we
have
the
same
clearly
repeated
in
this
sense
that
we
desire
to
see
objective
truth
reproduced
for
us
we
are
entitled
to
call
kotzebue
an
objective
poet
in
his
work
we
undoubtedly
find
ordinary
reality
simply
as
it
is
again
the
object
of
art
is
however
more
precisely
stated
to
strip
away
not
merely
the
appearance
but
the
actual
content
of
all
that
meets
us
every
day
and
by
means
of
the
spiritual
activity
of
the
artist
most
personal
to
himself
to
work
out
that
which
is
essentially
rational
in
that
content
in
its
really
adequate
external
form
indeed
if
we
look
at
yet
better
examples
of
art
than
kotzebues
such
as
those
we
have
already
glanced
at
in
the
youthful
productions
of
goethe
we
shall
find
that
this
realistic
type
of
objectivity
can
be
made
essentially
living
in
its
expression
and
by
virtue
of
this
quality
prove
highly
attractive
to
ourselves
and
yet
on
account
of
the
fact
that
the
artistic
form
remains
defective
fail
to
arrive
at
the
real
beauty
of
art
purely
external
objectivity
therefore
which
still
lacks
the
abiding
and
substantial
significance
is
not
that
for
which
an
artist
should
strive
b
a
second
type
of
objective
realization
presents
itself
to
us
in
the
case
where
we
find
the
external
is
not
the
artistic
aim
but
the
artist
has
seized
hold
of
his
subject
with
all
the
depth
and
strength
of
his
emotional
life
this
inward
aspect
of
his
work
remains
however
so
entirely
enclosed
within
itself
and
concentrated
that
it
fails
to
assert
itself
with
a
clearness
thoroughly
possessed
or
to
unfold
itself
in
its
full
truth
the
eloquence
of
pathos
simply
restricts
itself
by
means
of
illustrations
external
to
it
without
possessing
either
the
power
or
the
culture
to
be
able
to
present
the
fulness
of
that
content
in
an
explicit
form
folksongs
preeminently
belong
to
such
a
mode
of
artistic
production
extremely
simple
as
they
are
in
their
form
they
suggest
an
emotional
life
which
lies
at
their
root
of
still
wider
range
and
depth
but
which
they
are
unable
clearly
to
express
their
art
in
fact
is
itself
not
sufficiently
elaborate
or
complete
enough
to
carry
into
the
light
of
day
with
transparent
reflection
all
that
it
would
unfold
and
is
forced
to
rest
satisfied
with
suggesting
to
our
sympathies
the
same
by
means
of
an
external
symbolism
the
heart
remains
thrown
back
and
concentrated
upon
itself
and
in
order
to
make
its
life
intelligible
to
others
casts
but
a
fainter
reflection
of
its
world
upon
entirely
finite
and
external
circumstances
and
phenomena
which
no
doubt
are
thus
eloquent
in
a
degree
albeit
we
receive
from
them
only
a
faroff
echo
of
the
emotions
and
life
they
would
bring
home
to
us
goethe
has
himself
written
many
quite
exquisite
songs
of
this
kind
the
shepherds
lament
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
in
this
refrain
a
heart
that
is
broken
with
pain
and
yearning
still
remains
silent
and
reserved
beneath
the
purely
external
traits
which
would
fain
relieve
it
and
despite
of
this
we
hear
as
through
an
undertone
all
the
concentrated
depth
of
emotion
it
fails
to
express
in
the
erlking
and
many
other
of
his
songs
we
hear
the
same
tone
this
tone
however
we
may
also
meet
in
degenerate
form
right
down
to
the
most
futile
barbarism
unable
to
grasp
either
the
essential
character
of
the
facts
or
the
situation
merely
clinging
to
their
most
finite
aspects
in
all
their
crudeness
and
absence
of
artistic
taste
an
example
we
may
give
from
the
drummercomrade
of
the
boy

such
inanities
as
o
thou

strong
emotion
is
suggested
in
a
very
different
way
which
brings
before
our
mind
nothing
trivial
or
contrary
to
the
main
idea
what
however
is
as
a
rule
defective
in
this
particular
type
of
poetical
realization
is
the
expression
of
emotion
in
all
its
true
intensity
this
in
the
rarest

not

shut
away
which
merely
reflects
a
distant
echo
through

should
either
break
forth

soul
in
its
full
strength

pathos
of

work
withal
a
great
soul
which
penetrates
to
the
very
core
of
his
subject
and
is
able
to
express
its
very
deepest
significance
in
the
freest
and
most
perspicuous
way
through
the
wealth
and
music
of
his
verse
c
in
conformity
then
with
the
notion
of
the
ideal
we
may
conclude
that
even
when
we
are
dealing
with
the
mere
expression
of
emotional
life
we
shall
never
fully
establish
our
title
to
truly
objective
art
so
long
as
any
part
of
all
that
is
comprised
in
the
subjectmatter
which
stirs
the
artistic
inspiration
remains
still
wrapped
up
within
the
soul
that
seeks
to
express
itself
rather
all
that
lies
there
should
be
completely
unfolded
and
unfolded
in
a
way
which
not
merely
shall
reveal
to
us
the
essential
soul
and
substance
of
the
content
selected
but
shall
embody
it
in
some
completely
homogeneous
type
of
individual
art
through
which
as
through
a
transparency
both
soul
and
substance
shall
radiate
for
that
which
is
highest
and
most
excellent
is
not
by
any
means
that
we
are
unable
to
express
as
though
the
poet
contained
in
himself
still
greater
depths
than
those
expressed
on
the
face
of
his
work
the
work
of
an
artist
is
the
consummate
fruit
of
that
artist
and
reflects
precisely
what
he
is
and
only
what
he
is
and
all
that
remains
behind
in
the
temple
of
his
soul
is
a
naught
or
nothing426

manner
style
and
originality
however
much
it
may
be
imperatively
required
of
the
artist
that
he
should
give
to
his
work
an
objective
character
such
as
we
have
above
indicated
this
must
not
make
us
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
the
artists
production
is
at
the
same
time
the
work
of
his
inspiration
it
is
he
alone
who
has
by
his
entire
identification
of
his
personality
with
the
specific
subjectmatter
and
its
artistic
embodiment
brought
into
being
the
entire
creation
out
of
the
life
of
his
own
emotional
nature
and
imagination
and
it
is
this
identity
of
the
free
personality
of
the
artist
and
the
truly
objective
construction
of
his
artistic
creation
which
constitutes
the
third
fundamental
aspect
of
his
activity
as
set
forth
above
and
which
we
must
now
shortly
consider
in
so
far
as
we
may
be
thus
enabled
to
unite
that
which
we
have
hitherto
separated
in
our
independent
consideration
of
the
conceptions
of
genius
and
the
objective
presentment
of
a
work
of
art
we
may
characterize
such
a
unity
as
the
conception
of
true
artistic
originality
before
however
we
come
to
close
quarters
with
all
that
is
implied
in
this
conception
it
is
necessary
to
clearly
grasp
two
points
of
view
already
related
to
it
whose
insufficiency
we
have
to
expose
on
the
ground
of
their
onesidedness
before
a
true
conception
of
originality
can
be
fully
appreciated
these
may
be
sufficiently
indicated
by
the
terms
subjective
manner427
and
style
a
the
subjective
manner
the
point
of
first
importance
in
discussing
the
meaning
of
the
expression
artistic
manner
is
to
differentiate
it
fundamentally
from
artistic
originality
the
term
manner
in
our
view
is
only
used
in
direct
relation
to
the
specific
and
consequently
accidental
idiosyncrasies
of
the
artist
that
is
merely
in
so
far
as
such
qualities
assert
themselves
as
effective
in
his
work
without
being
called
forth
by
the
nature
of
the
subject
itself
and
its
ideal
exposition

a
manner
thus
interpreted
has
no
connection
with
the
universal
types
of
art
that
is
to
say
types
which
require
an
essentially
different
mode
of
representation
as
for
instance
the
landscape
painter
necessarily
treats
the
objects
of
nature
in
quite
a
different
way
from
that
under
which
a
historical
painter
would
so
treat
them
or
the
epic
poet
would
handle
similar
subjectmatter
in
a
different
way
from
that
appropriate
to
the
dramatic
poet
on
the
contrary
a
manner
is
a
form
of
artistic
expression
wholly
emanating
from
a
particular
individuality
an
entirely
supposititious
idiosyncrasy
of
executive
ability
which
may
be
carried
so
far
as
to
contradict
absolutely
the
true
notion
of
the
ideal
as
thus
defined
manner
stands
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
among
the
forms
which
may
characterize
an
artists
general
handling
an
artist
who
thus
expresses
his
individuality
simply
gives
free
rein
to
any
chance
notions
of
his
own
without
testing
them
as
subject
to
the
substantive
claims
of
art
but
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
art
that
it
should
abolish
precisely
all
that
is
merely
accidental
to
its
content
no
less
than
to
its
artistic
or
rather
external
mode
of
presentment
and
this
is
only
to
say
that
it
requires
of
the
artist
that
he
should
efface
from
his
work
all
traces
of
purely
personal
tastes
and
idiosyncrasies
he
shares
with
no
one
else428

and
for
these
reasons
we
would
point
out
that
a
manner
of
this
kind
is
not
so
much
to
be
contrasted
directly
with
the
true
exposition
of
art
as
to
be
considered
in
relation
to
the
purely
external
aspects
of
art
where
the
individuality
of
the
particular
mode
of
treatment
comes
into
play
this
kind
of
manner
is
most
conspicuous
in
the
arts
of
painting
and
music
for
the
reason
that
these
arts429
present
to
the
artist
the
widest
variety
of
external
characterization
for
him
to
seize
upon
and
reproduce
what
we
find
here
is
a
certain
artificial
manner
of
general
execution
entirely
peculiar
to
some
particular
artist
and
the
school
of
imitators
or
pupils
who
follow
him
which
through
constant
repetition
degenerates
into
mere
habit

and
its
tendency
is
to
develop
on
one
of
two
ways
in
which
we
may
regard
the
artistic
work
first
there
is
the
aspect
of
its
composition
to
take
painting
for
example
we
have
all
the
variety
of
ways
under
which
the
prevailing
atmospheric
tone
the
arrangement
of
foliage
the
contrast
of
light
and
shade
in
short
the
entire
scheme
of
colour
may
be
treated
most
particularly
in
this
feature
of
the
general
scheme430
of
the
colouring
and
lighting
of
a
picture
we
find
that
painters
permit
themselves
the
most
varied
freedom
of
individual
preference
and
distaste
of
course
such
a
prevailing
tone
may
appear
to
us
as
that
we
do
not
find
in
nature
for
the
simple
reason
that
we
have
not
had
our
attention
directed
to
it
although
it
is
really
there
but
we
shall
often
find
that
such
a
scheme
has
simply
been
adopted
by
this
or
that
artist
on
grounds
of
personal
taste
or
convenience431
and
it
becomes
simply
a
habit
in
him
to
use
everything
now
as
subject
to
that
particular
scheme
and
what
we
have
observed
with
reference
to
colouring
is
equally
true
when
applied
to
the
treatment
of
natural
objects
their
grouping
position
motion
and
general
characterization
this
inferior
mode
of
treatment
is
particularly
to
be
observed
in
the
works
of
the
dutch
school
take
the
case
of
van
der
neers
nightscenes
and
his
artificial
presentation
of
moonlight
or
van
der
goyens
sandhills
in
so
many
of
his
landscapes
the
everrepeated
reflections
of
light
from
satin
and
silk
stuffs
that
we
find
in
so
many
pictures
of
other
masters
of
the
same
school
are
indications
of
the
same
artificial
mode
of
handling

a
manner
of
this
type
may
be
still
further
traced
in
the
execution
of
other
details
the
handling
of
brush
or
pencil
the
laying
on
and
blending
of
tints
and
many
other
features
of
executive
work

the
general
conclusion
we
come
to
after
considering
all
such
examples
of
specialized
handling
and
conception
in
which
constant
repetition
grows
at
last
habitual
to
and
indeed
becomes
a
second
nature
of
the
artist
is
this
that
just
in
proportion
as
the
manner
adopted
is
more
specialized432
there
is
an
increasing
and
dangerous
tendency
for
it
to
degenerate
into
that
which
is
nothing
more
than
a
soulless
and
consequently
arid
repetition
and
mechanical
exercise
throughout
which
the
artist
is
no
longer
present
with
the
fulness
of
his
spiritual
resources
and
the
entire
strength
of
his
inspiration
when
this
takes
place
his
art
necessarily
sinks
to
the
level
of
a
mere
executive
facility
or
accomplishment
of
his
hands
and
a
manner
otherwise
innocent
enough
may
very
readily
grow
starved
and
lifeless

the
more
truly
artistic
manner
has
consequently
to
disengage
itself
from
such
jejune
peculiarities
to
broaden
out
into
a
freer
atmosphere433
so
that
no
specialized
mode
of
handling
shall
be
suffered
to
sterilize
itself
into
what
is
simply
a
matter
of
habit
in
this
way
an
artist
will
approach
the
facts
of
nature
with
a
breadth
of
view
more
in
keeping
with
her
own
and
will
understand
how
to
identify
his
larger
conceptions
and
the
general
technique
of
his
craft
with
the
same
ideal
spirit
in
something
of
the
same
sense
we
may
describe
it
as
a
peculiar
manner
of
goethe
that
he
is
particularly
apt
in
concluding
not
merely
poems
of
society
but
also
openings
to
works
of
a
more
serious
character
with
a
sudden
turn
of
pleasantry
in
order
to
remove
the
impression
of
or
throw
into
the
background
the
serious
nature
of
previous
reflection
or
situation
we
meet
with
the
same
characteristic
in
the
correspondence
of
horace
it
is
in
fact
an
application
of
the
art
of
conversation
and
general
sociability
which
in
order
to
avoid
following
up
any
matter
more
deeply
comes
to
a
stop
breaks
off
and
cleverly
diverts
the
serious
into
more
cheerful
channels
such
a
mode
of
the
literary
art
is
undoubtedly
part
of
the
manner
of
the
artist
and
his
individual
style
but
the
individuality
thus
exemplified
is
based
upon
a
broader
principle
and
is
asserted
in
a
way
wholly
justified
by
the
artistic
purpose
of
the
work
in
hand
and
this
particular
type
of
an
artistic
manner
will
enable
us
to
pass
readily
to
the
consideration
of
style
generally
b

le
style
cest
lhomme
mme
is
a
famous
phrase
of
the
french
style
is
here
generally
understood
as
the
unique
characterization
of
personality
the
particular
mode
of
expression
however
it
may
be
applied
which
wholly
reveals
to
us
its
substance
herr
von
rumohr
on
the
other
hand
italian
investigations
i
p
87
endeavours
to
interpret
the
expression
as
a
mode
habitual
through
its
constant
repetition
of
bringing
together
the
most
vital
characteristics
of
the
subjectmatter
artistically
treated
by
virtue
of
which
the
sculptor
informs
his
figures
with
reality
and
the
painter
gives
to
his
the
appearance
of
life
he
further
adds
important
observations
upon
the
appropriate
form
of
representation
which
in
the
case
of
an
art
such
as
sculpture
the
specific
sensuous
material
either
permits
or
proscribes
it
is
however
not
necessary
to
attach
the
expression
style
solely
to
this
aspect
of
sensuous
material
we
may
unquestionably
extend
it
to
all
those
determinations
and
rules
of
artistic
production
which
apply
naturally
to
any
particular
type
of
art
and
in
virtue
of
which
an
object
is
reproduced
in
the
medium
of
any
one
of
them
we
consequently
distinguish
in
the
art
of
music
the
style
of
church
music
from
that
of
opera
and
in
that
of
painting
the
historical
style
from
the
style
of
genre
painting
style
is
therefore
a
mode
of
artistic
presentation
which
not
merely
follows
closely
the
fundamental
conditions
of
its
material
but
asserts
itself
as
adequate
to
all
that
any
particular
type
of
art
demands
for
its
composition
and
execution
and
in
strict
conformity
with
the
laws
which
apply
to
the
subjectmatter
on
hand
defect
of
style
will
then
in
this
extension
of
the
meaning
either
imply
an
inability
to
present
a
composition
in
accordance
with
such
necessary
conditions
or
will
amount
to
a
personal
caprice
which
rather
gives
free
rein
to
its
own
particular
predilections
than
accepts
the
conditions
of
composition
which
are
really
proposed
to
it
in
other
words
adopts
an
inferior
manner
of
its
own
consequently
it
is
inadmissible
as
herr
von
rumohr
has
already
pointed
out
to
apply
principles
peculiar
to
one
type
of
art
to
another
as
mengs
has
done
in
his
famous
museum
in
the
villa
albani
where
both
in
the
general
conception
and
execution
of
his
apollo
he
adopts
the
modes
of
colouring
applicable
only
to
sculpture
a
defect
of
the
same
kind
may
be
traced
in
many
of
the
pictures
of
drer
where
we
see
that
even
in
painting
especially
in
the
folding
of
his
drapery
he
adopts
the
style
of
woodcut
in
which
he
is
so
consummate
a
master
c
originality
the
final
result
then
of
our
inquiry
on
this
head
is
that
true
originality
does
not
consist
in
merely
conforming
to
the
paramount
conditions
of
style
but
in
a
kind
of
inspired
state434
personal
to
the
artist
which
instead
of
committing
itself
wholly
to
a
mere
external
manner
of
composition
seizes
hold
of
a
particular
subjectmatter
that
is
essentially
rational
and
by
virtue
of
its
own
resources
and
quality
reclothes
the
same
as
from
within
the
artist
himself
and
not
merely
in
a
way
conformable
to
the
essential
notion
of
the
art
adopted
but
also
in
a
form
adequate
to
the
universal
notion
of
the
ideal

true
originality
is
consequently
identical
with
true
objectivity
and
combines
that
which
is
due
to
the
personality
of
the
artist
and
the
actual
subjectmatter
of
his
work
in
such
a
way
that
both
aspects
of
his
artistic
product
are
held
together
in
complete
accord
looked
at
in
one
way
such
a
work
appears
to
reveal
to
us
the
very
essence
of
the
artists
personality
while
regarded
from
another
we
only
find
there
the
essence
of
the
subjectmatter
artistically
treated
so
that
this
very
uniqueness
of
expression
appears
to
arise
from
the
unique
characteristics
of
the
material
to
which
it
is
applied
and
we
may
say
with
equal
truth
either
that
the
expressed
form
is
due
to
those
characteristics
or
that
this
unique
impression
we
obtain
from
them
proceeds
from
the
creative
unity
of
the
artist

true
originality
must
be
entirely
kept
distinct
from
individual
caprice
and
every
kind
of
personal
expression
that
is
due
to
fortuitous
causes
a
common
idea
of
originality
is
simply
the
stringing
together
of
so
many
curiosities
things
which
this
particular
individual
and
no
other
could
perpetuate
or
even
faintly
imagine
that
is
however
merely
idiosyncracy
gone
mad
no
people
on
earth
are
more
original
in
this
meaning
of
the
term
than
englishmen
a
country
where
every
one
prides
himself
on
committing
some
folly
or
other
which
no
man
in
his
senses
is
likely
to
repeat
and
then
fondly
imagines
his
performance
to
be
original
we
may
in
this
connection
briefly
refer
to
what
has
been
so
extolled
and
never
more
than
in
our
own
days
as
the
originality
of
wit
and
humour
an
artist
of
this
type
of
humour
starts
off
from
a
point
of
view
or
an
experience
wholly
personal
to
himself
and
constantly
recurs
to
the
same
so
that
the
real
object
of
his
artistic
production
is
merely
treated
as
the
peg
on
which
he
may
hang
or
the
field
in
which
he
may
give
full
play
to
whatever
wittiness
jest
quirks
and
sallies
his
mood
may
chance
to
light
upon
in
this
way
the
real
object
of
his
art
and
that
which
should
render
it
vital
in
himself
fall
entirely
apart
and
we
have
a
capricious
mode
of
artistic
production
in
which
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
artist
is
made
to
appear
as
of
first
importance
a
humour
of
this
kind
is
often
replete
with
intellectual
brilliance
and
deep
feeling
and
in
its
general
result
is
very
apt
to
impose
on
us
yet
for
all
that
it
is
not
generally
such
a
difficult
matter
as
is
commonly
believed
to
constantly
interrupt
the
rational
content
of
that
which
we
are
really
dealing
with
interrupting
all
steady
progress
with
a
stream
of
capricious
fresh
starts
and
conclusions
a
sort
of
patchwork
of
whims
and
emotional
excursions
and
thereby
to
create
a
caricature
of
imaginative
vigour
is
far
easier
than
to
develop
and
round
off
with
completeness
an
artistic
whole
of
sterling
quality
throughout
such
as
will
testify
to
the
real
ideal
moreover
our
humour
nowadays
is
only
too
ready
to
give
us
the
repulsive
features
of
a
talent
for
wit
essentially
crude
and
is
constantly
degenerating
into
coarse
buffoonery
and
emptiness
we
do
not
often
get
from
it
real
humour
at
all
the
stalest
trivialities
are
wont
to
pass
now
for
brilliancy
and
depth
of
soul
provided
they
only
rig
themselves
out
in
the
pretentious
motley
of
humour
shakespeare
on
the
contrary
possessed
a
grand
and
profound
sense
of
humour
but
even
his
works
are
by
no
means
destitute
of
shallows
the
humour
of
jean
paul
too
often
surprises
us
with
the
depth
of
its
wit
and
the
beauty
of
its
sentiment
but
we
are
quite
as
often
repelled
by
the
absurdly
eccentric
way
in
which
he
hitches
together
his
subjects
or
rather
leaves
them
with
the
bare
jointure
to
lie
apart
and
then
floods
all
he
has
to
say
with
a
kind
of
humour
that
leaves
it
almost
impossible
to
make
head
or
tail
of
no
humourist
however
great
he
may
be
is
likely
to
find
anything
resembling
it
in
his
memory
and
our
main
impression
is
frequently
even
in
the
case
of
jean
pauls
kaleidoscopic
effects
that
they
are
rather
the
result
of
mechanical
pasting
together
than
a
spontaneous
product
from
the
crucible
of
genius
for
this
reason
jean
paul
finds
it
necessary
in
order
continually
to
present
new
effects
to
drag
into
books
differing
wholly
in
kind
botanical
legal
and
philosophical
disquisitions
no
less
than
descriptions
of
travel
whatever
whim
in
fact
may
strike
his
fancy
at
the
time
is
promptly
inserted
even
when
his
subject
relates
to
scientific
discovery
he
will
run
together
the
most
heterogeneous
material
such
as
a
collection
of
brazilian
plants
and
observations
upon
the
old
imperial
chamber435
there
are
people
who
will
praise
a
motley
of
this
kind
as
original
but
it
is
really
precisely
the
kind
of
caprice
which
originality
of
the
genuine
stamp
excludes
while
we
are
on
this
topic
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
add
some
further
remarks
upon
irony
which
particularly
prides
itself
upon
presenting
us
with
the
very
flower
of
originality
on
just
those
occasions
when
it
has
ceased
to
treat
any
artistic
material
with
seriousness
and
converts
the
whole
affair
into
a
subject
of
witticism
only
worth
notice
for
the
sake
of
the
wit
it
suggests
looked
at
from
another
point
of
view
this
irony
rakes
together
a
lot
of
things
which
are
quite
foreign
to
the
essence
of
the
matter
in
hand
things
the
deeper
significance
of
which
the
poet
keeps
to
himself
and
his
notion
seems
to
be
that
by
this
subtle
exercise
of
his
powers
the
imagination
will
be
enlarged
and
it
is
just
in
external
associations
of
this
sort
that
we
get
what
we
have
already
described
as
the
poetry
of
a
poetry
wherein
everything
that
is
deepest
and
most
excellent
is
concealed
from
us
for
no
other
reason
than
this
that
we
must
not
be
allowed
to
look
at
it
because
it
is
so
profound
and
we
really
find
in
friedrich
von
schlegels
poetry
more
particularly
when
he
became
vain
over
his
title
to
the
rank
of
poet
that
which
clearly
is
set
forth
as
the
aroma
of
all
is
just
that
which
is
never
expressed
no
wonder
this
poetry
of
poetry
turns
out
to
be
the
flattest
prose

a
genuine
work
of
art
must
consequently
be
held
intact
from
all
originality
of
this
perverse
type
true
originality
will
be
asserted
throughout
by
this
and
this
alone
that
the
work
has
the
appearance
of
being
the
unique
creation
of
one
individual
mind
which
does
not
go
about
picking
up
scraps
from
around
it
and
then
make
thereof
a
patchwork
but
permits
the
material
of
that
work
in
complete
accordance
with
the
unity
most
congenial
to
its
own
substance
to
bind
itself
together
in
a
whole
all
parts
of
which
are
strictly
related
as
truly
stamped
with
one
mint
as
the
founders
cast
when
we
find
scenes
and
motives
introduced
upon
grounds
that
are
foreign
to
the
real
artistic
purpose
that
is
to
say
which
do
not
directly
grow
out
of
the
true
subject
we
must
inevitably
lose
that
subtle
and
necessary
connection
of
all
the
parts
which
create
this
unity
and
what
we
thus
interpolate
will
unavoidably
impress
us
as
something
fortuitously
attached
by
personal
caprice
much
in
this
way
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
give
exceptional
praise
to
the
gtz
von
berlichingen
of
goethe
on
the
grounds
of
its
great
originality
no
doubt
it
is
true
enough
as
we
have
above
remarked
that
in
this
drama
goethe
has
with
much
intrepidity
given
the
lie
direct
to
and
turned
his
back
upon
all
that
had
been
taken
as
the
established
principles
of
the
aesthetic
science
of
his
age
the
execution
of
this
work
however
does
not
bear
the
stamp
of
genuine
originality
one
finds
on
the
contrary
in
this
youthful
production
indications
of
the
poverty
of
the
material
upon
which
it
is
founded
so
that
many
traits
and
entire
scenes
appear
to
have
been
raked
together
and
united
by
connections
foreign
to
the
subject
from
material
of
an
interest
contemporary
with
that
of
the
artists
life
instead
of
being
the
genuine
elaboration
of
the
fundamental
subjectmatter
the
scene
for
example
between
gtz
and
brother
martin
where
martin
luther
is
clearly
suggested
contains
ideas
which
goethe
could
only
have
borrowed
from
a
time
such
as
his
own
when
people
began
once
more
to
wail
over
the
conditions
of
monastic
life
how
they
durst
not
drink
wine
could
only
sleep
off
their
meals
were
at
the
mercy
of
evil
desires
and
generally
must
submit
to
the
three
intolerable
vows
of
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
brother
martin

the
other
hand
grows
enthusiastic
over
the
knightly
life
of
gtz
how
he
recalled
to
memory
the
load
of
booty
he
took
from
his
foe
whom
he
ran
through
with
lance
on
horseback
before
he
could
shoot
then
tumbled
over
horse
and
all
and
finally
returned
to
his
castle
and
wife
whereupon
the
good
monk
drinks

of
the

his
eyes
the
while
with
mundane
reflections
of
this
sort
luther
never
started
on
his
journey
but
rather
as
a
pious
monk
who
had
penetrated
to
their
depths
the
religious
conceptions
and
convictions
of
augustine

source
altogether
subject
to
precisely
similar
defects
are
the
pedagogical
references
to
that

which
occur
in
the
following
scene
and
for
which
vasedow
is
mainly
responsible
we
are
informed
that
children
of
that
age
are
taught
much
that
is
unintelligible
that
the
true

should
rather
educate
their

the

phrases

a
village

for

hundred
years
has
been
the
ancestral
property
of
the
lords
of

when
gtz
asks
him
if
he
knows
any
lord
of
berlichingen
personally
the
lad
stares
blankly
at
him
and
through
sheer
overteaching
does
not
know
his

gtz
declares
that
he

before
he

the
names
of
a
single
river
village
or

all
this
kind
of
thing
is
mere
literary
stucco
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
subject
at
all
and
when
an
occasion
does
arise
in
which
we
ought
to
find
some
really
characteristic
grip
of
the
very
marrow
of
the
subject
as
in
the
conversations
between
gtz
and
weisslingen
we
get
nothing
more
than
cold
reflections
upon
the
times
we
find
much
the
same
association
of
irrelevant
matter
in
the
same
poets
wahlverwandschaften436
the
laying
out
of
pleasure
grounds
the
living
pictures
the
observations
upon
pendulum
oscillations
the
testing
of
metals
the
headaches
the
entire
description
of
elective
affinities
which
is
borrowed
straight
from
chemical
science
are
all
of
this
category
it
may
of
course
be
freely
admitted
that
in
a
romance
referring
to
an
essentially
prosaic
age
such
things
are
prima
facie
admissible
and
more
particularly
so
when
we
have
a
goethe
to
introduce
them
so
cleverly
and
apply
them
so
charmingly
moreover
no
work
of
art
of
any
kind
can
be
kept
wholly
unaffected
by
the
culture
of
the
artists
own
age
it
is
one
thing
to
allow
the
reflection
of
contemporary
culture
to
appear
as
part
of
the
artistic
whole
quite
another
to
bring
together
such
material
of
research
in
a
way
that
places
it
as
something
wholly
outside
and
independent
of
the
genuine
substance
of
the
composition
for
the
true
originality
of
the
artist
no
less
than
that
of
his
work
consists
exclusively
in
their
being
vitally
bound
up
with
that
which
is
only
intelligible
as
part
of
the
real
subjectmatter
treated
when
the
artist
has
fully
appropriated
this
objective
reason
without
mixing
up
with
it
to
the
detriment
of
its
clarity
details
he
may
have
borrowed
from
his
personal
experience
or
other
sources
which
do
not
strictly
belong
to
it
in
that
case
alone
will
he
stamp
the
material
with
the
genuine
mark
of
his
own
artistic
mintage
this
personal
effect
upon
his
work
merely
serves
him
as
a
bridge
of
life
over
which
he
passes
to
secure
a
work
of
art
wholly
complete
in
itself
just
as
in
all
genuine
thought
and
action
true
freedom
consists
in
allowing
that
which
is
of
essential
significance
to
assert
itself
without
restraint
so
that
it
becomes
itself
the
force
which
dominates
both
the
particular
thought
and
volition
of
the
man
who
thus
appropriates
it
and
by
so
doing
reconciles
every
vestige
of
opposition
in
this
way
the
originality
of
art
absorbs
every
accidental
trait
peculiar
to
a
given
personality
but
it
only
absorbs
it
that
the
artist
may
follow
without
reserve
the
impulse
and
bent
of
his
genius
as
inspired
through
every
fibre
of
the
material
he
moulds
and
instead
of
reflecting
a
purely
barren
wilfulness
and
caprice
of
his
own
may
give
an
objective
form
to
his
true
artistic
individuality
conjoined
with
consummate
accomplishment
to
have
no
manner
was
ever
the
one
great
manner
and
in
this
sense
alone
can
we
ascribe
originality
to
homer
sophocles
rafael
and

it

the

concur

the
view

the

more
artistic

the
landscape

gardening
such
as
we
find
it
in
our

a
real
justification
of
its
own

with

the
reason
given
that
a

should
be
entirely

do
we
not

also
in

of
the

i
think
it
must
be
admitted
that

it

the

both
these

not

i

it

no

what
an
artist
would
mean

in

would
apart
from
the
question
of
dirtiness
about
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
say
that
hegel
insists
too
much
precisely
as
ruskin
does
on
the
superiority
of

it

what
would
hegel
have
said
of
the
first
scene
in
the
merchant
of
venice
no
doubt
shakespeares
play
contains
very
much
more
than
such
scenes
and
there
is
a
profound
significance
in
that
opening
scene
for
it
at
once
emphasizes
the
collision
of
families
upon
which
the
entire
tragedy
turns
but
is
such
a
defence
needed
there
appears
to
be
indubitably
a
certain
deficiency
in
the
above
criticism
there
is
no
reason
that
a
scene
in
which
a
couple
of
peasants
and
two
troopers
are
the
dramatis
personae
should
not
be
infinitely
amusing
provided
a
shakespeare
or
even
a
goethe
when
he
is
not
in
one
of
his
dull
moods
performs
the
office
of
teaching
them
how
to
speak
footnote

this
surely
goes
too
far
unless
interest
is
taken
strictly
to
mean
artistic
interest
which
would
appear
to
be
so
from
the
context
everything
that
has
once
interested
or
affected
mankind
however
remote
has
at
heart
an
historical
and
antiquarian
interest
and
i
am
not
sure
that
we
should
not
be
right
in
adding
a
general
human
interest
at
least
such
is
almost
a
dogma
with
a
poet
of
the
type
of
browning

the
above
arguments
though
containing

that

appear
to
overlook
for
one
thing
the
symbolic
significance
of
mythological
history
and
in
a
certain
sense
to
be
lacking
in
sympathy
for
everything
that
is
not
modern
or
hellenic
how
very
differently
carlyle
for
example
referred
to
this
very
mythology

not
profound

sense
footnote
401
the
intention
of
aeschylus
went
of
course
much
farther
than
this

essentially
one
written
by
a
staunch

it
is
strange
that

have
ventured
such
a

his
old
friend

both
our

supports
him
somewhat
fail
to
recognize
the
permanent
reality
whether
symbolical
or
directly
spiritual
that
an
increasing
number
of
men
find
in
these
hellenic
personalities
as
illustrated
in
the
poetry
of
meredith

take
the
finest
flavour
of
the
type

i
think
it
must
be
admitted
that
hegel
goes
too
far
in
the
other
extreme
the
best
tendency
of
our
times

to
reproduce

our
adaptation

sense
an
illustration
of
hegels
contention

generally
it

this

from
a

down
to
wagner
and
strauss
the
explanation
appears
first
to
be
due
to
the
distinction
between
a
national
impulse
toward
popular
singing
which
the
italian
no
doubt
possesses
and
a
deeprooted
emotional
life
which
finally
discovers
its
supreme
mode
of
expression
in
the
art
of
instrumental
music
as
developed
by
the
teuton
stock
secondly
it
is
quite
clear
i
think
from
hegels
correspondence
that
he
had
no
real
sympathy
for
orchestral
music

an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
opera

opera

the

it
