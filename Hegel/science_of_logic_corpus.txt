note
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
say
anything
respecting
the
difficulty
of
making
any
adequate
translation
of
hegels
writings
in
the
case
of
the
history
of
philosophy
that
difficulty
is
possibly
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
the
greater
part
of
the
book
is
put
together
from
the
notes
of
different
courses
of
lectures
delivered
on
the
subject
at
various
times
hegel
as
we
learn
from
michelet
in
his
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
this
work
lectured
in
all
nine
times
on
the
history
of
philosophy
first
in
jena
in
18051806
then
in
heidelberg
in
18161817
and
18171818
and
the
other
six
times
in
berlin
between
the
years
1819
and
1830
he
had
begun
the
tenth
course
on
the
subject
in
1831
when
death
cut
his
labours
short
it
was
only
for
the
first
course
of
lecturesthat
delivered
in
jenathat
hegel
fully
wrote
out
his
lectures
this
was
evidently
done
with
the
intention
of
future
publication
in
book
form
at
heidelberg
he
composed
a
short
abstract
of
his
subject
giving
in
a
few
terse
words
the
main
points
dealt
with
in
each
system
of
philosophy
in
the
later
courses
of
lectures
hegel
trusted
to
extempore
speaking
but
at
the
same
time
made
considerable
use
of
the
above
writings
the
margins
of
which
he
annotated
with
subsequent
additions
besides
these
annotations
he
left
behind
him
a
large
number
of
miscellaneous
notes
which
have
proved
of
the
greatest
value
the
present
translation
is
taken
from
the
second
and
amended
edition
of
the
geschichte
der
philosophie
published
in
1840
this
edition
is
derived
from
no
one
set
of
lectures
in
particular
but
carefully
prepared
by
michelethimself
one
of
hegels
pupilsfrom
all
available
sources
including
the
notes
of
students
the
jena
volume
is
however
made
the
basis
as
representing
the
main
elements
of
the
subject

afterwards

i
have
endeavoured
to
make
this
translation
as
literal
as
possible
consistently
with
intelligibility
and
have
attempted
so
far
as
might
be
to
give
the
recognized
symbols
for
the
words
for
which

gentlemensince
the
history
of
philosophy
is
to
be
the
subject
of
these
lectures
and
today
i
am
making
my
first
appearance
in
this
university
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
what
satisfaction
it
gives
me
to
take
my
place
once
more
in
an
academy
of
learning
at
this
particular
time
for
the
period
seems
to
have
been
arrived
at
when
philosophy
may
again
hope
to
receive
some
attention
and
lovethis
almost
dead
science
may
again
raise
its
voice
and
hope
that
the
world
which
had
become
deaf
to
its
teaching
may
once
more
lend
it
an
ear
the
necessities
of
the
time
have
accorded
to
the
petty
interests
of
everyday
life
such
overwhelming
attention
the
deep
interests
of
actuality
and
the
strife
respecting
these
have
engrossed
all
the
powers
and
the
forces
of
the
mindas
also
the
necessary
meansto
so
great
an
extent
that
no
place
has
been
left
to
the
higher
inward
life
the
intellectual
operations
of
a
purer
sort
and
the
better
natures
have
thus
been
stunted
in
their
growth
and
in
great
measure
sacrificed
because
the
spirit
of
the
world
was
thus
occupied
it
could
not
look
within
and
withdraw
into
itself
but
since
this
stream
of
actuality
is
checked
since
the
german
nation
has
cut
its
way
out
of
its
most
material
conditions
since
its
nationality
the
basis
of
all
higher
life
has
been
saved
we
may
hope
that
in
addition
to
the
state
which
has
swallowed
up
all
other
interests
in
its
own
the
church
may
now
resume
her
high
positionthat
in
addition
to
the
kingdom
of
the
world
to
which
all
thoughts
and
efforts
have
hitherto
been
directed
the
kingdom
of
god
may
also
be
considered
in
other
words
along
with
the
business
of
politics
and
the
other
interests
of
everyday
life
we
may
trust
that
science
the
free
rational
world
of
mind
may
again
flourish
we
shall
see
in
the
history
of
philosophy
that
in
other
european
countries
in
which
the
sciences
and
the
cultivation
of
the
understanding
have
been
prosecuted
with
zeal
and
with
respect
philosophy
excepting
in
name
has
sunk
even
from
memory
and
that
it
is
in
the
german
nation
that
it
has
been
retained
as
a
peculiar
possession
we
have
received
the
higher
call
of
nature
to
be
the
conservers
of
this
holy
flame
just
as
the
eumolpid
in
athens
had
the
conservation
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
of
samothrace
the
preservation
and
maintenance
of
a
higher
divine
service
and
as
earlier
still
the
worldspirit
reserved
to
the
jewish
nation
the
highest
consciousness
that
it
should
once
more
rise
from
thence
as
a
new
spiritual
force
we
have
already
got
so
far
and
have
attained
to
a
seriousness
so
much
greater
and
a
consciousness
so
much
deeper
that
for
us
ideas
and
that
which
our
reason
justifies
can
alone
have
weight
to
speak
more
plainly
the
prussian
state
is
a
state
constituted
on
principles
of
intelligence
but
the
needs
of
the
time
and
the
interests
of
the
events
in
the
world
already
mentioned
have
repressed
a
real
and
earnest
effort
after
philosophy
and
driven
hence
any
general
attention
to
it
it
has
thus
happened
that
because
vigorous
natures
turned
to
the
practical
insipidity
and
dulness
appropriated
to
themselves
the
preeminence
in
philosophy
and
flourished
there
it
may
indeed
be
said
that
since
philosophy
began
to
take
a
place
in
germany
it
has
never
looked
so
badly
as
at
the
present
timenever
have
emptiness
and
shallowness
overlaid
it
so
completely
and
never
have
they
spoken
and
acted
with
such
arrogance
as
though
all
power
were
in
their
hands
to
combat
the
shallowness
to
strive
with
german
earnestness
and
honesty
to
draw
philosophy
out
of
the
solitude
into
which
it
has
wanderedto
do
such
work
as
this
we
may
hope
that
we
are
called
by
the
higher
spirit
of
our
time
let
us
together
greet
the
dawn
of
a
better
time
in
which
the
spirit
hitherto
a
prey
to
externalities
may
return
within
itself
come
to
itself
again
and
win
space
and
room
for
a
kingdom
of
its
own
where
true
minds
will
rise
above
the
interests
of
the
moment
and
obtain
the
power
to
receive
the
true
eternal
and
divine
the
power
to
consider
and
to
grasp
the
highest
we
elders
who
in
the
storms
of
the
age
have
ripened
into
men
may
think
you
happy
whose
youth
falls
in
the
day
in
which
you
may
devote
the
same
undisturbed
to
science
and
to
truth
i
have
dedicated
my
life
to
science
and
it
is
a
true
joy
to
me
to
find
myself
again
in
this
place
where
i
may
in
a
higher
measure
and
more
extensive
circle
work
with
others
in
the
interests
of
the
higher
sciences
and
help
to
direct
your
way
therein
i
hope
that
i
may
succeed
in
deserving
and
obtaining
your
confidence
but
in
the
first
place
i
can
ask
nothing
of
you
but
to
bring
with
you
above
all
a
trust
in
science
and
a
trust
in
yourselves
the
love
of
truth
faith
in
the
power
of
mind
is
the
first
condition
in
philosophy
man
because
he
is
mind
should
and
must
deem
himself
worthy
of
the
highest
he
cannot
think
too
highly
of
the
greatness
and
the
power
of
his
mind
and
with
this
belief
nothing
will
be
so
difficult
and
hard
that
it
will
not
reveal
itself
to
him
the
being
of
the
universe
at
first
hidden
and
concealed
has
no
power
which
can
offer
resistance
to
the
search
for
knowledge
it
has
to
lay
itself
open
before
the
seekerto
set
before
his
eyes
and
give
for
his
enjoyment
its
riches
and
its
depths
prefatory
note
in
the
history
of
philosophy
the
observation
is
immediately
forced
upon
us
that
it
certainly
presents
great
interest
if
its
subject
is
regarded
from
a
favourable
point
of
view
but
that
it
would
still
possess
interest
even
if
its
end
were
regarded
as
opposite
to
what
it
is
indeed
this
interest
may
seem
to
increase
in
the
degree
in
which
the
ordinary
conception
of
philosophy
and
of
the
end
which
its
history
serves
is
reversed
for
from
the
history
of
philosophy
a
proof
of
the
futility
of
the
science
is
mainly
derived
the
demand
that
a
history
whatever
the
subject
may
be
should
state
the
facts
without
prejudice
and
without
any
particular
object
or
end
to
be
gained
by
its
means
must
be
regarded
as
a
fair
one
but
with
a
commonplace
demand
like
this
we
do
not
get
far
for
the
history
of
a
subject
is
necessarily
intimately
connected
with
the
conception
which
is
formed
of
it
in
accordance
with
this
what
is
important
in
it
is
determined
and
the
relation
of
the
events
to
the
end
regulates
the
selection
of
facts
to
be
recorded
the
mode
of
comprehending
them
and
the
point
of
view
under
which
they
are
regarded
it
may
happen
from
the
ideas
formed
of
what
a
state
really
is
that
a
reader
of
the
political
history
of
a
country
may
find
therein
nothing
of
what
he
looks
for
still
more
may
this
be
the
case
in
the
history
of
philosophy
and
representations
of
this
history
may
be
instanced
in
which
everything
excepting
what
was
supposed
to
be
philosophy
appears
to
be
found
in
other
histories
we
have
a
clear
conception
of
their
subjects
at
least
so
far
as
their
principal
points
are
concerned
we
know
whether
they
concern
a
particular
land
people
or
race
or
whether
their
subject
is
the
science
of
mathematics
physics
c
or
an
art
such
as
painting
the
science
of
philosophy
has
however
this
distinguishing
feature
and
if
you
will
this
disadvantage
as
compared
with
other
sciences
that
we
find
the
most
varied
points
of
view
as
regards
its
notion
and
regarding
that
which
it
ought
to
and
can
accomplish
if
this
first
assumption
the
conception
of
the
subject
of
the
history
is
not
established
the
history
itself
is
necessarily
made
vacillating
and
it
only
obtains
consistency
when
it
sets
forth
a
definite
conception
but
then
in
view
of
the
various
ways
of
regarding
its
subject
it
easily
draws
upon
itself
the
reproach
of
onesidedness
that
drawback
relates
however
only
to
an
external
consideration
of
this
narrative
there
is
another
and
greater
disadvantage
allied
to
it
if
there
are
different
notions
of
the
science
of
philosophy
it
is
the
true
notion
alone
that
puts
us
in
a
position
to
understand
the
writings
of
philosophers
who
have
worked
in
the
knowledge
of
it
for
in
thought
and
particularly
in
speculative
thought
comprehension
means
something
quite
different
from
understanding
the
grammatical
sense
of
the
words
alone
and
also
from
understanding
them
in
the
region
of
ordinary
conception
only
hence
we
may
possess
a
knowledge
of
the
assertions
propositions
or
of
the
opinions
of
philosophers
we
may
have
occupied
ourselves
largely
with
the
grounds
of
and
deductions
from
these
opinions
and
the
main
point
in
all
that
we
have
done
may
be
wantingthe
comprehension
of
the
propositions
there
is
hence
no
lack
of
voluminous
and
even
learned
histories
of
philosophy
in
which
the
knowledge
of
the
matter
itself
about
which
so
much
ado
has
been
made
is
absent
the
authors
of
such
histories
may
be
compared
to
animals
which
have
listened
to
all
the
tones
in
some
music
but
to
whose
senses
the
unison
the
harmony
of
their
tones
has
not
penetrated
the
circumstance
mentioned
makes
it
in
no
science
so
necessary
as
in
the
history
of
philosophy
to
commence
with
an
introduction
and
in
it
correctly
to
define
in
the
first
place
the
subject
of
the
history
about
to
be
related
for
it
may
be
said
how
should
we
begin
to
treat
a
subject
the
name
of
which
is
certainly
mentioned
often
enough
but
of
whose
nature
we
as
yet
know
nothing
in
treating
the
history
of
philosophy
thus
we
could
have
no
other
guidance
than
that
of
seeking
out
and
taking
up
whatever
has
received
the
name
of
philosophy
anywhere
or
any
time
but
in
fact
when
the
notion
of
philosophy
is
established
not
arbitrarily
but
in
a
scientific
way
such
treatment
becomes
the
science
of
philosophy
itself
for
in
this
science
the
peculiar
characteristic
is
that
its
notion
forms
the
beginning
in
appearance
merely
and
it
is
only
the
whole
treatment
of
the
science
that
is
the
proof
and
indeed
we
may
say
the
finding
of
its
notion
and
this
is
really
a
result
of
that
treatment
in
this
introduction
the
notion
of
the
science
of
philosophy
of
the
subject
of
its
history
has
thus
likewise
to
be
set
forth
at
the
same
time
though
this
introduction
professes
to
relate
to
the
history
of
philosophy
only
what
has
just
been
said
of
philosophy
on
the
whole
also
holds
good
what
can
be
said
in
this
introduction
is
not
so
much
something
which
may
be
stated
beforehand
as
what
can
be
justified
or
proved
in
the
treatment
of
the
history
these
preparatory
explanations
are
for
this
reason
only
not
to
be
placed
in
the
category
of
arbitrary
assumptions
but
to
begin
with
stating
what
in
their
justification
are
really
results
can
only
have
the
interest
which
may
be
possessed
by
a
summary
given
in
advance
of
the
most
general
contents
of
a
science
it
must
serve
to
set
aside
many
questions
and
demands
which
might
from
our
ordinary
prejudices
arise
in
such
a
history
introduction
there
are
various
aspects
under
which
the
history
of
philosophy
may
possess
interest
we
shall
find
the
central
point
of
this
interest
in
the
essential
connection
existing
between
what
is
apparently
past
and
the
present
stage
reached
by
philosophy
that
this
connection
is
not
one
of
the
external
considerations
which
may
be
taken
into
account
in
the
history
of
philosophy
but
really
expresses
its
inner
character
that
the
events
of
this
history
while
they
perpetuate
themselves
in
their
effects
like
all
other
events
yet
produce
their
results
in
a
special
waythis
it
is
which
is
here
to
be
more
clearly
expounded
what
the
history
of
philosophy
shows
us
is
a
succession
of
noble
minds
a
gallery
of
heroes
of
thought
who
by
the
power
of
reason
have
penetrated
into
the
being
of
things
of
nature
and
of
spirit
into
the
being
of
god
and
have
won
for
us
by
their
labours
the
highest
treasure
the
treasure
of
reasoned
knowledge
the
events
and
actions
of
this
history
are
therefore
such
that
personality
and
individual
character
do
not
enter
to
any
large
degree
into
its
content
and
matter
in
this
respect
the
history
of
philosophy
contrasts
with
political
history
in
which
the
individual
according
to
the
peculiarity
of
his
disposition
talents
affections
the
strength
or
weakness
of
his
character
and
in
general
according
to
that
through
which
he
is
this
individual
is
the
subject
of
actions
and
events
in
philosophy
the
less
deserts
and
merits
are
accorded
to
the
particular
individual
the
better
is
the
history
and
the
more
it
deals
with
thought
as
free
with
the
universal
character
of
man
as
man
the
more
this
thought
which
is
devoid
of
special
characteristic
is
itself
shown
to
be
the
producing
subject
the
acts
of
thought
appear
at
first
to
be
a
matter
of
history
and
therefore
things
of
the
past
and
outside
our
real
existence
but
in
reality
we
are
what
we
are
through
history
or
more
accurately
as
in
the
history
of
thought
what
has
passed
away
is
only
one
side
so
in
the
present
what
we
have
as
a
permanent
possession
is
essentially
bound
up
with
our
place
in
history
the
possession
of
selfconscious
reason
which
belongs
to
us
of
the
present
world
did
not
arise
suddenly
nor
did
it
grow
only
from
the
soil
of
the
present
this
possession
must
be
regarded
as
previously
present
as
an
inheritance
and
as
the
result
of
labourthe
labour
of
all
past
generations
of
men
just
as
the
arts
of
outward
life
the
accumulated
skill
and
invention
the
customs
and
arrangements
of
social
and
political
life
are
the
result
of
the
thought
care
and
needs
of
the
want
and
the
misery
of
the
ingenuity
the
plans
and
achievements
of
those
who
preceded
us
in
history
so
likewise
in
science
and
specially
in
philosophy
do
we
owe
what
we
are
to
the
tradition
which
as
herder
has
put
it1
like
a
holy
chain
runs
through
all
that
was
transient
and
has
therefore
passed
away
thus
has
been
preserved
and
transmitted
to
us
what
antiquity
produced
but
this
tradition
is
not
only
a
stewardess
who
simply
guards
faithfully
that
which
she
has
received
and
thus
delivers
it
unchanged
to
posterity
just
as
the
course
of
nature
in
the
infinite
change
and
activity
of
its
forms
ever
remains
constant
to
its
original
laws
and
makes
no
step
in
advance
such
tradition
is
no
motionless
statue
but
is
alive
and
swells
like
a
mighty
river
which
increases
in
size
the
further
it
advances
from
its
source
the
content
of
this
tradition
is
that
which
the
intellectual
world
has
brought
forth
and
the
universal
mind
does
not
remain
stationary
but
it
is
just
the
universal
mind
with
which
we
have
to
do
it
may
certainly
be
the
case
with
a
single
nation
that
its
culture
art
scienceits
intellectual
activities
as
a
wholeare
at
a
standstill
this
appears
perhaps
to
be
the
case
with
the
chinese
for
example
who
may
have
been
as
far
advanced
in
every
respect
two
thousand
years
ago
as
now
but
the
worldspirit
does
not
sink
into
this
rest
of
indifference
this
follows
from
its
very
nature
for
its
activity
is
its
life
this
activity
presupposes
a
material
already
present
on
which
it
acts
and
which
it
does
not
merely
augment
by
the
addition
of
new
matter
but
completely
fashions
and
transforms
thus
that
which
each
generation
has
produced
in
science
and
in
intellectual
activity
is
an
heirloom
to
which
all
the
past
generations
have
added
their
savings
a
temple
in
which
all
races
of
men
thankfully
and
cheerfully
deposit
that
which
rendered
aid
to
them
through
life
and
which
they
had
won
from
the
depths
of
nature
and
of
mind
to
receive
this
inheritance
is
also
to
enter
upon
its
use
it
constitutes
the
soul
of
each
successive
generation
the
intellectual
substance
of
the
time
its
principles
prejudices
and
possessions
and
this
legacy
is
degraded
to
a
material
which
becomes
metamorphosed
by
mind
in
this
manner
that
which
is
received
is
changed
and
the
material
worked
upon
is
both
enriched
and
preserved
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
function
of
our
own
and
of
every
age
to
grasp
the
knowledge
which
is
already
existing
to
make
it
our
own
and
in
so
doing
to
develop
it
still
further
and
to
raise
it
to
a
higher
level
in
thus
appropriating
it
to
ourselves
we
make
it
into
something
different
from
what
it
was
before
on
the
presupposition
of
an
already
existing
intellectual
world
which
is
transformed
in
our
appropriation
of
it
depends
the
fact
that
philosophy
can
only
arise
in
connection
with
previous
philosophy
from
which
of
necessity
it
has
arisen
the
course
of
history
does
not
show
us
the
becoming
of
things
foreign
to
us
but
the
becoming
of
ourselves
and
of
our
own
knowledge
the
ideas
and
questions
which
may
be
present
to
our
mind
regarding
the
character
and
ends
of
the
history
of
philosophy
depend
on
the
nature
of
the
relationship
here
given
in
this
lies
the
explanation
of
the
fact
that
the
study
of
the
history
of
philosophy
is
an
introduction
to
philosophy
itself
the
guiding
principles
for
the
formation
of
this
history
are
given
in
this
fact
the
further
discussion
of
which
must
thus
be
the
main
object
of
this
introduction
we
must
also
however
keep
in
mind
as
being
of
fundamental
importance
the
conception
of
the
aim
of
philosophy
and
since
as
already
mentioned
the
systematic
exposition
of
this
conception
cannot
here
find
a
place
such
discussion
as
we
can
now
undertake
can
only
propose
to
deal
with
the
subject
provisionally
and
not
to
give
a
thorough
and
conclusive
account
of
the
nature
of
the
becoming
of
philosophy
this
becoming
is
not
merely
a
passive
movement
as
we
suppose
movements
such
as
those
of
the
sun
and
moon
to
be
it
is
no
mere
movement
in
the
unresisting
medium
of
space
and
time
what
we
must
represent
to
ourselves
is
the
activity
of
free
thought
we
have
to
present
the
history
of
the
world
of
thought
as
it
has
arisen
and
produced
itself
there
is
an
old
tradition
that
it
is
the
faculty
of
thought
which
separates
men
from
beasts
and
to
this
tradition
we
shall
adhere
in
accordance
with
this
what
man
has
as
being
nobler
than
a
beast
he
has
through
thinking
everything
which
is
human
however
it
may
appear
is
so
only
because
the
thought
contained
in
it
works
and
has
worked
but
thought
although
it
is
thus
the
essential
substantial
and
effectual
has
many
other
elements
we
must
however
consider
it
best
when
thought
does
not
pursue
anything
else
but
is
occupied
only
with
itselfwith
what
is
noblestwhen
it
has
sought
and
found
itself
the
history
which
we
have
before
us
is
the
history
of
thought
finding
itself
and
it
is
the
case
with
thought
that
it
only
finds
itself
in
producing
itself
indeed
that
it
only
exists
and
is
actual
in
finding
itself
these
productions
are
the
philosophic
systems
and
the
series
of
discoveries
on
which
thought
sets
out
in
order
to
discover
itself
forms
a
work
which
has
lasted
twentyfive
hundred
years
if
the
thought
which
is
essentially
thought
is
in
and
for
itself
and
eternal
and
that
which
is
true
is
contained
in
thought
alone
how
then
does
this
intellectual
world
come
to
have
a
history
in
history
what
appears
is
transient
has
disappeared
in
the
night
of
the
past
and
is
no
more
but
true
necessary
thoughtand
it
is
only
with
such
that
we
have
to
dois
capable
of
no
change
the
question
here
raised
constitutes
one
of
those
matters
first
to
be
brought
under
our
consideration
but
in
the
second
place
there
are
also
many
most
important
things
outside
of
philosophy
which
are
yet
the
work
of
thought
and
which
are
left
unconsidered
such
are
religion
political
history
forms
of
government
and
the
arts
and
sciences
the
question
arises
as
to
how
these
operations
differ
from
the
subject
of
consideration
and
how
they
are
related
in
history
as
regards
these
two
points
of
view
it
is
desirable
to
show
in
what
sense
the
history
of
philosophy
is
here
taken
in
order
to
see
clearly
what
we
are
about
moreover
in
the
third
place
we
must
first
take
a
general
survey
before
we
descend
to
particulars
else
the
whole
is
not
seen
for
the
mere
detailsthe
wood
is
not
seen
for
the
trees
nor
philosophy
for
mere
philosophies
we
require
to
have
a
general
idea
of
the
nature
and
aim
of
the
whole
in
order
to
know
what
to
look
for
just
as
we
first
desire
to
obtain
a
general
idea
of
a
country
which
we
should
no
longer
see
in
going
into
detail
so
we
desire
to
see
the
relation
which
single
philosophies
bear
to
the
whole
for
in
reality
the
high
value
of
the
detail
lies
in
its
relation
to
the
whole
this
is
nowhere
more
the
case
than
with
philosophy
and
also
with
its
history
in
the
case
of
a
history
indeed
the
establishment
of
the
universal
seems
to
be
less
needful
than
in
that
of
one
of
the
sciences
proper
for
history
seems
at
first
to
be
a
succession
of
chance
events
in
which
each
fact
stands
isolated
by
itself
which
has
time
alone
as
a
connectinglink
but
even
in
political
history
we
are
not
satisfied
with
this
we
see
or
at
least
divine
in
it
that
essential
connection
in
which
the
individual
events
have
their
place
and
relation
to
an
end
or
aim
and
in
this
way
obtain
significance
for
the
significant
in
history
is
such
only
through
its
relation
to
and
connection
with
a
universal
to
perceive
this
universal
is
thus
to
apprehend
the
significance
there
are
therefore
the
following
points
with
which
i
wish
to
deal
in
this
introduction
the
first
of
these
will
be
to
investigate
the
character
of
the
history
of
philosophy
its
significance
its
nature
and
its
aim
from
which
will
follow
inferences
as
to
its
treatment
in
particular
we
shall
get
an
insight
into
the
relation
of
the
history
of
philosophy
to
the
science
of
philosophy
and
this
will
be
the
most
interesting
point
of
all
that
is
to
say
this
history
represents
not
merely
the
external
accidental
events
contained
within
it
but
it
shows
how
the
content
or
that
which
appears
to
belong
to
mere
history
really
belongs
to
the
science
of
philosophy
the
history
of
philosophy
is
itself
scientific
and
thus
essentially
becomes
the
science
of
philosophy
in
the
second
place
the
notion
of
philosophy
must
be
more
adequately
determined
and
from
it
must
be
deduced
what
should
be
excluded
from
the
history
of
philosophy
out
of
the
infinite
material
and
the
manifold
aspects
of
the
intellectual
culture
of
the
nations
religion
certainly
and
the
thoughts
contained
in
and
regarding
it
particularly
when
these
are
in
the
form
of
mythology
are
on
account
of
their
matter
and
the
sciences
with
their
ideas
on
the
state
duties
and
laws
on
account
of
their
form
so
near
philosophy
that
the
history
of
the
science
of
philosophy
threatens
to
become
quite
indefinite
in
extent
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
history
of
philosophy
should
take
account
of
all
these
ideas
has
not
everything
been
called
philosophy
and
philosophizing
on
the
one
hand
the
close
connection
has
to
be
further
considered
in
which
philosophy
stands
with
its
allied
subjects
religion
art
the
other
sciences
and
likewise
with
political
history
on
the
other
hand
when
the
province
of
philosophy
has
been
correctly
defined
we
reach
with
the
determination
of
what
philosophy
is
and
what
pertains
to
it
the
startingpoint
of
its
history
which
must
be
distinguished
from
the
commencements
of
religious
ideas
and
mere
thoughtful
conjectures
from
the
idea
of
the
subject
which
is
contained
in
these
first
two
points
of
view
it
is
necessary
to
pass
on
to
the
consideration
of
the
third
point
to
the
general
review
of
this
history
and
to
the
division
of
its
progress
into
natural
periodssuch
an
arrangement
to
exhibit
it
as
an
organic
progressive
whole
as
a
rational
connection
through
which
this
history
attains
the
dignity
of
a
science
and
i
will
not
occupy
further
space
with
reflections
on
the
use
of
the
history
of
philosophy
and
other
methods
of
treating
it
the
use
is
evident
but
in
conclusion
i
wish
to
consider
the
sources
of
the
history
of
philosophy
for
this
is
customary
a
the
notion
of
the
history
of
philosophy
the
thought
which
may
first
occur
to
us
in
the
history
of
philosophy
is
that
the
subject
itself
contains
an
inner
contradiction
for
philosophy
aims
at
understanding
what
is
unchangeable
eternal
in
and
for
itself
its
end
is
truth
but
history
tells
us
of
that
which
has
at
one
time
existed
at
another
time
has
vanished
having
been
expelled
by
something
else
truth
is
eternal
it
does
not
fall
within
the
sphere
of
the
transient
and
has
no
history
but
if
it
has
a
history
and
as
this
history
is
only
the
representation
of
a
succession
of
past
forms
of
knowledge
the
truth
is
not
to
be
found
in
it
for
the
truth
cannot
be
what
has
passed
away
it
might
be
said
that
all
this
argument
would
affect
not
only
the
other
sciences
but
in
like
degree
the
christian
religion
and
it
might
be
found
inconsistent
that
a
history
of
this
religion
and
of
the
other
sciences
should
exist
but
it
would
be
superfluous
further
to
examine
this
argument
for
it
is
immediately
contradicted
by
the
very
fact
that
there
are
such
histories
but
in
order
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
this
apparent
contradiction
we
must
distinguish
between
the
outward
history
of
a
religion
or
a
science
and
the
history
of
the
subject
itself
and
then
we
must
take
into
account
that
the
history
of
philosophy
because
of
the
special
nature
of
its
subjectmatter
is
different
from
other
histories
it
is
at
once
evident
that
the
contradiction
in
question
could
not
refer
to
the
outward
history
but
merely
to
the
inward
or
that
of
the
content
itself
there
is
a
history
of
the
spread
of
christianity
and
of
the
lives
of
those
who
have
avowed
it
and
its
existence
has
formed
itself
into
that
of
a
church
this
in
itself
constitutes
an
external
existence
such
that
being
brought
into
contact
with
temporal
affairs
of
the
most
diverse
kind
its
lot
is
a
varied
one
and
it
essentially
possesses
a
history
and
of
the
christian
doctrine
it
is
true
that
it
too
has
its
history
but
it
necessarily
soon
reached
its
full
development
and
attained
to
its
appointed
powers
and
this
old
creed
has
been
an
acknowledged
influence
to
every
age
and
will
still
be
acknowledged
unchanged
as
the
truth
even
though
this
acknowledgment
were
become
no
more
than
a
pretence
and
the
words
an
empty
form
but
the
history
of
this
doctrine
in
its
wider
sense
includes
two
elements
first
the
various
additions
to
and
deviations
from
the
truth
formerly
established
and
secondly
the
combating
of
these
errors
the
purification
of
the
principles
that
remain
from
such
additions
and
a
consequent
return
to
their
first
simplicity
the
other
sciences
including
philosophy
have
also
an
external
history
like
religion
philosophy
has
a
history
of
its
origin
diffusion
maturity
decay
revival
a
history
of
its
teachers
promoters
and
of
its
opponentsoften
too
of
an
outward
relation
to
religion
and
occasionally
to
the
state
this
side
of
its
history
likewise
gives
occasion
to
interesting
questions
amongst
other
such
it
is
asked
why
philosophy
the
doctrine
of
absolute
truth
seems
to
have
revealed
itself
on
the
whole
to
a
small
number
of
individuals
to
special
nations
and
how
it
has
limited
itself
to
particular
periods
of
time
similarly
with
respect
to
christianity
to
the
truth
in
a
much
more
universal
form
than
the
philosophical
a
difficulty
has
been
encountered
in
respect
to
the
question
whether
there
is
a
contradiction
in
the
fact
that
this
religion
should
have
appeared
so
late
in
time
and
that
it
should
have
remained
so
long
and
should
still
remain
limited
to
special
races
of
men
but
these
and
other
similar
questions
are
too
much
a
matter
of
detail
to
depend
merely
on
the
general
conflict
referred
to
and
when
we
have
further
touched
upon
the
peculiar
character
of
philosophic
knowledge
we
may
go
more
specially
into
the
aspects
which
relate
to
the
external
existence
and
external
history
of
philosophy
but
as
regards
the
comparison
between
the
history
of
religion
and
that
of
philosophy
as
to
inner
content
there
is
not
in
the
latter
as
there
is
in
religion
a
fixed
and
fundamental
truth
which
as
unchangeable
is
apart
from
history
the
content
of
christianity
which
is
truth
has
however
remained
unaltered
as
such
and
has
therefore
little
history
or
as
good
as
none2
hence
in
religion
on
account
of
its
very
nature
as
christianity
the
conflict
referred
to
disappears
the
errors
and
additions
constitute
no
difficulty
they
are
transitory
and
altogether
historical
in
character
the
other
sciences
indeed
have
also
according
to
their
content
a
history
a
part
of
which
relates
to
alterations
and
the
renunciation
of
tenets
which
were
formerly
current
but
a
great
perhaps
the
greater
part
of
the
history
relates
to
what
has
proved
permanent
so
that
what
was
new
was
not
an
alteration
on
earlier
acquisitions
but
an
addition
to
them
these
sciences
progress
through
a
process
of
juxtaposition
it
is
true
that
in
botany
mineralogy
and
so
on
much
is
dependent
on
what
was
previously
known
but
by
far
the
greatest
part
remains
stationary
and
by
means
of
fresh
matter
is
merely
added
to
without
itself
being
affected
by
the
addition
with
a
science
like
mathematics
history
has
in
the
main
only
the
pleasing
task
of
recording
further
additions
thus
to
take
an
example
elementary
geometry
in
so
far
as
it
was
created
by
euclid
may
from
his
time
on
be
regarded
as
having
no
further
history
the
history
of
philosophy
on
the
other
hand
shows
neither
the
motionlessness
of
a
complete
simple
content
nor
altogether
the
onward
movement
of
a
peaceful
addition
of
new
treasures
to
those
already
acquired
it
seems
merely
to
afford
the
spectacle
of
everrecurring
changes
in
the
whole
such
as
finally
are
no
longer
even
connected
by
a
common

1
common
ideas
regarding
the
history
of
philosophy
at
this
point
appear
these
ordinary
superficial
ideas
regarding
the
history
of
philosophy
which
have
to
be
referred
to
and
corrected
as
regards
these
very
current
views
which
are
doubtless
known
to
you
gentlemen
for
indeed
they
are
the
reflections
most
likely
to
occur
in
ones
first
crude
thoughts
on
a
history
of
philosophy
i
will
shortly
explain
what
requires
explanation
and
the
explanation
of
the
differences
in
philosophies
will
lead
us
further
into
the
matter
itself
a
the
history
of
philosophy
as
an
accumulation
of
opinions
history
at
the
first
glance
includes
in
its
aim
the
narration
of
the
accidental
circumstances
of
times
of
races
and
of
individuals
treated
impartially
partly
as
regards
their
relation
in
time
and
partly
as
to
their
content
the
appearance
of
contingency
in
timesuccession
is
to
be
dealt
with
later
on
it
is
contingency
of
content
which
is
the
idea
with
which
we
have
first
to
dealthe
idea
of
contingent
actions
but
thoughts
and
not
external
actions
or
griefs
or
joys
form
the
content
of
philosophy
contingent
thoughts
however
are
nothing
but
opinions
and
philosophical
opinions
are
opinions
relating
to
the
more
special
content
of
philosophy
regarding
god
nature
and
spirit
thus
we
now
meet
the
view
very
usually
taken
of
the
history
of
philosophy
which
ascribes
to
it
the
narration
of
a
number
of
philosophical
opinions
as
they
have
arisen
and
manifested
themselves
in
time
this
kind
of
matter
is
in
courtesy
called
opinions
those
who
think
themselves
more
capable
of
judging
rightly
call
such
a
history
a
display
of
senseless
follies
or
at
least
of
errors
made
by
men
engrossed
in
thought
and
in
mere
ideas
this
view
is
not
only
held
by
those
who
recognize
their
ignorance
of
philosophy
those
who
do
this
acknowledge
it
because
that
ignorance
is
in
common
estimation
held
to
be
no
obstacle
to
giving
judgment
upon
what
has
to
do
with
the
subject
for
it
is
thought
that
anybody
can
form
a
judgment
on
its
character
and
value
without
any
comprehension
of
it
whatever
but
the
same
view
is
even
held
by
those
who
write
or
have
written
on
the
history
of
philosophy
this
history
considered
only
as
the
enumeration
of
various
opinions
thus
becomes
an
idle
tale
or
if
you
will
an
erudite
investigation
for
erudition
is
in
the
main
acquaintance
with
a
number
of
useless
things
that
is
to
say
with
that
which
has
no
intrinsic
interest
or
value
further
than
being
known
yet
it
is
thought
that
profit
is
to
be
derived
from
learning
the
various
opinions
and
reflections
of
other
men
it
stimulates
the
powers
of
thought
and
also
leads
to
many
excellent
reflections
this
signifies
that
now
and
then
it
occasions
an
idea
and
its
art
thus
consists
in
the
spinning
one
opinion
out
of
the
other
if
the
history
of
philosophy
merely
represented
various
opinions
in
array
whether
they
be
of
god
or
of
natural
and
spiritual
things
existent
it
would
be
a
most
superfluous
and
tiresome
science
no
matter
what
advantage
might
be
brought
forward
as
derived
from
such
thoughtactivity
and
learning
what
can
be
more
useless
than
to
learn
a
string
of
bald
opinions
and
what
more
unimportant
literary
works
being
histories
of
philosophy
in
the
sense
that
they
produce
and
treat
the
ideas
of
philosophy
as
if
they
were
opinions
need
be
only
superficially
glanced
at
to
find
how
dry
and
destitute
of
interest
everything
about
them
is
an
opinion
is
a
subjective
conception
an
uncontrolled
thought
an
idea
which
may
occur
to
me
in
one
direction
or
in
another
an
opinion
is
mine3
it
is
in
itself
a
universal
thought
which
is
existent
in
and
for
itself
but
philosophy
possesses
no
opinions
for
there
is
no
such
thing
as
philosophical
opinions
when
we
hear
a
man
speaking
of
philosophical
opinions
even
though
he
be
an
historian
of
philosophy
itself
we
detect
at
once
this
want
of
fundamental
education
philosophy
is
the
objective
science
of
truth
it
is
science
of
necessity
conceiving
knowledge
and
neither
opinion
nor
the
spinning
out
of
opinions
the
more
precise
significance
of
this
idea
is
that
we
get
to
know
opinions
only
thus
laying
emphasis
upon
the
word
opinion
now
the
direct
opposite
of
opinion
is
the
truth
it
is
truth
before
which
mere
opinion
pales
those
who
in
the
history
of
philosophy
seek
mere
theories
or
who
suppose
that
on
the
whole
only
such
are
to
be
found
within
it
also
turn
aside
when
that
word
truth
confronts
them
philosophy
here
encounters
opposition
from
two
different
sides
on
the
one
hand
piety
openly
declares
reason
or
thought
to
be
incapable
of
apprehending
what
is
true
and
to
lead
only
to
the
abyss
of
doubt
it
declares
that
independent
thought
must
be
renounced
and
reason
held
in
bounds
by
faith
in
blind
authority
if
truth
is
to
be
reached
of
the
relation
existing
between
religion
and
philosophy
and
of
its
history
we
shall
deal
later
on
on
the
other
hand
it
is
known
just
as
well
that
socalled
reason
has
maintained
its
rights
abandoning
faith
in
mere
authority
and
has
endeavoured
to
make
christianity
rational
so
that
throughout
it
is
only
my
personal
insight
and
conviction
which
obliges
me
to
make
any
admissions
but
this
affirmation
of
the
right
of
reason
is
turned
round
in
an
astonishing
manner
so
that
it
results
in
making
knowledge
of
the
truth
through
reason
an
impossibility
this
socalled
reason
on
the
one
hand
has
combated
religious
faith
in
the
name
and
power
of
thinking
reason
and
at
the
same
time
it
has
itself
turned
against
reason
and
is
true
reasons
adversary
instinct
and
feeling
are
maintained
by
it
against
the
true
reason
thus
making
the
measure
of
true
value
the
merely
subjectivethat
is
a
particular
conviction
such
as
each
can
form
in
and
for
himself
in
his
subjective
capacity
a
personal
conviction
such
as
this
is
no
more
than
the
particular
opinion
that
has
become
final
for
men
if
we
begin
with
what
meets
us
in
our
very
first
conceptions
we
cannot
neglect
to
make
mention
of
this
aspect
in
the
history
of
philosophy
in
its
results
it
permeates
culture
generally
being
at
once
the
misconception
and
true
sign
of
our
times
it
is
the
principle
through
which
men
mutually
understand
and
know
each
other
an
hypothesis
whose
value
is
established
and
which
is
the
ground
of
all
the
other
sciences
in
theology
it
is
not
so
much
the
creed
of
the
church
that
passes
for
christianity
as
that
every
one
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
makes
a
christianity
of
his
own
to
tally
with
his
conviction
and
in
history
we
often
see
theology
driven
into
acquiring
the
knowledge
of
various
opinions
in
order
that
an
interest
may
thus
be
furnished
to
the
science
and
one
of
the
first
results
of
the
attention
paid
them
is
the
honour
awarded
to
all
convictions
and
the
esteem
vouchsafed
to
what
has
been
constituted
merely
by
the
individual
the
endeavour
to
know
the
truth
is
then
of
course
relinquished
it
is
true
that
personal
conviction
is
the
ultimate
and
absolute
essential
which
reason
and
its
philosophy
from
a
subjective
point
of
view
demand
in
knowledge
but
there
is
a
distinction
between
conviction
when
it
rests
on
subjective
grounds
such
as
feelings
speculations
and
perceptions
or
speaking
generally
on
the
particular
nature
of
the
subject
and
when
it
rests
on
thought
proceeding
from
acquaintance
with
the
notion
and
the
nature
of
the
thing
in
the
former
case
conviction
is
opinion
this
opposition
between
mere
opinion
and
truth
now
sharply
defined
we
already
recognize
in
the
culture
of
the
period
of
socrates
and
platoa
period
of
corruption
in
greek
lifeas
the
platonic
opposition
between
opinion

and
science

it
is
the
same
opposition
as
that
which
existed
in
the
decadence
of
roman
public
and
political
life
under
augustus
and
subsequently
when
epicureanism
and
indifference
set
themselves
up
against
philosophy
under
this
influence
when
christ
said
i
came
into
the
world
that
i
should
bear
witness
unto
the
truth
pilate
answered
what
is
truth
that
was
said
in
a
superior
way
and
signifies
that
this
idea
of
truth
is
an
expedient
which
is
obsolete
we
have
got
further
we
know
that
there
is
no
longer
any
question
about
knowing
the
truth
seeing
that
we
have
gone
beyond
it
who
makes
this
statement
has
gone
beyond
it
indeed
if
this
is
made
our
starting
point
in
the
history
of
philosophy
its
whole
significance
will
consist
in
finding
out
the
particular
ideas
of
others
each
one
of
which
is
different
from
the
other
these
individual
points
of
view
are
thus
foreign
to
me
my
thinking
reason
is
not
free
nor
is
it
present
in
them
for
me
they
are
but
extraneous
dead
historic
matter
or
so
much
empty
content
and
to
satisfy
oneself
with
empty
vanity
is
mere
subjective
vanity
itself
to
the
impartial
man
the
truth
has
always
been
a
heartstirring
word
and
one
of
great
import
as
to
the
assertion
that
the
truth
cannot
be
known
we
shall
consider
it
more
closely
in
the
history
of
philosophy
itself
where
it
appears
the
only
thing
to
be
here
remarked
is
that
if
this
assumption
be
allowed
as
was
the
case
with
tennemann
it
is
beyond
conception
why
anyone
should
still
trouble
about
philosophy
since
each
opinion
asserts
falsely
in
its
turn
that
it
has
found
the
truth
this
immediately
recalls
to
me
the
old
belief
that
truth
consists
in
knowledge
but
that
an
individual
only
knows
the
truth
in
so
far
as
he
reflects
and
not
as
he
walks
and
stands
and
that
the
truth
cannot
be
known
in
immediate
apprehension
and
perception
whether
it
be
external
and
sensuous
or
whether
it
be
intellectual
perception
for
every
perception
as
a
perception
is
sensuous
but
only
through
the
labour
of
thought
b
proof
of
the
futility
of
philosophical
knowledge
obtained
through
the
history
of
philosophy
itself
from
another
point
of
view
another
consequence
ensues
from
the
above
conception
of
the
history
of
philosophy
which
may
at
will
be
looked
at
as
an
evil
or
a
benefit
in
view
of
such
manifold
opinions
and
philosophical
systems
so
numerous
one
is
perplexed
to
know
which
one
ought
to
be
accepted
in
regard
to
the
great
matters
to
which
man
is
attracted
and
a
knowledge
of
which
philosophy
would
bestow
it
is
evident
that
the
greatest
minds
have
erred
because
they
have
been
contradicted
by
others
since
this
has
been
so
with
minds
so
great
how
then
can
ego
homuncio
attempt
to
form
a
judgment
this
consequence
which
ensues
from
the
diversity
in
philosophical
systems
is
as
may
be
supposed
the
evil
in
the
matter
while
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
subjective
good
for
this
diversity
is
the
usual
plea
urged
by
those
who
with
an
air
of
knowledge
wish
to
make
a
show
of
interest
in
philosophy
to
explain
the
fact
that
they
with
this
pretence
of
goodwill
and
indeed
with
added
motive
for
working
at
the
science
do
in
fact
utterly
neglect
it
but
this
diversity
in
philosophical
systems
is
far
from
being
merely
an
evasive
plea
it
has
far
more
weight
as
a
genuine
serious
ground
of
argument
against
the
zeal
which
philosophy
requires
it
justifies
its
neglect
and
demonstrates
conclusively
the
powerlessness
of
the
endeavour
to
attain
to
philosophic
knowledge
of
the
truth
when
it
is
admitted
that
philosophy
ought
to
be
a
real
science
and
one
philosophy
must
certainly
be
the
true
the
question
arises
as
to
which
philosophy
it
is
and
when
it
can
be
known
each
one
asserts
its
genuineness
each
even
gives
different
signs
and
tokens
by
which
the
truth
can
be
discovered
sober
reflective
thought
must
therefore
hesitate
to
give
its
judgment
this
then
is
the
wider
interest
which
the
history
of
philosophy
is
said
to
afford

slovenly
history
of
philosophic
thought
on
god
he
puts
it
in
the
mouth
of
an
epicurean
but
he
himself
knew
of
nothing
more
favourable
to
say
and
it
is
thus
his
own
view
the
epicurean
says
that
no
certain
knowledge
has
been
arrived
at
the
proof
that
the
efforts
of
philosophy
are
futile
is
derived
directly
from
the
usual
superficial
view
taken
of
its
history
the
results
attendant
on
that
history
make
it
appear
to
be
a
process
in
which
the
most
various
thoughts
arise
in
numerous
philosophies
each
of
which
opposes
contradicts
and
refutes
the
other
this
fact
which
cannot
be
denied
seems
to
contain
the
justification
indeed
the
necessity
for
applying
to
philosophy
the
words
of
christ
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
arise
and
follow
me
the
whole
of
the
history
of
philosophy
becomes
a
battlefield
covered
with
the
bones
of
the
dead
it
is
a
kingdom
not
merely
formed
of
dead
and
lifeless
individuals
but
of
refuted
and
spiritually
dead
systems
since
each
has
killed
and
buried
the
other
instead
of
follow
thou
me
here
then
it
must
indeed
be
said
follow
thine
own
selfthat
is
hold
by
thine
own
convictions
remain
steadfast
to
thine
own
opinion
why
adopt
another
it
certainly
happens
that
a
new
philosophy
makes
its
appearance
which
maintains
the
others
to
be
valueless
and
indeed
each
one
in
turn
comes
forth
at
first
with
the
pretext
that
by
its
means
all
previous
philosophies
not
only
are
refuted
but
what
in
them
is
wanting
is
supplied
and
now
at
length
the
right
one
is
discovered
but
following
upon
what
has
gone
before
it
would
rather
seem
that
other
words
of
scripture
are
just
as
applicable
to
such
a
philosophythe
words
which
the
apostle
peter
spoke
to
ananias
behold
the
feet
of
them
that
shall
carry
thee
out
are
at
the
door
behold
the
philosophy
by
which
thine
own
will
be
refuted
and
displaced
shall
not
tarry
long
as
it
has
not
tarried
before
c
explanatory
remarks
on
the
diversity
in
philosophies
certainly
the
fact
is
sufficiently
well
established
that
there
are
and
have
been
different
philosophies
the
truth
is
however
one
and
the
instinct
of
reason
maintains
this
irradicable
intuition
or
belief
it
is
said
that
only
one
philosophy
can
be
true
and
because
philosophies
are
different
it
is
concluded
that
all
others
must
be
erroneous
but
in
fact
each
one
in
turn
gives
every
assurance
evidence
and
proof
of
being
the
one
and
true
philosophy
this
is
a
common
mode
of
reasoning
and
is
what
seems
in
truth
to
be
the
view
of
sober
thought
as
regards
the
sober
nature
of
the
word
at
issuethoughtwe
can
tell
from
everyday
experience
that
if
we
fast
we
feel
hunger
either
at
once
or
very
soon
but
sober
thought
always
has
the
fortunate
power
of
not
resulting
in
hunger
and
desire
but
of
being
and
remaining
as
it
is
content
hence
the
thought
expressed
in
such
an
utterance
reveals
the
fact
that
it
is
dead
understanding
for
it
is
only
death
which
fasts
and
yet
rests
satisfied
but
neither
physical
life
nor
intellectual
remains
content
with
mere
abstention
as
desire
it
presses
on
through
hunger
and
through
thirst
towards
truth
towards
knowledge
itself
it
presses
on
to
satisfy
this
desire
and
does
not
allow
itself
to
feast
and
find
sufficiency
in
a
reflection
such
as
this
as
to
this
reflection
the
next
thing
to
be
said
of
it
is
that
however
different
the
philosophies
have
been
they
had
a
common
bond
in
that
they
were
philosophy
thus
whoever
may
have
studied
or
become
acquainted
with
a
philosophy
of
whatever
kind
provided
only
that
it
is
such
has
thereby
become
acquainted
with
philosophy
that
delusive
mode
of
reasoning
which
regards
diversity
alone
and
from
doubt
of
or
aversion
to
the
particular
form
in
which
a
universal
finds
its
actuality
will
not
grasp
or
even
allow
this
universal
nature
i
have
elsewhere4
likened
to
an
invalid
recommended
by
the
doctor
to
eat
fruit
and
who
has
cherries
plums
or
grapes
before
him
but
who
pedantically
refuses
to
take
anything
because
no
part
of
what
is
offered
him
is
fruit
some
of
it
being
cherries
and
the
rest
plums
or
grapes
but
it
is
really
important
to
have
a
deeper
insight
into
the
bearings
of
this
diversity
in
the
systems
of
philosophy
truth
and
philosophy
known
philosophically
make
such
diversity
appear
in
another
light
from
that
of
abstract
opposition
between
truth
and
error
the
explanation
of
how
this
comes
about
will
reveal
to
us
the
significance
of
the
whole
history
of
philosophy
we
must
make
the
fact
conceivable
that
the
diversity
and
number
of
philosophies
not
only
does
not
prejudice
philosophy
itself
that
is
to
say
the
possibility
of
a
philosophy
but
that
such
diversity
is
and
has
been
absolutely
necessary
to
the
existence
of
a
science
of
philosophy
and
that
it
is
essential
to
it
this
makes
it
easy
to
us
to
comprehend
the
aim
of
philosophy
which
is
in
thought
and
in
conception
to
grasp
the
truth
and
not
merely
to
discover
that
nothing
can
be
known
or
that
at
least
temporal
finite
truth
which
also
is
an
untruth
can
alone
be
known
and
not
the
truth
indeed
further
we
find
that
in
the
history
of
philosophy
we
have
to
deal
with
philosophy
itself
the
facts
within
that
history
are
not
adventures
and
contain
no
more
romance
than
does
the
history
of
the
world
they
are
not
a
mere
collection
of
chance
events
of
expeditions
of
wandering
knights
each
going
about
fighting
struggling
purposelessly
leaving
no
results
to
show
for
all
his
efforts
nor
is
it
so
that
one
thing
has
been
thought
out
here
another
there
at
will
in
the
activity
of
thinking
mind
there
is
real
connection
and
what
there
takes
place
is
rational
it
is
with
this
belief
in
the
spirit
of
the
world
that
we
must
proceed
to
history
and
in
particular
to
the
history
of
philosophy
2
explanatory
remarks
upon
the
definition
of
the
history
of
philosophy
the
above
statement
that
the
truth
is
only
one
is
still
abstract
and
formal
in
the
deeper
sense
it
is
our
starting
point
but
the
aim
of
philosophy
is
to
know
this
one
truth
as
the
immediate
source
from
which
all
else
proceeds
both
all
the
laws
of
nature
and
all
the
manifestations
of
life
and
consciousness
of
which
they
are
mere
reflections
or
to
lead
these
laws
and
manifestations
in
ways
apparently
contrary
back
to
that
single
source
and
from
that
source
to
comprehend
them
which
is
to
understand
their
derivation
thus
what
is
most
essential
is
to
know
that
the
single
truth
is
not
merely
a
solitary
empty
thought
but
one
determined
within
itself
to
obtain
this
knowledge
we
must
enter
into
some
abstract
notions
which
as
such
are
quite
general
and
dry
and
which
are
the
two
principles
of
development
and
of
the
concrete
we
could
indeed
embrace
the
whole
in
the
single
principle
of
development
if
this
were
clear
all
else
would
result
and
follow
of
its
own
accord
the
product
of
thinking
is
the
thought
thought
is
however
still
formal
somewhat
more
defined
it
becomes
notion
and
finally
idea
is
thought
in
its
totality
implicitly
and
explicitly
determined
thus
the
idea
and
it
alone
is
truth
now
it
is
essentially
in
the
nature
of
the
idea
to
develop
and
only
through
development
to
arrive
at
comprehension
of
itself
or
to
become
what
it
is
that
the
idea
should
have
to
make
itself
what
it
is
seems
like
a
contradiction
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
what
it
is
a
the
notion
of
development
the
idea
of
development
is
well
known
but
it
is
the
special
characteristic
of
philosophy
to
investigate
such
matters
as
were
formerly
held
as
known
what
is
dealt
with
or
made
use
of
without
consideration
as
an
aid
to
daily
life
is
certainly
the
unknown
to
man
unless
he
be
informed
in
philosophy
the
further
discussion
of
this
idea
belongs
to
the
science
of
logic
in
order
to
comprehend
what
development
is
what
may
be
called
two
different
states
must
be
distinguished
the
first
is
what
is
known
as
capacity
power
what
i
call
beinginitself
potentia

the
second
principle
is
that
of
beingforitself
actuality
actus

if
we
say
for
example
that
man
is
by
nature
rational
we
would
mean
that
he
has
reason
only
inherently
or
in
embryo
in
this
sense
reason
understanding
imagination
will
are
possessed
from
birth
or
even
from
the
mothers
womb
but
while
the
child
only
has
capacities
or
the
actual
possibility
of
reason
it
is
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
no
reason
reason
does
not
yet
exist
in
him
since
he
cannot
yet
do
anything
rational
and
has
no
rational
consciousness
thus
what
man
is
at
first
implicitly
becomes
explicit
and
it
is
the
same
with
reason
if
then
man
has
actuality
on
whatever
side
he
is
actually
rational
and
now
we
come
to
reason
what
is
the
real
meaning
of
this
word
that
which
is
in
itself
must
become
an
object
to
mankind
must
arrive
at
consciousness
thus
becoming
for
man
what
has
become
an
object
to
him
is
the
same
as
what
he
is
in
himself
through
the
becoming
objective
of
this
implicit
being
man
first
becomes
for
himself
he
is
made
double
is
retained
and
not
changed
into
another
for
example
man
is
thinking
and
thus
he
thinks
out
thoughts
in
this
way
it
is
in
thought
alone
that
thought
is
object
reason
produces
what
is
rational
reason
is
its
own
object
the
fact
that
thought
may
also
descend
to
what
is
destitute
of
reason
is
a
consideration
involving
wider
issues
which
do
not
concern
us
here
but
even
though
man
who
in
himself
is
rational
does
not
at
first
seem
to
have
got
further
on
since
he
became
rational
for
himselfwhat
is
implicit
having
merely
retained
itselfthe
difference
is
quite
enormous
no
new
content
has
been
produced
and
yet
this
form
of
being
for
self
makes
all
the
difference
the
whole
variation
in
the
development
of
the
world
in
history
is
founded
on
this
difference
this
alone
explains
how
since
all
mankind
is
naturally
rational
and
freedom
is
the
hypothesis
on
which
this
reason
rests
slavery
yet
has
been
and
in
part
still
is
maintained
by
many
peoples
and
men
have
remained
contented
under
it
the
only
distinction
between
the
africans
and
the
asiatics
on
the
one
hand
and
the
greeks
romans
and
moderns
on
the
other
is
that
the
latter
know
and
it
is
explicit
for
them
that
they
are
free
but
the
others
are
so
without
knowing
that
they
are
and
thus
without
existing
as
being
free
this
constitutes
the
enormous
difference
in
their
condition
all
knowledge
and
learning
science
and
even
commerce
have
no
other
object
than
to
draw
out
what
is
inward
or
implicit
and
thus
to
become
objective
because
that
which
is
implicit
comes
into
existence
it
certainly
passes
into
change
yet
it
remains
one
and
the
same
for
the
whole
process
is
dominated
by
it
the
plant
for
example
does
not
lose
itself
in
mere
indefinite
change
from
the
germ
much
is
produced
when
at
first
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
whole
of
what
is
brought
forth
if
not
developed
is
yet
hidden
and
ideally
contained
within
itself
the
principle
of
this
projection
into
existence
is
that
the
germ
cannot
remain
merely
implicit
but
is
impelled
towards
development
since
it
presents
the
contradiction
of
being
only
implicit
and
yet
not
desiring
so
to
be
but
this
coming
without
itself
has
an
end
in
view
its
completion
fully
reached
and
its
previously
determined
end
is
the
fruit
or
produce
of
the
germ
which
causes
a
return
to
the
first
condition
the
germ
will
produce
itself
alone
and
manifest
what
is
contained
in
it
so
that
it
then
may
return
to
itself
once
more
thus
to
renew
the
unity
from
which
it
started
with
nature
it
certainly
is
true
that
the
subject
which
commenced
and
the
matter
which
forms
the
end
are
two
separate
units
as
in
the
case
of
seed
and
fruit
the
doubling
process
has
apparently
the
effect
of
separating
into
two
things
that
which
in
content
is
the
same
thus
in
animal
life
the
parent
and
the
young
are
different
individuals
although
their
nature
is
the
same
in
mind
it
is
otherwise
it
is
consciousness
and
therefore
it
is
free
uniting
in
itself
the
beginning
and
the
end
as
with
the
germ
in
nature
mind
indeed
resolves
itself
back
into
unity
after
constituting
itself
another
but
what
is
in
itself
becomes
for
mind
and
thus
arrives
at
being
for
itself
the
fruit
and
seed
newly
contained
within
it
on
the
other
hand
do
not
become
for
the
original
germ
but
for
us
alone
in
the
case
of
mind
both
factors
not
only
are
implicitly
the
same
in
character
but
there
is
a
being
for
the
other
and
at
the
same
time
a
being
for
self
that
for
which
the
other
is
is
the
same
as
that
other
and
thus
alone
mind
is
at
home
with
itself
in
its
other
the
development
of
mind
lies
in
the
fact
that
its
going
forth
and
separation
constitutes
its
coming
to
itself
this
beingathomewithself
or
comingtoself
of
mind
may
be
described
as
its
complete
and
highest
end
it
is
this
alone
that
it
desires
and
nothing
else
everything
that
from
eternity
has
happened
in
heaven
and
earth
the
life
of
god
and
all
the
deeds
of
time
simply
are
the
struggles
for
mind
to
know
itself
to
make
itself
objective
to
itself
to
find
itself
be
for
itself
and
finally
unite
itself
to
itself
it
is
alienated
and
divided
but
only
so
as
to
be
able
thus
to
find
itself
and
return
to
itself
only
in
this
manner
does
mind
attain
its
freedom
for
that
is
free
which
is
not
connected
with
or
dependent
on
another
true
selfpossession
and
satisfaction
are
only
to
be
found
in
this
and
in
nothing
else
but
thought
does
mind
attain
this
freedom
in
senseperception
for
instance
and
in
feeling
i
find
myself
confined
and
am
not
free
but
i
am
free
when
i
have
a
consciousness
of
this
my
feeling
man
has
particular
ends
and
interests
even
in
will
i
am
free
indeed
when
this
is
mine
such
ends
however
always
contain
another
or
something
which
constitutes
for
me
another
such
as
desire
and
impulse
it
is
in
thought
alone
that
all
foreign
matter
disappears
from
view
and
that
mind
is
absolutely
free
all
interest
which
is
contained
in
the
idea
and
in
philosophy
is
expressed
in
it
b
the
notion
of
the
concrete
as
to
development
it
may
be
asked
what
does
develop
and
what
forms
the
absolute
content
development
is
considered
in
the
light
of
a
formal
process
in
action
and
as
destitute
of
content
but
the
act
has
no
other
end
but
activity
and
through
this
activity
the
general
character
of
the
content
is
already
fixed
for
beinginself
and
beingforself
are
the
moments
present
in
action
but
the
act
is
the
retention
of
these
diverse
elements
within
itself
the
act
thus
is
really
one
and
it
is
just
this
unity
of
differences
which
is
the
concrete
not
only
is
the
act
concrete
but
also
the
implicit
which
stands
to
action
in
the
relation
of
subject
which
begins
and
finally
the
product
is
just
as
concrete
as
the
action
or
as
the
subject
which
begins
development
in
process
likewise
forms
the
content
the
idea
itself
for
this
we
must
have
the
one
element
and
then
the
other
both
combined
will
form
a
unity
as
third
because
the
one
in
the
other
is
at
home
with
and
not
without
itself
thus
the
idea
is
in
its
content
concrete
within
itself
and
this
in
two
ways
first
it
is
concrete
potentially
and
then
it
is
its
interest
that
what
is
in
itself
should
be
there
for
it
it
is
a
common
prejudice
that
the
science
of
philosophy
deals
only
with
abstractions
and
empty
generalities
and
that
senseperception
our
empirical
selfconsciousness
natural
instinct
and
the
feelings
of
everyday
life
lie
on
the
contrary
in
the
region
of
the
concrete
and
the
selfdetermined
as
a
matter
of
fact
philosophy
is
in
the
region
of
thought
and
has
therefore
to
deal
with
universals
its
content
is
abstract
but
only
as
to
form
and
element
in
itself
the
idea
is
really
concrete
for
it
is
the
union
of
the
different
determinations
it
is
here
that
reasoned
knowledge
differs
from
mere
knowledge
of
the
understanding
and
it
is
the
business
of
philosophy
as
opposed
to
understanding
to
show
that
the
truth
or
the
idea
does
not
consist
in
empty
generalities
but
in
a
universal
and
that
is
within
itself
the
particular
and
the
determined
if
the
truth
is
abstract
it
must
be
untrue
healthy
human
reason
goes
out
towards
what
is
concrete
the
reflection
of
the
understanding
comes
first
as
abstract
and
untrue
correct
in
theory
only
and
amongst
other
things
unpractical
philosophy
is
what
is
most
antagonistic
to
abstraction
and
it
leads
back
to
the
concrete
if
we
unite
the
notion
of
the
concrete
with
that
of
development
we
have
the
motion
of
the
concrete
since
the
implicit
is
already
concrete
within
itself
and
we
only
set
forth
what
is
implicitly
there
the
new
form
which
now
looks
different
and
which
was
formerly
shut
up
in
the
original
unity
is
merely
distinguished
the
concrete
must
become
for
itself
or
explicit
as
implicit
or
potential
it
is
only
differentiated
within
itself
not
as
yet
explicitly
set
forth
but
still
in
a
state
of
unity
the
concrete
is
thus
simple
and
yet
at
the
same
time
differentiated
this
its
inward
contradiction
which
is
indeed
the
impelling
force
in
development
brings
distinction
into
being
but
thus
too
its
right
to
be
taken
back
and
reinstated
extends
beyond
the
difference
for
its
truth
is
only
to
be
found
in
unity
life
both
that
which
is
in
nature
and
that
which
is
of
the
idea
of
mind
within
itself
is
thus
manifested
were
the
idea
abstract
it
would
simply
be
the
highest
conceivable
existence
and
that
would
be
all
that
could
be
said
of
it
but
such
a
god
is
the
product
of
the
understanding
of
modern
times
what
is
true
is
rather
found
in
motion
in
a
process
however
in
which
there
is
rest
difference
while
it
lasts
is
but
a
temporary
condition
through
which
comes
unity
full
and
concrete
we
may
now
proceed
to
give
examples
of
sensuous
things
which
will
help
us
further
to
explain
this
notion
of
the
concrete
although
the
flower
has
many
qualities
such
as
smell
taste
form
colour
c
yet
it
is
one
none
of
these
qualities
could
be
absent
in
the
particular
leaf
or
flower
each
individual
part
of
the
leaf
shares
alike
all
the
qualities
of
the
leaf
entire
gold
similarly
contains
in
every
particle
all
its
qualities
unseparated
and
entire
it
is
frequently
allowed
with
sensuous
things
that
such
varied
elements
may
be
joined
together
but
in
the
spiritual
differentiation
is
supposed
to
involve
opposition
we
do
not
controvert
the
fact
or
think
it
contradictory
that
the
smell
and
taste
of
the
flower
although
otherwise
opposed
are
yet
clearly
in
one
subject
nor
do
we
place
the
one
against
the
other
but
the
understanding
and
understanding
thought
find
everything
of
a
different
kind
placed
in
conjunction
to
be
incompatible
matter
for
example
is
complex
and
coherent
or
space
is
continuous
and
uninterrupted
likewise
we
may
take
separate
points
in
space
and
break
up
matter
dividing
it
ever
further
into
infinity
it
then
is
said
that
matter
consists
of
atoms
and
points
and
hence
is
not
continuous
therefore
we
have
here
the
two
determinations
of
continuity
and
of
definite
points
which
understanding
regards
as
mutually
exclusive
combined
in
one
it
is
said
that
matter
must
be
clearly
either
continuous
or
divisible
into
points
but
in
reality
it
has
both
these
qualities
or
when
we
say
of
the
mind
of
man
that
it
has
freedom
the
understanding
at
once
brings
up
the
other
quality
which
in
this
case
is
necessity
saying
that
if
mind
is
free
it
is
not
in
subjection
to
necessity
and
inversely
if
its
will
and
thought
are
determined
through
necessity
it
is
not
freethe
one
they
say
excludes
the
other
the
distinctions
here
are
regarded
as
exclusive
and
not
as
forming
something
concrete
but
that
which
is
true
the
mind
is
concrete
and
its
attributes
are
freedom
and
necessity
similarly
the
higher
point
of
view
is
that
mind
is
free
in
its
necessity
and
finds
its
freedom
in
it
alone
since
its
necessity
rests
on
its
freedom
but
it
is
more
difficult
for
us
to
show
the
unity
here
than
in
the
case
of
natural
objects
freedom
can
however
be
also
abstract
freedom
without
necessity
which
false
freedom
is
selfwill
and
for
that
reason
it
is
selfopposed
unconsciously
limited
an
imaginary
freedom
which
is
free
in
form
alone
the
fruit
of
development
which
comes
third
is
a
result
of
motion
but
inasmuch
as
it
is
merely
the
result
of
one
stage
in
development
as
being
last
in
this
stage
it
is
both
the
starting
point
and
the
first
in
order
in
another
such
stage
goethe
somewhere
truly
says
that
which
is
formed
ever
resolves
itself
back
into
its
elements
matterwhich
as
developed
has
formconstitutes
once
more
the
material
for
a
new
form
mind
again
takes
as
its
object
and
applies
its
activity
to
the
notion
in
which
in
going
within
itself
it
has
comprehended
itself
which
it
is
in
form
and
being
and
which
has
just
been
separated
from
it
anew
the
application
of
thought
to
this
supplies
it
with
the
form
and
determination
of
thought
this
action
thus
further
forms
the
previously
formed
gives
it
additional
determinations
makes
it
more
determinate
in
itself
further
developed
and
more
profound
as
concrete
this
activity
is
a
succession
of
processes
in
development
which
must
be
represented
not
as
a
straight
line
drawn
out
into
vague
infinity
but
as
a
circle
returning
within
itself
which
as
periphery
has
very
many
circles
and
whose
whole
is
a
large
number
of
processes
in
development
turning
back
within
themselves
c
philosophy
as
the
apprehension
of
the
development
of
the
concrete
having
thus
generally
explained
the
nature
of
the
concrete
i
now
add
as
regards
its
import
that
the
truth
thus
determined
within
itself
is
impelled
towards
development
it
is
only
the
living
and
spiritual
which
internally
bestirs
and
develops
itself
thus
the
idea
as
concrete
in
itself
and
selfdeveloping
is
an
organic
system
and
a
totality
which
contains
a
multitude
of
stages
and
of
moments
in
development
philosophy
has
now
become
for
itself
the
apprehension
of
this
development
and
as
conceiving
thought
is
itself
this
development
in
thought
the
more
progress
made
in
this
development
the
more
perfect
is
the
philosophy
this
development
goes
no
further
out
than
into
externality
but
the
going
without
itself
of
development
also
is
a
going
inwards
that
is
to
say
the
universal
idea
continues
to
remain
at
the
foundation
and
still
is
the
allembracing
and
unchangeable
while
in
philosophy
the
going
out
of
the
idea
in
course
of
its
development
is
not
a
change
a
becoming
another
but
really
is
a
going
within
itself
a
selfimmersion
the
progress
forward
makes
the
idea
which
was
previously
general
and
undetermined
determined
within
itself
further
development
of
the
idea
or
its
further
determination
is
the
same
thing
exactly
depth
seems
to
signify
intensiveness
but
in
this
case
the
most
extensive
is
also
the
most
intensive
the
more
intensive
is
the
mind
the
more
extensive
is
it
hence
the
larger
is
its
embrace
extension
as
development
is
not
dispersion
or
falling
asunder
but
a
uniting
bond
which
is
the
more
powerful
and
intense
as
the
expanse
of
that
embraced
is
greater
in
extent
and
richer
in
such
a
case
what
is
greater
is
the
strength
of
opposition
and
of
separation
and
the
greater
power
overcomes
the
greater
separation
these
are
the
abstract
propositions
regarding
the
nature
of
the
idea
and
of
its
development
and
thus
within
it
philosophy
in
its
developed
state
is
constituted
it
is
one
idea
in
its
totality
and
in
all
its
individual
parts
like
one
life
in
a
living
being
one
pulse
throbs
throughout
all
its
members
all
the
parts
represented
in
it
and
their
systematization
emanate
from
the
one
idea
all
these
particulars
are
but
the
mirrors
and
copies
of
this
one
life
and
have
their
actuality
only
in
this
unity
their
differences
and
their
various
qualities
are
only
the
expression
of
the
idea
and
the
form
contained
within
it
thus
the
idea
is
the
central
point
which
is
also
the
periphery
the
source
of
light
which
in
all
its
expansion
does
not
come
without
itself
but
remains
present
and
immanent
within
itself
thus
it
is
both
the
system
of
necessity
and
its
own
necessity
which
also
constitutes
its
freedom
3
results
obtained
with
respect
to
the
notion
of
the
history
of
philosophy
thus
we
see
that
philosophy
is
system
in
development
the
history
of
philosophy
is
the
same
and
this
is
the
main
point
to
be
noted
and
the
first
principle
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
treatise
on
that
history
in
order
to
make
this
evident
the
difference
in
respect
to
the
possible
modes
of
manifestation
must
first
be
pointed
out
that
is
to
say
the
progression
of
the
various
stages
in
the
advance
of
thought
may
occur
with
the
consciousness
of
necessity
in
which
case
each
in
succession
deduces
itself
and
this
form
and
this
determination
can
alone
emerge
or
else
it
may
come
about
without
this
consciousness
as
does
a
natural
and
apparently
accidental
process
so
that
while
inwardly
indeed
the
notion
brings
about
its
result
consistently
this
consistency
is
not
made
manifest
this
is
so
in
nature
in
the
various
stages
of
the
development
of
twigs
leaves
blossom
and
fruit
each
proceeds
for
itself
but
the
inward
idea
is
the
directing
and
determining
force
which
governs
the
progression
this
is
also
so
with
the
child
whose
bodily
powers
and
above
all
whose
intellectual
activities
make
their
appearance
one
after
the
other
simply
and
naturally
so
that
those
parents
who
form
such
an
experience
for
the
first
time
marvel
whence
all
that
is
now
showing
itself
from
within
comes
from
for
the
whole
of
these
manifestations
merely
have
the
form
of
a
succession
in
time
the
one
kind
of
progression
which
represents
the
deduction
of
the
forms
the
necessity
thought
out
and
recognized
of
the
determinations
is
the
business
of
philosophy
and
because
it
is
the
pure
idea
which
is
in
question
and
not
yet
its
mere
particularized
form
as
nature
and
as
mind
that
representation
is
in
the
main
the
business
of
logical
philosophy
but
the
other
method
which
represents
the
part
played
by
the
history
of
philosophy
shows
the
different
stages
and
moments
in
development
in
time
in
manner
of
occurrence
in
particular
places
in
particular
people
or
political
circumstances
the
complications
arising
thus
and
in
short
it
shows
us
the
empirical
form
this
point
of
view
is
the
only
one
worthy
of
this
science
from
the
very
nature
of
the
subject
it
is
inherently
the
true
one
and
through
the
study
of
this
history
it
will
be
made
manifest
that
it
actually
shows
and
proves
itself
so
now
in
reference
to
this
idea
i
maintain
that
the
sequence
in
the
systems
of
philosophy
in
history
is
similar
to
the
sequence
in
the
logical
deduction
of
the
notiondeterminations
in
the
idea
i
maintain
that
if
the
fundamental
conceptions
of
the
systems
appearing
in
the
history
of
philosophy
be
entirely
divested
of
what
regards
their
outward
form
their
relation
to
the
particular
and
the
like
the
various
stages
in
the
determination
of
the
idea
are
found
in
their
logical
notion
conversely
in
the
logical
progression
taken
for
itself
there
is
so
far
as
its
principal
elements
are
concerned
the
progression
of
historical
manifestations
but
it
is
necessary
to
have
these
pure
notions
in
order
to
know
what
the
historical
form
contains
it
may
be
thought
that
philosophy
must
have
another
order
as
to
the
stages
in
the
idea
than
that
in
which
these
notions
have
gone
forth
in
time
but
in
the
main
the
order
is
the
same
this
succession
undoubtedly
separates
itself
on
the
one
hand
into
the
sequence
in
time
of
history
and
on
the
other
into
succession
in
the
order
of
ideas
but
to
treat
more
fully
of
this
last
would
divert
us
too
far
from
our
aim
i
would
only
remark
this
that
what
has
been
said
reveals
that
the
study
of
the
history
of
philosophy
is
the
study
of
philosophy
itself
for
indeed
it
can
be
nothing
else
whoever
studies
the
history
of
sciences
such
as
physics
and
mathematics
makes
himself
acquainted
with
physics
and
mathematics
themselves
but
in
order
to
obtain
a
knowledge
of
its
progress
as
the
development
of
the
idea
in
the
empirical
external
form
in
which
philosophy
appears
in
history
a
corresponding
knowledge
of
the
idea
is
absolutely
essential
just
as
in
judging
of
human
affairs
one
must
have
a
conception
of
that
which
is
right
and
fitting
else
indeed
as
in
so
many
histories
of
philosophy
there
is
presented
to
the
vision
devoid
of
idea
only
a
disarranged
collection
of
opinions
to
make
you
acquainted
with
this
idea
and
consequently
to
explain
the
manifestations
is
the
business
of
the
history
of
philosophy
and
to
do
this
is
my
object
in
undertaking
to
lecture
on
the
subject
since
the
observer
must
bring
with
him
the
notion
of
the
subject
in
order
to
see
it
in
its
phenomenal
aspect
and
in
order
to
expose
the
object
faithfully
to
view
we
need
not
wonder
at
there
being
so
many
dull
histories
of
philosophy
in
which
the
succession
of
its
systems
are
represented
simply
as
a
number
of
opinions
errors
and
freaks
of
thought
they
are
freaks
of
thought
which
indeed
have
been
devised
with
a
great
pretension
of
acuteness
and
of
mental
exertion
and
with
everything
else
which
can
be
said
in
admiration
of
what
is
merely
formal
but
considering
the
absence
of
philosophic
mind
in
such
historians
as
these
how
should
they
be
able
to
comprehend
and
represent
the
content
which
is
reasoned
thought
it
is
shown
from
what
has
been
said
regarding
the
formal
nature
of
the
idea
that
only
a
history
of
philosophy
thus
regarded
as
a
system
of
development
in
idea
is
entitled
to
the
name
of
science
a
collection
of
facts
constitutes
no
science
only
thus
as
a
succession
of
phenomena
established
through
reason
and
having
as
content
just
what
is
reason
and
revealing
it
does
this
history
show
that
it
is
rational
it
shows
that
the
events
recorded
are
in
reason
how
should
the
whole
of
what
has
taken
place
in
reason
not
itself
be
rational
that
faith
must
surely
be
the
more
reasonable
in
which
chance
is
not
made
ruler
over
human
affairs
and
it
is
the
business
of
philosophy
to
recognize
that
however
much
its
own
manifestations
may
be
history
likewise
it
is
yet
determined
through
the
idea
alone
through
these
general
preliminary
conceptions
the
categories
are
now
determined
the
more
immediate
application
of
which
to
the
history
of
philosophy
we
have
now
to
consider
this
application
will
bring
before
us
the
most
significant
aspects
in
this
history
a
the
development
in
time
of
the
various
philosophies
the
first
question
which
may
be
asked
in
reference
to
this
history
concerns
that
distinction
in
regard
to
the
manifestation
of
the
idea
which
has
just
been
noticed
it
is
the
question
as
to
how
it
happens
that
philosophy
appears
to
be
a
development
in
time
and
has
a
history
the
answer
to
this
question
encroaches
on
the
metaphysics
of
time
and
it
would
be
a
digression
from
our
object
to
give
here
more
than
the
elements
on
which
the
answer
rests
it
has
been
shown
above
in
reference
to
the
existence
of
mind
that
its
being
is
its
activity
nature
on
the
contrary
is
as
it
is
its
changes
are
thus
only
repetitions
and
its
movements
take
the
form
of
a
circle
merely
to
express
this
better
the
activity
of
mind
is
to
know
itself
i
am
immediately
but
this
i
am
only
as
a
living
organism
as
mind
i
am
only
in
so
far
as
i
know
myself


know
thyself
the
inscription
over
the
temple
of
the
oracle
at
delphi
is
the
absolute
command
which
is
expressed
by
mind
in
its
essential
character
but
consciousness
really
implies
that
for
myself
i
am
object
to
myself
in
forming
this
absolute
division
between
what
is
mine
and
myself
mind
constitutes
its
existence
and
establishes
itself
as
external
to
itself
it
postulates
itself
in
the
externality
which
is
just
the
universal
and
the
distinctive
form
of
existence
in
nature
but
one
of
the
forms
of
externality
is
time
and
this
form
requires
to
be
further
examined
both
in
the
philosophy
of
nature
and
the
finite
mind
this
being
in
existence
and
therefore
being
in
time
is
a
moment
not
only
of
the
individual
consciousness
which
as
such
is
essentially
finite
but
also
of
the
development
of
the
philosophical
idea
in
the
element
of
thought
for
the
idea
thought
of
as
being
at
rest
is
indeed
not
in
time
to
think
of
it
as
at
rest
and
to
preserve
it
in
the
form
of
immediacy
is
equivalent
to
its
inward
perception
but
the
idea
as
concrete
is
as
has
been
shown
the
unity
of
differences
it
is
not
really
rest
and
its
existence
is
not
really
senseperception
but
as
differentiation
within
itself
and
therefore
as
development
it
comes
into
existent
being
and
into
externality
in
the
element
of
thought
and
thus
pure
philosophy
appears
in
thought
as
a
progressive
existence
in
time
but
this
element
of
thought
is
itself
abstract
and
is
the
activity
of
a
single
consciousness
mind
is
however
not
only
to
be
considered
as
individual
finite
consciousness
but
as
that
mind
which
is
universal
and
concrete
within
itself
this
concrete
universality
however
comprehends
all
the
various
sides
and
modes
evolved
in
which
it
is
and
becomes
object
to
the
idea
thus
minds
thinking
comprehension
of
self
is
at
the
same
time
the
progression
of
the
total
actuality
evolved
this
progression
is
not
one
which
takes
its
course
through
the
thought
of
an
individual
and
exhibits
itself
in
a
single
consciousness
for
it
shows
itself
to
be
universal
mind
presenting
itself
in
the
history
of
the
world
in
all
the
richness
of
its
form
the
result
of
this
development
is
that
one
form
one
stage
in
the
idea
comes
to
consciousness
in
one
particular
race
so
that
this
race
and
this
time
expresses
only
this
particular
form
within
which
it
constructs
its
universe
and
works
out
its
conditions
the
higher
stage
on
the
other
hand
centuries
later
reveals
itself
in
another
race
of
people
now
if
we
thus
grasp
the
principles
of
the
concrete
and
of
development
the
nature
of
the
manifold
obtains
quite
another
signification
and
what
is
said
of
the
diversity
in
philosophies
as
if
the
manifold
were
fixed
and
stationary
and
composed
of
what
is
mutually
exclusive
is
at
once
refuted
and
relegated
to
its
proper
place
such
talk
is
that
in
which
those
who
despise
philosophy
think
they
possess
an
invincible
weapon
against
it
and
in
their
truly
beggarly
pride
in
their
pitiful
representations
of
it
they
are
in
perfect
ignorance
even
of
what
they
have
and
what
they
have
to
know
in
any
meagre
ideas
attained
such
as
in
that
of
the
manifold
and
diverse
yet
this
category
is
one
which
anybody
can
understand
no
difficulty
is
made
in
regard
to
it
for
it
is
thoroughly
known
and
those
who
use
it
think
they
can
do
so
as
being
entirely
comprehensibleas
a
matter
of
course
they
understand
what
it
is
but
those
who
believe
the
principle
of
diversity
to
be
one
absolutely
fixed
do
not
know
its
nature
or
its
dialectic
the
manifold
or
diverse
is
in
a
state
of
flux
it
must
really
be
conceived
of
as
in
the
process
of
development
and
as
but
a
passing
moment
philosophy
in
its
concrete
idea
is
the
activity
of
development
in
revealing
the
differences
which
it
contains
within
itself
these
differences
are
thoughts
for
we
are
now
speaking
of
development
in
thought
in
the
first
place
the
differences
which
rest
in
the
idea
are
manifested
as
thoughts
secondly
these
distinctions
must
come
into
existence
one
here
and
the
other
there
and
in
order
that
they
may
do
this
they
must
be
complete
that
is
they
must
contain
within
themselves
the
idea
in
its
totality
the
concrete
alone
as
including
and
supporting
the
distinctions
is
the
actual
it
is
thus
and
thus
alone
that
the
differences
are
in
their
form
entire
a
complete
form
of
thought
such
as
is
here
presented
is
a
philosophy
but
the
idea
contains
the
distinctions
in
a
peculiar
form
it
may
be
said
that
the
form
is
indifferent
and
that
the
content
the
idea
is
the
main
consideration
and
people
think
themselves
quite
moderate
and
reasonable
when
they
state
that
the
different
philosophies
all
contain
the
idea
though
in
different
forms
understanding
by
this
that
these
forms
are
contingent
but
everything
hangs
on
this
these
forms
are
nothing
else
than
the
original
distinctions
in
the
idea
itself
which
is
what
it
is
only
in
them
they
are
in
this
way
essential
to
and
constitute
the
content
of
the
idea
which
in
thus
sundering
itself
attains
to
form
the
manifold
character
of
the
principles
which
appear
is
however
not
accidental
but
necessary
the
different
forms
constitute
an
integral
part
of
the
whole
form
they
are
the
determinations
of
the
original
idea
which
together
constitute
the
whole
but
as
being
outside
of
one
another
their
union
does
not
take
place
in
them
but
in
us
the
observers
each
system
is
determined
as
one
but
it
is
not
a
permanent
condition
that
the
differences
are
thus
mutually
exclusive
the
inevitable
fate
of
these
determinations
must
follow
and
that
is
that
they
shall
be
drawn
together
and
reduced
to
elements
or
moments
the
independent
attitude
taken
up
by
each
moment
is
again
laid
aside
after
expansion
contraction
followsthe
unity
out
of
which
they
first
emerged
this
third
may
itself
be
but
the
beginning
of
a
further
development
it
may
seem
as
if
this
progression
were
to
go
on
into
infinitude
but
it
has
an
absolute
end
in
view
which
we
shall
know
better
later
on
many
turnings
are
necessary
however
before
mind
frees
itself
in
coming
to
consciousness
the
temple
of
selfconscious
reason
is
to
be
considered
from
this
the
point
of
view
alone
worthy
of
the
history
of
philosophy
it
is
hence
rationally
built
by
an
inward
master
worker
and
not
in
solomons
method
as
freemasons
build
the
great
assumption
that
what
has
taken
place
on
this
side
in
the
world
has
also
done
so
in
conformity
with
reasonwhich
is
what
first
gives
the
history
of
philosophy
its
true
interestis
nothing
else
than
trust
in
providence
only
in
another
form
as
the
best
of
what
is
in
the
world
is
that
which
thought
produces
it
is
unreasonable
to
believe
that
reason
only
is
in
nature
and
not
in
mind
that
man
who
believes
that
what
like
the
philosophies
belongs
to
the
region
of
mind
must
be
merely
contingent
is
insincere
in
his
belief
in
divine
rule
and
what
he
says
of
it
is
but
empty
talk
a
long
time
is
undoubtedly
required
by
mind
in
working
out
philosophy
and
when
one
first
reflects
on
it
the
length
of
the
time
may
seem
astonishing
like
the
immensity
of
the
space
spoken
of
in
astronomy
but
it
must
be
considered
in
regard
to
the
slow
progress
of
the
worldspirit
that
there
is
no
need
for
it
to
hastena
thousand
years
are
in
thy
sight
as
one
day
it
has
time
enough
just
because
it
is
itself
outside
of
time
because
it
is
eternal
the
fleeting
events
of
the
day
pass
so
quickly
that
there
is
not
time
enough
for
all
that
has
to
be
done
who
is
there
who
does
not
die
before
he
has
achieved
his
aims
the
worldspirit
has
time
enough
but
that
is
not
all
it
is
not
time
alone
which
has
to
be
made
use
of
in
the
acquisition
of
a
conception
much
else
is
required
the
fact
that
so
many
races
and
generations
are
devoted
to
these
operations
of
its
consciousness
by
mind
and
that
the
appearance
is
so
perpetually
presented
of
rising
up
and
passing
away
concern
it
not
at
all
it
is
rich
enough
for
such
displays
it
pursues
its
work
on
the
largest
possible
scale
and
has
nations
and
individuals
enough
and
to
spare
the
saying
that
nature
arrives
at
its
end
in
the
shortest
possible
way
and
that
this
is
right
is
a
trivial
one
the
way
shown
by
mind
is
indirect
and
accommodates
itself
to
circumstances
considerations
of
finite
life
such
as
time
trouble
and
cost
have
no
place
here
we
ought
too
to
feel
no
disappointment
that
particular
kinds
of
knowledge
cannot
yet
be
attained
or
that
this
or
that
is
still
absent
in
the
history
of
the
world
progression
is
slow
b
the
application
of
the
foregoing
to
the
treatment
of
philosophy
the
first
result
which
follows
from
what
has
been
said
is
that
the
whole
of
the
history
of
philosophy
is
a
progression
impelled
by
an
inherent
necessity
and
one
which
is
implicitly
rational
and

priori
determined
through
its
idea
and
this
the
history
of
philosophy
has
to
exemplify
contingency
must
vanish
on
the
appearance
of
philosophy
its
history
is
just
as
absolutely
determined
as
the
development
of
notions
and
the
impelling
force
is
the
inner
dialectic
of
the
forms
the
finite
is
not
true
nor
is
it
what
it
is
to
beits
determinate
nature
is
bound
up
with
its
existence
but
the
inward
idea
abolishes
these
finite
forms
a
philosophy
which
has
not
the
absolute
form
identical
with
the
content
must
pass
away
because
its
form
is
not
that
of
truth
what
follows
secondly
from
what
we
have
said
is
that
every
philosophy
has
been
and
still
is
necessary
thus
none
have
passed
away
but
all
are
affirmatively
contained
as
elements
in
a
whole
but
we
must
distinguish
between
the
particular
principle
of
these
philosophies
as
particular
and
the
realization
of
this
principle
throughout
the
whole
compass
of
the
world
the
principles
are
retained
the
most
recent
philosophy
being
the
result
of
all
preceding
and
hence
no
philosophy
has
ever
been
refuted
what
has
been
refuted
is
not
the
principle
of
this
philosophy
but
merely
the
fact
that
this
principle
should
be
considered
final
and
absolute
in
character
the
atomic
philosophy
for
example
has
arrived
at
the
affirmation
that
the
atom
is
the
absolute
existence
that
it
is
the
indivisible
unit
which
is
also
the
individual
or
subject
seeing
then
that
the
bare
unit
also
is
the
abstract
beingforself
the
absolute
would
be
grasped
as
infinitely
many
units
the
atomic
theory
has
been
refuted
and
we
are
atomists
no
longer
mind
is
certainly
explicitly
existent
as
a
unit
or
atom
but
that
is
to
attribute
to
it
a
barren
character
and
qualities
incapable
of
expressing
anything
of
its
depth
the
principle
is
indeed
retained
although
it
is
not
the
absolute
in
its
entirety
this
same
contradiction
appears
in
all
development
the
development
of
the
tree
is
the
negation
of
the
germ
and
the
blossom
that
of
the
leaves
in
so
far
as
that
they
show
that
these
do
not
form
the
highest
and
truest
existence
of
the
tree
last
of
all
the
blossom
finds
its
negation
in
the
fruit
yet
none
of
them
can
come
into
actual
existence
excepting
as
preceded
by
all
the
earlier
stages
our
attitude
to
a
philosophy
must
thus
contain
an
affirmative
side
and
a
negative
when
we
take
both
of
these
into
consideration
we
do
justice
to
a
philosophy
for
the
first
time
we
get
to
know
the
affirmative
side
later
on
both
in
life
and
in
science
thus
we
find
it
easier
to
refute
than
to
justify
in
the
third
place
we
shall
limit
ourselves
to
the
particular
consideration
of
the
principle
itself
each
principle
has
reigned
for
a
certain
time
and
when
the
whole
system
of
the
world
has
been
explained
from
this
special
form
it
is
called
a
philosophical
system
its
whole
theory
has
certainly
to
be
learned
but
as
long
as
the
principle
is
abstract
it
is
not
sufficient
to
embrace
the
forms
belonging
to
our
conception
of
the
world
the
cartesian
principles
for
instance
are
very
suitable
for
application
to
mechanism
but
for
nothing
further
their
representation
of
other
manifestations
in
the
world
such
as
those
of
vegetable
and
animal
nature
are
insufficient
and
hence
uninteresting
therefore
we
take
into
consideration
the
principles
of
these
philosophies
only
but
in
dealing
with
concrete
philosophies
we
must
also
regard
the
chief
forms
of
their
development
and
their
applications
the
subordinate
philosophies
are
inconsistent
they
have
had
bright
glimpses
of
the
truth
which
are
however
independent
of
their
principles
this
is
exemplified
in
the
timus
of
plato
a
philosophy
of
nature
the
working
out
of
which
is
empirically
very
barren
because
its
principle
does
not
as
yet
extend
far
enough
and
it
is
not
to
its
principle
that
we
owe
the
deep
gleams
of
thought
there
contained
in
the
fourth
place
it
follows
that
we
must
not
regard
the
history
of
philosophy
as
dealing
with
the
past
even
though
it
is
history
the
scientific
products
of
reason
form
the
content
of
this
history
and
these
are
not
past
what
is
obtained
in
this
field
of
labour
is
the
true
and
as
such
the
eternal
it
is
not
what
exists
now
and
not
then
it
is
true
not
only
today
or
tomorrow
but
beyond
all
time
and
in
as
far
as
it
is
in
time
it
is
true
always
and
for
every
time
the
bodily
forms
of
those
great
minds
who
are
the
heroes
of
this
history
the
temporal
existence
and
outward
lives
of
the
philosophers
are
indeed
no
more
but
their
works
and
thoughts
have
not
followed
suit
for
they
neither
conceived
nor
dreamt
of
the
rational
import
of
their
works
philosophy
is
not
somnambulism
but
is
developed
consciousness
and
what
these
heroes
have
done
is
to
bring
that
which
is
implicitly
rational
out
of
the
depths
of
mind
where
it
is
found
at
first
as
substance
only
or
as
inwardly
existent
into
the
light
of
day
and
to
advance
it
into
consciousness
and
knowledge
this
forms
a
continuous
awakening
such
work
is
not
only
deposited
in
the
temple
of
memory
as
forms
of
times
gone
by
but
is
just
as
present
and
as
living
now
as
at
the
time
of
its
production
the
effects
produced
and
work
performed
are
not
again
destroyed
or
interrupted
by
what
succeeds
for
they
are
such
that
we
must
ourselves
be
present
in
them
they
have
as
medium
neither
canvas
paper
marble
nor
representation
or
memorial
to
preserve
them
these
mediums
are
themselves
transient
or
else
form
a
basis
for
what
is
such
but
they
do
have
thought
notion
and
the
eternal
being
of
mind
which
moths
cannot
corrupt
nor
thieves
break
through
and
steal
the
conquests
made
by
thought
when
constituted
into
thought
form
the
very
being
of
mind
such
knowledge
is
thus
not
learning
merely
or
a
knowledge
of
what
is
dead
buried
and
corrupt
the
history
of
philosophy
has
not
to
do
with
what
is
gone
but
with
the
living
present
c
further
comparison
between
the
history
of
philosophy
and
philosophy
itself
we
may
appropriate
to
ourselves
the
whole
of
the
riches
apportioned
out
in
time
it
must
be
shown
from
the
succession
in
philosophies
how
that
succession
is
the
systematization
of
the
science
of
philosophy
itself
but
a
distinction
is
to
be
noted
here
that
which
first
commences
is
implicit
immediate
abstract
generalit
is
what
has
not
yet
advanced
the
more
concrete
and
richer
comes
later
and
the
first
is
poorer
in
determinations
this
may
appear
contrary
to
ones
first
impressions
but
philosophic
ideas
are
often
enough
directly
opposed
to
ordinary
ideas
and
what
is
generally
supposed
is
not
found
to
be
the
case
it
may
be
thought
that
what
comes
first
must
be
the
concrete
the
child
for
instance
as
still
in
the
original
totality
of
his
nature
is
thought
to
be
more
concrete
than
the
man
hence
we
imagine
the
latter
to
be
more
limited
no
longer
forming
a
totality
but
living
an
abstract
life
certainly
the
man
acts
in
accordance
with
definite
ends
not
bringing
his
whole
soul
and
mind
into
a
subject
but
splitting
his
life
into
a
number
of
abstract
unities
the
child
and
the
youth
on
the
contrary
act
straight
from
the
fulness
of
the
heart
feeling
and
senseperception
come
first
thought
last
and
thus
feeling
appears
to
us
to
be
more
concrete
than
thought
or
the
activity
of
abstraction
and
of
the
universal
in
reality
it
is
just
the
other
way
the
sensuous
consciousness
is
certainly
the
more
concrete
and
if
poorer
in
thought
at
least
richer
in
content
we
must
thus
distinguish
the
naturally
concrete
from
the
concrete
of
thought
which
on
its
side
again
is
wanting
in
sensuous
matter
the
child
is
also
the
most
abstract
and
the
poorest
in
thought
as
to
what
pertains
to
nature
the
man
is
abstract
but
in
thought
he
is
more
concrete
than
the
child
mans
ends
and
objects
are
undoubtedly
abstract
in
general
affairs
such
as
in
maintaining
his
family
or
performing
his
business
duties
but
he
contributes
to
a
great
objective
organic
whole
whose
progress
he
advances
and
directs
in
the
acts
of
a
child
on
the
other
hand
only
a
childish
and
indeed
momentary
i
and
in
those
of
the
youth
the
subjective
constitution
or
the
random
aim
form
the
principle
of
action
it
is
in
this
way
that
science
is
more
concrete
than
senseperception
in
applying
this
to
the
different
forms
of
philosophy
it
follows
in
the
first
place
that
the
earliest
philosophies
are
the
poorest
and
the
most
abstract
in
them
the
idea
is
least
determined
they
keep
merely
to
generalities
not
yet
realized
this
must
be
known
in
order
that
we
may
not
seek
behind
the
old
philosophies
for
more
than
we
are
entitled
to
find
thus
we
need
not
require
from
them
determinations
proceeding
from
a
deeper
consciousness
for
instance
it
has
been
asked
whether
the
philosophy
of
thales
is
properly
speaking
theism
or
atheism5
whether
he
asserted
a
personal
god
or
merely
an
impersonal
universal
existence
the
question
here
regards
the
attribution
of
subjectivity
to
the
highest
idea
the
conception
of
the
personality
of
god
such
subjectivity
as
we
comprehend
it
is
a
much
richer
more
concentrated
and
therefore
much
later
conception
which
need
not
be
sought
for
in
distant
ages
the
greek
gods
had
indeed
personality
in
imagination
and
idea
like
the
one
god
of
the
jewish
religion
but
to
know
what
is
the
mere
picture
of
fancy
and
what
the
insight
of
pure
thought
and
notion
is
quite
another
thing
if
we
take
as
basis
our
own
ideas
judged
by
these
deeper
conceptions
an
ancient
philosophy
may
undoubtedly
be
spoken
of
as
atheism
but
this
expression
would
at
the
same
time
be
false
for
the
thoughts
as
thoughts
in
beginning
could
not
have
arrived
at
the
development
which
we
have
reached
from
this
it
followssince
the
progress
of
development
is
equivalent
to
further
determination
and
this
means
further
immersion
in
and
a
fuller
grasp
of
the
idea
itselfthat
the
latest
most
modern
and
newest
philosophy
is
the
most
developed
richest
and
deepest
in
that
philosophy
everything
which
at
first
seems
to
be
past
and
gone
must
be
preserved
and
retained
and
it
must
itself
be
a
mirror
of
the
whole
history
the
original
philosophy
is
the
most
abstract
because
it
is
the
original
and
has
not
as
yet
made
any
movement
forward
the
last
which
proceeds
from
this
forward
and
impelling
influence
is
the
most
concrete
this
as
may
at
once
be
remarked
is
no
mere
pride
in
the
philosophy
of
our
time
because
it
is
in
the
nature
of
the
whole
process
that
the
more
developed
philosophy
of
a
later
time
is
really
the
result
of
the
previous
operations
of
the
thinking
mind
and
that
it
pressed
forwards
and
onwards
from
the
earlier
standpoints
has
not
grown
up
on
its
own
account
or
in
a
state
of
isolation
it
must
also
be
recollected
that
we
must
not
hesitate
to
say
what
is
naturally
implied
that
the
idea
as
comprehended
and
shown
forth
in
the
latest
and
newest
philosophy
is
the
most
developed
the
richest
and
deepest
i
call
this
to
remembrance
because
the
designation
new
or
newest
of
all
in
reference
to
philosophy
has
become
a
very
common
byword
those
who
think
they
express
anything
by
using
such
terms
might
quite
easily
render
thanks
respecting
any
number
of
philosophies
just
as
fast
as
their
inclination
directs
regarding
either
every
shootingstar
and
even
every
candlegleam
in
the
light
of
a
sun
or
else
calling
every
popular
cry
a
philosophy
and
adducing
as
proof
that
at
any
rate
there
are
so
many
philosophies
that
every
day
one
displaces
another
thus
they
have
the
category
in
which
they
can
place
any
apparently
significant
philosophy
and
through
which
they
may
at
the
same
time
set
it
aside
this
they
call
a
fashionphilosophy
scoffer
thou
callst
this
but
a
fleeting
phase
when
the
spirit
of
man
once
again
and
anew
strives
earnestly
on
towards
forms
that
are
higher
a
second
consequence
has
regard
to
the
treatment
of
the
older
philosophies
such
insight
also
prevents
us
from
ascribing
any
blame
to
the
philosophies
when
we
miss
determinations
in
them
which
were
not
yet
present
to
their
culture
and
similarly
it
prevents
our
burdening
them
with
deductions
and
assertions
which
were
neither
made
nor
thought
of
by
them
though
they
might
correctly
enough
allow
themselves
to
be
derived
from
the
thought
of
such
a
philosophy
it
is
necessary
to
set
to
work
on
an
historical
basis
and
to
ascribe
to
philosophy
what
is
immediately
given
to
us
and
that
alone
errors
crop
up
here
in
most
histories
of
philosophy
since
we
may
see
in
them
a
number
of
metaphysical
propositions
ascribed
to
a
philosopher
and
given
out
as
an
historical
statement
of
the
views
which
he
has
propounded
of
which
he
neither
thought
nor
knew
a
word
and
of
which
there
is
not
the
slightest
trace
found
in
history
thus
in
bruckers
great
history
of
philosophy
pt
i
pp

seq
a
list
of
thirty
forty
or
a
hundred
theorems
are
quoted
from
thales
and
others
no
idea
of
which
can
be
traced
in
history
as
having
been
present
to
these
philosophers
there
are
also
propositions
in
support
of
them
and
citations
taken
from
discussions
of
a
similar
kind
with
which
we
may
occupy
ourselves
long
enough
bruckers
method
is
to
endow
the
single
theorem
of
an
ancient
philosopher
with
all
the
consequences
and
premises
which
must
according
to
the
idea
of
the
wolffian
metaphysics
be
the
premises
and
conclusions
of
that
theorem
and
thus
easily
to
produce
a
simple
naked
fiction
as
if
it
were
an
actual
historical
fact
thus
according
to
brucker
thales
said
ex
nihilo
fit
nihil
since
he
said
that
water
was
eternal
thus
too
he
was
to
be
counted
amongst
the
philosophers
who
deny
creation
out
of
nothing
and
of
this
historically
at
least
thales
was
ignorant
professor
ritter
too
whose
history
of
ionic
philosophy
is
carefully
written
and
who
on
the
whole
is
cautious
not
to
introduce
foreign
matter
has
very
possibly
ascribed
to
thales
more
than
is
found
in
history
he
says
pp
12
13
hence
we
must
regard
the
view
of
nature
which
we
find
in
thales
as
dynamic
in
principle
he
regarded
the
world
as
the
allembracing
living
animal
which
has
developed
from
a
germ
like
every
other
animal
and
this
germ
like
that
of
all
other
animals
is
either
damp
or
water
thus
the
fundamental
idea
of
thales
is
that
the
world
is
a
living
whole
which
has
developed
from
a
germ
and
carries
on
its
life
as
does
an
animal
by
means
of
nourishment
suitable
to
its
nature

this
is
quite
a
different
account
from
that
of
aristotle
and
none
of
it
is
communicated
by
the
ancients
regarding
thales
the
sequence
of
thought
is
evident
but
historically
it
is
not
justified
we
ought
not
by
such
deductions
to
make
an
ancient
philosophy
into
something
quite
different
from
what
it
originally
was
we
are
too
apt
to
mould
the
ancient
philosophers
into
our
own
forms
of
thought
but
this
is
just
to
constitute
the
progress
of
development
the
difference
in
times
in
culture
and
in
philosophies
depends
on
whether
certain
reflections
certain
thought
determinations
and
certain
stages
in
the
notion
have
come
to
consciousness
whether
a
consciousness
has
been
developed
to
a
particular
point
or
not
the
history
of
philosophy
has
simply
to
deal
with
this
development
and
bringing
forth
of
thought
the
determinations
involved
certainly
follow
from
a
proposition
but
whether
they
are
put
forth
as
yet
or
not
is
quite
another
thing
and
the
bringing
forth
of
the
inner
content
is
the
only
matter
of
importance
we
must
therefore
only
make
use
of
the
words
which
are
actually
literal
for
to
use
further
thought
determinations
which
do
not
yet
belong
to
the
consciousness
of
the
philosopher
in
question
is
to
carry
on
development
thus
aristotle
states
that
thales
has
defined
the
principle

of
every
thing
to
be
water
but
anaximander
first
made
use
of

and
thales
thus
did
not
possess
this
determination
of
thought
at
all
he
recognized

as
commencement
in
time
but
not
as
the
fundamental
principle
thales
did
not
once
introduce
the
determination
of
cause
into
his
philosophy
and
first
cause
is
a
further
determination
still
there
are
whole
nations
which
have
not
this
conception
at
all
indeed
it
involves
a
great
step
forward
in
development
and
seeing
that
difference
in
culture
on
the
whole
depends
on
difference
in
the
thought
determinations
which
are
manifested
this
must
be
so
still
more
with
respect
to
philosophies
now
as
in
the
logical
system
of
thought
each
of
its
forms
has
its
own
place
in
which
alone
it
suffices
and
this
form
becomes
by
means
of
everprogressing
development
reduced
to
a
subordinate
element
each
philosophy
is
in
the
third
place
a
particular
stage
in
the
development
of
the
whole
process
and
has
its
definite
place
where
it
finds
its
true
value
and
significance
its
special
character
is
really
to
be
conceived
of
in
accordance
with
this
determination
and
it
is
to
be
considered
with
respect
to
this
position
in
order
that
full
justice
may
be
done
to
it
on
this
account
nothing
more
must
be
demanded
or
expected
from
it
than
what
it
actually
gives
and
the
satisfaction
is
not
to
be
sought
for
in
it
which
can
only
be
found
in
a
fuller
development
of
knowledge
we
must
not
expect
to
find
the
questions
of
our
consciousness
and
the
interest
of
the
present
world
responded
to
by
the
ancients
such
questions
presuppose
a
certain
development
in
thought
therefore
every
philosophy
belongs
to
its
own
time
and
is
restricted
by
its
own
limitations
just
because
it
is
the
manifestation
of
a
particular
stage
in
development
the
individual
is
the
offspring
of
his
people
of
his
world
whose
constitution
and
attributes
are
alone
manifested
in
his
form
he
may
spread
himself
out
as
he
will
he
cannot
escape
out
of
his
time
any
more
than
out
of
his
skin
for
he
belongs
to
the
one
universal
mind
which
is
his
substance
and
his
own
existence
how
should
he
escape
from
this
it
is
the
same
universal
mind
that
is
embraced
by
thinking
philosophy
that
philosophy
is
minds
thought
of
itself
and
therefore
its
determinate
and
substantial
content
every
philosophy
is
the
philosophy
of
its
own
day
a
link
in
the
whole
chain
of
spiritual
development
and
thus
it
can
only
find
satisfaction
for
the
interests
belonging
to
its
own
particular
time
on
this
account
an
earlier
philosophy
does
not
give
satisfaction
to
the
mind
in
which
a
deeper
conception
reigns
what
mind
seeks
for
in
philosophy
is
this
conception
which
already
constitutes
its
inward
determination
and
the
root
of
its
existence
conceived
of
as
object
to
thought
mind
demands
a
knowledge
of
itself
but
in
the
earlier
philosophy
the
idea
is
not
yet
present
in
this
determinate
character
hence
the
philosophy
of
plato
and
aristotle
and
indeed
all
philosophies
ever
live
and
are
present
in
their
principles
but
philosophy
no
longer
has
the
particular
form
and
aspect
possessed
by
that
of
plato
and
of

we
cannot
rest
content
with
them
and
they
cannot
be
revived
hence
there
can
be
no
platonists
aristotelians
stoics
or
epicureans
today
to
reawaken
them
would
be
to
try
to
bring
back
to
an
earlier
stage
the
mind
of
a
deeper
culture
and
selfpenetration
but
this
cannot
be
the
case
it
would
be
an
impossibility
and
as
great
a
folly
as
were
a
man
to
wish
to
expend
his
energies
in
attaining
the
standpoint
of
the
youth
the

in
endeavouring
to
be

or
child

the

the

are

the
same

the
period
of
revival
in
the
sciences
the
new
epoch
in
learning
which
took
place
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries

not
only
with
the
revived

of
but
also
with
the
reanimation
of
the
old
philosophies
marsilius
ficinus
was
a
platonist
an
academy
of
platonic
philosophy
was
established
and
installed
with
professors
by
cosmos
de
medici
and
ficinus
was
placed
at
the
head
of
it
there
were
pure
aristotelians
like

to
be

and
so
on
the
sense
of
opposition

so
great
ancient
philosophy
and
christianityfrom
or
in
which
no
special
philosophy
had
developedwere
so
diverse
that
no
philosophy
peculiar
to
itself
could
develop
in
christianity
what
was
or
could
be
had
as
philosophy
either
in
conformity
with
or
in
opposition
to
christianity
was
a
certain
ancient
philosophy
which
was
thus
taken
up
anew
but
mummies
when
brought
amongst
living
beings
cannot
there
remain
mind
had
for
long
possessed
a
more
substantial
life
a
more
profound
notion
of
itself
and
hence
its
thought
had
higher
needs
than
such
as
could
be
satisfied
by
these
philosophies
a
revival
such
as
this
is
then
to
be
regarded
only
as
the
transitory
period
in
which
we
learn
to
know
the
forms
which
are
implied
and
which
have
gone
before
and
as
the
renewal
of
former
struggles
through
the
steps
necessary
in
development
such
reconstructions
and
repetitions
in
a
distant
time
of
principles
which
have
become
foreign
to
mind
are
in
history
transitory
only
and
formed
in
a
language
which
is
dead
such
things
are
translations
only
and
not
originals
and
mind
does
not
find
satisfaction
excepting
in
knowledge
of
its
own
origination
when
modern
times
are
in
the
same
way
called
upon
to
revert
to
the
standpoint
of
an
ancient
philosophy
as
is
recommended
specially
in
regard
to
the
philosophy
of
plato
in
order
to
make
this
a
means
of
escaping
from
the
complications
and
difficulties
of
succeeding
times
this
reversion
does
not
come
naturally
as
in
the
first
case
this
discreet
counsel
has
the
same
origin
as
the
request
to
cultivated
members
of
society
to
turn
back
to
the
customs
and
ideas
of
the
savages
of
the
north
american
forests
or
as
the
recommendation
to
adopt
the
religion
of
melchisedec
which
fichte6
has
maintained
to
be
the
purest
and
simplest
possible
and
therefore
the
one
at
which
we
must
eventually
arrive
on
the
one
hand
in
this
retrogression
the
desire
for
an
origin
and
for
a
fixed
point
of
departure
is
unmistakable
but
such
must
be
sought
for
in
thought
and
idea
alone
and
not
in
an
authoritatively
given
form
on
the
other
hand
the
return
of
the
developed
enriched
mind
to
a
simplicity
such
as
thiswhich
means
to
an
abstraction
an
abstract
condition
or
thoughtis
to
be
regarded
only
as
the
escape
of
an
incapacity
which
cannot
enjoy
the
rich
material
of
development
which
it
sees
before
it
and
which
demands
to
be
controlled
and
comprehended
in
its
very
depths
by
thought
but
seeks
a
refuge
in
fleeing
from
the
difficulty
and
in
mere
sterility
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
quite
comprehensible
how
so
many
of
those
who
whether
induced
by
some
special
attraction
such
as
this
or
simply
by
the
fame
of
a
plato
or
ancient
philosophy
in
general
direct
their
way
thereto
in
order
to
draw
their
own
philosophy
from
these
sources
do
not
find
themselves
satisfied
by
the
study
and
unjustifiably
quit
such
altogether
satisfaction
is
found
in
them
to
a
certain
extent
only
we
must
know
in
ancient
philosophy
or
in
the
philosophy
of
any
given
period
what
we
are
going
to
look
for
or
at
least
we
must
know
that
in
such
a
philosophy
there
is
before
us
a
definite
stage
in
the
development
of
thought
and
in
it
those
forms
and
necessities
of
mind
which
lie
within
the
limits
of
that
stage
alone
are
brought
into
existence
there
slumber
in
the
mind
of
modern
times
ideas
more
profound
which
require
for
their
awakening
other
surroundings
and
another
present
than
the
abstract
dim
grey
thought
of
olden
times
in
plato
for
instance
questions
regarding
the
nature
of
freedom
the
origin
of
evil
and
of
sin
providence
c
do
not
find
their
philosophic
answer
on
such
subjects
we
certainly
may
in
part
take
the
ordinary
serious
views
of
the
present
time
and
in
part
philosophically
set
their
consideration
altogether
aside
or
else
consider
sin
and
freedom
as
something
negative
only
but
neither
the
one
plan
nor
the
other
gives
freedom
to
mind
if
such
subjects
have
once
been
explicitly
for
it
and
if
the
opposition
in
selfconsciousness
has
given
it
the
power
of
sinking
its
interests
therein
the
case
is
similar
with
regard
to
questions
regarding
the
limits
of
knowledge
the
opposition
between
subjectivity
and
objectivity
which
had
not
yet
come
up
in
platos
age
the
independence
of
the
i
within
itself
and
its
explicit
existence
was
foreign
to
him
man
had
not
yet
gone
back
within
himself
had
not
yet
set
himself
forth
as
explicit
the
subject
was
indeed
the
individual
as
free
but
as
yet
he
knew
himself
only
as
in
unity
with
his
being
the
athenian
knew
himself
to
be
free
as
such
just
as
the
roman
citizen
would
as
ingenuus
but
the
fact
that
man
is
in
and
for
himself
free
in
his
essence
and
as
man
free
born
was
known
neither
by
plato
aristotle
cicero
nor
the
roman
legislators
even
though
it
is
this
conception
alone
which
forms
the
source
of
law
in
christianity
the
individual
personal
mind
for
the
first
time
becomes
of
real
infinite
and
absolute
value
god
wills
that
all
men
shall
be
saved
it
was
in
the
christian
religion
that
the
doctrine
was
advanced
that
all
men
are
equal
before
god
because
christ
has
set
them
free
with
the
freedom
of
christianity
these
principles
make
freedom
independent
of
any
such
things
as
birth
standing
or
culture
the
progress
made
through
them
is
enormous
but
they
still
come
short
of
this
that
to
be
free
constitutes
the
very
idea
of
man
the
sense
of
this
existent
principle
has
been
an
active
force
for
centuries
and
centuries
and
an
impelling
power
which
has
brought
about
the
most
tremendous
revolutions
but
the
conception
and
the
knowledge
of
the
natural
freedom
of
man
is
a
knowledge
of
himself
which
is
not
old
b
the
relation
of
philosophy
to
other
departments
of
knowledge
the
history
of
philosophy
has
to
represent
this
science
in
that
form
of
time
and
individualities
from
which
its
outward
form
has
resulted
such
a
representation
has
however
to
shut
out
from
itself
the
external
history
of
the
time
and
to
take
into
account
only
the
general
character
of
the
people
and
time
and
likewise
their
circumstances
as
a
whole
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
history
of
philosophy
does
present
this
character
and
that
indeed
in
the
highest
possible
degree
its
connection
with
it
is
of
the
closest
kind
and
the
particular
appearance
presented
by
a
philosophy
belonging
to
one
special
period
is
only
a
particular
aspect
or
element
in
the
character
because
of
this
inward
correspondence
we
have
partly
to
consider
more
closely
the
particular
relation
borne
by
a
philosophy
to
its
historical
surroundings
and
partly
but
preeminently
what
is
proper
to
itself
from
which
alone
after
separating
everything
related
however
closely
we
can
fix
our
standpoint
this
connection
which
is
not
merely
external
but
essential
has
thus
two
sides
which
we
must
consider
the
first
is
the
distinctly
historical
side
the
second
is
the
connection
with
other
mattersthe
connection
of
philosophy
with
religion
for
instance
by
which
we
at
once
obtain
a
deeper
conception
of
philosophy
itself
1
the
historical
side
of
this
connection
it
is
usually
said
that
political
affairs
and
such
matters
as
religion
are
to
be
taken
into
consideration
because
they
have
exercised
a
great
influence
on
the
philosophy
of
the
time
and
similarly
it
exerts
an
influence
upon
them
but
when
people
are
content
with
such
a
category
as
great
influence
they
place
the
two
in
an
external
relationship
and
start
from
the
point
of
view
that
both
sides
are
for
themselves
independent
here
however
we
must
think
of
this
relationship
in
another
category
and
not
according
to
the
influence
or
effect
of
one
upon
the
other
the
true
category
is
the
unity
of
all
these
different
forms
so
that
it
is
one
mind
which
manifests
itself
in
and
impresses
itself
upon
these
different
elements
a
outward
and
historical
conditions
imposed
upon
philosophy
it
must
be
remarked
in
the
first
place
that
a
certain
stage
is
requisite
in
the
intellectual
culture
of
a
people
in
order
that
it
may
have
a
philosophy
at
all
aristotle
says
man
first
begins
to
philosophize
when
the
necessities
of
life
are
supplied
metaphysics
i
2
because
since
philosophy
is
a
free
and
not
selfseeking
activity
cravings
of
want
must
have
disappeared
a
strength
elevation
and
inward
fortitude
of
mind
must
have
appeared
passions
must
be
subdued
and
consciousness
so
far
advanced
before
what
is
universal
can
be
thought
of
philosophy
may
thus
be
called
a
kind
of
luxury
in
so
far
as
luxury
signifies
those
enjoyments
and
pursuits
which
do
not
belong
to
external
necessity
as
such
philosophy
in
this
respect
seems
more
capable
of
being
dispensed
with
than
anything
else
but
that
depends
on
what
is
called
indispensable
from
the
point
of
view
of
mind
philosophy
may
even
be
said
to
be
that
which
is
most
essential
b
the
commencement
in
history
of
an
intellectual
necessity
for
philosophy
however
much
philosophy
as
the
thought
and
conception
of
the
mind
of
a
particular
time
is

priori
it
is
at
the
same
time
just
as
really
a
result
since
the
thought
produced
and
indeed
the
life
and
action
are
produced
to
produce
themselves
this
activity
contains
the
essential
element
of
a
negation
because
to
produce
is
also
to
destroy
philosophy
in
producing
itself
has
the
natural
as
its
starting
point
in
order
to
abrogate
it
again
philosophy
thus
makes
its
appearance
at
a
time
when
the
mind
of
a
people
has
worked
its
way
out
of
the
indifference
and
stolidity
of
the
first
life
of
nature
as
it
has
also
done
from
the
standpoint
of
the
emotional
so
that
the
individual
aim
has
blotted
itself
out
but
as
mind
passes
on
from
its
natural
form
it
also
proceeds
from
its
exact
code
of
morals
and
the
robustness
of
life
to
reflection
and
conception
the
result
of
this
is
that
it
lays
hold
of
and
troubles
this
real
substantial
kind
of
existence
this
morality
and
faith
and
thus
the
period
of
destruction
commences
further
progress
is
then
made
through
the
gathering
up
of
thought
within
itself
it
may
be
said
that
philosophy
first
commences
when
a
race
for
the
most
part
has
left
its
concrete
life
when
separation
and
change
of
class
have
begun
and
the
people
approach
toward
their
fall
when
a
gulf
has
arisen
between
inward
strivings
and
external
reality
and
the
old
forms
of
religion
c
are
no
longer
satisfying
when
mind
manifests
indifference
to
its
living
existence
or
rests
unsatisfied
therein
and
moral
life
becomes
dissolved
then
it
is
that
mind
takes
refuge
in
the
clear
space
of
thought
to
create
for
itself
a
kingdom
of
thought
in
opposition
to
the
world
of
actuality
and
philosophy
is
the
reconciliation
following
upon
the
destruction
of
that
real
world
which
thought
has
begun
when
philosophy
with
its
abstractions
paints
grey
in
grey
the
freshness
and
life
of
youth
has
gone
the
reconciliation
is
not
a
reconciliation
in
the
actual
but
in
the
ideal
world
thus
the
greek
philosophers
held
themselves
far
removed
from
the
business
of
the
state
and
were
called
by
the
people
idlers
because
they
withdrew
themselves
within
the
world
of
thought
this
holds
good
throughout
all
the
history
of
philosophy
it
was
so
with
ionic
philosophy
in
the
decline
of
the
ionic
states
in
asia
minor
socrates
and
plato
had
no
more
pleasure
in
the
life
of
the
state
in
athens
which
was
in
the
course
of
its
decline
plato
tried
to
bring
about
something
better
with
dionysius
thus
in
athens
with
the
ruin
of
the
athenian
people
the
period
was
reached
when
philosophy
appeared
in
rome
philosophy
first
expanded
in
the
decline
of
the
republic
and
of
roman
life
proper
under
the
despotism
of
the
roman
emperors
a
time
of
misfortune
for
the
world
and
of
decay
in
political
life
when
earlier
religious
systems
tottered
and
everything
was
in
the
process
of
struggle
and
disintegration
with
the
decline
of
the
roman
empire
which
was
so
great
rich
and
glorious
and
yet
inwardly
dead
the
height
and
indeed
the
zenith
of
ancient
philosophy
is
associated
through
the
neoplatonists
at
alexandria
it
was
also
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
when
the
teutonic
life
of
the
middle
ages
acquired
another
form
that
philosophy
first
became
taught
though
it
was
later
on
that
it
attained
to
independence
before
that
political
life
still
existed
in
unity
with
religion
or
if
the
state
fought
against
the
church
the
church
still
kept
the
foremost
place
but
now
the
gulf
between
church
and
state
came
into
existence
philosophy
thus
comes
in
at
a
certain
epoch
only
in
the
development
of
the
whole
c
philosophy
as
the
thought
of
its
time
but
men
do
not
at
certain
epochs
merely
philosophize
in
general
for
there
is
a
definite
philosophy
which
arises
among
a
people
and
the
definite
character
of
the
standpoint
of
thought
is
the
same
character
which
permeates
all
the
other
historical
sides
of
the
spirit
of
the
people
which
is
most
intimately
related
to
them
and
which
constitutes
their
foundation
the
particular
form
of
a
philosophy
is
thus
contemporaneous
with
a
particular
constitution
of
the
people
amongst
whom
it
makes
its
appearance
with
their
institutions
and
forms
of
government
their
morality
their
social
life
and
the
capabilities
customs
and
enjoyments
of
the
same
it
is
so
with
their
attempts
and
achievements
in
art
and
science
with
their
religious
warfares
and
external
relationships
likewise
with
the
decadence
of
the
states
in
which
this
particular
principle
and
form
had
maintained
its
supremacy
and
with
the
origination
and
progress
of
new
states
in
which
a
higher
principle
finds
its
manifestation
and
development
mind
in
each
case
has
elaborated
and
expanded
in
the
whole
domain
of
its
manifold
nature
the
principle
of
the
particular
stage
of
selfconsciousness
to
which
it
has
attained
thus
the
mind
of
a
people
in
its
richness
is
an
organization
and
like
a
cathedral
is
divided
into
numerous
vaults
passages
pillars
and
vestibules
all
of
which
have
proceeded
out
of
one
whole
and
are
directed
to
one
end
philosophy
is
one
form
of
these
many
aspects
and
which
is
it
it
is
the
fullest
blossom
the
notion
of
mind
in
its
entire
form
the
consciousness
and
spiritual
essence
of
all
things
the
spirit
of
the
time
as
spirit
present
in
itself
the
multifarious
whole
is
reflected
in
it
as
in
the
single
focus
in
the
notion
which
knows
itself
the
philosophy
which
is
essential
within
christianity
could
not
be
found
in
rome
for
all
the
various
forms
of
the
whole
are
only
the
expression
of
one
and
the
same
determinate
character
hence
political
history
forms
of
government
art
and
religion
are
not
related
to
philosophy
as
its
causes
nor
on
the
other
hand
is
philosophy
the
ground
of
their
existenceone
and
all
have
the
same
common
root
the
spirit
of
the
time
it
is
one
determinate
existence
one
determinate
character
which
permeates
all
sides
and
manifests
itself
in
politics
and
in
all
else
as
in
different
elements
it
is
a
condition
which
hangs
together
in
all
its
parts
and
the
various
parts
of
which
contain
nothing
which
is
really
inconsistent
however
diverse
and
accidental
they
may
appear
to
be
and
however
much
they
may
seem
to
contradict
one
another
this
particular
stage
is
the
product
of
the
one
preceding
but
to
show
how
the
spirit
of
a
particular
time
moulds
its
whole
actuality
and
destiny
in
accordance
with
its
principle
to
show
this
whole
edifice
in
its
conception
is
far
from
usfor
that
would
be
the
object
of
the
whole
philosophic
worldhistory
those
forms
alone
concern
us
which
express
the
principle
of
the
mind
in
a
spiritual
element
related
to
philosophy
this
is
the
position
of
philosophy
amongst
its
varying
forms
from
which
it
follows
that
it
is
entirely
identical
with
its
time
but
if
philosophy
does
not
stand
above
its
time
in
content
it
does
so
in
form
because
as
the
thought
and
knowledge
of
that
which
is
the
substantial
spirit
of
its
time
it
makes
that
spirit
its
object
in
as
far
as
philosophy
is
in
the
spirit
of
its
time
the
latter
is
its
determined
content
in
the
world
although
as
knowledge
philosophy
is
above
it
since
it
places
it
in
the
relation
of
object
but
this
is
in
form
alone
for
philosophy
really
has
no
other
content
this
knowledge
itself
undoubtedly
is
the
actuality
of
mind
the
selfknowledge
of
mind
which
previously
was
not
present
thus
the
formal
difference
is
also
a
real
and
actual
difference
through
knowledge
mind
makes
manifest
a
distinction
between
knowledge
and
that
which
is
this
knowledge
is
thus
what
produces
a
new
form
of
development
the
new
forms
at
first
are
only
special
modes
of
knowledge
and
it
is
thus
that
a
new
philosophy
is
produced
yet
since
it
already
is
a
wider
kind
of
spirit
it
is
the
inward
birthplace
of
the
spirit
which
will
later
arrive
at
actual
form
we
shall
deal
further
with
this
in
the
concrete
below
and
we
shall
then
see
that
what
the
greek
philosophy
was
entered
in
the
christian
world
into
actuality
2
separation
of
philosophy
from
other
allied
departments
of
knowledge
the
history
of
the
other
sciences
of
culture
and
above
all
the
history
of
art
and
of
religion
are
partly
in
regard
to
the
elements
contained
in
them
and
partly
to
their
particular
objects
related
to
the
history
of
philosophy
it
is
through
this
relationship
that
the
treatment
of
the
history
of
philosophy
has
been
so
confused
if
it
is
to
concern
itself
with
the
possession
of
culture
generally
and
then
with
scientific
culture
and
then
again
with
popular
myths
and
the
dogmas
contained
only
in
them
and
yet
farther
with
the
religious
reflections
which
are
already
thoughts
of
a
speculative
kind
and
which
make
their
appearance
in
them
no
bounds
are
left
to
philosophy
at
all
this
is
so
partly
on
account
of
the
amount
of
material
itself
and
the
labour
required
in
working
it
up
and
preparing
it
and
partly
because
it
is
in
immediate
connection
with
so
much
else
but
the
separation
must
not
be
made
arbitrarily
or
as
by
chance
but
must
be
derived
from
fundamental
determinations
if
we
merely
look
at
the
name
of
philosophy
all
this
matter
will
pertain
to
its
history
i
shall
speak
of
this
material
from
three
points
of
view
for
three
related
aspects
are
to
be
eliminated
and
separated
from
philosophy
the
first
of
these
is
that
which
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
domain
of
science
and
in
which
are
found
the
beginnings
of
understanding
thought
the
second
region
is
that
of
mythology
and
religion
the
relation
of
philosophy
to
them
seems
often
to
be
inimical
both
in
the
time
of
the
greeks
and
of
the
christians
the
third
is
that
of
philosophizing
and
the
metaphysics
of
the
understanding
while
we
distinguish
what
is
related
to
philosophy
we
must
also
take
note
of
the
elements
in
this
related
matter
which
belong
to
the
notion
of
philosophy
but
which
appear
to
us
to
be
partially
separated
from
it
and
thus
we
may
become
acquainted
with
the
notion
of
philosophy
a
relation
of
philosophy
to
scientific
knowledge
knowledge
and
thought
certainly
form
the
element
of
whatever
has
to
do
with
particular
sciences
as
they
form
the
element
of
philosophy
but
their
subjects
are
mainly
finite
subjects
and
appearance
a
collection
of
facts
known
about
this
content
is
by
its
nature
excluded
from
philosophy
neither
this
content
nor
such
a
form
has
anything
to
do
with
it
but
even
if
the
sciences
are
systematic
and
contain
universal
principles
and
laws
from
which
they
proceed
they
are
still
related
to
a
limited
circle
of
objects
the
ultimate
principles
are
assumed
as
are
the
objects
themselves
that
is
the
outward
experience
or
the
feelings
of
the
heart
natural
or
educated
sense
of
right
and
duty
constitute
the
source
from
which
they
are
created
logic
and
the
determinations
and
principles
of
thought
in
general
are
in
their
methods
assumed
the
forms
of
thought
or
the
points
of
view
and
principles
which
hold
good
in
the
sciences
and
constitute
the
ultimate
support
of
all
their
matter
are
not
peculiar
to
them
but
are
common
to
the
condition
and
culture
of
the
time
and
of
the
people
this
culture
consists
mainly
in
the
general
ideas
and
aims
in
the
whole
extent
of
the
particular
intellectual
powers
dominating
consciousness
and
life
our
consciousness
has
these
ideas
and
allows
them
to
be
considered
ultimate
determinations
it
makes
use
of
them
as
guiding
and
connecting
links
but
does
not
know
them
and
does
not
even
make
them
the
objects
of
its
consideration
to
give
an
abstract
example
each
act
of
consciousness
has
and
requires
the
whole
abstract
thoughtdetermination
of
being
the
sun
is
in
the
heavens
the
bunch
of
grapes
is
ripe
and
so
on
into
infinitude
again
in
a
higher
culture
such
relations
as
those
of
cause
and
effect
are
involved
as
also
those
of
force
and
its
manifestation
all
its
knowledge
and
ideas
are
permeated
and
governed
by
a
metaphysic
such
as
this
it
is
the
net
in
which
all
the
concrete
matter
which
occupies
mankind
in
action
and
in
impulses
is
grasped
but
this
web
and
its
knots
in
our
ordinary
consciousness
are
sunk
into
a
manifold
material
for
it
contains
the
objects
and
interests
which
we
know
and
which
we
have
before
us
these
common
threads
are
not
drawn
up
and
made
explicitly
the
objects
of
our
reflection
we
germans
seldom
now
count
general
scientific
knowledge
as
philosophy
and
yet
traces
of
this
are
found
as
for
instance
in
the
fact
that
the
philosophic
faculty
contains
all
the
sciences
which
have
not
as
their
immediate
aim
the
church
and
state
in
connection
with
this
the
significance
of
the
name
of
philosophy
which
is
even
now
an
important
matter
of
discussion
in
england
comes
in
question
natural
sciences
are
in
england
called
philosophy
a
philosophic
journal
in
england
edited
by
thompson
treats
of
chemistry
agriculture
manuring
husbandry
technology
like
hermbstdts
journal
and
gives
inventions
connected
therewith
the
english
call
physical
instruments
such
as
the
barometer
and
thermometer
philosophical
instruments
theories
too
and
especially
morality
and
the
moral
sciences
which
are
derived
from
the
feelings
of
the
human
heart
or
from
experience
are
called
philosophy
and
finally
this
is
also
so
with
the
theories
and
principles
of
political
economy
and
thus
at
least
in
england
is
the
name
of
philosophy
respected
some
time
ago
a
banquet
took
place
under
the
presidency
of
lord
liverpool
at
which
the
minister
canning
was
also
present
the
latter
in
returning
thanks
congratulated
england
in
having
philosophic
principles
of
government
there
brought
into
operation
there
at
least
philosophy
is
no
byword
in
the
first
beginnings
of
culture
however
we
are
more
often
met
by
this
admixture
of
philosophy
and
general
knowledge
there
comes
a
time
to
a
nation
when
mind
applies
itself
to
universal
objects
when
for
example
in
seeking
to
bring
natural
things
under
general
modes
of
understanding
it
tries
to
learn
their
causes
then
it
is
said
that
a
people
begins
to
philosophize
for
this
content
has
thought
in
common
with
philosophy
at
such
a
time
we
find
deliverances
about
all
the
common
events
of
nature
as
we
also
find
intellectual
maxims
moral
sentences
general
principles
respecting
morality
the
will
duty
and
the
like
and
those
who
expressed
them
have
been
called
wise
men
or
philosophers
thus
in
the
beginnings
of
greek
philosophy
we
find
the
seven
sages
and
the
ionic
philosophers
from
them
a
number
of
ideas
and
discoveries
are
conveyed
to
us
which
seem
like
philosophic
propositions
thus
thales
amongst
others
has
explained
that
the
eclipse
of
sun
and
moon
is
due
to
the
intervention
of
the
moon
or
earth
this
is
called
a
theorem
pythagoras

out

principle
of
the
harmony

others
have
had
ideas
about
the
stars
the
heavens
were
supposed
to
be
composed
of
perforated
metal
by
which
we
see
throughout
the
empyrean
region
the
eternal
fire
which
surrounds
the
world
such
propositions
as
products
of
the
understanding
do
not
belong
to
the
history
of
philosophy
although
they
imply
that
the
merely
sensuous
gaze
has
been
left
behind
as
also
the
representation
of
those
objects
by
the
imagination
only
earth
and
heaven
thus
become
unpeopled
with
gods
because
the
understanding
distinguishes
things
in
their
outward
and
natural
qualities
from
mind
in
a
later
time
the
epoch
of
the
revival
in
the
sciences
is
as
noteworthy
in
this
respect
general
principles
regarding
the
state
c
were
given
expression
to
and
in
them
a
philosophic
side
cannot
be
mistaken
to
this
place
the
philosophic
systems
of
hobbes
and
descartes
belong
the
writings
of
the
latter
contain
philosophic
principles
but
his
philosophy
of
nature
is
quite
empirical

which
what
was
historically
held
by
the
people
as
law
the
consensus
gentium
was
a
main
element
though
earlier
medicine
was
a
collection
of
isolated
facts
and
a
theosophic
combination
mixed
up
with
astrology
c
it
is
not
so
long
ago
since
cures
were
effected
by
sacred
relics
a
mode
of
regarding
nature
came
into
vogue
according
to
which
men
went
forth
to
discover
the
laws
and
forces
of
nature
the

priori
reasoning
regarding
natural
things
according
to
the
metaphysics
of
the
scholastic
philosophy
or
to
religion
has
now
been
given
up
the
philosophy
of
newton
contains
nothing
but
natural
science
that
is
the
knowledge
of
the
laws
forces
and
general
constitution
of
nature
derived
from
observation
and
from
experience
however
much
this
may
seem
to
be
contrary
to
the
principle
of
philosophy
it
has
in
common
with
it
the
fact
that
the
bases
of
both
are
universal
and
still
further
that
i
have
made
this
experience
that
it
rests
on
my
consciousness
and
obtains
its
significance
through
me
this
form
is
in
its
general
aspect
antagonistic
to
the
positive
and
has
come
forward
as
particularly
opposed
to
religion
and
to
that
which
is
positive
in
it
if
in
the
middle
ages
the
church
had
its
dogmas
as
universal
truths
man
on
the
contrary
has
now
obtained
from
the
testimony
of
his
own
thought
feeling
and
ideas
a
mistrust
of
these
it
is
merely
to
be
remarked
of
this
that
my
own
thought
is
in
itself
a
pleonasm
because
each
individual
must
think
for
himself
and
no
one
can
do
so
for
another
similarly
this
principle
has
turned
against
the
recognized
constitutions
and
has
sought
different
principles
instead
by
them
to
correct
the
former
universal
principles
of
the
state
have
now
been
laid
down
while
earlier
because
religion
was
positive
the
ground
of
obedience
of
subjects
to
princes
and
of
all
authority
were
also
so
kings
as
the
anointed
of
the
lord
in
the
sense
that
jewish
kings
were
so
derived
their
power
from
god
and
had
to
give
account
to
him
alone
because
all
authority
is
given
by
god
so
far
theology
and
jurisprudence
were
on
the
whole
fixed
and
positive
sciences
wherever
this
positive
character
might
have
been
derived
against
this
external
authority
reflection
has
been
brought
to
bear
and
thus
especially
in
england
the
source
of
public
and
civil
law
became
no
longer
mere
authority
derived
from
god
like
the
mosaic
law
for
the
authority
of
kings
other
justification
was
sought
such
as
the
end
implied
in
the
state
the
good
of
the
people
this
forms
quite
another
source
of
truth
and
it
is
opposed
to
that
which
is
revealed
given
and
positive
this
substitution
of
another
ground
than
that
of
authority
has
been
called
philosophizing
the
knowledge
was
then
a
knowledge
of
what
is
finitethe
world
of
the
content
of
knowledge
because
this
content
proceeded
through
the
personal
insight
of
human
reason
man
has
become
independent
in
his
actions
this
independence
of
the
mind
is
the
true
moment
of
philosophy
although
the
notion
of
philosophy
through
this
formal
determination
which
limits
it
to
finite
objects
has
not
yet
been
exhausted
this
independent
thought
is
respected
has
been
called
human
wisdom
or
worldly
wisdom
for
it
has
had
what
is
earthly
as
its
object
and
it
took
its
origin
in
the
world
this
was
the
meaning
of
philosophy
and
men
did
rightly
to
call
it
worldly
wisdom
frederick
von
schlegel
revived
this
byname
for
philosophy
and
desired
to
indicate
by
it
that
what
concerns
higher
spheres
such
as
religion
must
be
kept
apart
and
he
had
many
followers
philosophy
indeed
occupies
itself
with
finite
things
but
according
to
spinoza
as
resting
in
the
divine
idea
it
has
thus
the
same
end
as
religion
to
the
finite
sciences
which
are
now
separated
also
from
philosophy
the
churches
objected
that
they
led
men
away
from
god
since
they
have
as
objects
only
what
is
finite
this
defect
in
them
conceived
of
from
the
point
of
view
of
content
leads
us
to
the
second
department
allied
to
philosophythat
is
to
religion
b
relation
of
philosophy
to
religion
as
the
first
department
of
knowledge
was
related
to
philosophy
principally
by
means
of
formal
and
independent
knowledge
religion
though
in
its
content
quite
different
from
this
first
kind
or
sphere
of
knowledge
is
through
it
related
to
philosophy
its
object
is
not
the
earthly
and
worldly
but
the
infinite
in
the
case
of
art
and
still
more
in
that
of
religion
philosophy
has
in
common
a
content
composed
entirely
of
universal
objects
they
constitute
the
mode
in
which
the
highest
idea
is
existent
for
the
unphilosophical
feeling
the
perceiving
and
imagining
consciousness
inasmuch
as
in
the
progress
of
culture
in
time
the
manifestation
of
religion
precedes
the
appearance
of
philosophy
this
circumstance
must
really
be
taken
account
of
and
the
conditions
requisite
for
beginning
the
history
of
philosophy
have
to
depend
on
this
because
it
has
to
be
shown
in
how
far
what
pertains
to
religion
is
to
be
excluded
from
it
and
that
a
commencement
must
not
be
made
with
religion
in
religion
races
of
men
have
undoubtedly
expressed
their
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
world
the
substance
of
nature
and
of
intellect
and
the
relation
of
man
thereto
absolute
being
is
here
the
object
of
their
consciousness
and
as
such
is
for
them
preeminently
the
other
a
beyond
nearer
or
further
off
more
or
less
friendly
or
frightful
and
alarming
in
the
act
and
forms
of
worship
this
opposition
is
removed
by
man
and
he
raises
himself
to
the
consciousness
of
unity
with
his
being
to
the
feeling
of
or
dependence
on
the
grace
of
god
in
that
god
has
reconciled
mankind
to
himself
in
conception
with
the
greeks
for
instance
this
existence
is
to
man
one
which
is
already
in
and
for
itself
and
friendly
and
thus
worship
is
but
the
enjoyment
of
this
unity
this
existence
is
now
reason
which
is
existent
in
and
for
itself
the
universal
and
concrete
substance
the
mind
whose
first
cause
is
objective
to
itself
in
consciousness
it
thus
is
a
representation
of
this
last
in
which
not
only
reason
in
general
but
the
universal
infinite
reason
is
we
must
therefore
comprehend
religion
as
philosophy
before
everything
else
which
means
to
know
and
apprehend
it
in
reason
for
it
is
the
work
of
selfrevealing
reason
and
is
the
highest
form
of
reason
such
ideas
as
that
priests
have
framed
a
peoples
religion
in
fraud
and
selfinterest
are
consequently
absurd
to
regard
religion
as
an
arbitrary
matter
or
a
deception
is
as
foolish
as
it
is
perverted
priests
have
often
profaned
religionthe
possibility
of
which
is
a
consequence
of
the
external
relations
and
temporal
existence
of
religion
it
can
thus
in
this
external
connection
be
laid
hold
of
here
and
there
but
because
it
is
religion
it
is
really
that
which
stands
firm
against
finite
ends
and
their
complications
and
constitutes
a
region
exalted
high
above
them
this
region
of
mind
is
really
the
holy
place
of
truth
itself
the
holy
place
in
which
are
dissolved
the
remaining
illusions
of
the
sensuous
world
of
finite
ideas
and
ends
and
of
the
sphere
of
opinion
and
caprice
inasmuch
as
it
really
is
the
content
of
religions
this
rational
matter
might
now
seem
to
be
capable
of
being
abstracted
and
expressed
as
a
number
of
historical
theorems
philosophy
stands
on
the
same
basis
as
religion
and
has
the
same
objectthe
universal
reason
existing
in
and
for
itself
mind
desires
to
make
this
object
its
own
as
is
done
with
religion
in
the
act
and
form
of
worship
but
the
form
as
it
is
present
in
religion
is
different
from
what
is
found
to
be
contained
in
philosophy
and
on
this
account
a
history
of
philosophy
is
different
from
a
history
of
religion
worship
is
only
the
operation
of
reflection
philosophy
attempts
to
bring
about
the
reconciliation
by
means
of
thinking
knowledge
because
mind
desires
to
take
up
its
being
into
itself
philosophy
is
related
in
the
form
of
thinking
consciousness
to
its
object
with
religion
it
is
different
but
the
distinction
between
the
two
should
not
be
conceived
of
so
abstractly
as
to
make
it
seem
that
thought
is
only
in
philosophy
and
not
in
religion
the
latter
has
likewise
ideas
and
universal
thoughts
because
both
are
so
nearly
related
it
is
an
old
tradition
in
the
history
of
philosophy
to
deduce
philosophy
from
persian
indian
or
similar
philosophy
a
custom
which
is
still
partly
retained
in
all
histories
of
philosophy
for
this
reason
too
it
is
a
legend
universally
believed
that
pythagoras
for
instance
received
his
philosophy
from
india
and
egypt
the
fame
of
the
wisdom
of
these
people
which
wisdom
is
understood
also
to
contain
philosophy
is
an
old
one
the
oriental
ideas
and
religious
worship
which
prevailed
throughout
the
west
up
to
the
time
of
the
roman
empire
likewise
bear
the
name
of
oriental
philosophy
the
christian
religion
and
philosophy
are
thought
of
in
the
christian
world
as
more
definitely
divided
in
these
eastern
days
on
the
other
hand
religion
and
philosophy
are
still
conceived
of
as
one
in
so
far
as
that
the
content
has
remained
in
the
form
in
which
it
is
philosophy
considering
the
prevalence
of
these
ideas
and
in
order
to
have
a
definite
limit
to
the
relations
between
a
history
of
philosophy
and
religious
ideas
it
is
desirable
to
note
some
further
considerations
as
to
the
form
which
separates
religious
ideas
from
philosophical
theorems
religion
has
not
only
universal
thought
as
inward
content
implicite
contained
in
its
myths
ideas
imaginations
and
in
its
exact
and
positive
histories
so
that
we
require
first
of
all
to
dig
this
content
out
of
such
myths
in
the
form
of
theorems
but
it
often
has
its
content
explicite
in
the
form
of
thought
in
the
persian
and
indian
religions
very
deep
sublime
and
speculative
thoughts
are
even
expressed
indeed
in
religion
we
even
meet
philosophies
directly
expressed
as
in
the
philosophy
of
the
fathers
the
scholastic
philosophy
really
was
theology
there
is
found
in
it
a
union
or
if
you
will
a
mixture
of
theology
and
philosophy
which
may
very
well
puzzle
us
the
question
which
confronts
us
on
the
one
side
is
how
philosophy
differs
from
theology
as
the
science
of
religion
or
from
religion
as
consciousness
and
then
in
how
far
have
we
in
the
history
of
philosophy
to
take
account
of
what
pertains
to
religion
for
the
reply
to
this
last
question
three
aspects
have
again
to
be
dealt
with
first
of
all
the
mythical
and
historical
aspect
of
religion
and
its
relation
to
philosophy
in
the
second
place
the
theorems
and
speculative
thoughts
directly
expressed
in
religion
and
in
the
third
place
we
must
speak
of
philosophy
within
theology

difference
between
philosophy
and
religion
the
consideration
of
the
mythical
aspect
of
religion
or
the
historical
and
positive
side
generally
is
interesting
because
from
it
the
difference
in
respect
of
form
will
show
in
what
this
content
is
antagonistic
to
philosophy
indeed
taken
in
its
connections
its
difference
passes
into
apparent
inconsistency
this
diversity
is
not
only
found
in
our
contemplation
but
forms
a
very
definite
element
in
history
it
is
required
by
philosophy
that
it
should
justify
its
beginning
and
its
manner
of
knowledge
and
philosophy
has
thus
placed
itself
in
opposition
to
religion
on
the
other
hand
philosophy
is
combated
and
condemned
by
religion
and
by
the
churches
the
greek
popular
religion
indeed
proscribed
several
philosophers
but
the
opposition
is
even
more
apparent
in
the
christian
church
the
question
is
thus
not
only
whether
regard
is
to
be
paid
to
religion
in
the
history
of
philosophy
for
it
has
been
the
case
that
philosophy
has
paid
attention
to
religion
and
the
latter
to
the
former
since
neither
of
the
two
has
allowed
the
other
to
rest
undisturbed
we
are
not
permitted
to
do
so
either
of
their
relations
therefore
we
must
speak
definitely
openly
and
honestlyaborder
la
question
as
the
french
say
we
must
not
hesitate
as
if
such
a
discussion
were
too
delicate
nor
try
to
help
ourselves
out
by
beating
about
the
bush
nor
must
we
seek
to
find
evasions
or
shifts
so
that
in
the
end
no
one
can
tell
what
we
mean
we
must
not
seem
to
wish
to
leave
religion
alone
this
is
nothing
else
than
to
appear
to
wish
to
conceal
the
fact
that
philosophy
has
directed
its
efforts
against
religion
religion
that
is
the
theologians
are
indeed
the
cause
of
this
they
ignore
philosophy
but
only
in
order
that
they
may
not
be
contradicted
in
their
arbitrary
reasoning
it
may
appear
as
if
religion
demanded
that
man
should
abstain
from
thinking
of
universal
matters
and
philosophy
because
they
are
merely
worldly
wisdom
and
represent
human
operations
human
reason
is
here
opposed
to
the
divine
men
are
indeed
well
accustomed
to
a
distinction
between
divine
teaching
and
laws
and
human
power
and
inventions
such
that
under
the
latter
everything
is
comprehended
which
in
its
manifestation
proceeds
from
the
consciousness
the
intelligence
or
the
will
of
mankind
which
makes
all
this
opposed
to
the
knowledge
of
god
and
to
things
rendered
divine
by
divine
revelation
but
the
depreciation
of
what
is
human
expressed
by
this
opposition
is
then
driven
further
still
inasmuch
as
while
it
implies
the
further
view
that
man
is
certainly
called
upon
to
admire
the
wisdom
of
god
in
nature
and
that
the
grain
the
mountains
the
cedars
of
lebanon
in
all
their
glory
the
song
of
the
birds
in
the
bough
the
superior
skill
and
the
domestic
instincts
of
animals
are
all
magnified
as
being
the
work
of
god
it
also
implies
that
the
wisdom
goodness
and
justice
of
god
is
indeed
pointed
out
in
human
affairs
but
not
so
much
in
the
disposition
or
laws
of
man
or
in
actions
performed
voluntarily
and
in
the
ordinary
progress
of
the
world
as
in
human
destiny
that
is
in
that
which
is
external
and
even
arbitrary
in
relation
to
knowledge
and
freewill
thus
what
is
external
and
accidental
is
regarded
as
emphatically
the
work
of
god
and
what
has
its
root
in
will
and
conscience
as
the
work
of
man
the
harmony
between
outward
relations
circumstances
and
events
and
the
general
aims
of
man
is
certainly
something
of
a
higher
kind
but
this
is
the
case
only
for
the
reason
that
this
harmony
is
considered
with
respect
to
ends
which
are
human
and
not
naturalsuch
as
those
present
in
the
life
of
a
sparrow
which
finds
its
food
but
if
the
summit
of
everything
is
found
in
this
that
god
rules
over
nature
what
then
is
freewill
does
he
not
rule
over
what
is
spiritual
or
rather
since
he
himself
is
spiritual
in
what
is
spiritual
and
is
not
the
ruler
over
or
in
the
spiritual
region
higher
than
a
ruler
over
or
in
nature
but
is
that
admiration
of
god
as
revealed
in
natural
things
as
such
in
trees
and
animals
as
opposed
to
what
is
human
far
removed
from
the
religion
of
the
ancient
egyptians
which
derived
its
knowledge
of
what
is
divine
from
the
ibis
or
from
cats
and
dogs
or
does
it
differ
from
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
ancient
and
the
modern
indians
who
held
and
still
hold
cows
and
apes
in
reverence
and
are
scrupulously
concerned
for
the
maintenance
and
nourishment
of
these
animals
while
they
allow
men
to
suffer
hunger
who
would
commit
a
crime
by
removing
the
pangs
of
starvation
through
their
slaughter
or
even
by
partaking
of
their
food
it
seems
to
be
expressed
by
such
a
view
that
human
action
as
regards
nature
is
ungodly
that
the
operations
of
nature
are
divine
operations
but
what
man
produces
is
ungodly
but
the
productions
of
human
reason
might
at
least
be
esteemed
as
much
as
nature
in
so
doing
however
we
cede
less
to
reason
than
is
permitted
to
us
if
the
life
and
the
action
of
animals
be
divine
human
action
must
stand
much
higher
and
must
be
worthy
to
be
called
divine
in
an
infinitely
higher
sense
the
preeminence
of
human
thought
must
forthwith
be
avowed
christ
says
on
this
subject
matt
vi
2680
behold
the
fowls
of
the
air
in
which
we
may
also
include
the
ibis
and
the
kokilas
are
ye
not
much
better
than
they
wherefore
if
god
so
clothe
the
grass
of
the
field
which
today
is
and
tomorrow
is
cast
into
the
oven
shall
he
not
much
more
clothe
you
the
superiority
of
man
of
the
image
of
god
to
animals
and
plants
is
indeed
implicitly
and
explicitly
established
but
in
asking
wherein
the
divine
element
is
to
be
sought
and
seenin
making
use
of
such
expressionsnone
of
the
superior
but
only
the
inferior
nature
is
indicated
similarly
in
regard
to
the
knowledge
of
god
it
is
remarkable
that
christ
places
the
knowledge
of
and
faith
in
him
not
in
any
admiration
of
the
creatures
of
nature
nor
in
marvelling
at
any
socalled
dominion
over
them
nor
in
signs
and
wonders
but
in
the
witness
of
the
spirit
spirit
is
infinitely
high
above
nature
in
it
the
divine
nature
manifests
itself
more
than
in
nature
but
the
form
in
which
the
universal
content
which
is
in
and
for
itself
first
belongs
to
philosophy
is
the
form
of
thought
the
form
of
the
universal
itself
in
religion
however
this
content
is
for
immediate
and
outward
perception
and
further
for
idea
and
sensation
through
art
the
import
is
for
the
sensuous
nature
it
is
the
evidence
of
the
mind
which
comprehends
that
content
to
make
this
clearer
the
difference
must
be
recollected
between
that
which
we
are
and
have
and
how
we
know
the
samethat
is
in
what
manner
we
know
it
and
have
it
as
our
object
this
distinction
is
an
infinitely
important
matter
and
it
alone
is
concerned
in
the
culture
of
races
and
of
individuals
we
are
men
and
have
reason
what
is
human
or
above
all
what
is
rational
vibrates
within
us
both
in
our
feelings
mind
and
heart
and
in
our
subjective
nature
generally
it
is
in
this
corresponding
vibration
and
in
the
corresponding
motion
effected
that
a
particular
content
becomes
our
own
and
is
like
our
own
the
manifold
nature
of
the
determinations
which
it
contains
is
concentrated
and
wrapt
up
within
this
inward
naturean
obscure
motion
of
mind
in
itself
and
in
universal
substantiality
the
content
is
thus
directly
identical
with
the
simple
abstract
certainty
of
ourselves
and
with
selfconsciousness
but
mind
because
it
is
mind
is
as
truly
consciousness
what
is
confined
within
itself
in
its
simplicity
must
be
objective
to
itself
and
must
come
to
be
known
the
whole
difference
lies
in
the
manner
and
method
of
this
objectivity
and
hence
in
the
manner
and
method
of
consciousness
this
method
and
manner
extends
from
the
simple
expression
of
the
dulness
of
mere
feeling
to
the
most
objective
form
to
that
which
is
in
and
for
itself
objective
to
thought
the
most
simple
most
formal
objectivity
is
the
expression
of
a
name
for
that
feeling
and
for
the
state
of
mind
according
with
it
as
seen
in
these
words
worship
prayer
etc
such
expressions
as
let
us
pray
and
let
us
worship
are
simply
the
recalling
of
that
feeling
but
let
us
think
about
god
brings
with
it
something
more
it
expresses
the
absolutely
embracing
content
of
that
substantial
feeling
and
the
object
which
differs
from
mere
sensation
as
subjective
selfconscious
activity
or
which
is
content
distinguished
from
this
activity
as
form
this
object
however
comprehending
in
itself
the
whole
substantial
content
is
itself
still
undeveloped
and
entirely
undetermined
to
develop
that
content
to
comprehend
express
and
bring
to
consciousness
its
relations
is
the
commencement
creation
and
manifestation
of
religion
the
form
in
which
this
developed
content
first
possesses
objectivity
is
that
of
immediate
perception
of
sensuous
idea
or
of
a
more
defined
idea
deduced
from
natural
physical
or
mental
manifestations
and
conditions
art
brings
about
this
consciousness
in
that
it
gives
permanence
and
cohesion
to
the
fleeting
visible
appearance
through
which
objectivity
passes
in
sensation
the
shapeless
sacred
stone
the
mere
place
or
whatever
it
is
to
which
the
desire
for
objectivity
first
attaches
itself
receives
from
art
form
feature
determinate
character
and
content
which
can
be
known
and
which
is
now
present
for
consciousness
art
has
thus
become
the
instructress
of
the
people
this
was
the
case
with
homer
and
hesiod
for
instance
who
according
to
herodotus
ii
53
made
the
greeks
their
theogony
because
they
elevated
and
consolidated
ideas
and
traditions
in
unison
with
the
spirit
of
the
people
wherever
and
in
whatever
confusion
they
might
be
found
into
definite
images
and
ideas
this
is
not
the
art
which
merely
gives
expression
in
its
own
way
to
the
content
already
perfectly
expressed
of
a
religion
which
in
thought
idea
and
words
has
already
attained
complete
development
that
is
to
say
which
puts
its
matter
into
stone
canvas
or
words
as
is
done
by
modern
art
which
in
dealing
either
with
religious
or
with
historical
objects
takes
as
its
groundwork
ideas
and
thoughts
which
are
already
there
the
consciousness
of
this
religion
is
rather
the
product
of
thinking
imagination
or
of
thought
which
comprehends
through
the
organ
of
imagination
alone
and
finds
expression
in
its
forms
if
the
infinite
thought
the
absolute
mind
has
revealed
and
does
reveal
itself
in
true
religion
that
in
which
it
reveals
itself
is
the
heart
the
representing
consciousness
and
the
understanding
of
what
is
finite
religion
is
not
merely
directed
to
every
sort
of
culture
to
the
poor
is
the
gospel
preached
but
it
must
as
being
religion
expressly
directed
towards
heart
and
mind
enter
into
the
sphere
of
subjectivity
and
consequently
into
the
region
of
finite
methods
of
representation
in
the
perceiving
and
with
reference
to
perceptions
reflecting
consciousness
man
possesses
for
the
speculative
relations
belonging
to
the
absolute
only
finite
relations
whether
taken
in
an
exact
or
in
a
symbolical
sense
to
serve
him
to
comprehend
and
express
those
qualities
and
relationships
of
the
infinite
in
religion
as
the
earliest
and
the
immediate
revelations
of
god
the
form
of
representation
and
of
reflecting
finite
thought
cannot
be
the
only
form
in
which
he
gives
existence
to
himself
in
consciousness
but
it
must
also
appear
in
this
form
for
such
alone
is
comprehensible
to
religious
consciousness
to
make
this
clearer
something
must
be
said
as
to
what
is
the
meaning
of
comprehension
on
the
one
hand
as
has
been
remarked
above
there
is
in
it
the
substantial
basis
of
content
which
coming
to
mind
as
its
absolute
being
affects
it
in
its
innermost
finds
an
answering
chord
and
thereby
obtains
from
it
confirmation
this
is
the
first
absolute
condition
necessary
to
comprehension
what
is
not
implicitly
there
cannot
come
within
it
or
be
for
itthat
is
a
content
which
is
infinite
and
eternal
for
the
substantial
as
infinite
is
just
that
which
has
no
limitations
in
that
to
which
it
is
related
for
else
it
would
be
limited
and
not
the
true
substantial
and
mind
is
that
alone
which
is
not
implicit
which
is
finite
and
external
for
what
is
finite
and
external
is
no
longer
what
is
implicit
but
what
is
for
another
what
has
entered
into
a
relation
but
on
the
other
hand
because
the
true
and
eternal
must
be
for
mind
become
known
that
is
enter
into
finite
consciousness
the
mind
for
which
it
is
is
finite
and
the
manner
of
its
consciousness
consists
in
the
ideas
and
forms
of
finite
things
and
relations
these
forms
are
familiar
and
well
known
to
consciousness
the
ordinary
mode
of
finality
which
mode
it
has
appropriated
to
itself
having
constituted
it
the
universal
medium
of
its
representation
into
which
everything
that
comes
to
consciousness
must
be
resolved
in
order
that
it
may
have
and
know
itself
therein
the
assertion
of
religion
is
that
the
manifestation
of
truth
which
is
revealed
to
us
through
it
is
one
which
is
given
to
man
from
outside
and
on
this
account
it
is
also
asserted
that
man
has
humbly
to
assent
to
it
because
human
reason
cannot
attain
to
it
by
itself
the
assertion
of
positive
religion
is
that
its
truths
exist
without
having
their
source
known
so
that
the
content
as
given
is
one
which
is
above
and
beyond
reason
by
means
of
some
prophet
or
other
divine
instrument
the
truth
is
made
known
just
as
ceres
and
triptolemus
who
introduced
agriculture
and
matrimony
for
so
doing
were
honoured
by
the
greeks
men
have
rendered
thanks
to
moses
and
to
mahomed
through
whatever
individual
the
truth
may
have
been
given
the
external
matter
is
historical
and
this
is
indifferent
to
the
absolute
content
and
to
itself
since
the
person
is
not
the
import
of
the
doctrine
but
the
christian
religion
has
this
characteristic
that
the
person
of
christ
in
his
character
of
the
son
of
god
himself
partakes
of
the
nature
of
god
if
christ
be
for
christians
only
a
teacher
like
pythagoras
socrates
or
columbus
there
would
be
here
no
universal
divine
content
no
revelation
or
knowledge
imparted
about
the
nature
of
god
and
it
is
regarding
this
alone
that
we
desire
to
obtain
knowledge
whatever
stage
it
may
itself
have
reached
the
truth
must
undoubtedly
in
the
first
place
come
to
men
from
without
as
a
present
object
sensuously
represented
just
as
moses
saw
god
in
the
fiery
bush
and
as
the
greek
brought
the
god
into
conscious
being
by
means
of
sculpture
or
other
representations
but
there
is
the
further
fact
that
neither
in
religion
nor
in
philosophy
does
this
external
form
remain
nor
can
it
so
remain
a
form
of
the
imagination
or
an
historical
form
such
as
christ
must
for
the
spirit
be
spiritual
and
thus
it
ceases
to
be
an
external
matter
seeing
that
the
form
of
externality
is
dead
we
must
know
god
in
spirit
and
in
truth
he
is
the
absolute
and
actual
spirit
the
relation
borne
by
the
human
spirit
to
this
spirit
involves
the
following
considerations
when
man
determines
to
adopt
a
religion
he
asks
himself
what
is
the
ground
of
my
faith
the
christian
religion
repliesthe
spirits
witness
to
its
content
christ
reproved
the
pharisees
for
wishing
to
see
miracles
the
spirit
alone
comprehends
spirit
the
miracle
is
only
a
presentiment
of
that
spirit
and
if
the
miracle
be
the
suspension
of
natural
laws
spirit
itself
is
the
real
miracle
in
the
operations
of
nature
spirit
in
itself
is
merely
this
comprehension
of
itself
there
is
only
one
spirit
the
universal
divine
spirit
not
that
it
is
merely
everywhere
it
is
not
to
be
comprehended
as
what
is
common
to
everything
as
an
external
totality
to
be
found
in
many
or
in
all
individuals
which
are
essentially
individuals
but
it
must
be
understood
as
that
which
permeates
through
everything
as
the
unity
of
itself
and
of
a
semblance
of
its
other
as
of
the
subjective
and
particular
as
universal
it
is
object
to
itself
and
thus
determined
as
a
particular
it
is
this
individual
but
as
universal
it
reaches
over
this
its
other
so
that
its
other
and
itself
are
comprised
in
one
the
true
universality
seems
popularly
expressed
to
be
twowhat
is
common
to
the
universal
itself
and
to
the
particular
a
division
is
formed
in
the
understanding
of
itself
and
the
spirit
is
the
unity
of
what
is
understood
and
the
understanding
person
the
divine
spirit
which
is
comprehended
is
objective
the
subjective
spirit
comprehends
but
spirit
is
not
passive
or
else
the
passivity
can
be
momentary
only
there
is
one
spiritual
substantial
unity
the
subjective
spirit
is
the
active
but
the
objective
spirit
is
itself
this
activity
the
active
subjective
spirit
is
that
which
comprehends
the
divine
and
in
its
comprehension
of
it
it
is
itself
the
divine
spirit
the
relation
of
spirit
to
self
alone
is
the
absolute
determination
the
divine
spirit
lives
in
its
own
communion
and
presence
this
comprehension
has
been
called
faith
but
it
is
not
an
historical
faith
we
lutheransi
am
a
lutheran
and
will
remain
the
samehave
only
this
original
faith
this
unity
is
not
the
substance
of
spinoza
but
the
apprehending
substance
in
selfconsciousness
which
makes
itself
eternal
and
relates
to
universality
the
talk
about
the
limitations
of
human
thought
is
futile
to
know
god
is
the
only
end
of
religion
the
testimony
of
the
spirit
to
the
content
of
religion
is
itself
religion
it
is
a
testimony
that
both
bears
witness
and
at
the
same
time
is
that
witness
the
spirit
proves
itself
and
does
so
first
in
the
proof
it
is
only
proved
because
it
proves
itself
and
shows
or
manifests
itself
it
has
further
to
be
said
that
this
testimony
this
inward
stirring
and
selfconsciousness
reveals
itself
while
in
the
enshrouded
consciousness
of
devotion
it
does
not
arrive
at
the
proper
consciousness
of
an
object
but
only
at
the
consciousness
of
immersion
in
absolute
being
this
permeating
and
permeated
spirit
now
enters
into
conception
god
goes
forth
into
the
other
and
makes
himself
objective
all
that
pertains
to
revelation
and
its
reception
and
which
comes
before
us
in
mythology
here
appears
everything
which
is
historical
and
which
belongs
to
what
is
positive
has
here
its
proper
place
to
speak
more
definitely
we
now
have
the
christ
who
came
into
the
world
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
but
he
says
i
am
with
you
even
unto
the
ends
of
the
earth
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
will
i
be
in
the
midst
i
shall
not
be
seen
of
you
in
the
flesh
but
the
spirit
of
truth
will
guide
you
into
all
truth
the
external
is
not
the
true
relation
it
will
disappear
the
two
stages
have
here
been
given
the
first
of
which
is
the
stage
of
devotion
of
worship
such
as
that
reached
in
partaking
of
the
communion
that
is
the
perception
of
the
divine
spirit
in
the
community
in
which
the
present
indwelling
living
christ
as
selfconsciousness
has
attained
to
actuality
the
second
stage
is
that
of
developed
consciousness
when
the
content
becomes
the
object
here
this
present
indwelling
christ
retreats
two
thousand
years
to
a
small
corner
of
palestine
and
is
an
individual
historically
manifested
far
away
at
nazareth
or
jerusalem
it
is
the
same
thing
in
the
greek
religion
where
the
god
present
in
devotion
changes
into
prosaic
statues
and
marble
or
in
painting
where
this
externality
is
likewise
arrived
at
when
the
god
becomes
mere
canvas
or
wood
the
supper
is
according
to
the
lutheran
conception
of
faith
alone
it
is
a
divine
satisfaction
and
is
not
adored
as
if
it
were
the
host
thus
a
sacred
image
is
no
more
to
us
than
is
a
stone
or
thing
the
second
point
of
view
must
indeed
be
that
with
which
consciousness
begins
it
must
start
from
the
external
comprehension
of
this
form
it
must
passively
accept
report
and
take
it
up
into
memory
but
if
it
remain
where
it
is
that
is
the
unspiritual
point
of
view
to
remain
fixed
in
this
second
standpoint
in
this
dead
faraway
historic
distance
is
to
reject
the
spirit
the
sins
of
him
who
lies
against
the
holy
ghost
cannot
be
forgiven
that
lie
is
the
refusal
to
be
a
universal
to
be
holy
that
is
to
make
christ
become
divided
separated
to
make
him
only
another
person
as
this
particular
person
in
judea
or
else
to
say
that
he
now
exists
but
only
far
away
in
heaven
or
in
some
other
place
and
not
in
present
actual
form
amongst
his
people
the
man
who
speaks
of
the
merely
finite
of
merely
human
reason
and
of
the
limits
to
mere
reason
lies
against
the
spirit
for
the
spirit
as
infinite
and
universal
as
selfcomprehension
comprehends
itself
not
in
a
merely
nor
in
limits
nor
in
the
finite
as
such
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
for
it
comprehends
itself
within
itself
alone
in
its
infinitude
if
it
be
said
of
philosophy
that
it
makes
reality
the
subject
of
its
knowledge
the
principal
point
is
that
the
reality
should
not
be
one
outside
of
that
of
which
it
is
the
reality
for
example
if
from
the
real
content
of
a
book
i
abstract
the
binding
paper
ink
language
the
many
thousand
letters
that
are
contained
in
it
the
simple
universal
content
as
reality
is
not
outside
of
the
book
similarly
law
is
not
outside
of
the
individual
but
it
constitutes
the
true
being
of
the
individual
the
reality
of
my
mind
is
thus
in
my
mind
itself
and
not
outside
of
it
it
is
my
real
being
my
own
substance
without
which
i
am
without
existence
this
reality
is
so
to
speak
the
combustible
material
which
may
be
kindled
and
lit
up
by
the
universal
reality
as
such
as
objective
and
only
so
far
as
this
phosphorus
is
in
men
is
comprehension
the
kindling
and
lighting
up
possible
feeling
anticipation
knowledge
of
god
are
only
thus
in
men
without
such
the
divine
mind
would
not
be
the
in
and
for
itself
universal
reality
is
itself
a
real
content
and
not
the
destitute
of
content
and
undetermined
yet
as
the
book
has
other
content
besides
there
is
in
the
individual
mind
also
a
great
amount
of
other
matter
which
belongs
only
to
the
manifestation
of
this
reality
and
the
individual
surrounded
with
what
is
external
must
be
separated
from
this
existence
since
reality
is
itself
spirit
and
not
an
abstraction
god
is
not
a
god
for
the
dead
but
for
the
living
and
indeed
for
living
spirits
the
great
creator
was
alone
and
experienced
desire
therefore
he
created
spirits
holy
mirrors
of
his
holiness
the
noblest
being
he
found
no
equal
from
out
the
bowl
of
all
the
spiritual
world
there
sparkled
up
to
him
infinitude
religion
is
also
the
point
of
view
from
which
this
existence
is
known
but
as
regards
the
different
forms
of
knowledge
existing
in
religion
and
philosophy
philosophy
appears
to
be
opposed
to
the
conception
in
religion
that
the
universal
mind
first
shows
itself
as
external
in
the
objective
mode
of
consciousness
worship
commencing
with
the
external
then
turns
against
and
abrogates
it
as
has
just
been
said
and
thus
philosophy
is
justified
through
the
acts
and
forms
of
worship
and
only
does
what
they
do
philosophy
has
to
deal
with
two
different
objects
first
as
in
the
religion
present
in
worship
with
the
substantial
content
the
spiritual
soul
and
secondly
with
bringing
this
before
consciousness
as
object
but
in
the
form
of
thought
philosophy
thinks
and
conceives
of
that
which
religion
represents
as
the
object
of
consciousness
whether
it
is
as
the
work
of
the
imagination
or
as
existent
facts
in
history
the
form
of
the
knowledge
of
the
object
is
in
religious
consciousness
such
as
pertains
to
the
ordinary
idea
and
is
thus
more
or
less
sensuous
in
nature
in
philosophy
we
do
not
say
that
god
begot
a
son
which
is
a
relation
derived
from
natural
life
thought
or
the
substance
of
such
a
relation
is
therefore
still
recognized
in
philosophy
since
philosophy
thinks
its
object
it
has
the
advantage
of
uniting
the
two
stages
of
religious
consciousnesswhich
in
religion
are
different
momentsinto
one
unity
in
philosophic
thought
it
is
these
two
forms
which
are
different
from
one
another
and
which
as
opposed
may
therefore
seem
to
be
mutually
conflicting
and
it
is
natural
and
it
necessarily
seems
to
be
the
case
that
on
first
definitely
coming
to
view
they
are
so
to
speak
conscious
of
their
diversity
and
hence
at
first
appear
as
inimical
to
one
another
the
first
stage
in
the
order
of
manifestation
is
definite
existence
or
a
determinate
beingforself
as
opposed
to
the
other
the
later
form
is
that
thought
embraces
itself
in
the
concrete
immerses
itself
in
itself
and
mind
as
such
comes
in
it
to
consciousness
in
the
earlier
stage
mind
is
abstract
and
in
this
constraint
it
knows
itself
to
be
different
and
in
opposition
to
the
other
when
it
embraces
itself
in
the
concrete
it
is
no
more
simply
confined
in
determinate
existence
only
knowing
or
possessing
itself
in
that
diversity
but
it
is
the
universal
which
inasmuch
as
it
determines
itself
contains
its
other
within
itself
as
concrete
intelligence
mind
thus
comprehends
the
substantial
in
the
form
which
seemed
to
differ
from
it
of
which
it
had
only
grasped
the
outward
manifestation
and
had
turned
away
from
it
it
recognizes
itself
in
its
inward
content
and
so
it
for
the
first
time
grasps
its
object
and
deals
justice
to
its
opposite
generally
speaking
the
course
of
this
antithesis
in
history
is
that
thought
first
of
all
comes
forth
within
religion
as
not
free
and
in
separate
manifestations
secondly
it
strengthens
itself
feels
itself
to
be
resting
upon
itself
holds
and
conducts
itself
inimically
towards
the
other
form
and
does
not
recognize
itself
therein
in
the
third
place
it
concludes
by
acknowledging
itself
as
in
this
other
or
else
philosophy
has
to
begin
with
carrying
on
its
work
entirely
on
its
own
account
isolating
thought
from
all
popular
beliefs
and
taking
for
itself
quite
a
different
field
of
operation
a
field
for
which
the
world
of
ordinary
ideas
lies
quite
apart
so
that
the
two
exist
peacefully
side
by
side
or
to
put
it
better
so
that
no
reflection
on
their
opposition
is
arrived
at
just
as
little
did
the
thought
of
reconciling
them
occur
since
in
the
popular
beliefs
the
same
content
appeared
as
in
any
external
form
other
than
the
notionthe
thought
that
is
of
explaining
and
justifying
popular
belief
in
order
thus
to
be
able
again
to
express
the
conceptions
of
free
thought
in
the
form
of
popular
religion
thus
we
see
philosophy
first
restrained
and
confined
within
the
range
of
the
greek
heathen
world
then
resting
upon
itself
it
goes
forth
against
popular
religion
and
takes
up
an
unfriendly
attitude
to
it
until
it
grasps
that
religion
in
its
innermost
and
recognizes
itself
therein
thus
the
ancient
greek
philosophers
generally
respected
the
popular
religion
or
at
least
they
did
not
oppose
it
or
reflect
upon
it
those
coming
later
including
even
xenophanes
handled
popular
ideas
most
severely
and
thus
many
socalled
atheists
made
their
appearance
but
as
the
spheres
of
popular
conception
and
abstract
thought
stood
peacefully
side
by
side
we
also
find
greek
philosophers
of
even
a
later
period
in
development
in
whose
case
speculative
thought
and
the
act
of
worship
as
also
the
pious
invocation
upon
and
sacrifice
to
the
gods
coexist
in
good
faith
and
not
in
mere
hypocrisy
socrates
was
accused
of
teaching
other
gods
than
those
belonging
to
the
popular
religion
his

was
indeed
opposed
to
the
principles
of
greek
morals
and
religion
but
at
the
same
time
he
followed
quite
honestly
the
usages
of
his
religion
and
we
know
besides
that
his
last
request
was
to
ask
his
friends
to
offer
a
cock
to
sculapiusa
desire
quite
inconsistent
with
his
conclusions
regarding
the
existence
of
god
and
above
all
regarding
morality
plato
declaimed
against
the
poets
and
their
gods
it
was
in
a
much
later
time
that
the
neoplatonists
first
recognized
in
the
popular
mythology
rejected
earlier
by
the
philosophers
the
universal
content
they
transposed
and
translated
it
into
what
is
significant
for
thought
and
thus
used
mythology
itself
as
a
symbolical
imagery
for
giving
expression
to
their
formulas
similarly
do
we
see
in
the
christian
religion
thought
which
is
not
independent
first
placing
itself
in
conjunction
with
the
form
belonging
to
this
religion
and
acting
within
itthat
is
to
say
taking
the
religion
as
its
groundwork
and
proceeding
from
the
absolute
assumption
of
the
christian
doctrine
we
see
later
on
the
opposition
between
socalled
faith
and
socalled
reason
when
the
wings
of
thought
have
become
strengthened
the
young
eaglet
flies
away
for
himself
to
the
sun
of
truth
but
like
a
bird
of
prey
he
turns
upon
religion
and
combats
it
latest
of
all
philosophy
permits
full
justice
to
be
done
to
the
content
of
religion
through
the
speculative
notion
which
is
through
thought
itself
for
this
end
the
notion
must
have
grasped
itself
in
the
concrete
and
penetrated
to
concrete
spirituality
this
must
be
the
standpoint
of
the
philosophy
of
the
present
time
it
has
begun
within
christianity
and
can
have
no
other
content
than
the
worldspirit
when
that
spirit
comprehends
itself
in
philosophy
it
also
comprehends
itself
in
that
form
which
formerly
was
inimical
to
philosophy
thus
religion
has
a
content
in
common
with
philosophy
the
forms
alone
being
different
and
the
only
essential
point
is
that
the
form
of
the
notion
should
be
so
far
perfected
as
to
be
able
to
grasp
the
content
of
religion
the
truth
is
just
that
which
has
been
called
the
mysteries
of
religion
these
constitute
the
speculative
element
in
religion
such
as
were
called
by
the
neoplatonists


being
initiated
or
being
occupied
with
speculative
notions
by
mysteries
is
meant
superficially
speaking
the
secret
what
remains
such
and
does
not
arrive
at
being
known
but
in
the
eleusinian
mysteries
there
was
nothing
unknown
all
athenians
were
initiated
into
them
socrates
alone
shut
himself
out
openly
to
make
them
known
to
strangers
was
the
one
thing
forbidden
as
indeed
it
was
made
a
crime
in
the
case
of
certain
people
such
matters
however
as
being
holy
were
not
to
be
spoken
of
herodotus
often
expressly
says
eg
ii
4547
that
he
would
speak
of
the
egyptian
divinities
and
mysteries
in
as
far
as
it
was
pious
so
to
do
he
knew
more
but
it
would
be
impious
to
speak
of
them
in
the
christian
religion
dogmas
are
called
mysteries
they
are
that
which
man
knows
about
the
nature
of
god
neither
is
there
anything
mysterious
in
this
it
is
known
by
all
those
who
are
partakers
in
that
religion
and
these
are
thus
distinguished
from
the
followers
of
other
religions
hence
mystery
here
signifies
nothing
unknown
since
all
christians
are
in
the
secret
mysteries
are
in
their
nature
speculative
mysterious
certainly
to
the
understanding
but
not
to
reason
they
are
rational
just
in
the
sense
of
being
speculative
the
understanding
does
not
comprehend
the
speculative
which
simply
is
the
concrete
because
it
holds
to
the
differences
in
their
separation
their
contradiction
is
indeed
contained
in
the
mystery
which
however
is
likewise
the
resolution
of
the
same
philosophy
on
the
contrary
is
opposed
to
the
socalled
rationalism
of
the
new
theology
which
for
ever
keeps
reason
on
its
lips
but
which
is
dry
understanding
only
no
reason
is
recognizable
in
it
as
the
moment
of
independent
thought
which
really
is
abstract
thought
and
that
alone
when
the
understanding
which
does
not
comprehend
the
truths
of
religion
calls
itself
the
illuminating
reason
and
plays
the
lord
and
master
it
goes
astray
rationalism
is
opposed
to
philosophy
in
content
and
form
for
it
has
made
the
content
empty
as
it
has
made
the
heavens
and
has
reduced
all
that
is
to
finite
relationsin
its
form
it
is
a
reasoning
process
which
is
not
free
and
which
has
no
conceiving
power
the
supernatural
in
religion
is
opposed
to
rationalism
and
if
indeed
the
latter
is
related
in
respect
of
the
real
content
to
philosophy
yet
it
differs
from
it
in
form
for
it
has
become
unspiritual
and
wooden
looking
for
its
justification
to
mere
external
authority
the
scholastics
were
not
supernaturalists
in
this
sense
they
knew
the
dogmas
of
the
church
in
thought
and
in
conception
if
religion
in
the
inflexibility
of
its
abstract
authority
as
opposed
to
thought
declares
of
it
that
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
triumph
over
it
the
gates
of
reason
are
stronger
than
the
gates
of
hell
not
to
overcome
the
church
but
to
reconcile
itself
to
the
church
philosophy
as
the
conceiving
thought
of
this
content
has
as
regards
the
idea
of
religion
the
advantage
of
comprehending
both
sidesit
comprehends
religion
and
also
comprehends
both
rationalism
and
supernaturalism
and
itself
likewise
but
this
is
not
the
case
on
the
other
side
religion
from
the
standpoint
of
idea
comprehends
only
what
stands
on
the
same
platform
as
itself
and
not
philosophy
the
notion
the
universal
thought
determinations
often
no
injustice
is
done
to
a
philosophy
when
its
opposition
to
religion
has
been
made
matter
of
reproach
but
often
too
a
wrong
has
been
inflicted
where
this
is
done
from
the
religious
point
of
view
the
form
of
religion
is
necessary
to
mind
as
it
is
in
and
for
itself
it
is
the
form
of
truth
as
it
is
for
all
men
and
for
every
mode
of
consciousness
this
universal
mode
is
first
of
all
for
men
in
the
form
of
sensuous
consciousness
and
then
secondly
in
the
intermingling
of
the
form
of
the
universal
with
sensuous
manifestation
or
reflectionthe
representing
consciousness
the
mythical
positive
and
historical
form
is
that
pertaining
to
the
understanding
what
is
received
in
evidence
of
mind
only
becomes
object
to
consciousness
when
it
appears
in
the
form
of
the
understanding
that
is
to
say
consciousness
must
first
be
already
acquainted
with
these
forms
from
life
and
from
experience
now
because
thinking
consciousness
is
not
the
outward
universal
form
for
all
mankind
the
consciousness
of
the
true
the
spiritual
and
the
rational
must
have
the
form
of
religion
and
this
is
the
universal
justification
of
this
form
we
have
here
laid
down
the
distinction
between
philosophy
and
religion
but
taking
into
account
what
it
is
we
wish
to
deal
with
in
the
history
of
philosophy
there
is
something
still
which
must
be
remarked
upon
and
which
partly
follows
from
what
has
been
already
said
there
is
the
question
still
confronting
us
as
to
what
attitude
we
must
take
in
reference
to
this
matter
in
the
history
of
philosophy

the
religious
element
to
be
excluded
from
the
content
of
the
history
of
philosophy

mythology
first
meets
us
and
it
seems
as
if
it
might
be
drawn
within
the
history
of
philosophy
it
is
indeed
a
product
of
the
imagination
but
not
of
caprice
although
that
also
has
its
place
here
but
the
main
part
of
mythology
is
the
work
of
the
imaginative
reason
which
makes
reality
its
object
but
yet
has
no
other
means
of
so
doing
than
that
of
sensuous
representation
so
that
the
gods
make
their
appearance
in
human
guise
mythology
can
now
be
studied
for
art
c
but
the
thinking
mind
must
seek
out
the
substantial
content
the
thought
and
the
theory
implicitly
contained
therein
as
reason
is
sought
in
nature
this
mode
of
treating
mythology
was
that
of
the
neoplatonists
in
recent
times
it
has
for
the
most
part
become
the
work
of
my
friend
creuzer
in

method
of

and
condemned

man
it
is
said
must
set
to
work
historically
alone
and
it
is
not
historic
when
a
theory
unthought
of
by
the
ancients
is
read
into
a
myth
or
brought
out
of
it
in
one
light
this
is
quite
correct
for
it
points
to
a
method
adopted
by
creuzer
and
also
by
the
alexandrians
who
acted
in
a
similar
way
in
conscious
thought
the
ancients
had
not
such
theories
before
them
nor
did
anyone
maintain
them
yet
to
say
that
such
content
was
not
implicitly
present
is
an
absurd
contention
as
the
products
of
reason
though
not
of
thinking
reason
the
religions
of
the
people
as
also
the
mythologies
however
simple
and
even
foolish
they
may
appear
indubitably
contain
as
genuine
works
of
art
thoughts
universal
determinations
and
truth
for
the
instinct
of
reason
is
at
their
basis
bound
up
with
this
is
the
fact
that
since
mythology
in
its
expression
takes
sensuous
forms
much
that
is
contingent
and
external
becomes
intermingled
for
the
representation
of
the
notion
in
sensuous
forms
always
possesses
a
certain
incongruity
seeing
that
what
is
founded
on
imagination
cannot
express
the
idea
in
its
real
aspect
this
sensuous
form
produced
as
it
is
by
an
historic
or
natural
method
must
be
determined
on
many
sides
and
this
external
determination
must
more
or
less
be
of
such
a
nature
as
not
to
express
the
idea
it
may
also
be
that
many
errors
are
contained
in
that
explanation
particularly
when
a
single
one
is
brought
within
our
notice
all
the
customs
actions
furnishings
vestments
and
offerings
taken
together
may
undoubtedly
contain
something
of
the
idea
in
analogy
but
the
connection
is
far
removed
and
many
contingent
circumstances
must
find
their
entrance
but
that
there
is
a
reason
there
must
certainly
be
recognized
and
it
is
essential
so
to
comprehend
and
grasp
mythology
but
mythology
must
remain
excluded
from
our
history
of
philosophy
the
reason
of
this
is
found
in
the
fact
that
in
philosophy
we
have
to
do
not
with
theorems
generally
or
with
thoughts
which
only
are
implicite
contained
in
some
particular
form
or
other
but
with
thoughts
which
are
explicit
and
only
in
so
far
as
they
are
explicit
and
in
so
far
as
a
content
such
as
that
belonging
to
religion
has
come
to
consciousness
in
the
form
of
thought
and
this
is
just
what
forms
the
immense
distinction
which
we
saw
above
between
capacity
and
actuality
the
theorems
which
are
implicite
contained
within
religion
do
not
concern
us
they
must
be
in
the
form
of
thoughts
since
thought
alone
is
the
absolute
form
of
the
idea
in
many
mythologies
images
are
certainly
used
along
with
their
significance
or
else
the
images
are
closely
attended
by
their
interpretation

zoroaster

up

the
light

likewise

the

the

raised

it
is
not
the

ormuzd

ahriman
by
establishing
peace
and
leaving
each
to
remain
as
it
was
it
does
not
partake
of
good
and
evil
both
like
an
unblest
middle
thing
but
it
stands
on
the
side
of
ormuzd
and
strives
with
him
against
the
evil
ahriman
is
sometimes
called
the
firstborn
son
of
the
light
but
ormuzd
only
remained
within
the
light
at
the
creation
of
the
visible
world
ormuzd
places
on
the
earth
in
his
incomprehensible
kingdom
of
light
the
firm
arches
of
the
heavens
which
are
above
yet
surrounded
on
every
side
with
the
first
original
light
midway
to
the
earth
is
the
high
hill
albordi
which
reaches
into
the
source
of
light
ormuzds
empire
of
light
extended
uninterruptedly
over
the
firm
vault
of
the
heavens
and
the
hill
albordi
and
over
the
earth
too
until
the
third
age
was
reached
then
ahriman
whose
kingdom
of
night
was
formerly
bound
beneath
the
earth
broke
in
upon
ormuzds
corporeal
world
and
ruled
in
common
with
him
now
the
space
between
heaven
and
earth
was
divided
into
light
and
night
as
ormuzd
had
formerly
only
a
spiritual
kingdom
of
light
ahriman
had
only
one
of
night
but
now
that
they
were
intermingled
he
placed
the
terrestrial
light
thus
created
in
opposition
to
the
terrestrial
night
from
this
time
on
two
corporeal
worlds
stand
opposed
one
pure
and
good
and
one
impure
and
evil
and
this
opposition
permeates
all
nature
on
albordi
ormuzd
created
mithra
as
mediator
for
the
earth
the
end
of
the
creation
of
the
bodily
world
is
none
other
than
to
reinstate
existence
fallen
from
its
creator
to
make
it
good
again
and
thus
to
make
the
evil
disappear
for
ever
the
bodily
world
is
the
battleground
between
good
and
evil
but
the
battle
between
light
and
darkness
is
not
in
itself
an
absolute
and
irreconcilable
opposition
but
one
which
can
be
conquered
and
in
it
ormuzd
the
principle
of
light
will
be
the
conqueror
i
would
remark
of
this
that
when
we
consider
the
elements
in
these
ideas
which
bear
some
further
connection
with
philosophy
the
universal
of
that
duality
with
which
the
notion
is
necessarily
set
forth
can
alone
be
interesting
and
noteworthy
to
us
for
in
it
the
notion
is
just
the
immediate
opposite
of
itself
the
unity
of
itself
with
itself
in
the
other
a
simple
existence
in
which
absolute
opposition
appears
as
the
opposition
of
existence
and
the
sublation
of
that
opposition
because
properly
the
light
principle
is
the
only
existence
of
both
and
the
principle
of
darkness
is
the
null
and
voidthe
principle
of
light
identifies
itself
with
mithra
which
was
before
called
the
highest
existence
the
opposition
has
laid
aside
the
appearance
of
contingency
but
the
spiritual
principle
is
not
separate
from
the
physical
because
the
good
and
evil
are
both
determined
as
light
and
darkness
we
thus
here
see
thought
breaking
forth
from
actuality
and
yet
not
such
a
separation
as
only
takes
place
in
religion
when
the
supersensuous
is
itself
again
represented
in
a
manner
sensuous
notionless
and
dispersed
for
the
whole
of
what
is
dispersed
in
sensuous
form
is
gathered
together
in
the
one
single
opposition
and
activity
is
thus
simply
represented
these
determinations
lie
much
nearer
to
thought
they
are
not
mere
images
or
symbols
but
yet
these
myths
do
not
concern
philosophy
in
them
thought
does
not
take
the
first
place
for
the
mythform

predominant
in
all
religions
this
oscillation
between
form
and
thought
is
found
and
such
a
combination
still
lies
outside

the
principles
of

in
chaos

which
the

exist
undeveloped
and
confused
and
in
a
spirit
of
air

latter
permeated
the
chaos

with
it
engendered
a
slimy

contained
within
it

seemed
to
him
to
be
insufficiently
populated

compelled
another
god
to
lay

upon
himself

from
his
blood

men

more
kinds

uncultivated
life

called

joined
them
into
a
state
taught
them
arts
and
sciences
and
in
a
word
brought

about

what
belongs
to
mythology
may
in
the
second
place
make
a
pretence
of
being
a
kind
of
philosophy
it
has
produced
philosophers
who
availed
themselves
of
the
mythical
form
in
order
to
bring
their
theories
and
systems
more
prominently
before
the
imagination
for
they
made
the
thoughts
the
content
of
the
myth
but
the
myth
is
not
a
mere
cloak
in
the
ancient
myths
it
is
not
merely
that
the
thoughts
were
there
and
were
concealed
this
may
happen
in
our
reflecting
times
but
the
first
poetry
does
not
start
from
a
separation
of
prose
and
poetry
if
philosophers
used
myths
it
was
usually
the
case
that
they
had
the
thoughts
and
then
sought
for
images
appropriate
to
them
plato
has
many
beautiful
myths
of
this
kind
others
likewise
have
spoken
in
myths
as
for
example
jacobi
whose
philosophy
took
the
form
of
the
christian
religion
through
which
he
gave
utterance
to
matter
of
a
highly
speculative
nature
but
this
form
is
not
suitable
to
philosophy
thought
which
has
itself
as
object
must
have
raised
itself
to
its
own
form
to
the
form
of
thought
plato
is
often
esteemed
on
account
of
his
myths
he
is
supposed
to
have
evinced
by
their
means
greater
genius
than
other
philosophers
were
capable
of
it
is
contended
here
that
the
myths
of
plato
are
superior
to
the
abstract
form
of
expression
and
platos
method
of
representation
is
certainly
a
wonderful
one
on
closer
examination
we
find
that
it
is
partly
the
impossibility
of
expressing
himself
after
the
manner
of
pure
thought
that
makes
plato
put
his
meaning
so
and
also
such
methods
of
expression
are
only
used
by
him
in
introducing
a
subject
when
he
comes
to
the
matter
in
point
plato
expresses
himself
otherwise
as
we
see
in
the
parmenides
where
simple
thought
determinations
are
used
without
imagery
externally
these
myths
may
certainly
serve
when
the
heights
of
speculative
thought
are
left
behind
in
order
to
present
the
matter
in
an
easier
form
but
the
real
value
of
plato
does
not
rest
in
his
myths
if
thought
once
attains
power
sufficient
to
give
existence
to
itself
within
itself
and
in
its
element
the
myth
becomes
a
superfluous
adornment
by
which
philosophy
is
not
advanced
men
often
lay
hold
of
nothing
but
these
myths
hence
aristotle
has
been
misunderstood
just
because
he
intersperses
similes
here
and
there
the
simile
can
never
be
entirely
in
accord
with
thought
for
it
always
carries
with
it
something
more
the
difficulty
of
representing
thoughts
as
thoughts
always
attaches
to
the
expedient
of
expression
in
sensuous
form
thought
too
ought
not
to
be
concealed
by
means
of
the
myth
for
the
object
of
the
mythical
is
just
to
give
expression
to
and
to
reveal
thought
the
symbol
is
undoubtedly
insufficient
for
this
expression
thought
concealed
in
symbols
is
not
yet
possessed
for
thought
is
selfrevealing
and
hence
the
myth
does
not
form
a
medium
adequate
for
its
conveyance
aristotle

says
it
is
not
worth
while
to
treat
seriously
of
those
whose
philosophy
takes
a
mythical
form
such
is
not
the
form
in
which
thought
allows
itself
to
be
stated
but
only
is
a
subordinate
mode
connected
with
this
there
is
a
similar
method
of
representing
the
universal
content
by
means
of
numbers
lines
and
geometric
figures
these
are
figurative
but
not
concretely
so
as
in
the
case
of
myths
thus
it
may
be
said
that
eternity
is
a
circle
the
snake
that
bites
its
own
tail
this
is
only
an
image
but
mind
does
not
require
such
a
symbol
there
are
people
who
value
such
methods
of
representation
but
these
forms
do
not
go
far
the
most
abstract
determinations
can
indeed
be
thus
expressed
but
any
further
progress
brings
about
confusion
just
as
the
freemasons
have
symbols
which
are
esteemed
for
their
depth
of
wisdomdepth
as
a
brook
is
deep
when
one
cannot
see
the
bottomthat
which
is
hidden
very
easily
seems
to
men
deep
or
as
if
depth
were
concealed
beneath
but
when
it
is
hidden
it
may
possibly
prove
to
be
the
case
that
there
is
nothing
behind
this
is
so
in
freemasonry
in
which
everything
is
concealed
to
those
outside
and
also
to
many
people
within
and
where
nothing
remarkable
is
possessed
in
learning
or
in
science
and
least
of
all
in
philosophy
thought
is
on
the
contrary
simply
its
manifestation
clearness
is
its
nature
and
itself
the
act
of
manifestation
is
not
a
condition
which
may
be
or
may
not
be
equally
so
that
thought
may
remain
as
thought
when
it
is
not
manifested
but
its
manifestation
is
itself
its
being
numbers
as
will
be
remarked
in
respect
of
the
pythagoreans
are
unsuitable
mediums
for
expressing
thoughts
thus



are
with
pythagoras
unity
difference
and
unity
of
the
unity
and
of
the
difference
the
two
first
of
the
three
are
certainly
united
by
addition
this
kind
of
union
is
however
the
worst
form
of
unity
in
religion
the
three
make
their
appearance
in
a
deeper
sense
as
the
trinity
and
in
philosophy
as
the
notion
but
enumeration
forms
a
bad
method
of
expression
there
is
the
same
objection
to
it
as
would
exist
to
making
the
mensuration
of
space
the
medium
for
expressing
the
absolute
people
also
quote
the
philosophy
of
the
chinese
of
the
fo
in
which
it
is
said
that
thoughts
are
represented
by
numbers
yet
the
chinese
have
explained
their
symbols
and
hence
have
made
their
meaning
evident
universal
simple
abstractions
have
been
present
to
all
people
who
have
arrived
at
any
decree
of
culture

we
have
still
to
remark
in
the
third
place
that
religion
as
such
does
not
merely
form
its
representations
after
the
manner
of
art
and
also
that
poetry
likewise
contains
actual
thoughts
in
the
case
of
the
poets
whose
art
has
speech
as
medium
we
find
all
through
deep
universal
thought
regarding
reality
these
are
more
explicitly
expressed
in
the
indian
religion
but
with
the
indians
everything
is
mixed
up
hence
it
is
said
that
such
races
have
also
had
a
philosophy
proper
to
themselves
but
the
universal
thoughts
of
interest
in
indian
books
limit
themselves
to
what
is
most
abstract
to
the
idea
of
rising
up
and
passing
away
and
thus
of
making
a
perpetual
round
the
story
of
the
phnix
is
well
known
as
an
example
of
this
it
is
one
which
took
its
origin
in
the
east
we
are
able
similarly
to
find
thoughts
about
life
and
death
and
of
the
transition
of
being
into
passing
away
from
life
comes
death
and
from
death
comes
life
even
in
being
in
what
is
positive
the
negation
is
already
present
the
negative
side
must
indeed
contain
within
it
the
positive
for
all
change
all
the
process
of
life
is
founded
on
this
but
such
reflections
only
occasionally
come
forth
they
are
not
to
be
taken
as
being
proper
philosophic
utterances
for
philosophy
is
only
present
when
thought
as
such
is
made
the
absolute
ground
and
root
of
everything
else
and
in
these
modes
of
representation
this
is
not
so
philosophy
does
not
reflect
on
any
particular
thing
or
object
already
existing
as
a
first
substratum
its
content
is
just
thought
universal
thought
which
must
plainly
come
first
of
all
to
put
it
otherwise
the
absolute
must
in
philosophy
be
in
the
form
of
thought
in
the
greek
religion
we
find
the
thoughtdetermination
eternal
necessity
which
means
an
absolute
and
clearly
universal
relation
but
such
thought
has
other
subjects
besides
it
only
expresses
a
relation
the
necessity
to
be
the
true
and
allembracing
being
thus
neither
must
we
take
this
form
into
our
consideration
we
might
speak
in
that
way
of
a
philosophy
of
euripides
schiller
or
goethe
but
all
such
reflection
respecting
or
general
modes
of
representing
what
is
true
the
ends
of
men
morality
and
so
on
are
in
part
only
incidentally
set
forth
and
in
part
they
have
not
reached
the
proper
form
of
thought
which
implies
that
what
is
so
expressed
must
be
ultimate
thus
constituting
the
absolute

particular
theories
found
in
religion
in
conclusion
the
philosophy
which
we
find
within
religion
does
not
concern
us
we
find
deep
speculative
thoughts
regarding
the
nature
of
god
not
only
in
the
indian
religions
but
also
in
the
fathers
and
the
schoolmen
in
the
history
of
dogmatism
there
is
a
real
interest
in
becoming
acquainted
with
these
thoughts
but
they
do
not
belong
to
the
history
of
philosophy
nevertheless
more
notice
must
be
taken
of
the
schoolmen
than
of
the
fathers
for
they
were
certainly
great
philosophers
to
whom
the
culture
of
christendom
owes
much
but
their
speculations
belong
in
part
to
other
philosophies
such
as
to
that
of
plato
which
must
in
so
far
be
considered
for
themselves
partly
too
they
emanate
from
the
speculative
content
of
religion
itself
which
already
exists
as
independent
truth
in
the
doctrine
of
the
church
and
belongs
primarily
to
faith
thus
such
modes
of
thought
rest
on
an
hypothesis
and
not
on
thought
itself
they
are
not
properly
speaking
themselves
philosophy
or
thought
which
rests
on
itself
but
as
ideas
already
firmly
rooted
they
act
on
its
behalf
either
in
refuting
other
ideas
and
conclusions
or
in
philosophically
vindicating
against
them
their
own
religious
teaching
thought
in
this
manner
does
not
represent
and
know
itself
as
the
ultimate
and
absolute
culmination
of
the
content
or
as
the
inwardly
selfdetermining
thought
hence
too
when
the
fathers
seeing
that
the
content
of
the
christian
religion
can
only
be
grasped
after
the
speculative
form
did
within
the
teaching
of
the
church
produce
thoughts
of
a
highly
speculative
nature
the
ultimate
justification
of
these
was
not
found
in
thought
as
such
but
in
the
teaching
of
the
church
philosophic
teaching
here
finds
itself
within
a
strongly
bound
system
and
not
as
thought
which
emanates
freely
from
itself
thus
with
the
scholastics
too
thought
does
not
construct
itself
out
of
itself
but
depends
upon
hypotheses
and
although
it
ever
rests
more
and
more
upon
itself
it
never
does
so
in
opposition
to
the
doctrine
of
the
church
both
must
and
do
agree
since
thought
has
to
prove
from
itself
what
the
church
has
already
verified
c
philosophy
proper
distinguished
from
popular
philosophy
of
the
two
departments
of
knowledge
allied
to
philosophy
we
found
that
the
one
that
of
the
special
sciences
could
not
be
called
a
philosophy
in
that
it
as
independent
seeing
and
thinking
immersed
in
finite
matter
and
as
the
active
principle
in
becoming
acquainted
with
the
finite
was
not
the
content
but
simply
the
formal
and
subjective
moment
the
second
sphere
religion
is
deficient
in
that
it
only
had
the
content
or
the
objective
moment
in
common
with
philosophy
in
it
independent
thought
was
an
essential
moment
since
the
subject
had
an
imaginary
or
historical
form
philosophy
demands
the
unity
and
intermingling
of
these
two
points
of
view
it
unites
the
sunday
of
life
when
man
in
humility
renounces
himself
and
the
workingday
when
he
stands
up
independently
is
master
of
himself
and
considers
his
own
interests
a
third
point
of
view
seems
to
unite
both
elements
and
that
is
popular
philosophy
it
deals
with
universal
objects
and
philosophizes
as
to
god
and
the
world
and
thought
is
likewise
occupied
in
learning
about
these
matters
yet
this
philosophy
must
also
be
cast
aside
the
writings
of
cicero
may
be
put
under
this
category
they
contain
a
kind
of
philosophy
that
has
its
own
place
and
in
which
excellent
things
are
said
cicero
formed
many
experiences
both
in
the
affairs
of
life
and
mind
and
from
them
and
after
observing
what
takes
place
in
the
world
he
deduced
the
truth
he
expresses
himself
with
culture
on
the
concerns
most
important
to
man
and
hence
his
great
popularity
fanatics
and
mystics
may
from
another
point
of
view
be
reckoned
as
in
this
category
they
give
expression
to
a
deep
sense
of
devotion
and
have
had
experiences
in
the
higher
regions
they
are
able
to
express
the
highest
content
and
the
result
is
attractive
we
thus
find
the
brightest
gleams
of
thought
in
the
writings
of
a
pascalas
we
do
in
his
penses
but
the
drawback
that
attaches
to
this
philosophy
is
that
the
ultimate
appealeven
in
modern
timesis
made
to
the
fact
that
men
are
constituted
such
as
they
are
by
nature
and
with
this
cicero
is
very
free
here
the
moral
instinct
comes
into
question
only
under
the
name
of
feeling
religion
now
rests
not
on
what
is
objective
but
on
religious
feeling
because
the
immediate
consciousness
of
god
by
men
is
its
ultimate
ground
cicero
makes
copious
use
of
the
consensus
gentium
in
more
modern
times
this
appeal
has
been
more
or
less
left
alone
since
the
individual
subject
has
to
rest
upon
himself
feeling
is
first
of
all
laid
hold
of
then
comes
reasoning
from
what
is
given
but
in
these
we
can
appeal
to
what
is
immediate
only
independent
thought
is
certainly
here
advanced
the
content
too
is
taken
from
the
self
but
we
must
just
as
necessarily
exclude
this
mode
of
thinking
from
philosophy
for
the
source
from
which
the
content
is
derived
is
of
the
same
description
as
in
the
other
cases
nature
is
the
source
in
finite
sciences
and
in
religion
it
is
spirit
but
here
the
source
is
in
authority
the
content
is
given
and
the
act
of
worship
removes
but
momentarily
this
externality
the
source
of
popular
philosophy
is
in
the
heart
impulses
and
capacities
our
natural
being
my
impression
of
what
is
right
and
of
god
the
content
is
in
a
form
which
is
of
nature
only
i
certainly
have
everything
in
feeling
but
the
whole
content
is
also
in
mythology
and
yet
in
neither
is
it
so
in
veritable
form
the
laws
and
doctrines
of
religion
are
that
in
which
this
content
always
comes
to
consciousness
in
a
more
definite
way
while
in
feeling
there
still
is
intermingled

3
commencement
of
philosophy
and
of
its
history
now
that
we
have
thus
defined
the
notion
of
philosophy
to
be
the
thought
which
as
the
universal
content
is
complete
being
it
will
be
shown
in
the
history
of
philosophy
how
the
determinations
in
this
content
make
their
appearance
little
by
little
at
first
we
only
ask
where
philosophy
and
its
history
begin
a
freedom
of
thought
as
a
first
condition
the
general
answer
is
in
accordance
with
what
has
been
said
philosophy
begins
where
the
universal
is
comprehended
as
the
allembracing
existence
or
where
the
existent
is
laid
hold
of
in
a
universal
form
and
where
thinking
about
thought
first
commences
where
then
has
this
occurred
where
did
it
begin
that
is
a
question
of
history
thought
must
be
for
itself
must
come
into
existence
in
its
freedom
liberate
itself
from
nature
and
come
out
of
its
immersion
in
mere
senseperception
it
must
as
free
enter
within
itself
and
thus
arrive
at
the
consciousness
of
freedom
philosophy
is
properly
to
be
commenced
where
the
absolute
is
no
more
in
the
form
of
ordinary
conception
and
free
thought
not
merely
thinks
the
absolute
but
grasps
its
idea
that
is
to
say
where
thought
grasps
as
thought
the
being
which
may
be
thought
itself
which
it
recognizes
as
the
essence
of
things
the
absolute
totality
and
the
immanent
essence
of
everything
and
does
so
as
an
external
being
the
simple
existence
which
is
not
sensuous
and
which
the
jews
thought
of
as
god
for
all
religion
is
thinking
is
thus
not
a
subject
to
be
treated
of
by
philosophy
but
just
such
a
proposition
as
that
the
existence
or
principle
of
things
is
water
fire
or
thought
thought
this
universal
determination
which
sets
forth
itself
is
an
abstract
determinateness
it
is
the
beginning
of
philosophy
but
this
beginning
is
at
the
same
time
in
history
the
concrete
form
taken
by
a
people
the
principle
of
which
constitutes
what
we
have
stated
above
if
we
say
that
the
consciousness
of
freedom
is
connected
with
the
appearance
of
philosophy
this
principle
must
be
a
fundamental
one
with
those
with
whom
philosophy
begins
a
people
having
this
consciousness
of
freedom
founds
its
existence
on
that
principle
seeing
that
the
laws
and
the
whole
circumstances
of
the
people
are
based
only
on
the
notion
that
mind
forms
of
itself
and
in
the
categories
which
it
has
connected
with
this
on
the
practical
side
is
the
fact
that
actual
freedom
develops
political
freedom
and
this
only
begins
where
the
individual
knows
himself
as
an
independent
individual
to
be
universal
and
real
where
his
significance
is
infinite
or
where
the
subject
has
attained
the
consciousness
of
personality
and
thus
desires
to
be
esteemed
for
himself
alone
free
philosophic
thought
has
this
direct
connection
with
practical
freedom
that
as
the
former
supplies
thought
about
the
absolute
universal
and
real
object
the
latter
because
it
thinks
itself
gives
itself
the
character
of
universality
thinking
means
the
bringing
of
something
into
the
form
of
universality
hence
thought
first
treats
of
the
universal
or
determines
what
is
objective
and
individual
in
the
natural
things
which
are
present
in
sensuous
consciousness
as
the
universal
as
an
objective
thought
its
second
attribute
is
that
in
recognizing
and
knowing
this
objective
and
infinite
universal
i
at
the
same
time
remain
confronting
it
from
the
standpoint
of
objectivity
on
account
of
this
general
connection
between
political
freedom
and
the
freedom
of
thought
philosophy
only
appears
in
history
where
and
in
as
far
as
free
institutions
are
formed
since
mind
requires
to
separate
itself
from
its
natural
will
and
engrossment
in
matter
if
it
wishes
to
enter
upon
philosophy
it
cannot
do
so
in
the
form
with
which
the
worldspirit
commences
and
which
takes
precedence
of
that
separation
this
stage
of
the
unity
of
mind
with
nature
which
as
immediate
is
not
the
true
and
perfect
state
is
mainly
found
in
the
oriental
conception
of
existence
therefore
philosophy
first
begins
in
the
grecian
world
b
separation
of
the
east
and
its
philosophy
some
explanations
have
to
be
given
regarding
this
first
form
since
mind
in
it
as
consciousness
and
will
is
but
desire
selfconsciousness
still
stands
upon
its
first
stage
in
which
the
sphere
of
its
idea
and
will
is
finite
as
intelligence
is
thus
finite
too
its
ends
are
not
yet
a
universal
for
themselves
but
if
a
people
makes
for
what
is
moral
if
laws
and
justice
are
possessed
the
character
of
universality
underlies
its
will
this
presupposes
a
new
power
in
mind
with
which
it
commences
to
be
free
for
the
universal
will
as
the
relation
of
thought
to
thought
or
as
the
universal
contains
a
thought
which
is
at
home
with
itself
if
a
people
desire
to
be
free
they
will
subordinate
their
desires
to
universal
laws
while
formerly
that
which
was
desired
was
only
a
particular
now
finitude
of
the
will
characterizes
the
orientals
because
with
them
the
will
has
not
yet
grasped
itself
as
universal
for
thought
is
not
yet
free
for
itself
hence
there
can
but
be
the
relation
of
lord
and
slave
and
in
this
despotic
sphere
fear
constitutes
the
ruling
category
because
the
will
is
not
yet
free
from
what
is
finite
it
can
therein
be
comprehended
and
the
finite
can
be
shown
forth
as
negative
this
sensation
of
negation
that
something
cannot
last
is
just
fear
as
distinguished
from
freedom
which
does
not
consist
in
being
finite
but
in
being
for
itself
and
this
cannot
be
laid
hold
of
religion
necessarily
has
this
character
since
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
essential
element
beyond
which
we
cannot
get
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
is
indeed
a
true
saying
man
must
begin
with
this
in
order
to
know
the
finite
ends
in
their
negative
character
but
man
must
also
have
overcome
fear
through
the
relinquishment
of
finite
ends
and
the
satisfaction
which
that
religion
affords
is
confined
to
what
is
finite
seeing
that
the
chief
means
of
reconciliation
are
natural
forms
which
are
impersonated
and
held
in
reverence
the
oriental
consciousness
raises
itself
indeed
above
the
natural
content
to
what
is
infinite
but
it
only
knows
itself
as
accidental
in
reference
to
the
power
which
makes
the
individual
fear
this
subordination
may
take
two
forms
and
must
indeed
from
one
extreme
pass
to
the
other
the
finite
which
is
for
consciousness
may
have
the
form
of
finitude
as
finite
or
it
may
become
the
infinite
which
is
however
an
abstraction
the
man
who
lives
in
fear
and
he
who
rules
over
men
through
fear
both
stand
upon
the
same
platform
the
difference
between
them
is
only
in
the
greater
power
of
will
which
can
go
forth
to
sacrifice
all
that
is
finite
for
some
particular
end
the
despot
brings
about
what
his
caprice
directs
including
certainly
what
is
good
not
as
law
but
as
arbitrary
will
the
passive
will
like
that
of
slavery
is
converted
into
the
active
energy
of
will
which
will
however
is
arbitrary
still
in
religion
we
even
find
selfimmersion
in
the
deepest
sensuality
represented
as
the
service
of
god
and
then
there
follows
in
the
east
a
flight
to
the
emptiest
abstraction
as
to
what
is
infinite
as
also
the
exaltation
attained
through
the
renunciation
of
everything
and
this
is
specially
so
amongst
the
indians
who
torture
themselves
and
enter
into
the
most
profound
abstraction
the
indians
look
straight
before
them
for
ten
years
at
a
time
are
fed
by
those
around
and
are
destitute
of
other
spiritual
content
than
that
of
knowing
what
is
abstract
which
content
therefore
is
entirely
finite
this
then
is
not
the
soil
of
freedom
in
the
east
mind
indeed
begins
to
dawn
but
it
is
still
true
of
it
that
the
subject
is
not
presented
as
a
person
but
appears
in
the
objectively
substantial
which
is
represented
as
partly
supersensuous
and
partly
and
even
more
material
as
negative
and
perishing
the
highest
point
attainable
by
the
individual
the
everlasting
bliss
is
made
an
immersion
into
substance
a
vanishing
away
of
consciousness
and
thus
of
all
distinction
between
substance
and
individualityhence
an
annihilation
a
spiritually
dead
relation
thus
comes
into
existence
since
the
highest
point
there
to
be
reached
is
insensibility
so
far
however
man
has
not
attained
that
bliss
but
finds
himself
to
be
a
single
existent
individual
distinguished
from
the
universal
substance
he
is
thus
outside
the
unity
has
no
significance
and
as
being
what
is
accidental
and
without
rights
is
finite
only
he
finds
himself
limited
through
naturein
caste
for
instance
the
will
is
not
here
the
substantial
will
it
is
the
arbitrary
will
given
up
to
what
is
outwardly
and
inwardly
contingent
for
substance
alone
is
the
affirmative
with
it
greatness
nobility
or
exaltitude
of
character
are
certainly
not
excluded
but
they
are
only
present
as
the
naturally
determined
or
the
arbitrary
will
and
not
in
the
objective
forms
of
morality
and
law
to
which
all
owe
respect
which
hold
good
for
all
and
in
which
for
that
same
reason
all
are
recognized
the
oriental
subject
thus
has
the
advantage
of
independence
since
there
is
nothing
fixed
however
undetermined
is
the
substance
of
the
easterns
as
undetermined
free
and
independent
may
their
character
be
what
for
us
is
justice
and
morality
is
also
in
their
state
but
in
a
substantial
natural
patriarchal
way
and
not
in
subjective
freedom
conscience
does
not
exist
nor
does
morality
everything
is
simply
in
a
state
of
nature
which
allows
the
noblest
to
exist
as
it
does
the
worst
the
conclusion
to
be
derived
from
this
is
that
no
philosophic
knowledge
can
be
found
here
to
philosophy
belongs
the
knowledge
of
substance
the
absolute
universal
that
whether
i
think
it
and
develop
it
or
not
confronts
me
still
as
for
itself
objective
and
whether
this
is
to
me
substantial
or
not
still
just
in
that
i
think
it
it
is
mine
that
in
which
i
possess
my
distinctive
character
or
am
affirmative
thus
my
thoughts
are
not
mere
subjective
determinations
or
opinions
but
as
being
my
thoughts
are
also
thoughts
of
what
is
objective
or
they
are
substantial
thoughts
the
eastern
form
must
therefore
be
excluded
from
the
history
of
philosophy
but
still
upon
the
whole
i
will
take
some
notice
of
it
i
have
touched
on
this
elsewhere8
for
some
time
ago
we
for
the
first
time
reached
a
position
to
judge
of
it
earlier
a
great
parade
was
made
about
the
indian
wisdom
without
any
real
knowledge
of
what
it
was
now
this
is
for
the
first
time
known
and
naturally
it
is
found
to
be
in
conformity
with
the
rest
c
beginnings
of
philosophy
in
greece
philosophy
proper
commences
in
the
west
it
is
in
the
west
that
this
freedom
of
selfconsciousness
first
comes
forth
the
natural
consciousness
and
likewise
mind
disappear
into
themselves
in
the
brightness
of
the
east
the
individual
disappears
the
light
first
becomes
in
the
west
the
flash
of
thought
which
strikes
within
itself
and
from
thence
creates
its
world
out
of
itself
the
blessedness
of
the
west
is
thus
so
determined
that
in
it
the
subject
as
such
endures
and
continues
in
the
substantial
the
individual
mind
grasps
its
being
as
universal
but
universality
is
just
this
relation
to
itself
this
being
at
home
with
self
this
personality
and
infinitude
of
the
i
constitutes
the
being
of
mind
it
is
thus
and
can
be
none
else
for
a
people
to
know
themselves
as
free
and
to
be
only
as
universal
is
for
them
to
be
it
is
the
principle
of
their
whole
life
as
regards
morality
and
all
else
to
take
an
example
we
only
know
our
real
being
in
so
far
as
personal
freedom
is
its
first
condition
and
hence
we
never
can
be
slaves
were
the
mere
arbitrary
will
of
the
prince
a
law
and
should
he
wish
slavery
to
be
introduced
we
would
have
the
knowledge
that
this
could
not
be
to
sleep
to
live
to
have
a
certain
office
is
not
our
real
being
and
certainly
to
be
no
slave
is
such
for
that
has
come
to
mean
the
being
in
nature
thus
in
the
west
we
are
upon
the
soil
of
a
veritable
philosophy
because
in
desire
i
am
subject
to
another
and
my
being
is
in
a
particularity
i
am
as
i
exist
unlike
myself
for
i
am
i
the
universal
complete
but
hemmed
in
by
passion
this
last
is
selfwill
or
formal
freedom
which
has
desire
as
content
amongst
the
greeks
we
first
find
the
freedom
which
is
the
end
of
true
will
the
equitable
and
right
in
which
i
am
free
and
universal
and
others
too
are
free
are
also
i
and
like
me
where
a
relationship
between
free
and
free
is
thus
established
with
its
actual
laws
determinations
of
the
universal
will
and
justly
constituted
states
hence
it
is
here
that
philosophy
began
in
greece
we
first
see
real
freedom
flourish
but
still
in
a
restricted
form
and
with
a
limitation
since
slavery
was
still
existent
and
the
states
were
by
its
means
conditioned
in
the
following
abstractions
we
may
first
of
all
superficially
describe
the
freedom
of
the
east
of
greece
and
of
the
teutonic
world
in
the
east
only
one
individual
is
free
the
despot
in
greece
the
few
are
free
in
the
teutonic
world
the
saying
is
true
that
all
are
free
that
is
man
is
free
as
man
but
since
the
one
in
eastern
countries
cannot
be
free
because
that
would
necessitate
the
others
also
being
free
to
him
impulse
selfwill
and
formal
freedom
can
there
alone
be
found
since
in
greece
we
have
to
deal
with
the
particular
the
athenians
and
the
spartans
are
free
indeed
but
not
the
messenians
or
the
helots
the
principle
of
the
few
has
yet
to
be
discovered
and
this
implies
some
modifications
of
the
greek
point
of
view
which
we
must
consider
in
connection
with
the
history
of
philosophy
to
take
these
into
consideration
means
simply
to
proceed
to
the
dividing
up
of
philosophy
c
division
sources
and
method
adopted
in
treating
of
the
history
of
philosophy
1
division
of
the
history
of
philosophy
since
we
set
to
work
systematically
this
division
must
present
itself
as
necessary
speaking
generally
we
have
properly
only
two
epochs
to
distinguish
in
the
history
of
philosophy
as
in
ancient
and
modern
artthese
are
the
greek
and
the
teutonic
the
teutonic
philosophy
is
the
philosophy
within
christendom
in
so
far
as
it
belongs
to
the
teutonic
nations
the
christianeuropean
people
inasmuch
as
they
belong
to
the
world
of
science
possess
collectively
teutonic
culture
for
italy
spain
france
england
and
the
rest
have
through
the
teutonic
nations
received
a
new
form
the
influence
of
greece
also
reaches
into
the
roman
world
and
hence
we
have
to
speak
of
philosophy
in
the
territory
of
the
roman
world
but
the
romans
produced
no
proper
philosophy
any
more
than
any
proper
poets
they
have
only
received
from
and
imitated
others
although
they
have
often
done
this
with
intelligence
even
their
religion
is
derived
from
the
greek
and
the
special
character
that
it
has
makes
no
approach
to
philosophy
and
art
but
is
unphilosophical
and
inartistic
a
further
description
of
these
two
outstanding
opposites
must
be
given
the
greek
world
developed
thought
as
far
as
to
the
idea
the
christian
teutonic
world
on
the
contrary
has
comprehended
thought
as
spirit
idea
and
spirit
are
thus
the
distinguishing
features
more
particularly
the
facts
are
as
follows
because
god
the
still
undetermined
and
immediate
universal
being
or
objective
thought
jealously
allowing
nothing
to
exist
beside
him
is
the
substantial
groundwork
of
all
philosophy
which
never
alters
but
ever
sinks
more
deeply
within
itself
and
through
the
development
of
determinations
manifests
itself
and
brings
to
consciousness
we
may
designate
the
particular
character
of
the
development
in
the
first
period
of
philosophy
by
saying
that
this
development
is
a
simple
process
of
determinations
figurations
abstract
qualities
issuing
from
the
one
ground
that
potentially
already
contains
the
whole
the
second
stage
in
this
universal
principle
is
the
gathering
up
of
the
determinations
manifested
thus
into
ideal
concrete
unity
in
the
mode
of
subjectivity
the
first
determinations
as
immediate
were
still
abstractions
but
now
the
absolute
as
the
endlessly
selfdetermining
universal
must
furthermore
be
comprehended
as
active
thought
and
not
as
the
universal
in
this
determinate
character
hence
it
is
manifested
as
the
totality
of
determinations
and
as
concrete
individuality
thus
with
the

of
anaxagoras
and
still
more
with
socrates
there
commences
a
subjective
totality
in
which
thought
grasps
itself
and
thinking
activity
is
the
fundamental
principle
the
third
stage
then
is
that
this
totality
which
is
at
first
abstract
in
that
it
becomes
realized
through
the
active
determining
distinguishing
thought
sets
itself
forth
even
in
the
separated
determinations
which
as
ideal
belong
to
it
since
these
determinations
are
contained
unseparated
in
the
unity
and
thus
each
in
it
is
also
the
other
these
opposed
moments
are
raised
into
totalities
the
quite
general
forms
of
opposition
are
the
universal
and
the
particular
or
in
another
form
thought
as
such
external
reality
feeling
or
perception
the
notion
is
the
identity
of
universal
and
particular
because
each
of
these
is
thus
set
forth
as
concrete
in
itself
the
universal
is
in
itself
at
once
the
unity
of
universality
and
particularity
and
the
same
holds
good
of
particularity
unity
is
thus
posited
in
both
forms
and
the
abstract
moments
can
be
made
complete
through
this
unity
alone
thus
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
differences
themselves
are
each
raised
up
to
a
system
of
totality
which
respectively
confront
one
another
as
the
philosophy
of
stoicism
and
of
epicureanism
the
whole
concrete
universal
is
now
mind
and
the
whole
concrete
individual
nature
in
stoicism
pure
thought
develops
into
a
totality
if
we
make
the
other
side
from
mindnatural
being
or
feelinginto
a
totality
epicureanism
is
the
result
each
determination
is
formed
into
a
totality
of
thought
and
in
accordance
with
the
simple
mode
which
characterizes
this
sphere
these
principles
seem
to
be
for
themselves
and
independent
like
two
antagonistic
systems
of
philosophy
implicitly
both
are
identical
but
they
themselves
take
up
their
position
as
conflicting
and
the
idea
is
also
as
it
is
apprehended
in
a
onesided
determinateness
the
higher
stage
is
the
union
of
these
differences
this
may
occur
in
annihilation
in
scepticism
but
the
higher
point
of
view
is
the
affirmative
the
idea
in
relation
to
the
notion
if
the
notion
is
then
the
universalthat
which
determines
itself
further
within
itself
but
yet
remains
there
in
its
unity
and
in
the
ideality
and
transparency
of
its
determinations
which
do
not
become
independentthe
further
step
is
on
the
other
hand
the
reality
of
the
notion
in
which
the
differences
are
themselves
brought
to
totalities
thus
the
fourth
stage
is
the
union
of
the
idea
in
which
all
these
differences
as
totalities
are
yet
at
the
same
time
blended
into
one
concrete
unity
of
notion
this
comprehension
first
takes
place
without
constraint
since
the
ideal
is
itself
only
apprehended
in
the
element
of
universality
the
greek
world
got
as
far
as
this
idea
since
they
formed
an
ideal
intellectual
world
and
this
was
done
by
the
alexandrian
philosophy
in
which
the
greek
philosophy
perfected
itself
and
reached
its
end
if
we
wish
to
represent
this
process
figuratively
a
thought
is

speaking
generally
abstract
as
in
universal
or
absolute
space
by
which
empty
space
is
often
understood

then
the
most
simple
space
determinations
appear
in
which
we
commence
with
the
point
in
order
that
we
may
arrive
at
the
line
and
angle

what
comes
third
is
their
union
into
the
triangle
that
which
is
indeed
concrete
but
which
is
still
retained
in
this
abstract
element
of
surface
and
thus
is
only
the
first
and
still
formal
totality
and
limitation
which
corresponds
to
the

b
the
next
point
is
that
since
we
allow
each
of
the
enclosing
lines
of
the
triangle
to
be
again
surface
each
forms
itself
into
the
totality
of
the
triangle
and
into
the
whole
figure
to
which
it
belongs
that
is
the
realization
of
the
whole
in
the
sides
as
we
see
it
in
scepticism
or
stoicism
c
the
last
stage
of
all
is
that
these
surfaces
or
sides
of
the
triangle
join
themselves
into
a
body
or
a
totality
the
body
is
for
the
first
time
the
perfect
spacial
determination
and
that
is
a
reduplication
of
the
triangle
but
in
as
far
as
the
triangle
which
forms
the
basis
is
outside
of
the
pyramid
this
simile
does
not
hold
good
grecian
philosophy
in
the
neoplatonists
finds
its
end
in
a
perfect
kingdom
of
thought
and
of
bliss
and
in
a
potentially
existent
world
of
the
ideal
which
is
yet
unreal
because
the
whole
only
exists
in
the
element
of
universality
this
world
still
lacks
individuality
as
such
which
is
an
essential
moment
in
the
notion
actuality
demands
that
in
the
identity
of
both
sides
of
the
idea
the
independent
totality
shall
be
also
posited
as
negative
through
this
selfexistent
negation
which
is
absolute
subjectivity
the
idea
is
first
raised
into
mind
mind
is
the
subjectivity
of
selfknowledge
but
it
is
only
mind
inasmuch
as
it
knows
what
is
object
to
itself
and
that
is
itself
as
a
totality
and
is
for
itself
a
totality
that
is
to
say
the
two
triangles
which
are
above
and
below
in
the
prism
must
not
be
two
in
the
sense
of
being
doubled
but
they
must
be
one
intermingled
unity
or
in
the
case
of
body
the
difference
arises
between
the
centre
and
the
peripheral
parts
this
opposition
of
real
corporeality
and
centre
as
the
simple
existence
now
makes
its
appearance
and
the
totality
is
the
union
of
the
centre
and
the
substantialnot
however
the
simple
union
but
a
union
such
that
the
subjective
knows
itself
as
subjective
in
relation
to
the
objective
and
substantial
hence
the
idea
is
this
totality
and
the
idea
which
knows
itself
is
essentially
different
from
the
substantial
the
former
manifests
itself
independently
but
in
such
a
manner
that
as
such
it
is
considered
to
be
for
itself
substantial
the
subjective
idea
is
at
first
only
formal
but
it
is
the
real
possibility
of
the
substantial
and
of
the
potentially
universal
its
end
is
to
realize
itself
and
to
identify
itself
with
substance
through
this
subjectivity
and
negative
unity
and
through
this
absolute
negativity
the
ideal
becomes
no
longer
our
object
merely
but
object
to
itself
and
this
principle
has
taken
effect
in
the
world
of
christianity
thus
in
the
modern
point
of
view
the
subject
is
for
itself
free
man
is
free
as
man
and
from
this
comes
the
idea
that
because
he
is
mind
he
has
from
his
very
nature
the
eternal
quality
of
being
substantial
god
becomes
known
as
mind
which
appears
to
itself
as
double
yet
removes
the
difference
that
it
may
in
it
be
for
and
at
home
with
itself
the
business
of
the
world
taking
it
as
a
whole
is
to
become
reconciled
with
mind
recognizing
itself
therein
and
this
business
is
assigned
to
the
teutonic
world
the
first
beginning
of
this
undertaking
is
found
in
the
religion
which
is
the
contemplation
of
and
faith
in
this
principle
as
in
an
actual
existence
before
a
knowledge
of
the
principle
has
been
arrived
at
in
the
christian
religion
this
principle
is
found
more
as
feeling
and
idea
in
it
man
as
man
is
destined
to
everlasting
bliss
and
is
an
object
of
divine
grace
pity
and
interest
which
is
as
much
as
saying
that
man
has
an
absolute
and
infinite
value
we
find
it
further
in
that
dogma
revealed
through
christ
to
men
of
the
unity
of
the
divine
and
human
nature
according
to
which
the
subjective
and
the
objective
ideaman
and
godare
one
this
in
another
form
is
found
in
the
old
story
of
the
fall
in
which
the
serpent
did
not
delude
man
for
god
said
behold
adam
has
become
as
one
of
us
to
know
good
and
evil
we
have
to
deal
with
this
unity
of
subjective
principle
and
of
substance
it
constitutes
the
process
of
mind
that
this
individual
one
or
independent
existence
of
subject
should
put
aside
its
immediate
character
and
bring
itself
forth
as
identical
with
the
substantial
such
an
aim
is
pronounced
to
be
the
highest
end
attainable
by
man
we
see
from
this
that
religious
ideas
and
speculation
are
not
so
far
asunder
as
was
at
first
believed
and
i
maintain
these
ideas
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
ashamed
of
them
seeing
that
we
still
belong
to
them
and
so
that
if
we
do
get
beyond
them
we
may
not
be
ashamed
of
our
progenitors
of
the
early
christian
times
who
held
these
ideas
in
such
high
esteem
the
first
principle
of
that
philosophy
which
has
taken
its
place
in
christendom
is
thus
found
in
the
existence
of
two
totalities
this
is
a
reduplication
of
substance
which
now
however
is
characterized
by
the
fact
that
the
two
totalities
are
no
longer
external
to
one
another
but
are
clearly
both
required
through
their
relation
to
one
another
if
formerly
stoicism
and
epicureanism
whose
negativity
was
scepticism
came
forth
as
independent
and
if
finally
the
implicitly
existent
universality
of
both
was
established
these
moments
are
now
known
as
separate
totalities
and
yet
in
their
opposition
they
have
to
be
thought
of
as
one
we
have
here
the
true
speculative
idea
the
notion
in
its
determinations
each
of
which
is
brought
into
a
totality
and
clearly
relates
to
the
other
we
thus
have
really
two
ideas
the
subjective
idea
as
knowledge
and
then
the
substantial
and
concrete
idea
and
the
development
and
perfection
of
this
principle
and
its
coming
to
the
consciousness
of
thought
is
the
subject
treated
by
modern
philosophy
thus
the
determinations
are
in
it
more
concrete
than
with
the
ancients
this
opposition
in
which
the
two
sides
culminate
grasped
in
its
widest
significance
is
the
opposition
between
thought
and
being
individuality
and
substance
so
that
in
the
subject
himself
his
freedom
stands
once
more
within
the
bounds
of
necessity
it
is
the
opposition
between
subject
and
object
and
between
nature
and
mind
in
so
far
as
this
last
as
finite
stands
in
opposition
to
nature
the
greek
philosophy
is
free
from
restraint
because
it
does
not
yet
have
regard
to
the
opposition
between
being
and
thought
but
proceeds
from
the
unconscious
presupposition
that
thought
is
also
being
certainly
certain
stages
in
the
greek
philosophy
are
laid
hold
of
which
seem
to
stand
on
the
same
platform
as
the
christian
philosophies
thus
when
we
see
for
instance
in
the
philosophy
of
the
sophists
the
new
academics
and
the
sceptics
that
they
maintain
the
doctrine
that
the
truth
is
not
capable
of
being
known
they
might
appear
to
accord
with
the
later
subjective
philosophies
in
asserting
that
all
thoughtdeterminations
were
only
subjective
in
character
and
that
hence
from
these
no
conclusions
could
be
arrived
at
as
regards
what
is
objective
but
there
is
really
a
difference
in
the
case
of
ancient
philosophies
which
said
that
we
know
only
the
phenomenal
everything
is
confined
to
that
it
is
as
regards
practical
life
that
the
new
academy
and
the
sceptics
also
admitted
the
possibility
of
conducting
oneself
rightly
morally
and
rationally
when
one
adopts
the
phenomenal
as
ones
rule
and
guide
in
life
but
though
it
is
the
phenomenal
that
lies
at
the
foundation
of
things
it
is
not
asserted
that
there
is
likewise
a
knowledge
of
the
true
and
existent
as
in
the
case
of
the
merely
subjective
idealists
of
a
more
modern
day
these
last
still
keep
in
the
background
a
potentiality
a
beyond
which
cannot
be
known
through
thought
or
through
conception
this
other
knowledge
is
an
immediate
knowledgea
faith
in
a
view
of
and
a
yearning
after
the
beyond
such
as
was
evinced
by
jacobi
the
ancients
have
no
such
yearning
on
the
contrary
they
have
perfect
satisfaction
and
rest
in
the
certitude
that
only
that
which
appears
is
for
knowledge
thus
it
is
necessary
in
this
respect
to
keep
strictly
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
start
else
through
the
similarity
of
the
results
we
come
to
see
in
that
old
philosophy
all
the
determinate
character
of
modern
subjectivity
since
in
the
simplicity
of
ancient
philosophy
the
phenomenal
was
itself
the
only
sphere
doubts
as
to
objective
thought
were
not
present
to
it
the
opposition
defined
the
two
sides
of
which
are
in
modern
times
really
related
to
one
another
as
totalities
also
has
the
form
of
an
opposition
between
reason
and
faith
between
individual
perception
and
the
objective
truth
which
must
be
taken
without
reason
of
ones
own
and
even
with
a
complete
disregard
for
such
reason
this
is
faith
as
understood
by
the
church
or
faith
in
the
modern
sense
ie
a
rejection
of
reason
in
favour
of
an
inward
revelation
called
a
direct
certainty
or
perception
or
an
implicit
and
intuitive
feeling
the
opposition
between
this
knowledge
which
has
first
of
all
to
develop
itself
and
that
knowledge
which
has
already
developed
itself
inwardly
arouses
a
peculiar
interest
in
both
cases
the
unity
of
thought
or
subjectivity
and
of
truth
or
objectivity
is
manifested
only
in
the
first
form
it
is
said
that
the
natural
man
knows
the
truth
since
he
intuitively
believes
it
while
in
the
second
form
the
unity
of
knowledge
and
truth
is
shown
but
in
such
a
way
that
the
subject
raises
itself
above
the
immediate
form
of
sensuous
consciousness
and
reaches
the
truth
first
of
all
through
thought
the
final
end
is
to
think
the
absolute
as
mind
as
the
universal
that
which
when
the
infinite
bounty
of
the
notion
in
its
reality
freely
emits
its
determinations
from
itself
wholly
impresses
itself
upon
and
imparts
itself
to
them
so
that
they
may
be
indifferently
outside
of
or
in
conflict
with
one
another
but
so
that
these
totalities
are
one
only
not
alone
implicitly
which
would
simply
be
our
reflection
but
explicitly
identical
the
determinations
of
their
difference
being
thus
explicitly
merely
ideal
hence
if
the
startingpoint
of
the
history
of
philosophy
can
be
expressed
by
saying
that
god
is
comprehended
as
the
immediate
and
not
yet
developed
universality
and
that
its
endthe
grasping
of
the
absolute
as
mind
through
the
two
and
a
half
thousand
years
work
of
the
thus
far
inert
worldspiritis
the
end
of
our
time
it
makes
it
easy
for
us
from
one
determination
to
go
on
through
the
manifestation
of
its
needs
to
others
yet
in
the
course
of
history
this
is
difficult
we
thus
have
altogether
two
philosophiesthe
greek
and
the
teutonic
as
regards
the
latter
we
must
distinguish
the
time
when
philosophy
made
its
formal
appearance
as
philosophy
and
the
period
of
formation
and
of
preparation
for
modern
times
we
may
first
begin
teutonic
philosophy
where
it
appears
in
proper
form
as
philosophy
between
the
first
period
and
those
more
recent
comes
as
an
intermediate
period
that
fermentation
of
a
new
philosophy
which
on
the
one
side
keeps
within
the
substantial
and
real
existence
and
does
not
arrive
at
form
while
on
the
other
side
it
perfects
thought
as
the
bare
form
of
a
presupposed
truth
until
it
again
knows
itself
as
the
free
ground
and
source
of
truth
hence
the
history
of
philosophy
falls
into
three
periodsthat
of
the
greek
philosophy
the
philosophy
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
modern
philosophy
of
these
the
first
is
speaking
generally
regulated
by
thought
the
second
falls
into
the
opposition
between
existence
and
formal
reflection
but
the
third
has
the
notion
as
its
ground
this
must
not
be
taken
to
mean
that
the
first
contains
thought
alone
it
also
has
conceptions
and
ideas
just
as
the
latter
begins
from
abstract
thoughts
which
yet
constitute
a
duality
first
periodthis
commences
at
the
time
of
thales
about
600
bc
and
goes
on
to
the
coming
to
maturity
of
the
neoplatonic
philosophy
with
plotinus
in
the
third
century
from
thence
to
its
further
progress
and
development
with
proclus
in
the
fifth
century
until
the
time
when
all
philosophy
was
extinguished
the
neoplatonic
philosophy
then
made
its
entrance
into
christianity
later
on
and
many
philosophies
within
christianity
have
this
philosophy
as
their
only
groundwork
this
is
a
space
of
time
extending
to
about
1000
years
the
end
of
which
coincides
with
the
migration
of
the
nations
and
the
decline
of
the
roman
empire
second
periodthe
second
period
is
that
of
the
middle
ages
the
scholastics
are
included
in
it
and
arabians
and
jews
are
also
historically
to
be
noticed
but
this
philosophy
mainly
falls
within
the
christian
church
this
period
is
of
something
over
1000
years
duration
third
periodthe
philosophy
of
modern
times
made
its
first
independent
appearance
after
the
thirty
years
war
with
bacon
jacob
bhm
and
descartes
it
begins
with
the
distinction
contained
in
cogito
ergo
sum
this
period
is
one
of
a
couple
of
centuries
and
the
philosophy
is
consequently
still
somewhat
modern
2
sources
of
the
history
of
philosophy
we
have
to
seek
for
sources
of
another
kind
in
this
than
in
political
history
there
historians
are
the
fountainheads
which
again
have
as
sources
the
deeds
and
sayings
of
individuals
and
the
historians
who
are
not
original
have
over
and
above
performed
their
work
at
secondhand
but
historians
always
have
the
deeds
already
present
in
history
that
is
to
say
here
brought
into
the
form
of
ordinary
conception
for
the
name
of
history
has
two
meanings
it
signifies
on
the
one
hand
the
deeds
and
events
themselves
and
on
the
other
it
denotes
them
in
so
far
as
they
are
formed
through
conception
for
conception
in
the
history
of
philosophy
there
are
on
the
contrary
not
any
sources
which
can
be
derived
from
historians
but
the
deeds
themselves
lie
before
us
and
thesethe
philosophic
operations
themselvesare
the
true
sources
if
we
wish
to
study
the
history
of
philosophy
in
earnest
we
must
go
to
such
springs
as
these
yet
these
operations
form
too
wide
a
field
to
permit
of
our
keeping
to
it
alone
in
this
history
in
the
case
of
many
philosophers
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
confine
oneself
to
the
original
authors
but
in
many
periods
in
which
we
cannot
obtain
original
sources
seeing
that
they
have
not
been
preserved
to
us
as
for
instance
in
that
of
the
older
greek
philosophy
we
must
certainly
confine
our
attention
simply
to
historians
and
other
writers
there
are
other
periods
too
where
it
is
desirable
that
others
should
have
read
the
works
of
the
philosophers
and
that
we
should
receive
abstracts
therefrom
several
schoolmen
have
left
behind
them
works
of
sixteen
twentyfour
and
twentysix
folios
and
hence
we
must
in
their
case
confine
ourselves
to
the
researches
of
others
many
philosophic
works
are
also
rare
and
hence
difficult
to
obtain
many
philosophers
are
for
the
most
part
important
from
an
historic
or
literary
point
of
view
only
and
hence
we
may
limit
ourselves
to
the
compilations
in
which
they
are
dealt
with
the
most
noteworthy
works
on
the
history
of
philosophy
are
however
the
following
regarding
which
i
refer
for
particulars
to
the
summary
of
tennemanns
history
of
philosophy
by
a
wendt
since
i
do
not
wish
to
give
any
complete
list
1
one
of
the
first
histories
of
philosophy
which
is
only
interesting
as
an
attempt
is
the
history
of
philosophy
by
thomas
stanley

this
history
is
no
longer
much
used
and
only
contains
the
old
philosophic
schools
in
the
form
of
sects
and
as
if
no
new
ones
had
existed
that
is
to
say
it
keeps
to
the
old
belief
commonly
held
at
that
time
that
there
only
were
ancient
philosophies
and
that
the
period
of
philosophy
came
to
an
end
with
christianity
as
if
philosophy
were
something
belonging
to
heathendom
and
the
truth
only
could
be
found
in
christianity
in
it
a
distinction
was
drawn
between
truth
as
it
is
created
from
the
natural
reason
in
the
ancient
philosophies
and
the
revealed
truth
of
the
christian
religion
in
which
there
was
consequently
no
longer
any
philosophy
in
the
time
of
the
revival
of
learning
there
certainly
were
no
proper
philosophies
and
above
all
in
stanleys
time

treats

diffusely

without
any

the

the
whole

a
melancholy
example
of
how
a

can
occupy

whole

with
the

of

have

of

he

they
keep
to

when

the
eighth
part
the
scholastic
philosophy
occupies
two
volumes
the
philosophies
are
fully
described
and
the
more
modern
times
are
better
done
than
the
ancient
the
philosophies
of
recent
times
are
easier
to
describe
since
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
an
abstract
or
to
interpret
straight
on
for
the
thoughts
contained
in
them
lie
nearer
to
ours
it
is
otherwise
with
the
ancient
philosophers
because
they
stand
in
another
stage
of
the
notion
and
on
this
account
they
are
likewise
more
difficult
to
grasp
that
is
to
say
what
is
old
is
easily
overthrown
by
something
else
more
familiar
to
us
and
where
tennemann
comes
across
such
he
is
almost
useless
in
aristotle
for
instance
the
misinterpretation
is
so
great
that
tennemann
foists
upon
him
what
is
directly
opposite
to
his
beliefs
and
thus
from
the
adoption
of
the
opposite
to
what
tennemann
asserts
to
be
aristotles
opinion
a
correct
idea
of
aristotelian
philosophy
is
arrived
at
tennemann
is
then
candid
enough
to
place
the
reference
to
aristotle
underneath
the
text
so
that
the
original
and
the
interpretation
often
contradict
one
another
tennemann
thinks
that
it
is
really
the
case
that
the
historian
should
have
no
philosophy
and
he
glories
in
that
yet
he
really
has
a
system
and
he
is
a
critical
philosopher
he
praises
philosophers
their
work
and
their
genius
and
yet
the
end
of
the
lay
is
that
all
of
them
will
be
pronounced
to
be
wanting
in
that
they
have
one
defect
which
is
not
to
be
kantian
philosophers
and
not
yet
to
have
sought
the
source
of
knowledge
from
this
the
result
is
that
the
truth
could
not
be
known

compendiums

to
be

it
is
astonishing
to

what
is

without
any

whether

method
of
treatment
adopted
in
this
history
of
philosophy
as
regards
external
history
i
shall
only
touch
upon
that
which
is
the
concern
of
universal
history
the
spirit
or
the
principle
of
the
times
and
hence
i
will
treat
of
conditions
of
life
in
reference
to
the
outstanding
philosophers
of
philosophies
however
only
those
are
to
be
made
mention
of
the
principles
of
which
have
caused
some
sensation
and
through
which
science
has
made
an
advance
hence
i
shall
put
aside
many
names
which
would
be
taken
up
in
a
learned
treatise
but
which
are
of
little
value
in
respect
to
philosophy
the
history
of
the
dissemination
of
a
doctrine
its
fate
those
who
have
merely
taught
a
particular
doctrine
i
pass
over
as
the
deduction
of
the
whole
world
from
one
particular
principle
the
demand
that
in
philosophy
an
historian
should
have
no
system
should
put
into
the
philosophy
nothing
of
his
own
nor
assail
it
with
his
ideas
seems
a
plausible
one
the
history
of
philosophy
should
show
just
this
impartiality
and
it
seems
in
so
far
that
to
give
only
summaries
of
the
philosophers
proves
a
success
he
who
understands
nothing
of
the
matter
and
has
no
system
but
merely
historic
knowledge
will
certainly
be
impartial
but
political
history
has
to
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
history
of
philosophy
that
is
to
say
though
in
the
former
one
is
not
indeed
at
liberty
to
limit
oneself
to
representing
the
events
chronologically
only
one
can
yet
keep
to
what
is
entirely
objective
as
is
done
in
the
homeric
epic
thus
herodotus
and
thucydides
as
free
men
let
the
objective
world
do
freely
and
independently
as
it
would
they
have
added
nothing
of
their
own
neither
have
they
taken
and
judged
before
their
tribunal
the
actions
which
they
represented
yet
even
in
political
history
there
is
also
a
particular
end
kept
in
view
in
livy
the
main
points
are
the
roman
rule
its
enlargement
and
the
perfecting
of
the
constitution
we
see
rome
arise
defend
itself
and
exercise
its
mastery
it
is
thus
that
the
selfdeveloping
reason
in
the
history
of
philosophy
makes
of
itself
an
end
and
this
end
is
not
foreign
or
imported
but
is
the
matter
itself
which
lies
at
the
basis
as
universal
and
with
which
the
individual
forms
of
themselves
correspond
thus
when
the
history
of
philosophy
has
to
tell
of
deeds
in
history
we
first
ask
what
a
deed
in
philosophy
is
and
whether
any
particular
thing
is
philosophic
or
not
in
external
history
everything
is
in
actioncertainly
there
is
in
it
what
is
important
and
that
which
is
unimportantbut
action
is
the
idea
immediately
placed
before
us
this
is
not
the
case
in
philosophy
and
on
this
account
the
history
of
philosophy
cannot
be
treated
throughout
without
the
introduction
of
the
historians
views
oriental
philosophy
the
first
philosophy
in
order
is
the
socalled
oriental
which
however
does
not
enter
into
the
substance
or
range
of
our
subject
as
represented
here
its
position
is
preliminary
and
we
only
deal
with
it
at
all
in
order
to
account
for
not
treating
of
it
at
greater
length
and
to
show
in
what
relation
it
stands
to
thought
and
to
true
philosophy
the
expression
eastern
philosophy
is
specially
employed
in
reference
to
the
period
in
which
this
great
universal
oriental
conception
aroused
the
eastthe
land
of
circumscription
and
of
limitation
where
the
spirit
of
subjectivity
reigns
more
particularly
in
the
first
centuries
of
christendomthat
significant
perioddid
these
great
oriental
ideas
penetrate
into
italy
and
in
the
gnostic
philosophy
they
began
to
force
the
idea
of
the
illimitable
into
the
western
mind
until
in
the
church
the
latter
again
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
ascendency
and
hence
in
firmly
establishing
the
divine
that
which
we
call
eastern
philosophy
is
more
properly
the
religious
mode
of
thought
and
the
conception
of
the
world
belonging
generally
to
the
orientals
and
approximates
very
closely
to
philosophy
and
to
consider
the
oriental
idea
of
religion
just
as
if
it
were
religious
philosophy
is
to
give
the
main
reason
why
it
is
so
like
we
do
not
similarly
maintain
that
the
roman
greek
and
christian
religions
constitute
philosophy
these
bear
all
the
less
similarity
thereto
in
that
the
greek
and
roman
gods
as
also
christ
and
the
god
of
the
jews
on
account
of
the
principle
of
individual
freedom
which
penetrates
the
greek
and
still
more
the
christian
element
make
their
appearance
immediately
as
the
explicit
personal
forms
which
being
mythological
or
christian
must
first
be
themselves
interpreted
and
changed
into
a
philosophic
form
in
the
case
of
eastern
religion
on
the
contrary
we
are
much
more
directly
reminded
of
the
philosophic
conception
for
since
in
the
east
the
element
of
subjectivity
has
not
come
forth
religious
ideas
are
not
individualized
and
we
have
predominating
a
kind
of
universal
ideas
which
hence
present
the
appearance
of
being
philosophic
ideas
and
thoughts
the
orientals
certainly
have
also
individual
forms
such
as
brahma
vishnu
and
civa
but
because
freedom
is
wanting
the
individuality
is
not
real
but
merely
superficial
and
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
when
we
suppose
that
we
have
to
deal
with
a
human
form
the
same
loses
itself
again
and
expands
into
the
illimitable
just
as
we
hear
amongst
the
greeks
of
a
uranus
and
chronosof
time
individualizedwe
find
with
the
persians
zeroane
akerene
but
it
is
time
unlimited
we
find
ormuzd
and
ahriman
to
be
altogether
general
forms
and
ideas
they
appear
to
be
universal
principles
which
thus
seem
to
bear
a
relationship
to
philosophy
or
even
seem
to
be
themselves
philosophic
just
as
the
content
of
the
eastern
religions
god
the
essentially
existent
the
eternal
is
comprehended
somewhat
in
the
light
of
universal
we
find
the
relative
positions
of
individuals
to
him
to
be
the
same
in
the
eastern
religions
the
first
condition
is
that
only
the
one
substance
shall
as
such
be
the
true
and
that
the
individual
neither
can
have
within
himself
nor
can
he
attain
to
any
value
in
as
far
as
he
maintains
himself
as
against
the
being
in
and
for
itself
he
can
have
true
value
only
through
an
identification
with
this
substance
in
which
he
ceases
to
exist
as
subject
and
disappears
into
unconsciousness
in
the
greek
and
christian
religion
on
the
other
hand
the
subject
knows
himself
to
be
free
and
must
be
maintained
as
such
and
because
the
individual
in
this
way
makes
himself
independent
it
is
undoubtedly
much
more
difficult
for
thought
to
free
itself
from
this
individuality
and
to
constitute
itself
in
independence
the
higher
point
of
view
implicitly
contained
in
the
greek
individual
freedom
this
happier
larger
life
makes
more
difficult
the
work
of
thought
which
is
to
give
due
value
to
the
universal
in
the
east
on
the
contrary
the
substantial
in
religion
is
certainly
on
its
own
view
the
principal
matter
the
essentialand
with
it
lawlessness
the
absence
of
individual
consciousness
is
immediately
connectedand
this
substance
is
undoubtedly
a
philosophic
idea
the
negation
of
the
finite
is
also
present
but
in
such
a
manner
that
the
individual
only
reaches
to
its
freedom
in
this
unity
with
the
substantial
in
as
far
as
in
the
eastern
mind
reflection
consciousness
come
through
thought
to
distinction
and
to
the
determination
of
principles
there
exist
such
categories
and
such
definite
ideas
not
in
unity
with
the
substantial
the
destruction
of
all
that
is
particular
either
is
an
illimitable
the
exaltitude
of
the
east
or
in
so
far
as
that
which
is
posited
and
determined
for
itself
is
known
it
is
a
dry
dead
understanding
which
cannot
take
up
the
speculative
notion
into
itself
to
that
which
is
true
this
finite
can
exist
only
as
immersed
in
substance
if
kept
apart
from
this
it
remains
dead
and
arid
we
thus
find
only
dry
understanding
amongst
the
easterns
a
mere
enumeration
of
determinations
a
logic
like
the
wolffian
of
old
it
is
the
same
as
in
their
worship
which
is
complete
immersion
in
devotion
and
then
an
endless
number
of
ceremonials
and
of
religious
actions
and
this
on
the
other
side
is
the
exaltitude
of
that
illimitable
in
which
everything
disappears
there
are
two
eastern
nations
with
which
i
wish
just
now
to
dealthe
chinese
and
the
indian
a
chinese
philosophy
it
is
true
of
the
chinese
as
well
as
of
the
indians
that
they
have
a
great
reputation
for
culture
but
this
as
well
as
the
amount
of
indian
literature
which
exists
has
largely
diminished
through
a
further
knowledge
of
it
the
great
knowledge
of
these
people
bears
upon
such
subjects
as
religion
science
the
constitution
and
administration
of
the
state
poetry
handicrafts
and
commerce
but
when
we
compare
the
laws
and
constitution
of
china
with
the
european
we
find
that
we
can
only
do
so
in
respect
of
what
is
formal
for
the
content
is
very
different
it
is
also
felt
however
consistently
they
may
be
constituted
as
to
form
that
they
cannot
find
their
place
with
us
that
we
could
not
allow
of
their
giving
us
satisfaction
and
that
they
take
the
place
of
law
or
rather
that
they
put
an
end
to
it
it
is
the
same
thing
when
we
compare
indian
poetry
with
european
considered
as
a
mere
play
of
the
imagination
it
is
as
brilliant
rich
and
cultured
as
that
of
any
other
people
but
in
poetry
we
have
to
do
with
content
and
that
is
the
important
part
of
it
even
the
homeric
poetry
is
not
serious
for
us
and
hence
such
poetry
cannot
last
it
is
not
the
lack
of
genius
in
the
oriental
poetry
the
amount
of
genius
is
the
same
and
the
form
may
be
very
much
developed
but
the
content
remains
confined
within
certain
bounds
and
cannot
satisfy
us
nor
can
it
be
our
content
this
is
at
outset
a
fact
applying
universally
to
such
comparisons
inasmuch
as
men
let
themselves
be
dazzled
by
form
making
it
equal
with
or
even
preferring
it
to
ours

confucius
the
first
subject
of
remark
with
regard
to
the
chinese
respects
the
teaching
of
confucius
500
years
before
christ
which
made
a
great
sensation
in
liebnitz
time
this
teaching
is
a
moral
philosophy
confucius
has
besides
commented
upon
the
old
traditional
principles
of
the
chinese
his
high
moral
teaching
however
gave
him
his
great
fame
and
that
teaching
is
the
authority
most
esteemed
in
china
confucius
biography
has
been
translated
by
french
missionaries
from
the
original
chinese
from
this
he
appears
to
have
been
almost
contemporaneous
with
thales
to
have
been
for
a
considerable
time
minister
to
have
then
fallen
into
disfavour
lost
his
place
and
lived
and
philosophized
amongst
his
own
friends
while
still
being
often
asked
to
give
advice
we
have
conversations
between
confucius
and
his
followers
in
which
there
is
nothing
definite
further
than
a
commonplace
moral
put
in
the
form
of
good
sound
doctrine
which
may
be
found
as
well
expressed
and
better
in
every
place
and
amongst
every
people
cicero
gives
us
de
officiis
a
book
of
moral
teaching
more
comprehensive
and
better
than
all
the
books
of
confucius
he
is
hence
only
a
man
who
has
a
certain
amount
of
practical
and
worldly
wisdomone
with
whom
there
is
no
speculative
philosophy
we
may
conclude
from
his
original
works
that
for
their
reputation
it
would
have
been
better
had
they
never
been
translated
the
treatise
which
the
jesuits
produced9
is
however
more
a
paraphrase
than
a
translation
2
the
philosophy
of
the
yking
a
second
matter
of
remark
is
that
the
chinese
have
also
taken
up
their
attention
with
abstract
thoughts
and
with
pure
categories
the
old
book
yking
or
the
book
of
principles
serves
as
the
foundation
for
such
it
contains
the
wisdom
of
the
chinese
and
its
origin
is
attributed
to
fohi
that
which
is
there
by
him
related
passes
into
what
is
quite
mythological
fabulous
and
even
senseless
the
main
point
in
it
is
the
ascription
to
him
of
the
discovery
of
a
table
with
certain
signs
or
figures
hotu
which
he
saw
on
the
back
of
a
horsedragon
as
it
rose
out
of
the
river10
this
table
contains
parallel
lines
above
one
another
which
have
a
symbolical
signification
and
the
chinese
say
that
these
lines
are
the
foundation
of
their
characters
as
also
of
their
philosophy
these
symbols
are
quite
abstract
categories
and
consequently
the
most
superficial
determinations
of
the
understanding
it
must
certainly
be
considered
that
pure
thoughts
are
brought
to
consciousness
but
in
this
case
we
make
no
advance
merely
remaining
stationary
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
the
concrete
is
not
conceived
of
speculatively
but
is
simply
taken
from
ordinary
ideas
inasmuch
as
it
is
expressed
in
accordance
with
their
forms
of
representation
and
of
perception
hence
in
this
collection
of
concrete
principles
there
is
not
to
be
found
in
one
single
instance
a
sensuous
conception
of
universal
natural
or
spiritual
powers
to
satisfy
the
curious
i
will
give
these
principles
in
greater
detail
the
two
fundamental
figures
are
a
horizontal
line

yang
and
the
one
which
is
broken
into
two
equal
parts

yin
the
first
which
is
the
perfect
the
father
the
manlike
the
unity
such
as
is
represented
by
the
pythagoreans
represents
the
affirmative
the
second
is
the
imperfect
the
mother
the
womanly
the
duality
and
the
negation
these
signs
are
held
in
high
esteem
for
they
are
considered
to
be
the
principles
of
things
first
of
all
they
are
placed
in
combination
of
two
from
which
four
figures
result




or
the
great
yang
the
little
yang
the
little
yin
and
the
great
yin
the
signification
of
these
four
representations
is
matter
as
perfect
and
imperfect
the
two
yangs
are
perfect
matter
the
first
is
in
the
category
of
youth
and
power
the
second
is
the
same
matter
but
as
old
and
powerless
the
third
and
fourth
images
where
yin
constitutes
the
basis
are
imperfect
matter
which
has
again
the
two
determinations
of
youth
and
age
strength
and
weakness
these
lines
are
further
united
in
sets
of
three
and
thus
eight
figures
result
which
are
called
kua








i
will
give
the
interpretation
of
these
kua
just
to
show
how
superficial
it
is
the
first
sign
containing
the
great
yang
and
the
yang
is
the
heavens
tien
or
the
allpervading
ether
the
heavens
to
the
chinese
means
what
is
highest
and
it
has
been
a
great
source
of
division
amongst
the
missionaries
whether
they
ought
to
call
the
christian
god
tien
or
not
the
second
sign
is
pure
water
tui
the
third
pure
fire
li
the
fourth
thunder
tschin
the
fifth
wind
siun
the
sixth
common
water
kan
the
seventh
mountains
ken
the
eighth
the
earth
kuen
we
should
not
place
heaven
thunder
wind
and
mountains
on
the
same
footing
we
may
thus
obtain
a
philosophic
origin
for
everything
out
of
these
abstract
thoughts
of
absolute
unity
and
duality
all
symbols
have
the
advantage
of
indicating
thoughts
and
of
calling
up
significations
and
in
this
way
such
are
likewise
present
there
thought
thus
forms
the
first
beginning
but
afterwards
it
goes
into
the
clouds
and
philosophy
does
likewise
therefore
if
windischmann11
in
his
commentary
recognizes
in
this
system
of
confucius
a
thorough
interconnection
between
all
kua
in
the
whole
series
it
should
be
remembered
that
not
a
particle
of
the
notion
is
to
be
found
in
it
united
further
in
sets
of
four
the
lines
produce
sixtyfour
figures
which
the
chinese
consider
to
be
the
origin
of
their
characters
since
there
have
been
added
to
these
straight
lines
those
which
are
perpendicular
and
inclined
in
different
directions
in
schuking
there
is
also
a
chapter
on
chinese
wisdom
where
the
five
elements
from
which
everything
is
made
make
their
appearance
these
are
fire
water
wood
metal
and
earth
which
exist
all
in
confusion
and
which
we
should
no
more
than
we
did
before
allow
to
be
principles
the
first
canon
in
the
law
is
found
in
the
schuking
as
the
naming
of
the
five
elements
the
second
considerations
upon
the
last
and
so
it
goes
on12
universal
abstraction
with
the
chinese
thus
goes
on
to
what
is
concrete
although
in
accordance
with
an
external
kind
of
order
only
and
without
containing
anything
that
is
sensuous
this
is
the
principle
of
all
chinese
wisdom
and
of
all
the
objects
of
study
in
china

the
sect
of
the
taosee
there
is
yet
another
separate
sect
that
of
the
taosee
the
followers
of
which
are
not
mandarins
and
attached
to
the
state
religion
nor
are
they
buddhists
or
lamaics
the
originator
of
this
philosophy
and
the
one
who
was
closely
connected
with
it
in
his
life
is
laots
who
was
born
in
the
end
of
the
seventh
century
before
christ
and
who
was
older
than
confucius
for
this
representative
of
the
more
political
school
went
to
him
in
order
to
ask
his
advice
the
book
of
the
laots
taoking
is
certainly
not
included
in
the
proper
kings
and
has
not
their
authority
but
it
is
an
important
work
amongst
the
taosts
or
the
followers
of
reason
who
call
their
rule
in
life
taotao
which
means
the
observation
of
the
dictates
or
the
laws
of
reason
they
dedicate
their
lives
to
the
study
of
reason
and
maintain
that
he
who
knows
reason
in
its
source
will
possess
universal
science
remedies
for
every
ill
and
all
virtue
he
will
also
have
obtained
a
supernatural
power
of
being
able
to
fly
to
heaven
and
of
not
dying13
his
followers
say
of
laots
himself
that
he
is

who
as
man
became
the
everexistent

we
still
have
his
principal
writings
they
have
been
taken
to
vienna
and
i
have
seen
them
there
myself
one
special
passage
is
frequently
taken
from
them
without
a
name
tao14

the
beginning
of

and
with
a
name
she
is
the
mother
of
the
universe
it
is
only
in
her
imperfect
state
that
she
is
considered
with
affection
who
desires
to
know
her
must
be
devoid
of
passions
abel
rmusat
says
that
taken
at
its
best
this
might
be
expressed
by
the
greek
in

the
celebrated
passage
which
is
often
quoted
by
the
ancients

tried

it

it
can
be

in

been
expressed

this

negation
only
in
an
affirmative
form

if
philosophy
has
got
no
further
than
to
such
expression
it
still
stands
on
its
most
elementary
stage
what
is
there
to
be
found
in
all
this
learning
b
indian
philosophy
if
we
had
formerly
the
satisfaction
of
believing
in
the
antiquity
of
the
indian
wisdom
and
of
holding
it
in
respect
we
now
have
ascertained
through
being
acquainted
with
the
great
astronomical
works
of
the
indians
the
inaccuracy
of
all
figures
quoted
nothing
can
be
more
confused
nothing
more
imperfect
than
the
chronology
of
the
indians
no
people
which
has
attained
to
culture
in
astronomy
mathematics
c
is
as
incapable
for
history
in
it
they
have
neither
stability
nor
coherence
it
was
believed
that
such
was
to
be
had
in
the
time
of
wikramaditya
who
was
supposed
to
have
lived
about
50
bc
and
under
whose
reign
the
poet
kalidasa
author
of
sakontala
lived
but
further
research
discovered
half
a
dozen
wikramadityas
and
careful
investigation
has
placed
this
epoch
in
our
eleventh
century
the
indians
have
lines
of
kings
and
an
enormous
quantity
of
names
but
everything
is
vague
we
know
how
the
ancient
glory
of
this
land
was
held
in
the
highest
estimation
even
by
the
greeks
just
as
they
knew
about
the
gymnosophists
who
were
excellent
men
though
people
ventured
to
call
them
otherwisemen
who
having
dedicated
themselves
to
a
contemplative
life
lived
in
abstraction
from
external
life
and
hence
wandering
about
in
hordes
like
the
cynics
renounced
all
ordinary
desires
these
latter
in
their
capacity
as
philosophers
were
also
more
especially
known
to
the
greeks
inasmuch
as
philosophy
is
also
supposed
to
exist
in
this
abstraction
in
which
all
the
relationships
of
ordinary
life
are
set
aside
and
this
abstraction
is
a
feature
which
we
wish
to
bring
into
prominence
and
consider
indian
culture
is
developed
to
a
high
degree
and
it
is
imposing
but
its
philosophy
is
identical
with
its
religion
and
the
objects
to
which
attention
is
devoted
in
philosophy
are
the
same
as
those
which
we
find
brought
forward
in
religion
hence
the
holy
books
or
vedas
also
form
the
general
groundwork
for
philosophy
we
know
the
vedas
tolerably
well
they
contain
principally
prayers
addressed
to
the
many
representations
of
god
direction
as
to
ceremonials
offerings
c
they
are
also
of
the
most
various
periods
many
parts
are
very
ancient
and
others
have
taken
their
origin
later
as
for
instance
that
which
treats
of
the
service
of
vishnu
the
vedas
even
constitute
the
basis
for
the
atheistical
indian
philosophies
these
too
are
not
wanting
in
gods
and
they
pay
genuine
attention
to
the
vedas
indian
philosophy
thus
stands
within
religion
just
as
scholastic
philosophy
stands
within
christian
dogmatism
having
at
its
basis
and
presupposing
the
doctrines
of
the
church
mythology
takes
the
form
of
incarnation
or
individualization
from
which
it
might
be
thought
that
it
would
be
opposed
to
philosophy
in
its
universality
and
ideality
incarnation
is
not
however
here
taken
in
so
definite
a
sense
for
almost
everything
is
supposed
to
partake
of
it
and
the
very
thing
that
seems
to
define
itself
as
individuality
falls
back
directly
within
the
mist
of
the
universal
the
idea
of
the
indians
more
appropriately
expressed
is
that
there
is
one
universal
substance
which
may
be
laid
hold
of
in
the
abstract
or
in
the
concrete
and
out
of
which
everything
takes
its
origin
the
summit
of
mans
attainment
is
that
he
as
consciousness
should
make
himself
identical
with
the
substance
in
religion
by
means
of
worship
offerings
and
rigid
acts
of
expiation
and
in
philosophy
through
the
instrumentality
of
pure
thought
it
is
quite
recently
that
we
first
obtained
a
definite
knowledge
of
indian
philosophy
in
the
main
we
understand
by
it
religious
ideas
but
in
modern
times
men
have
learned
to
recognize
real
philosophic
writings
colebrooke17
in
particular
communicated
abstracts
to
us
from
two
indian
philosophic
works
and
this
forms
the
first
contribution
we
have
had
in
reference
to
indian
philosophy
what
frederick
von
schlegel
says
about
the
wisdom
of
the
indians
is
taken
from
their
religious
ideas
only
he
is
one
of
the
first
germans
who
took
up
his
attention
with
indian
philosophy
yet
his
work
bore
little
fruit
because
he
himself
read
no
more
than
the
index
to
the
ramayana
according
to
the
abstract
before
mentioned
the
indians
possess
ancient
philosophic
systems
one
part
of
these
they
consider
to
be
orthodox
and
those
which
tally
with
the
vedas
are
particularly
included
the
others
are
held
to
be
heterodox
and
as
not
corresponding
with
the
teaching
of
the
holy
books
the
one
part
which
really
is
orthodox
has
no
other
purpose
than
to
make
the
deliverances
of
the
vedas
clearer
or
to
derive
from
the
text
of
these
original
treatises
an
ingeniously
thoughtout
psychology
this
system
is
called
mimansa
and
two
schools
proceed
from
it
distinguished
from
these
there
are
other
systems
amongst
which
the
two
chief
are
those
of
the
sanchya
and
nyaya
the
former
again
divides
into
two
parts
which
are
however
different
in
form
only
the
nyaya
is
the
most
developed
it
more
particularly
gives
the
rules
for
reasoning
and
may
be
compared
to
the
logic
of
aristotle
colebrooke
has
made
abstracts
from
both
of
these
systems
and
he
says
that
there
are
many
ancient
treatises
upon
them
and
that
the
versus
memoriales
from
them
are
very
extensive
1
the
sanchya
philosophy
of
capila
the
originator
of
the
sanchya
is
called
capila
and
he
was
an
ancient
sage
of
whom
it
was
said
that
he
was
a
son
of
brahma
and
one
of
the
seven
great
holy
men
others
say
that
he
was
an
incarnation
of
vishnu
like
his
disciple
asuri
and
that
he
was
identified
with
fire
as
to
the
age
of
the
aphorisms
sutras
of
capila
colebrooke
can
say
nothing
he
merely
mentions
that
they
were
already
mentioned
in
other
very
ancient
books
but
he
does
not
feel
able
to
say
anything
definite
in
the
matter
the
sanchya
is
divided
into
different
schools
of
which
there
are
two
or
three
which
however
differ
from
one
another
only
in
a
few
particulars
it
is
held
to
be
partly
heterodox
and
partly
orthodox
the
real
aim
of
all
indian
schools
and
systems
of
philosophy
whether
atheistic
or
theistic
is
to
teach
the
means
whereby
eternal
happiness
can
be
attained
before
as
well
as
after
death
the
vedas
say
what
has
to
be
known
is
the
soul
it
must
be
distinguished
from
nature
and
hence
it
will
never
come
again
that
means
that
it
is
exempt
from
metempsychosis
and
likewise
from
bodily
form
so
that
it
does
not
after
death
make
its
appearance
in
another
body
this
blessed
condition
therefore
is
according
to
the
sanchya
a
perfect
and
eternal
release
from
every
kind
of
ill
it
readsthrough
thought
the
true
science
this
freedom
can
be
accomplished
the
temporal
and
worldly
means
of
procuring
enjoyment
and
keeping
off
spiritual
or
bodily
evil
are
insufficient
even
the
methods
advocated
by
the
vedas
are
not
effectual
for
the
purpose
and
these
are
found
in
the
revealed
form
of
worship
or
in
the
performance
of
religious
ceremonies
as
directed
in
the
vedas
the
offering
up
of
animals
is
specially
valuable
as
such
a
means
and
in
this
regard
the
sanchya
rejects
the
vedas
such
an
offering
is
not
pure
because
it
is
connected
with
the
death
of
animals
and
the
main
tenet
in
the
former
is
not
to
injure
any
animal
other
methods
of
deliverance
from
evil
are
in
the
excessive
acts
of
penance
performed
by
the
indians
to
which
a
retreat
within
themselves
is
added
now
when
the
indian
thus
internally
collects
himself
and
retreats
within
his
own
thoughts
the
moment
of
such
pure
concentration
is
called
brahma
the
one
and
the
clearly
supersensuous
state
which
the
understanding
calls
the
highest
possible
existence
when
this
is
so
with
me
then
am
i
brahma
such
a
retreat
into
thought
takes
place
in
the
religion
as
well
as
in
the
philosophy
of
the
indians
and
they
assert
with
reference
to
this
state
of
bliss
that
it
is
what
is
highest
of
all
and
that
even
the
gods
do
not
attain
to
it
indra
for
example
the
god
of
the
visible
heavens
is
much
lower
than
the
soul
in
this
life
of
internal
contemplation
many
thousand
indras
have
passed
away
but
the
soul
is
exempt
from
every
change
the
sanchya
only
differs
from
religion
in
that
it
has
a
complete
system
of
thought
or
logic
and
that
the
abstraction
is
not
made
a
reduction
to
what
is
empty
but
is
raised
up
into
the
significance
of
a
determinate
thought
this
science
is
stated
to
subsist
in
the
correct
knowledge
of
the
principleswhich
may
be
outwardly
perceptible
or
notof
the
material
and
of
the
immaterial
world
the
sanchya
system
separates
itself
into
three
parts
the
method
of
knowledge
the
object
of
knowledge
and
the
determinate
form
of
the
knowledge
of
principles
a
as
regards
the
methods
of
obtaining
knowledge
the
sanchya
says
that
there
are
three
kinds
of
evidence
possible
first
of
all
that
of
perception
secondly
that
of
inference
thirdly
that
of
affirmation
which
is
the
origin
of
all
others

as
reverence
for
authority
a
teachable
disposition
and
tradition
perception
is
said
to
require
no
explanation
inference
is
a
conclusion
arrived
at
from
the
operation
of
cause
and
effect
by
which
one
determination
merely
passes
over
into
a
second
there
are
three
forms
because
inferences
are
made
either
from
cause
to
effect
from
effect
to
cause
or
in
accordance
with

relations

forth
the
following
principles

five
very
subtle
particles
rudiments
or
atoms
which
are
only
perceptible
to
an
existence
of
a
higher
order
and
not
through
the
senses
of
men
these
proceed
from
the
principle
of
consciousness
and
bring
forth
on
their
own
account

the
eleven
succeeding
principles
are
the
organs
of
feeling
which
are
produced
by
the
personality
there
are
ten
external
organs

five
senses

principles
are

the
soul
in
this
very
unsystematic
form
we
see
only
the
first
beginnings
of
reflection
which
seem
to
be
put
together
as
a
universal
but
this
arrangement
is
to
say
nothing
of
being
unsystematic
not
even
intelligent
formerly
the
principles
were
outside
of
and
successive
to
one
another
their
unity
is
found
in
the
soul
it
is
said
of
the
latter
that
it
is
not
produced
and
is
not
productive
it
is
individual
and
hence
there
are
many
souls
it
is
sentient
eternal
immaterial
and
unchangeable
colebrooke
here
distinguishes
between
the
theistic
and
atheistic
systems
of
the
sanchya
since
the
former
not
only
admits
of
individual
souls
but
also
upholds
god
iswara
as
the
ruler
of
the
world
the
knowledge
of
the
soul
still
remains
the
principal
point
it
is
through
the
consideration
of
nature
and
through
abstraction
from
nature
that
the
unity
of
the
soul
with
nature
is
brought
about
just
as
the
lame
man
and
the
blind
are
brought
together
for
the
purposes
of
transport
and
of
guidancethe
one
being
the
bearer
and
being
directed
nature
the
other
being
borne
and
guiding
soul
through
the
union
of
soul
and
nature
the
creation
is
effected
and
this
consists
in
the
development
of
intelligence
and
of
other
principles
this
unity
is
the
actual
support
for
that
which
is
and
the
means
by
which
it
is
so
maintained
it
is
at
the
same
time
an
important
consideration
that
the
negation
of
the
object
which
is
contained
in
thought
is
necessary
in
order
to
comprehend
this
reflection
has
far
more
depth
than
the
ordinary
talk
about
immediate
consciousness
the
view
is
superficial
and
perverted
which
maintains
the
easterns
to
have
lived
in
unity
with
nature
the
soul
in
its
activity
mind
is
indeed
undoubtedly
in
relation
with
nature
and
in
unity
with
the
truth
of
nature
but
this
true
unity
essentially
contains
the
moment
of
the
negation
of
nature
as
it
is
in
its
immediacy
such
an
immediate
unity
is
merely
the
life
of
animals
the
life
and
perception
of
the
senses
the
idea
which
is
present
to
the
indians
is
thus
indeed
the
unity
of
nature
and
of
soul
but
the
spiritual
is
only
one
with
nature
in
so
far
as
it
is
within
itself
and
at
the
same
time
manifests
the
natural
as
negative
as
regards
the
creation
this
is
further
signified
the
souls
desire
and
end
is
for
satisfaction
and
freedom
and
with
this
view
it
is
endowed
with
a
subtle
environment
in
which
all
the
abovementioned
principles
are
contained
but
only
in
their
elementary
development
something
of
our
ideal
or
of
the
implicit
is
present
in
this
idea
it
is
like
the
blossom
which
is
ideally
in
the
bud
and
yet
is
not
actual
and
real
the
expression
for
this
is
lingam
the
generative
power
of
nature
which
holds
a
high
place
in
the
estimation
of
all
indians
this
subtle
form
says
the
sanchya
also
assumes
a
coarse
bodily
shape
and
clothes
itself
in
several
garbs
and
as
a
means
of
preventing
the
descent
into
a
coarse
materiality
philosophic
contemplation
is
recommended
hitherto
we
have
observed
the
abstract
principles
the
following
is
to
be
noticed
regarding
the
creation
of
the
concrete
actuality
of
the
universe
the
bodily
creation
consists
of
the
soul
habited
in
a
material
body
it
comprehends
eight
orders
of
higher
beings
and
five
orders
of
lower
beings
which
constitutewith
men
who
form
a
single
classfourteen
orders
and
these
are
divided
into
three
worlds
or
classes
the
first
eight
orders
have
appellations
which
appear
in
indian
mythology
viz
brahma
prajapatis
indra
c
there
are
both
gods
and
demigods
and
brahma
himself
is
represented
here
as
if
he
were
created
the
five
lower
orders
are
composed
of
animals
the
fourfooted
animals
are
in
two
classes
birds
come
third
reptiles
fishes
and
insects
fourth
and
finally
vegetable
and
inorganic
nature
comes
fifth
the
abode
of
the
eight
higher
classes
is
in
heaven
they
are
it
is
said
in
the
enjoyment
of
that
which
is
good
and
virtuous
and
consequently
are
happy
though
still
they
are
but
imperfect
and
transient
underneath
is
the
seat
of
darkness
or
delusion
where
beings
of
the
lower
orders
live
and
between
is
the
world
of
men
where
untruth
or
passion
reigns
against
these
three
worlds
which
have
their
place
in
the
material
creation
the
system
places
yet
another
creation
and
that
is
the
intellectual
consisting
of
the
powers
of
understanding
and
the
senses
these
last
are
again
divided
into
four
classes
viz
those
determinations
which
impede
those
which
incapacitate
those
which
satisfy
and
those
which
perfect
the
intelligence
1
sixtytwo
of
the
impeding
determinations
are
adduced
eight
kinds
of
error
as
many
of
opinion
or
of
illusion
ten
of
passion
as
being
illusion
carried
to
extremity
eighteen
of
hate
or
sullenness
and
the
same
of
grief
here
there
is
shown
somewhat
of
an
empirical
psychological
and
observing
mode
of
treatment
2
the
incapacity
of
intelligence
has
again
eightandtwenty
variations
injury
want
of
organs
c
3
satisfaction
is
either
inward
or
outward
the
inward
satisfaction
is
fourfold
the
first
concerns
nature
the
whole
universal
or
substantial
and
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
that
philosophic
knowledge
is
a
modification
of
the
principle
of
nature
itself
with
which
there
is
immediately
united
the
anticipation
of
a
liberty
given
through
the
act
of
nature
yet
the
true
liberty
is
not
to
be
expected
as
an
act
of
nature
for
it
is
the
soul
which
has
to
bring
forth
that
liberty
through
itself
and
through
its
thinking
activity
the
second
satisfaction
is
in
the
belief
of
securing
liberty
through
ascetic
exercises
pains
torments
and
penances
the
third
has
to
do
with
timethe
idea
that
liberty
will
come
in
the
course
of
time
and
without
study
the
fourth
satisfaction
is
obtained
in
a
belief
in
luckin
believing
that
liberty
depends
on
fate
the
external
mode
of
obtaining
satisfaction
relates
to
continence
from
enjoyment
but
continence
from
sensuous
motives
such
as
dislike
to
the
unrest
of
acquisition
and
fear
of
the
evil
consequences
of
enjoyment

there
are
again
several
means
of
perfecting
the
intelligence
adduced
and
amongst
others
there
is
the
direct
psychological
mode
of
perfecting
mind
as
is
seen
in
the
act
of
reasoning
in
friendly
converse
and
so
on
this
we
may
find
indeed
in
our
applied
logic
there
is
still
somewhat
to
be
remarked
as
to
the
main
points
of
the
system
the
sanchya
and
likewise
the
other
indian
systems
of
philosophy
occupy
themselves
particularly
with
the
three
qualities
guna
of
the
absolute
idea
which
are
represented
as
substances
and
as
modifications
of
nature
it
is
noteworthy
that
in
the
observing
consciousness
of
the
indians
it
struck
them
that
what
is
true
and
in
and
for
itself
contains
three
determinations
and
the
notion
of
the
idea
is
perfected
in
three
moments
this
sublime
consciousness
of
the
trinity
which
we
find
again
in
plato
and
others
then
went
astray
in
the
region
of
thinking
contemplation
and
retains
its
place
only
in
religion
and
there
but
as
a
beyond
then
the
understanding
penetrated
through
it
declaring
it
to
be
senseless
and
it
was
kant
who
broke
open
the
road
once
more
to
its
comprehension
the
reality
and
totality
of
the
notion
of
everything
considered
in
its
substance
is
absorbed
by
the
triad
of
determinations
and
it
has
become
the
business
of
our
times
to
bring
this
to
consciousness
with
the
indians
this
consciousness
proceeded
from
sensuous
observation
merely
and
they
now
further
define
these
qualities
as
follows
the
first
and
highest
is
with
them
the
good
sattva
it
is
exalted
and
illuminatingallied
to
joy
and
felicityand
piety
predominates
within
it
it
prevails
in
fire
and
therefore
flames
rise
up
and
sparks
fly
upwards
if
it
has
ascendency
in
men
as
it
does
have
in
the
eight
higher
orders
it
is
the
origin
of
virtue
this
also
is
the
universalthroughout
and
in
every
aspect
the
affirmativein
abstract
form
the
second
and
mediate
quality
is
deceit
or
passion
najas
tejas
which
for
itself
is
blind
it
is
that
which
is
impure
harmful
hateful
it
is
active
vehement
and
restless
allied
to
evil
and
misfortune
being
prevalent
in
the
air
on
which
account
the
wind
moves
transversely
amongst
living
beings
it
is
the
cause
of
vice
the
third
and
last
quality
is
darkness
tamas
it
is
inert
and
obstructive
allied
to
care
dullness
and
disappointment
predominating
in
earth
and
water
and
hence
these
fall
down
and
tend
ever
downwards
with
living
beings
stupidity
takes
its
origin
in
this
the
first
quality
is
thus
the
unity
with
itself
the
second
the
manifestation
or
the
principle
of
difference
desire
disunion
as
wickedness
the
third
however
is
mere
negation
as
in
mythology
it
is
concretely
represented
in
the
form
of
siva
mahadeva
or
maheswara
the
god
of
change
or
destruction
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
important
distinction
is
that
the
third
principle
is
not
the
return
to
the
first
which
mind
and
idea
demand
and
which
is
effected
by
the
removal
of
the
negation
in
order
to
effect
a
reconciliation
with
itself
and
to
go
back
within
itself
with
the
indians
the
third
is
still
change
and
negation
these
three
qualities
are
represented
as
the
essential
being
of
nature
the
sanchya
says
we
speak
of
them
as
we
do
of
the
trees
in
a
wood
yet
this
is
a
bad
simile
for
the
wood
is
but
an
abstract
universal
in
which
the
individuals
are
independent
in
the
religious
ideas
of
the
vedas
where
these
qualities
also
appear
as
trimurti
they
are
spoken
of
as
if
they
were
successive
modifications
so
that
everything
was
darkness
first
then
received
the
command
to
transform
itself
and
in
this
manner
the
formwhich
however
is
a
worse
oneof
movement
and
activity
foulness
was
assumed
until
finally
by
yet
another
command
from
brahma
the
form
of
goodness
was
adopted
further
determinations
of
the
intelligence
in
respect
of
these
qualities
follow
it
is
said
that
eight
kinds
of
intelligence
are
counted
of
which
four
pertain
to
what
is
goodvirtue
first
science
and
knowledge
second
thirdly
freedom
from
passion
which
may
have
either
an
external
and
sensuous
motivethe
repugnance
to
disturbanceor
be
of
an
intellectual
nature
and
emanate
from
the
conviction
that
nature
is
a
dream
a
mere
jugglery
and
sham
the
fourth
is
power
this
last
is
eightfold
and
hence
eight
special
qualities
are
given
as
being
present
viz
the
power
to
contract
oneself
into
a
quite
small
form
for
which
everything
shall
be
penetrable
the
power
to
expand
into
a
gigantic
body
the
power
to
become
light
enough
to
be
able
to
mount
to
the
sun
on
a
sunbeam
the
possession
of
unlimited
power
of
action
in
the
organs
so
that
with
the
fingertips
the
moon
may
be
touched
irresistible
will
so
that
for
instance
one
may
dive
into
the
earth
as
easily
as
in
the
water
mastery
over
all
living
and
lifeless
existence
the
power
to
change
the
course
of
nature
and
the
power
to
perform
everything
that
is
wished
the
feeling
that
such
transcendent
power
colebrooke
goes
on
is
within
the
reach
of
man
in
his
life
is
not
peculiar
to
the
sanchya
sect
but
is
common
to
all
systems
and
religious
ideas
and
such
a
power
is
in
good
faith
ascribed
to
many
holy
men
and
brahmins
in
dramas
and
popular
narratives
sensuous
evidence
is
of
no
account
as
opposed
to
this
for
with
the
indian
perception
of
the
senses
is
generally
speaking
absent
everything
adopts
the
form
of
imaginary
images
every
dream
is
esteemed
just
as
much
as
truth
and
actuality
the
sanchya
ascribes
this
power
to
man
in
so
far
as
he
elevates
himself
through
the
working
of
his
thought
into
inward
subjectivity
colebrooke
says
the
yogasastra
names
in
one
of
its
four
chapters
a
number
of
acts
by
which
such
power
may
be
attained
these
are
exemplified
by
a
profound
meditation
accompanied
by
holding
back
the
breath
and
inactivity
of
the
senses
while
a
fixed
position
is
constantly
preserved
by
means
of
such
acts
the
adept
reaches
the
knowledge
of
all
that
is
past
as
well
as
future
he
has
learned
to
divine
the
thoughts
of
others
to
have
the
strength
of
elephants
the
courage
of
lions
the
swiftness
of
the
wind
the
power
to
fly
in
the
air
to
swim
in
the
water
to
dive
into
the
earth
to
behold
every
possible
world
in
one
moment
and
to
accomplish
other
wonderful
deeds
but
the
quickest
mode
of
reaching
happiness
through
deep
contemplation
is
that
worship
of
god
which
consists
in
ever
murmuring
the
mystic
name
of
god
om
this
idea
is
a
very
general
one
colebrooke
deals
more
particularly
with
the
theistic
and
atheistic
divisions
of
the
sanchya
as
distinguished
while
in
the
theistic
system
iswara
the
chief
ruler
of
the
world
is
a
soul
or
spirit
distinguished
from
the
other
souls
capila
in
the
atheistic
sanchya
disowns
iswara
the
originator
of
the
world
by
volition
alleging
that
there
is
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
god
since
it
is
not
shown
by
perception
nor
is
it
possible
that
it
should
be
deduced
from
argument
he
recognizes
indeed
an
existence
proceeding
from
nature
which
is
absolute
intelligence
the
source
of
all
individual
intelligences
and
the
origin
of
all
other
existences
which
gradually
develop
out
of
it
about
the
creator
of
the
world
understanding
this
to
be
creation
he
emphatically
remarks
that
the
truth
of
such
an
iswara
is
proved
but
he
says
the
existence
of
effects
depends
on
the
soul
on
consciousness
and
not
on
iswara
everything
proceeds
from
the
great
principle
which
is
intelligence
to
this
the
individual
soul
belongs
and
through
this
it
is
brought
about
c
as
to
the
third
division
of
the
sanchya
the
more
particular
consideration
of
the
forms
of
knowledge
as
regards
the
principle
i
shall
make
a
few
more
remarks
which
may
perhaps
have
some
interest
of
the
various
kinds
of
knowledge
already
given
that
of
reasoning
of
the
connection
existing
with
the
conclusion
through
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
remains
the
chief
and
i
will
show
how
the
indians
comprehend
this
relation
the
understanding
and
all
other
principles
derived
from
it
are
to
them
effects
and
from
these
they
reason
to
their
causes
in
one
respect
this
is
analogous
to
our
inference
but
in
another
different
they
perceive
that
effects
exist
even
before
the
operation
of
the
causes
for
what
does
not
exist
cannot
be
made
explicit
in
existence
through
causality
colebrooke
says
this
means
that
effects
are
educts
rather
than
products
but
the
question
is
just
what
products
are
as
an
example
of
how
the
effect
is
already
contained
in
the
cause
the
following
is
givenoil
is
already
existent
in
the
seeds
of
sesamum
before
it
is
pressed
out
rice
is
in
the
husk
before
it
is
thrashed
milk
is
in
the
udder
of
the
cow
before
it
is
milked
cause
and
effect
are
in
reality
the
same
a
piece
of
a
dress
is
not
really
different
from
the
yarn
from
which
it
is
woven
for
the
material
is
the
same
this
is
how
this
relation
is
understood
a
consequence
derived
from
it
was
the
eternity
of
the
world
for
the
saying
out
of
nothing
there
comes
nothing
which
colebrooke
also
mentions
is
opposed
to
the
belief
in
a
creation
of
the
world
from
nothing
in
our
religious
sense
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
must
also
be
said
god
creates
the
world
not
out
of
nothing
but
out
of
himself
it
is
his
own
determination
by
him
brought
into
existence
the
distinction
between
cause
and
effect
is
only
a
formal
distinction
it
is
the
understanding
that
keeps
them
separate
and
not
reason
moisture
is
the
same
as
rain
or
again
we
speak
in
mechanics
of
different
movements
whereas
motion
has
the
same
velocity
before
as
after
impact
the
ordinary
consciousness
cannot
comprehend
the
fact
that
there
is
no
real
distinction
between
cause
and
effect
the
indians
infer
the
existence
of
a
universal
cause
which
is
undistinguishable
while
determinate
things
are
finite
and
on
this
account
there
must
be
a
cause
permeating
through
them
even
intelligence
is
an
effect
of
this
cause
which
is
the
soul
in
so
far
as
it
is
creative
in
this
identity
with
nature
after
its
abstraction
from
it
effect
proceeds
from
cause
yet
on
the
other
hand
this
last
is
not
independent
but
goes
back
into
universal
cause
general
destruction
is
postulated
along
with
what
is
called
the
creation
of
the
three
worlds
just
as
the
tortoise
stretches
out
its
limbs
and
then
draws
them
back
again
within
its
shell
the
five
elements
earth
c
which
constitute
the
three
worlds
are
in
the
general
ruin
and
dissolution
of
things
which
takes
place
within
a
certain
time
again
drawn
back
in
the
reverse
order
to
that
in
which
they
emerged
from
the
original
principle
because
they
return
step
by
step
to
their
first
causethat
is
to
what
is
highest
and
inseparable
which
is
nature
to
this
the
three
qualities
goodness
passion
and
darkness
are
attributed
the
further
attributes
of
these
determinations
may
be
very
interesting
but
they
are
understood
in
a
very
superficial
way
for
it
is
said
that
nature
operates
through
the
admixture
of
these
three
qualities
each
thing
has
all
three
within
itself
like
three
streams
which
flow
together
it
also
works
by
means
of
modifications
just
as
water
which
is
soaked
in
through
the
roots
of
plants
and
led
up
into
the
fruit
obtains
a
special
flavour
there
are
hence
only
the
categories
of
admixture
and
of
modification
present
the
indians
saynature
has
these
three
qualities
in
her
own
right
as
her
forms
and
characteristics
other
things
have
them
only
because
they
are
present
in
them
as
effects
of
the
former
we
still
have
to
consider
the
relation
of
nature
to
spirit
nature
although
it
is
quite
inanimate
performs
the
office
of
preparing
the
soul
for
its
freedom
just
as
it
is
the
function
of
milkof
a
substance
having
no
sensationto
nourish
the
calf
the
sanchya
makes
the
following
simile
nature
is
like
a
bajadere
showing
herself
to
the
soul
as
to
an
audience
she
is
abused
for
her
impudence
in
exposing
herself
too
often
to
the
rude
gaze
of
the
spectators
but
she
retires
when
she
has
shown
herself
sufficiently
she
does
so
because
she
has
been
seen
and
the
audience
retires
because
it
has
seen
nature
has
no
further
use
as
regards
the
soul
and
yet
the
union
remains
a
lasting
one
with
the
attainment
of
intellectual
knowledge
through
the
study
of
principles
the
final
incontrovertible
single
truth
is
learnt
that
i
neither
am
nor
is
anything
mine
nor
do
i
exist
that
is
the
personality
is
still
distinguished
from
the
soul
and
finally
personality
and
selfconsciousness
disappear
for
the
indian
everything
that
comes
forth
in
consciousness
is
reflected
by
the
soul
but
like
an
image
which
does
not
dull
the
crystal
of
the
soul
and
does
not
belong
to
it
in
possession
of
this
selfknowledge
without
personality
the
soul
contemplates
nature
at
its
ease
thus
exempt
from
all
terrible
variation
and
freed
from
every
other
form
and
operation
of
the
understanding
with
the
exception
of
this
spiritual
knowledge
this
is
a
mediate
spiritual
knowledge
of
the
likewise
spiritualized
contenta
knowledge
without
personality
and
consciousness
the
soul
still
indeed
remains
for
some
time
in
bodily
garb
but
this
is
only
so
after
the
same
manner
as
the
potters
wheel
when
the
jar
is
perfected
still
turns
round
from
the
effect
of
the
previously
given
impulse
the
soul
thus
has
according
to
the
indians
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
body
and
its
connection
therewith
is
therefore
a
superfluous
one
but
when
the
separation
of
the
already
prepared
soul
from
its
body
at
length
comes
to
pass
and
nature
is
done
with
soul
the
absolute
and
final
liberation
is
accomplished
here
we
find
the
crowning
moments
in
the
sanchya
philosophy
2
the
philosophy
of
gotama
and
canade
the
philosophy
of
gotama
and
that
of
canade
belong
to
one
another18
the
philosophy
of
gotama
is
called
nyaya
reasoning
and
that
of

the
first
is
a
specially
perfect
dialectic
and
the
second

the
other

itself
with
physics

or
sensuous
objects
colebrooke
saysno
department
of
science
or
of
literature
has
taken
up
the
attention
of
the
indians
more
than
the
nyaya
and
the
fruit
of
this
study
is
an
infinite
number
of
writings
included
in
which
there
may
be
found
the
works
of
very
celebrated
men
of
learning
the
system
which
gotama
and
canade
observe
is
that
indicated
in
one
part
of
the
vedas
as
being
the
path
which
must
be
trodden
in
the
pursuit
of
learning
and
study
viz
enunciation
definition
and
investigation
enunciation
is
the
specification
of
a
thing
by
its
name
that
is
by
the
expression
denoting
it
as
revelation
directs
for
language
is
considered
as
revealed
to
man
definition
sets
forth
the
particular
quality
which
constitutes
the
real
character
of
a
thing
investigation
consists
in
an
inquiry
into
the
adequacy
and
sufficiency
of
the
definition
in
conformity
with
this
the
teachers
of
philosophy
presuppose
scientific
terms
proceed
to
definitions
and
then
come
to
the
investigation
of
the
thus
premised
subjects
by
the
name
the
ordinary
conception
is
indicated
and
with
it
what
is
given
in
definition
is
compared
in
investigation
what
comes
next
is
the
object
to
be
contemplated
gotama
here
adduces
sixteen
points
amongst
which
proof
evidence
which
is
formal
and
what
has
to
be
proved
are
the
principal
the
others
are
merely
subsidiary
and
accessory
as
contributing
to
the
knowledge
and
confirmation
of
the
truth
the
nyaya
concurs
with
the
other
psychological
schools
in
this
that
it
promises
happiness
final
excellence
and
freedom
from
evil
as
the
reward
of
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
principles
which
it
teaches
that
is
to
say
of
the
truth
meaning
the
conviction
of
the
eternal
existence
of
the
soul
as
separable
from
body
which
makes
spirit
independent
soul
then
is
itself
the
object
which
is
to
be
known
and
proved
this
has
still
to
be
shown
more
particularly
a
the
first
point
of
importance
the
evidence
brought
forth
as
proof
is
said
to
be
divided
into
four
kindsfirst
of
all
perception
secondly
inference
of
which
there
are
three
kinds
viz
inference
from
result
to
cause
that
from
cause
to
effect
and
that
derived
from
analogy
the
third
kind
of
evidence
is
comparison
the
fourth
trustworthy
authority
including
both
tradition
and
the
revelation
implied
in
it
these
kinds
of
proof
are
much
brought
forward
both
in
the
ancient
treatise
ascribed
to
gotama
and
in
innumerable
commentaries
b
the
second
point
of
importance
is
found
in
the
subjects
which
have
to
be
proved
and
which
have
to
be
made
evident
and
of
these
twelve
are
here
given
the
first
and
most
important
is
however
the
soul
as
the
seat
distinguished
from
the
body
and
from
the
senses
of
feeling
and
of
knowledge
the
existence
of
which
is
proved
through
inclination

merit
fault
and
imagination
we
see
in
this
first
commencement
of
reflection
which
is
quite
without
order
neither
connection
nor
any
totality
of
determinations
the
second
object
of
knowledge
is
body
the

the
organs
of
sensation
as
the
five
outward
senses
are
called
these
are
not
modifications
of
consciousness
as
the
sanchya
asserts
but
matter
constructed
out
of
the
elements
which
respectively
consist
of
earth
water
light
air
and
ether
the
pupil
of
the
eye
is
not
they
say
the
organ
of
sight
nor
the
ear
of
hearing
but
the
organ
of
seeing
is
a
ray
of
light
that
proceeds
from
the
eye
to
the
object
the
organ
of
hearing
is
the
ether
that
in
the
cavity
of
the
ear
communicates
with
the
object
heard
through
the
ether
that
is
found
between
the
ray
of
light
is
usually
invisible
just
as
a
light
is
not
seen
at
midday
but
in
certain
circumstances
it
is
visible
in
taste
a
watery
substance
like
saliva
is
the
organ
and
so
on
we
find
something
similar

there
are
interesting
remarks
upon
the
phosphorus
of
the
eyes
in
a
paper
by
schultz
contained
in
goethes

examples
of
men
seeing
at
night
so
that
their
eyes
lighted
up

forward

numbers

demands
particular
conditions

the
fourth
subject
here
cesava
a
commentator
inserts
the
categories
of
canade
of
which
there
are
six
the
first
of
these
is
substance
and
of
this
there
are
nine
kinds
earth
water
light
air
ether
time
space
soul
understanding
the
fundamental
elements
of
material
substances
are
by
canade
regarded
as
if
they
were
original
atoms
and
afterwards
aggregates
of
the
same
he
maintains
the
everlasting
nature
of
atoms
and
thus
much
is
adduced
about
the
union
of
atoms
by
which
means
motes
are
also
produced
the
second
category
is
that
of
quality
and
of
it
there
are
twentyfour
kinds
viz
1
colour
2
taste
3
smell
4
tangibility
5
numbers
6

a
capacity
which
includes
three
different
qualities
viz
celerity
elasticity
and
power
of
imagination
the
third
category
is
action
the
fourth
association
of
qualities
the
fifth
distinction
the
sixth
is
aggregation
and
according
to
canade
this
is
the
last
other
writers
add
negation
as
the
seventh
this
is
the
manner
in
which
philosophy
is
regarded
by
the
indians
c
the
philosophy
of
gotama
makes
doubt
the
third
topic
succeeding
those
of
the
evidence
of
knowledge
and
the
subjects
of
interest
to
knowledge
another
topic
is
regular
proof
formal
reasoning
or
the
perfect
syllogism
nyaya
which
consists
of
five
propositions1
the
proposition
2
the
reason
3
the
instance
4
the
application
5
the
conclusion
to
take
examples1
this
hill
is
burning
2
because
it
smokes
3
what
smokes
is
burning
like
a
kitchen
fire
4
accordingly
the
hill
smokes
5
therefore
it
is
on
fire
this
is
propounded
as
syllogisms
are
with
us
but
in
the
manner
adopted
the
matter
which
is
in
point
is
propounded
first
we
should
on
the
contrary
begin
with
the
general
this
is
the
ordinary
form
and
these
examples
may
satisfy
us
yet
we
shall
recapitulate
the
matter
once
more
we
have
seen
that
in
india
the
point
of
main
importance
is
the
souls
drawing
itself
within
itself
raising
itself
up
into
liberty
or
thought
which
constitutes
itself
for
itself
this
becoming
explicit
of
soul
in
the
most
abstract
mode
may
be
called
intellectual
substantiality
but
here
it
is
not
the
unity
of
mind
and
nature
that
is
present
but
directly
the
opposite
to
mind
the
consideration
of
nature
is
only
the
vehicle
of
thought
or
its
exercise
which
has
as
its
aim
the
liberation
of
mind
intellectual
substantiality
is
in
india
the
end
while
in
philosophy
it
is
in
general
the
true
commencement
to
philosophize
is
the
idealism
of
making
thought
in
its
own
right
the
principle
of
truth
intellectual
substantiality
is
the
opposite
of
the
reflection
understanding
and
the
subjective
individuality
of
the
european
with
us
it
is
of
importance
that
i
will
know
believe
think
this
particular
thing
according
to
the
grounds
that
i
have
for
so
doing
and
in
accordance
with
my
own
free
will
and
upon
this
an
infinite
value
is
set
intellectual
substantiality
is
the
other
extreme
from
this
it
is
that
in
which
all
the
subjectivity
of
the
i
is
lost
for
it
everything
objective
has
become
vanity
there
is
for
it
no
objective
truth
duty
or
right
and
thus
subjective
vanity
is
the
only
thing
left
the
point
of
interest
is
to
reach
intellectual
substantiality
in
order
to
drown
in
it
that
subjective
vanity
with
all
its
cleverness
and
reflection
this
is
the
advantage
of
arriving
at
this
point
of
view
the
defect
in
such
a
view
is
that
because
intellectual
substantiality
while
represented
as
end
and
aim
for
the
subject
as
a
condition
that
has
to
be
produced
in
the
interest
of
the
subject
even
though
it
be
most
objective
is
yet
only
quite
abstractly
objective
and
hence
the
essential
form
of
objectivity
is
wanting
to
it
that
intellectual
substantiality
that
thus
remaining
in
abstraction
has
as
its
existence
the
subjective
soul
alone
just
as
in
empty
vanity
where
the
subjective
power
of
negation
alone
remains
everything
disappears
this
abstraction
of
intellectual
substantiality
only
signifies
an
escape
into
what
is
empty
and
without
determination
wherein
everything
vanishes
therefore
what
remains
to
be
done
is
to
force
forward
the
real
ground
of
the
inwardly
selfforming
and
determining
objectivitythe
eternal
form
within
itself
which
is
what
men
call
thought
just
as
this
thought
in
the
first
place
as
subjective
is
mine
because
i
think
but
in
the
second
place
is
universality
which
comprehends
intellectual
substantiality
it
is
likewise
in
the
third
place
forming
activity
the
principle
of
determination
this
higher
kind
of
objectivity
that
unfolds
itself
alone
gives
a
place
to
the
particular
content
allows
it
to
have
free
scope
and
receives
it
into
itself
if
in
the
oriental
view
the
particular
shakes
and
is
destined
to
fall
it
still
has
its
place
grounded
on
thought
it
is
able
to
root
itself
in
itself
it
is
able
to
stand
firm
and
this
is
the
hard
european
understanding
such
eastern
ideas
tend
to
destroy
it
but
it
is
preserved
active
in
the
soil
of
thought
it
cannot
exist
when
regarded
as
independent
but
must
exist
only
as
a
moment
in
the
whole
system
in
the
eastern
philosophy
we
have
also
discovered
a
definite
content
which
is
brought
under
our
consideration
but
the
consideration
is
destitute
of
thought
or
system
because
it
comes
from
above
and
is
outside
of
the
unity
on
that
side
there
stands
intellectual
substantiality
on
this
side
it
appears
dry
and
barren
the
particular
thus
only
has
the
dead
form
of
simple
reason
and
conclusion
such
as
we
find
in
the
scholastics
based
on
the
ground
of
thought
on
the
other
hand
the
particular
may
receive
its
dues
it
may
be
regarded
and
grasped
as
a
moment
in
the
whole
organization
the
idea
has
not
become
objective
in
the
indian
philosophy
hence
the
external
and
objective
has
not
been
comprehended
in
accordance
with
the
idea
this
is
the
deficiency
in
orientalism
the
true
objective
ground
of
thought
finds
its
basis
in
the
real
freedom
of
the
subject
the
universal
or
substantial
must
itself
have
objectivity
because
thought
is
this
universal
the
ground
of
the
substantial
and
likewise
ithought
is
the
implicit
and
exists
as
the
free
subjectthe
universal
has
immediate
existence
and
actual
presence
it
is
not
only
an
end
or
condition
to
be
arrived
at
but
the
absolute
character
is
objective
it
is
this
principle
that
we
find
in
the
greek
world
and
the
object
of
our
further
consideration
is
its
development
the
universal
first
appears
as
quite
abstract
and
as
such
it
confronts
the
concrete
world
but
its
value
is
both
for
the
ground
of
the
concrete
world
and
for
that
which
is
implicit
it
is
not
a
beyond
for
the
value
of
the
present
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
exists
in
the
implicit
or
that
which
is
implicit
the
universal
is
the
truth
of
present
objects

greek
philosophy
introduction
the
name
of
greece
strikes
home
to
the
hearts
of
men
of
education
in
europe
and
more
particularly
is
this
so
with
us
germans
europeans
have
taken
their
religion
the
life
to
come
the
faroff
land
from
a
point
somewhat
further
off
than
greecethey
took
it
from
the
east
and
more
especially
from
syria
but
the
here
the
present
art
and
science
that
which
in
giving
liberty
to
our
spiritual
life
gives
it
dignity
as
it
likewise
bestows
upon
it
ornament
we
know
to
have
proceeded
from
greece
either
directly
or
indirectlythrough
the
circuitous
road
of
rome
the
latter
of
these
two
ways
was
the
earlier
form
in
which
this
culture
came
to
us
it
also
came
from
the
formerly
universal
church
which
derived
its
origin
as
such
from
rome
and
has
retained
its
speech
even
until
now
the
sources
of
authority
in
addition
to
the
latin
gospels
have
been
the
fathers
our
law
too
boasts
of
deriving
its
most
perfect
forms
from
rome
teutonic
strength
of
mind
has
required
to
pass
through
the
hard
discipline
of
the
church
and
law
which
came
to
us
from
rome
and
to
be
kept
in
check
it
is
in
this
way
that
the
european
character
first
obtained
its
pliability
and
capacity
for
freedom
thus
it
was
after
european
manhood
came
to
be
at
home
with
itself
and
to
look
upon
the
present
that
the
historical
and
that
which
is
of
foreign
derivation
was
given
when
man
began
to
be
at
home
with
himself
he
turned
to
the
greeks
to
find
enjoyment
in
it
let
us
leave
the
latin
and
the
roman
to
the
church
and
to
jurisprudence
higher
freer
philosophic
science
as
also
the
beauty
of
our
untrammelled
art
the
taste
for
and
love
of
the
same
we
know
to
have
taken
their
root
in
greek
life
and
to
have
created
therefrom
their
spirit
if
we
were
to
have
an
aspiration
it
would
be
for
such
a
land
and
such
conditions
but
what
makes
us
specially
at
home
with
the
greeks
is
that
they
made
their
world
their
home
the
common
spirit
of
homeliness
unites
us
both
in
ordinary
life
we
like
best
the
men
and
families
that
are
homely
and
contented
in
themselves
not
desiring
what
is
outside
and
above
them
and
so
it
is
with
the
greeks
they
certainly
received
the
substantial
beginnings
of
their
religion
culture
their
common
bonds
of
fellowship
more
or
less
from
asia
syria
and
egypt
but
they
have
so
greatly
obliterated
the
foreign
nature
of
this
origin
and
it
is
so
much
changed
worked
upon
turned
round
and
altogether
made
so
different
that
what
they
as
we
prize
know
and
love
in
it
is
essentially
their
own
for
this
reason
in
the
history
of
greek
life
when
we
go
further
back
and
seem
constrained
so
to
go
back
we
find
we
may
do
without
this
retrogression
and
follow
within
the
world
and
manners
of
the
greeks
the
beginnings
the
germination
and
the
progress
of
art
and
science
up
to
their
maturity
even
seeing
the
origin
of
their
decayand
this
completely
comprehended
within
their
own
range
for
their
spiritual
development
requires
that
which
is
received
or
foreign
as
matter
or
stimulus
only
in
such
they
have
known
and
borne
themselves
as
men
that
were
free
the
form
which
they
have
given
to
the
foreign
principle
is
this
characteristic
breath
of
spirituality
the
spirit
of
freedom
and
of
beauty
which
can
in
the
one
aspect
be
regarded
as
form
but
which
in
another
and
higher
sense
is
simply
substance
they
have
thus
not
only
themselves
created
the
substantial
in
their
culture
and
made
their
existence
their
own
but
they
have
also
held
in
reverence
this
their
spiritual
rebirth
which
is
their
real
birth
the
foreign
origin
they
have
so
to
speak
thanklessly
forgotten
putting
it
in
the
backgroundperhaps
burying
it
in
the
darkness
of
the
mysteries
which
they
have
kept
secret
from
themselves
they
have
not
only
done
this
that
is
they
have
not
only
used
and
enjoyed
all
that
they
have
brought
forth
and
formed
but
they
have
become
aware
of
and
thankfully
and
joyfully
placed
before
themselves
this
athomeness
heimathlichkeit
in
their
whole
existence
the
ground
and
origin
of
themselves
not
merely
existing
in
it
possessing
and
making
use
of
it
for
their
mind
when
transformed
in
this
spiritual
new
birth
is
just
the
living
in
their
life
and
also
the
becoming
conscious
of
that
life
as
it
has
become
actual
they
represent
their
existence
as
an
object
apart
from
themselves
which
manifests
itself
independently
and
which
in
its
independence
is
of
value
to
them
hence
they
have
made
for
themselves
a
history
of
everything
which
they
have
possessed
and
have
been
not
only
have
they
represented
the
beginning
of
the
worldthat
is
of
gods
and
men
the
earth
the
heavens
the
wind
mountains
and
riversbut
also
of
all
aspects
of
their
existence
such
as
the
introduction
of
fire
and
the
offerings
connected
with
it
the
crops
agriculture
the
olive
the
horse
marriage
property
laws
arts
worship
the
sciences
towns
princely
races
c
of
all
these
it
is
pleasingly
represented
through
tales
how
they
have
arisen
in
history
as
their
own
work
it
is
in
this
veritable
homeliness
or
more
accurately
in
the
spirit
of
homeliness
in
this
spirit
of
ideally
beingathomewiththemselves
in
their
physical
corporate
legal
moral
and
political
existence
it
is
in
the
beauty
and
the
freedom
of
their
character
in
history
making
what
they
are
to
be
also
a
sort
of
mnemosyne
with
them
that
the
kernel
of
thinking
liberty
rests
and
hence
it
was
requisite
that
philosophy
should
arise
amongst
them
philosophy
is
being
at
home
with
self
just
like
the
homeliness
of
the
greek
it
is
mans
being
at
home
in
his
mind
at
home
with
himself
if
we
are
at
home
with
the
greeks
we
must
be
at
home
more
particularly
in
their
philosophy
not
however
simply
as
it
is
with
them
for
philosophy
is
at
home
with
itself
and
we
have
to
do
with
thought
with
what
is
most
specially
ours
and
with
what
is
free
from
all
particularity
the
development
and
unfolding
of
thought
has
taken
place
with
them
from
its
earliest
beginning
and
in
order
to
comprehend
their
philosophy
we
may
remain
with
them
without
requiring
to
seek
for
further
and
external
influences
but
we
must
specify
more
particularly
their
character
and
point
of
view
the
greeks
have
a
startingpoint
in
history
as
truly
as
they
have
arisen
from
out
of
themselves
this
startingpoint
comprehended
in
thought
is
the
oriental
substantiality
of
the
natural
unity
between
the
spiritual
and
the
natural
to
start
from
the
self
to
live
in
the
self
is
the
other
extreme
of
abstract
subjectivity
when
it
is
still
empty
or
rather
has
made
itself
to
be
empty
such
is
pure
formalism
the
abstract
principle
of
the
modern
world
the
greeks
stand
between
both
these
extremes
in
the
happy
medium
this
therefore
is
the
medium
of
beauty
seeing
that
it
is
both
natural
and
spiritual
but
yet
that
the
spiritual
still
remains
the
governing
determining
subject
mind
immersed
in
nature
is
in
substantial
unity
with
it
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
consciousness
it
is
essentially
sensuous
perception
as
subjective
consciousness
it
is
certainly
formgiving
though
it
is
devoid
of
measure
for
the
greeks
the
substantial
unity
of
nature
and
spirit
was
a
fundamental
principle
and
thus
being
in
the
possession
and
knowledge
of
this
yet
not
being
overwhelmed
in
it
but
having
retired
into
themselves
they
have
avoided
the
extreme
of
formal
subjectivity
and
are
still
in
unity
with
themselves
thus
it
is
a
free
subject
which
still
possesses
that
original
unity
in
content
essence
and
substratum
and
fashions
its
object
into
beauty
the
stage
reached
by
greek
consciousness
is
the
stage
of
beauty
for
beauty
is
the
ideal
it
is
the
thought
which
is
derived
from
mind
but
in
such
a
way
that
the
spiritual
individuality
is
not
yet
explicit
as
abstract
subjectivity
that
has
then
in
itself
to
perfect
its
existence
into
a
world
of
thought
what
is
natural
and
sensuous
still
pertains
to
this
subjectivity
but
yet
the
natural
form
has
not
equal
dignity
and
rank
with
the
other
nor
is
it
predominant
as
is
the
case
in
the
east
the
principle
of
the
spiritual
now
stands
first
in
rank
and
natural
existence
has
no
further
value
for
itself
in
its
existent
forms
being
the
mere
expression
of
the
mind
shining
through
and
having
been
reduced
to
be
the
vehicle
and
form
of
its
existence
mind
however
has
not
yet
got
itself
as
a
medium
whereby
it
can
represent
itself
in
itself
and
from
which
it
can
form
its
world
thus
free
morality
could
and
necessarily
did
find
a
place
in
greece
for
the
spiritual
substance
of
freedom
was
here
the
principle
of
morals
laws
and
constitutions
because
the
natural
element
is
however
still
contained
in
it
the
form
taken
by
the
morality
of
the
state
is
still
affected
by
what
is
natural
the
states
are
small
individuals
in
their
natural
condition
which
could
not
unite
themselves
into
one
whole
since
the
universal
does
not
exist
in
independent
freedom
that
which
is
spiritual
still
is
limited
in
the
greek
world
what
is
potentially
and
actually
eternal
is
realized
and
brought
to
consciousness
through
thought
but
in
such
a
way
that
subjectivity
confronts
it
in
a
determination
which
is
still
accidental
because
it
is
still
essentially
related
to
what
is
natural
and
in
this
we
find
the
reason
as
promised
above
for
the
fact
that
in
greece
the
few
alone
are
free
the
measureless
quality
of
substance
in
the
east
is
brought
by
means
of
the
greek
mind
into
what
is
measurable
and
limited
it
is
clearness
aim
limitation
of
forms
the
reduction
of
what
is
measureless
and
of
infinite
splendour
and
riches
to
determinateness
and
individuality
the
riches
of
the
greek
world
consist
only
of
an
infinite
quantity
of
beautiful
lovely
and
pleasing
individualities
in
the
serenity
which
pervades
all
existence
those
who
are
greatest
amongst
the
greeks
are
the
individualities
the
connoisseurs
in
art
poetry
song
science
integrity
and
virtue
if
the
serenity
of
the
greeks
their
beautiful
gods
statues
and
temples
as
well
as
their
serious
work
their
institutions
and
acts
may
seemcompared
to
the
splendour
and
sublimity
the
colossal
forms
of
oriental
imagination
the
egyptian
buildings
of
eastern
kingdomsto
be
like
childs
play
this
is
the
case
yet
more
with
the
thought
that
comes
into
existence
here
such
thought
puts
a
limit
on
this
wealth
of
individualities
as
on
the
oriental
greatness
and
reduces
it
into
its
one
simple
soul
which
however
is
in
itself
the
first
source
of
the
opulence
of
a
higher
ideal
world
of
the
world
of
thought
from
out
of
thy
passions
oh
man
exclaimed
an
ancient
thou
hast
derived
the
materials
for
thy
gods
just
as
the
easterns
and
especially
the
indians
did
from
the
elements
powers
and
forms
of
nature
one
may
add
out
of
thought
thou
takest
the
element
and
material
for
god
thus
thought
is
the
ground
from
which
god
comes
forth
but
it
is
not
thought
in
its
commencement
that
constitutes
the
first
principle
from
which
all
culture
must
be
grasped
it
is
quite
the
other
way
in
the
beginning
thought
comes
forth
as
altogether
poor
abstract
and
of
a
content
which
is
meagre
in
comparison
to
that
given
to
his
subject
by
the
oriental
for
as
immediate
the
beginning
is
just
in
the
form
of
nature
and
this
it
shares
with
what
is
oriental
because
it
thus
reduces
the
content
of
the
east
to
determinations
which
are
altogether
poor
these
thoughts
are
scarcely
worth
observation
on
our
part
since
they
are
not
yet
proper
thoughts
neither
being
in
the
form
of
or
determined
as
thought
but
belonging
really
to
nature
thus
thought
is
the
absolute
though
not
as
thought
that
is
we
have
always
two
things
to
distinguish
the
universal
or
the
notion
and
the
reality
of
this
universal
for
the
question
here
arises
as
to
whether
the
reality
is
itself
thought
or
nature
we
find
in
the
fact
that
reality
at
first
has
still
the
immediate
form
and
is
only
thought
potentially
the
reason
for
commencing
with
the
greeks
and
from
the
natural
philosophy
of
the
ionic
school
as
regards
the
external
and
historical
condition
of
greece
at
this
time
greek
philosophy
commences
in
the
sixth
century
before
christ
in
the
time
of
cyrus
and
in
the
period
of
decline
in
the
ionic
republics
in
asia
minor
just
because
this
world
of
beauty
which
raised
itself
into
a
higher
kind
of
culture
went
to
pieces
philosophy
arose
crsus
and
the
lydians
first
brought
ionic
freedom
into
jeopardy
later
on
the
persians
were
those
who
destroyed
it
altogether
so
that
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
sought
other
spots
and
created
colonies
more
particularly
in
the
west
at
the
time
of
the
decline
in
ionic
towns
the
other
greece
ceased
to
be
under
its
ancient
lines
of
kings
the
pelopideans
and
the
other
and
for
the
most
part
foreign
princely
races
had
passed
away
greece
had
in
many
ways
come
into
touch
with
the
outside
world
and
the
greek
inhabitants
likewise
sought
within
themselves
for
a
bond
of
fellowship
the
patriarchal
life
was
past
and
in
many
states
it
came
to
be
a
necessity
that
they
should
constitute
themselves
as
free
organized
and
regulated
by
law
many
individuals
come
into
prominence
who
were
no
more
rulers
of
their
fellowcitizens
by
descent
but
who
were
by
means
of
talent
power
of
imagination
and
scientific
knowledge
marked
out
and
reverenced
and
such
individuals
came
into
many
different
relations
with
their
fellows
part
of
them
became
advisers
but
their
advice
was
frequently
not
followed
part
of
them
were
hated
and
despised
by
their
fellowcitizens
and
they
drew
back
from
public
affairs
others
became
violent
if
not
fierce
governors
of
the
other
citizens
and
others
again
finally
became
the
administrators
of
liberty
the
seven
sages
amongst
these
men
just
characterized
the
seven
sagesin
modern
times
excluded
from
the
history
of
philosophytake
their
place
in
as
far
as
they
may
be
reckoned
as
milestones
in
the
history
of
philosophy
something
about
their
character
should
in
the
commencement
of
philosophy
be
shortly
said
they
came
into
prominence
partly
as
taking
part
in
the
battles
of
the
ionic
towns
partly
as
expatriated
and
partly
as
individuals
of
distinction
in
greece
the
names
of
the
seven
are
given
differently
usually
however
as

solon
periander
cleobulus

specifies
seventeen
and
amongst
these

people
pick
out
seven

various
ways
according
to
diogenes
laertius
1
41
dicarchus
who
came
still
earlier
in
history
only
names
four
and
these
are
placed
amongst
the
seven
by
all

of
them
that
they
are
neither
wise
men

nor
philosophers
but
men
of
understanding

and
lawgivers
this
judgment
has
become
the
universal
one
and
is
held
to
be
just
they
come
in
a
period
of
transition
amongst
the
greeksa
transition
from
a
patriarchal
system
of
kings
into
one
of
law
or
force
the
fame
of
the
wisdom
of
these
men
depends
on
the
one
hand
on
the
fact
that
they
grasped
the
practical
essence
of
consciousness
or
the
consciousness
of
universal
morality
as
it
is
in
and
for
itself
giving
expression
to
it
in
the
form
of
moral
maxims
and
in
part
in
civil
laws
making
these
actual
in
the
state
on
the
other
hand
it
depends
on
their
having
in
theoretic
form
expressed
the
same
in
witty
sayings
some
of
these
sayings
could
not
merely
be
regarded
as
thoughtful
or
good
reflections
but
in
so
far
as
philosophic
and
speculative
they
have
a
comprehensive
universal
significance
ascribed
to
them
which
however
does
not
explain
them
these
men
have
not
really
made
science
and
philosophy
their
aim
it
is
expressly
said
of
thales
that
it
was
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
that
he
first
took
to
philosophy
what
had
relation
to
politics
appeared
most
frequently
they
were
practical
men
men
of
affairs
but
not
in
our
sense
of
the
word
with
us
practical
activity
devotes
itself
to
a
special
line
of
administration
or
to
a
particular
business
or
to
economics
c
they
lived
in
democratic
states
and
thus
shared
the
responsibilities
of
the
general
administration
and
rule
they
were
not
statesmen
like
the
great
greek
personalities
like
miltiades
themistocles
pericles
and
demosthenes
but
they
were
statesmen
in
a
time
when
safety
preservation
and
indeed
the
whole
wellbeing
disposition
and
well
nigh
the
very
foundation
of
civic
life
were
in
question
and
certainly
when
this
was
so
with
the
foundations
of
legally
established
institutions
thales
and
bias
thus
appear
as
the
representatives
of
the
ionic
towns
herodotus
i
169171
speaks
of
both
and
says
of
thales
that
he
advised
even
before
the
overthrow
of
the
ionians
apparently
through
crsus
that
they
should
constitute
a
supreme
council


in
teos
in
the
centre
of
the
ionian
people
and
thus
make
a
federal
state
with
a
capital
and
principal
federal
town
so
that
they
might
still
remain
separate
nations

as
before
however
they
did
not
follow
this
advice
and
this
isolated
and
weakened
them
and
the
result
was
their
conquest
it
has
always
been
a
difficult
thing
for
the
greeks
to
give
up
their
individuality
later
on
when
harpagus
the
general
of
cyrus
who
accomplished
their
overthrow
pressed
in
upon
them
the
ionians
took
no
better
the
most
excellent
advice
of
bias
of
priene
given
them
at
the
decisive
moment
when
they
were
assembled
at
panionium
to
go
in
a
common
fleet
to
sardinia
there
to
found
an
ionic
state
by
so
doing
they
would
escape
servitude
be
happy
and
inhabiting
the
largest
island
subdue
the
others
but
if
they
remained
in
ionia
there
was
no
hope
of
liberty
to
be
seen
for
them
herodotus
gives
his
corroboration
to
this
adviceif
they
had
followed
him
they
would
have
been
the
happiest
of
greeks
such
things
take
place
but
through
force
and
not
voluntarily
we
find
the
other
sages
under
similar
conditions
solon
was
an
administrator
in
athens
and
thereby
became
famous
few
men
have
attained
the
honourable
position
of
being
a
lawgiver
solon
shares
it
with
moses
lycurgus
zaleucus
numa
c
alone
no
individuals
can
be
found
amongst
teutonic
peoples
who
possess
the
distinction
of
being
the
lawgivers
of
their
people
nowadays
there
can
be
lawgivers
no
longer
legal
institutions
and
regulations
are
in
modern
times
always
ready
to
hand
and
the
little
that
can
still
be
done
by
means
of
the
lawgiver
and
by
lawmaking
assemblies
is
simply
the
further
modification
of
details
or
making
very
insignificant
additions
what
is
dealt
with
is
the
compilation
wording
and
perfecting
of
the
particular
only
and
yet
neither
solon
and
lycurgus
did
more
than
respectively
bring
the
ionic
mind
and
the
doric
characterbeing
that
which
had
been
given
them
and
which
was
implicitly
presentinto
the
form
of
consciousness
and
obviate
the
temporary
inconvenience
of
disorder
through
effective
laws
solon
was
thus
not
a
perfect
statesman
this
is
manifest
from
the
sequel
of
his
history
a
constitution
which
allowed
pisistratus
in
solons
own
time
to
raise
himself
into
the
tyranny
showing
itself
to
be
so
destitute
of
strength
and
organization
that
it
could
not
prevent
its
own
overthrow
and
by
what
a
power
manifests
some
inward
want
this
may
seem
strange
for
a
constitution
must
be
able
to
afford
resistance
to
such
an
attack
but
let
us
see
what
pisistratus
did
what
the
socalled
tyrants
really
were
is
most
clearly
shown
by
the
relation
borne
by
solon
to
pisistratus
when
orderly
institutions
and
laws
were
necessary
to
the
greeks
we
find
lawgivers
and
regents
of
states
appearing
who
laid
down
laws
and
ruled
accordingly
the
law
as
universal
seemed
and
still
seems
now
to
the
individual
to
be
force
inasmuch
as
he
does
not
have
regard
to
or
comprehend
the
law
it
applies
first
to
all
the
people
and
then
only
to
the
individual
it
is
essential
first
of
all
to
use
constraint
until
the
individual
attains
discernment
and
law
to
him
becomes
his
law
and
ceases
to
be
something
foreign
most
of
the
lawgivers
and
administrators
of
states
undertook
themselves
to
constrain
the
people
and
to
be
their
tyrants
in
states
where
they
did
not
undertake
it
it
had
to
be
done
by
other
individuals
for
it
was
essential
according
to
diogenes
laertius
account
i
4850
we
find
solonwhom
his
friends
advised
to
secure
the
mastery
for
himself
since
the
people
held
to
him

and
would
have
liked
to
see
him
become
tyrantrepulse
them
and
try
to
prevent
any
such
occurrence
when
he
became
suspicious
of
pisistratus
intentions
what
he
did
when
he
remarked
upon
the
attitude
of
pisistratus
was
to
come
into
the
assembly
of
the
people
and
tell
them
the
design
of
pisistratus
accoutred
in
armour
and
shield
this
was
then
unusual
for
thucydides
1

makes
it
a
distinguishing
feature
between
greeks
and
barbarians
that
the
former
and
preeminently
the
athenians
put
aside
their
arms
in
time
of
peace
he
said
men
of
athens
i
am
wiser
than
some
and
braver
than
others
i
am
wiser
than
those
who
do
not
see
the
deceit
of
pisistratus
braver
than
those
who
certainly
see
it
but
say
nothing
from
fear
as
he
could
not
do
anything
he
left
athens
pisistratus
is
said
to
have
then
written
a
most
honourable
letter
to
solon
in
his
absence
which
diogenes
i
53
54
has
preserved
for
us
inviting
him
to
return
to
athens
and
live
with
him
as
a
free
citizen
not
only
am
i
not
the
only
one
of
the
greeks
to
have
seized
the
tyranny
but
i
have
not
taken
anything
which
was
not
my
due
for
i
am
of
the
race
of
codrus
i
have
only
taken
back
to
myself
what
the
athenians
swore
they
would
preserve
to
codrus
and
his
race
and
yet
took
from
them
moreover
i
am
doing
no
evil
toward
gods
and
men
but
as
thou
hast
given
laws
to
the
athenians
i
take
care

that
in
civil
life
they
shall
carry
them
out

his
son
hippias
did
the
same
and
these
relations
are
carried
out
better
than
they
would
be
in
a
democracy
for
i
allow
nobody
to
do
evil

and
as
tyrant
i
lay
claim
to
no
more



than
such
consideration
and
respect
and
specified
gifts



as
would
have
been
offered
to
the
kings
in
earlier
times
every
athenian
gives
the
tenth
part
of
his
revenue
not
to
me
but
towards
the
cost
of
the
public
offering
and
besides
for
the
commonwealth
and
for
use
in
case
of
war
i
am
not
angry
that
thou
hast
disclosed
my
project
for
thou
didst
it
more
out
of
love
to
the
people
than
hate
against
me
and
because
thou
didst
not
know
how
i
would
conduct
my
rule
for
if
thou
hadst
known
this
thou
wouldst
have
submitted
to
it
willingly
and
wouldst
not
have
taken
flight
and
so
he
goes
on
solon
in
the
answer
given
by
diogenes
i
66
67
says
that
he
has
not
a
personal
grudge
against
pisistratus
and
he
must
call
him
the
best
of
tyrants
but
to
turn
back
does
not
befit
him
for
he
made
equality
of
rights
essential
in
the
athenian
constitution
and
himself
refused
the
tyranny
by
his
return
he
would
condone
what
was
done
by
pisistratus
the
rule
of
pisistratus
accustomed
the
athenians
to
the
laws
of
solon
and
brought
them
into
usage
so
that
after
this
usage
came
to
be
general
supremacy
was
superfluous
his
sons
were
hence
driven
out
of
athens
and
for
the
first
time
the
constitution
of
solon
upheld
itself
solon
undoubtedly
gave
the
laws
but
it
is
another
thing
to
make
such
regulations
effectual
in
the
manners
habits
and
life
of
a
people
what
was
separate
in
solon
and
pisistratus
we
find
united
in
periander
in
corinth
and
pittacus
in
mitilene
this
may
be
enough
about
the
outward
life
of
the
seven
sages
they
are
also
famed
for
the
wisdom
of
the
sayings
which
have
been
preserved
to
us
these
sayings
seem
in
great
measure
however
to
be
superficial
and
hackneyed
the
reason
for
this
is
found
in
the
fact
that
to
our
reflection
general
propositions
are
quite
usual
much
in
the
proverbs
of
solomon
seems
to
us
to
be
superficial
and
commonplace
for
the
same
reason
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
bring
to
the
ordinary
conception
for
the
first
time
this
same
universal
in
the
form
of
universality
many
distichs
are
ascribed
to
solon
which
we
still
retain
their
object
is
to
express
in
maxims
general
obligations
towards
the
gods
the
family
and
the
country
diogenes
i
58
tells
us
that
solon
said
laws
are
like
a
spiders
web
the
small
are
caught
the
great
tear
it
up
speech
is
the
image
of
action
c
such
sayings
are
not
philosophy
but
general
reflections
the
expression
of
moral
duties
maxims
necessary
determinations
the
wisdom
of
the
sages
is
of
this
kind
many
sayings
are
insignificant
but
many
seem
to
be
more
insignificant
than
they
are
for
instance
chilon
says
stand
surety
and
evil
awaits
thee




on
the
one
hand
this
is
quite
a
common
rule
of
life
and
prudence
but
the
sceptics
gave
to
this
proposition
a
much
higher
universal
significance
which
is
also
accredited
to
chilon
this
sense
is
ally
thyself
closely
to
any
particular
thing
and
unhappiness
will
fall
upon
thee
the
sceptics
adduced
this
proposition
independently
as
demonstrating
the
principle
of
scepticism
which
is
that
nothing
is
finite
and
definite
in
and
for
itself
being
only
a
fleeting
vacillating
phase
which
does
not
last
cleobulus
says


another


and
this
has
likewise
a
universal
significance
which
is
that
limitation
the

of
plato
as
opposed
to
the
the
selfdetermined
as
opposed
to
undeterminedis
what
is
best
and
thus
it
is
that
in
being
limit
or
measure
is
the
highest
determination
one
of
the
most
celebrated
sayings
is
that
of
solon
in
his
conversation
with
crsus
which
herodotus
i
3033
has
in
his
own
way
given
us
very
fully
the
result
arrived
at
is
thisnobody
is
to
be
esteemed
happy
before
his
death
but
the
noteworthy
point
in
this
narrative
is
that
from
it
we
can
get
a
better
idea
of
the
standpoint
of
greek
reflection
in
the
time
of
solon
we
see
that
happiness
is
put
forward
as
the
highest
aim
that
which
is
most
to
be
desired
and
which
is
the
end
of
man
before
kant
morality
as
eudmonism
was
based
on
the
determination
of
happiness
in
solons
sayings
there
is
an
advance
over
the
sensuous
enjoyment
which
is
merely
pleasant
to
the
feelings
let
us
ask
what
happiness
is
and
what
there
is
within
it
for
reflection
and
we
find
that
it
certainly
carries
with
it
a
certain
satisfaction
to
the
individual
of
whatever
sort
it
bewhether
obtained
through
physical
enjoyment
or
spiritualthe
means
of
obtaining
which
lie
in
mens
own
hands
but
the
fact
is
further
to
be
observed
that
not
every
sensuous
immediate
pleasure
can
be
laid
hold
of
for
happiness
contains
a
reflection
on
the
circumstances
as
a
whole
in
which
we
have
the
principle
to
which
the
principle
of
isolated
enjoyment
must
give
way
eudmonism
signifies
happiness
as
a
condition
for
the
whole
of
life
it
sets
up
a
totality
of
enjoyment
which
is
a
universal
and
a
rule
for
individual
enjoyment
in
that
it
does
not
allow
it
to
give
way
to
what
is
momentary
but
restrains
desires
and
sets
a
universal
standard
before
ones
eyes
if
we
contrast
it
with
indian
philosophy
we
find
eudmonism
to
be
antagonistic
to
it
there
the
liberation
of
the
soul
from
what
is
corporeal
the
perfect
abstraction
the
necessity
that
the
soul
shall
in
its
simplicity
be
at
home
with
itself
is
the
final
end
of
man
with
the
greeks
the
opposite
is
the
case
the
satisfaction
there
is
also
satisfaction
of
the
soul
but
it
is
not
attained
through
flight
abstraction
withdrawal
within
self
but
through
satisfaction
in
the
present
concrete
satisfaction
in
relation
to
the
surroundings
the
stage
of
reflection
that
we
reach
in
happiness
stands
midway
between
mere
desire
and
the
other
extreme
which
is
right
as
right
and
duty
as
duty
in
happiness
the
individual
enjoyment
has
disappeared
the
form
of
universality
is
there
but
the
universal
does
not
yet
come
forth
on
its
own
account
and
this
is
the
issue
of
the
conversation
between
crsus
and
solon
man
as
thinking
is
not
solely
engrossed
with
present
enjoyment
but
also
with
the
means
for
obtaining
that
to
come
crsus
points
out
to
him
these
means
but
solon
still
objects
to
the
statement
of
the
question
of
crsus
for
in
order
that
any
one
should
be
conceived
of
as
happy
we
must
await
his
death
for
happiness
depends
upon
his
condition
to
the
end
and
upon
the
fact
that
his
death
should
be
a
pious
one
and
be
consistent
with
his
higher
destiny
because
the
life
of
crsus
had
not
yet
expired
solon
could
not
deem
him
happy
and
the
history
of
crsus
bears
evidence
that
no
momentary
state
deserves
the
name
of
happiness
this
edifying
history
holds
in
its
embrace
the
whole
standpoint
of
the
reflection
of
that
time
division
of
the
subject
in
the
consideration
of
greek
philosophy
we
have
now
to
distinguish
further
three
important
periodsin
the
first
place
the
period
from
thales
to
aristotle
secondly
greek
philosophy
in
the
roman
world
thirdly
the
neoplatonic
philosophy
1
we
begin
with
thought
as
it
is
in
a
quite
abstract
natural
or
sensuous
form
and
we
proceed
from
this
to
the
idea
as
determined
this
first
period
shows
the
beginning
of
philosophic
thought
and
goes
on
to
its
development
and
perfection
as
a
totality
of
knowledge
in
itself
this
takes
place
in
aristotle
as
representing
the
unity
of
what
has
come
before
in
plato
there
is
just
such
a
union
of
what
came
earlier
but
it
is
not
worked
out
for
he
only
represents
the
idea
generally
the
neoplatonists
have
been
called
eclectics
and
plato
was
said
to
have
brought
about
the
unity
they
were
not
however
eclectics
but
they
had
a
conscious
insight
into
the
necessity
for
uniting
these
philosophies
2
after
the
concrete
idea
was
reached
it
came
forth
as
if
in
opposites
perfecting
and
developing
itself
the
second
period
is
that
in
which
science
breaks
itself
up
into
different
systems
a
onesided
principle
is
carried
through
the
whole
conception
of
the
world
each
side
is
in
itself
formed
into
a
totality
and
stands
in
the
relation
of
one
extreme
to
another
the
philosophical
systems
of
stoicism
and
epicureanism
are
such
scepticism
forms
the
negative
to
their
dogmatism
while
the
other
philosophies
disappear
3
the
third
period
is
the
affirmative
the
withdrawal
of
the
opposition
into
an
ideal
world
or
a
world
of
thought
a
divine
world
this
is
the
idea
developed
into
totality
which
yet
lacks
subjectivity
as
the
infinite
beingforself
section
one
first
period
from
thales
to
aristotle
in
this
first
period
we
shall
again
make
three
divisions
1
the
first
extends
from
thales
to
anaxagoras
from
abstract
thought
which
is
in
immediate
determinateness
to
the
thought
of
the
selfdetermining
thought
here
a
beginning
is
made
with
the
absolutely
simple
in
which
the
earliest
methods
of
determination
manifest
themselves
as
attempts
until
the
time
of
anaxagoras
he
determines
the
true
as
the

and
as
active
thought
which
no
longer
is
in
a
determinate
character
but
which
is
selfdetermining
2
the
second
division
comprises
the
sophists
socrates
and
the
followers
of
socrates
here
the
selfdetermining
thought
is
conceived
of
as
present
and
concrete
in
me
that
constitutes
the
principle
of
subjectivity
if
not
also
of
infinite
subjectivity
for
thought
first
shows
itself
here
only
partly
as
abstract
principle
and
partly
as
contingent
subjectivity
3
the
third
division
which
deals
with
plato
and
aristotle
is
found
in
greek
science
where
objective
thought
the
idea
forms
itself
into
a
whole
the
concrete
in
itself
determining
thought
is
with
plato
the
still
abstract
idea
but
in
the
form
of
universality
while
with
aristotle
that
idea
was
conceived
of
as
the
selfdetermining
or
in
the
determination
of
its
efficacy
or
activity
chapter
i
period
idivision
ithales
to
anaxagoras
since
we
possess
only
traditions
and
fragments
of
this
epoch
we
may
speak
here
of
the
sources
of
these
1
the
first
source
is
found
in
plato
who
makes
copious
reference
to
the
older
philosophers
for
the
reason
that
he
makes
the
earlier
and
apparently
independent
philosophies
which
are
not
so
far
apart
when
once
their
notion
is
definitely
grasped
into
concrete
moments
of
one
idea
platos
philosophy
often
seems
to
be
merely
a
clearer
statement
of
the
doctrines
of
the
older
philosophers
and
hence
it
draws
upon
itself
the
reproach
of
plagiarism
plato
was
willing
to
spend
much
money
in
procuring
the
writings
of
the
older
philosophers
and
from
his
profound
study
of
these
his
conclusions
have
much
weight
but
because
in
his
writings
he
never
himself
appeared
as
teacher
but
always
represented
other
people
in
his
dialogues
as
the
philosophers
a
distinction
never
has
been
made
between
what
really
belonged
to
them
in
history
and
what
was
added
by
him
through
the
further
development
which
he
effected
in
their
thoughts
in
the
parmenides
for
instance
we
have
the
eleatic
philosophy
and
yet
the
working
out
of
this
doctrine
belongs
peculiarly
to
plato
2
aristotle
is
our
most
abundant
authority
he
studied
the
older
philosophers
expressly
and
most
thoroughly
and
he
has
in
the
beginning
of
his
metaphysics
especially
and
also
to
a
large
extent
elsewhere
dealt
with
them
in
historical
order
he
is
as
philosophic
as
erudite
and
we
may
rely
upon
him
we
can
do
no
better
in
greek
philosophy
than
study
the
first
book
of
his
metaphysics
when
the
wouldbewise
man
depreciates
aristotle
and
asserts
that
he
has
not
correctly
apprehended
plato
it
may
be
retorted
that
as
he
associated
with
plato
himself
with
his
deep
and
comprehensive
mind
perhaps
no
one
knew
him
better
3
ciceros
name
may
also
occur
to
us
herealthough
he
certainly
is
but
a
troubled
springsince
he
undoubtedly
gives
us
much
information
yet
because
he
was
lacking
in
philosophic
spirit
he
understood
philosophy
rather
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
history
merely
he
does
not
seem
to
have
himself
studied
its
first
sources
and
even
avows
that
for
instance
he
never
understood
heraclitus
and
because
this
old
and
deep
philosophy
did
not
interest
him
he
did
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
study
it
his
information
bears
principally
on
later
philosophersthe
stoics
epicureans
the
new
academy
and
the
peripatetics
he
saw
what
was
ancient
through
their
medium
and
generally
speaking
through
a
medium
of
reasoning
and
not
of
speculation
4
sextus
empiricus
a
later
sceptic
has
importance
through
his
writings
hypotyposes
pyrrhonic
and
adversus
mathematicos
because
as
a
sceptic
he
both
combated
the
dogmatic
philosophy
and
also
adduced
other
philosophers
as
testifying
to
scepticism
so
that
the
greater
part
of
his
writings
is
filled
with
the
tenets
of
other
philosophers
he
is
the
most
abundant
source
we
have
for
the
history
of
ancient
philosophy
and
he
has
retained
for
our
use
many
valuable
fragments

is
an
important
compilation
and
yet
it
brings
forward
copious
evidence
without
much
discrimination
a
philosophic
spirit
cannot
be
ascribed
to
it

about
amongst
bad
anecdotes

their
tenets

6
finally
we
must
speak
of
simplicius
a
later
greek
from
cilicia
living
under
justinian
in
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
he
is
the
most
learned
and
acute
of
the
greek
commentators
of
aristotle
and
of
his
writings
there
is
much
still
unpublished
to
him
we
certainly
owe
our
thanks
i
need
give
no
more
references
for
they
may
be
found
without
trouble
in
any
compendium
in
the
progress
of
greek
philosophy
men
were
formerly
accustomed
to
follow
the
order
that
showed
according
to
ordinary
ideas
an
external
connection
and
which
is
found
in
one
philosopher
having
had
another
as
his
teacherthis
connection
is
one
which
might
show
him
to
be
partly
derived
from
thales
and
partly
from
pythagoras
but
such
a
connection
is
in
part
defective
in
itself
and
in
part
it
is
merely
external
the
one
set
of
philosophic
sects
or
of
philosophers
classed
together
which
is
considered
as
belonging
to
a
systemthat
which
proceeds
from
thalespursues
its
course
in
time
and
mind
far
separate
from
the
other
but
in
truth
no
such
series
ever
does
exist
in
this
isolation
nor
would
it
do
so
even
though
the
individuals
were
consecutive
and
had
been
externally
connected
as
teacher
and
taught
which
never
is
the
case
mind
follows
quite
another
order
these
successive
series
are
interwoven
in
spirit
just
as
much
as
in
their
particular
content
we
come
across
thales
first
amongst
the
ionic
people
to
whom
the
athenians
belonged
or
from
whom
the
ionians
of
asia
minor
as
a
whole
derived
their
origin
the
ionic
race
appears
earlier
in
peloponnesus
but
seems
to
have
been
removed
from
thence
it
is
however
not
known
what
nations
belonged
to
it
for
according
to
herodotus
i
143
the
other
ionians
and
even
the
athenians
laid
aside
the
name
according
to
thucydides
i
2
and
12
the
ionic
colonies
in
asia
minor
and
the
islands
proceeded
principally
from
athens
because
the
athenians
on
account
of
the
overpopulation
of
attica
migrated
there
we
find
the
greatest
activity
in
greek
life
on
the
coasts
of
asia
minor
in
the
greek
islands
and
then
towards
the
west
of
magna
grcia
we
see
amongst
these
people
through
their
internal
political
activity
and
their
intercourse
with
foreigners
the
existence
of
a
diversity
and
variety
in
their
relations
whereby
narrowness
of
vision
is
done
away
with
and
the
universal
rises
in
its
place
these
two
places
ionia
and
greater
greece
are
thus
the
two
localities
where
this
first
period
in
the
history
of
philosophy
plays
its
part
until
the
time
when
that
period
being
ended
philosophy
plants
itself
in
greece
proper
and
there
makes
its
home
those
spots
were
also
the
seat
of
early
commerce
and
of
an
early
culture
while
greece
itself
so
far
as
these
are
concerned
followed
later
we
must
thus
remark
that
the
character
of
the
two
sides
into
which
these
philosophies
divide
the
philosophy
of
asia
minor
in
the
east
and
that
of
grecian
italy
in
the
west
partakes
of
the
character
of
the
geographical
distinction
on
the
asia
minor
side
and
also
in
the
islands
we
find
thales
anaximander
anaximenes
heraclitus
leucippus
democritus
anaxagoras
and
diogenes
from
crete
on
the
other
side
are
the
inhabitants
of
italy
pythagoras
from
samos
who
lived
in
italy
however
xenophanes
parmenides
zeno
empedocles
and
several
of
the
sophists
also
lived
in
italy
anaxagoras
was
the
first
to
come
to
athens
and
thus
his
science
takes
a
middle
place
between
both
extremes
and
athens
was
made
its
centre
the
geographical
distinction
makes
its
appearance
in
the
manifestation
of
thought
in
the
fact
that
with
the
orientals
a
sensuous
material
side
is
dominant
and
in
the
west
thought
on
the
contrary
prevails
because
it
is
constituted
into
the
principle
in
the
form
of
thought
those
philosophers
who
turned
to
the
east
knew
the
absolute
in
a
real
determination
of
nature
while
towards
italy
there
is
the
ideal
determination
of
the
absolute
these
explanations
will
be
sufficient
for
us
here
but
empedocles
whom
we
find
in
sicily
is
somewhat
of
a
natural
philosopher
while
gorgias
the
sicilian
sophist
remains
faithful
to
the
ideal
side
we
now
have
to
consider
further1
the
ionians
viz
thales
anaximander
anaximenes
2
pythagoras
and
his
followers
3
the
eleatics
viz
xenophanes
parmenides
c
4
heraclitus
5
empedocles
leucippus
and
democritus
6
anaxagoras
we
have
to
trace
and
point
out
the
progression
of
this
philosophy
also
the
first
and
altogether
abstract
determinations
are
found
with
thales
and
the
other
ionians
they
grasped
the
universal
in
the
form
of
a
natural
determination
as
water
and
air
progression
must
thus
take
place
by
leaving
behind
the
merely
natural
determination
and
we
find
that
this
is
so
with
the
pythagoreans
they
say
that
number
is
the
substance
or
the
essence
of
things
number
is
not
sensuous
nor
is
it
pure
thought
but
it
is
a
nonsensuous
object
of
sense
it
was
with
the
eleatics
that
pure
thought
appeared
and
that
its
forcible
liberation
from
the
sensuous
form
and
the
form
of
number
came
to
pass
and
thus
from
them
proceeds
the
dialectic
movement
of
thought
which
negates
the
definite
particular
in
order
to
show
that
it
is
not
the
many
but
only
the
one
that
is
true
heraclitus
declares
the
absolute
to
be
this
very
process
which
according
to
the
eleatics
was
still
subjective
he
arrived
at
objective
consciousness
since
in
it
the
absolute
is
that
which
moves
or
changes
empedocles
leucippus
and
democritus
on
the
contrary
rather
go
to
the
opposite
extreme
to
the
simple
material
stationary
principle
to
the
substratum
which
underlies
the
process
and
thus
this
last
as
being
movement
is
distinguished
from
it
with
anaxagoras
it
is
the
moving
selfdetermining
thought
itself
that
is
then
known
as
existence
and
this
is
a
great
step
forward
a
the
ionic
philosophy
here
we
have
the
earlier
ionic
philosophy
which
we
desire
to
treat
as
shortly
as
possible
and
this
is
so
much
the
easier
that
the
thought
contained
in
it
is
very
abstract
and
barren
other
philosophers
than
thales
anaximander
and
anaximenes
only
come
under
our
consideration
as
names
we
have
no
more
than
half
a
dozen
passages
in
the
whole
of
the
early
ionic
philosophy
and
that
makes
it
an
easy
study
yet
learning
prides
itself
most
upon
the
ancients
for
we
may
be
most
learned
about
that
of
which
we
know
the
least

thales
with
thales
we
properly
speaking
first
begin
the
history
of
philosophy
the
life
of
thales
occurred
at
the
time
when
the
ionic
towns
were
under
the
dominion
of
crsus
through
his
overthrow
ol
58
1
548
bc
an
appearance
of
freedom
was
produced
yet
the
most
of
these
towns
were
conquered
by
the
persians
and
thales
survived
the
catastrophe
only
a
few
years
he
was
born
at
miletus
his
family
is
by
diogenes
i
22
37
stated
to
be
the
phnician
one
of
thelides
and
the
date
of
his
birth
according
to
the
best
calculation
is
placed
in
the
first
year
of
the
35th
olympiad
640
bc
but
according
to
meiners
it
was
a
couple
of
olympiads
later
38th
olympiad
629
bc
thales
lived
as
a
statesman
partly
with
crsus
and
partly
in
miletus
herodotus
quotes
him
several
times
and
tells
i
75
that
according
to
the
narratives
of
the
greeks
when
crsus
went
to
battle
against
cyrus
and
had
difficulty
in
passing
over
the
river
halys
thales
who
accompanied
the
army
diverted
the
river
by
a
trench
which
he
made
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
behind
the
camp
so
that
it
could
then
be
forded
diogenes
i
25
says
further
of
him
as
regards
his
relations
to
his
country
that
he
restrained
the
men
of
miletus
from
allying
themselves
with
crsus
when
he
went
against
cyrus
and
that
hence
after
the
conquest
of
crsus
when
the
other
ionic
states
were
subdued
by
the
persians
the
inhabitants
of
miletus
alone
remained
undisturbed
diogenes
records
moreover
i
23
that
he
soon
withdrew
his
attention
from
the
affairs
of
the
state
and
devoted
himself
entirely
to
science
voyages
to
phnicia
are
recorded
of
him
which
however
rest
on
vague
tradition
but
that
he
was
in
egypt
in
his
old
age
seems
undoubted19
there
he
was
said
to
have
learned
geometry
but
this
would
appear
not
to
have
been
much
judging
from
the
anecdote
which
diogenes
i
24
27
retails
from
a
certain
hieronymus
it
was
to
the
effect
that
thales
taught
the
egyptians
to
measure
the
height
of
their
pyramids
by
shadowby
taking
the
relation
borne
by
the
height
of
a
man
to
his
shadow
the
terms
of
the
proportion
are
as
the
shadow
of
a
man
is
to
the
height
of
a
man
so
is
the
shadow
of
a
pyramid
to
its
height
if
this
were
something
new
to
the
egyptians
they
must
have
been
very
far
back
in
the
theory
of
geometry
herodotus
tells
i
74
moreover
that
thales
foretold
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
that
happened
exactly
on
the
day
of
the
battle
between
the
medians
and
lydians
and
that
he
ascribed
the
rising
of
the
nile
to
the
contrary
etesian
winds
which
drove
back
the
waters20
we
have
some
further
isolated
instances
of
and
anecdotes
about
his
astronomical
knowledge
and
works21
in
gazing
at
and
making
observations
on
the
stars
he
fell
into
a
ditch
and
the
people
mocked
him
as
one
who
had
knowledge
of
heavenly
objects
and
yet
could
not
see
what
lay
at
his
own
feet
the
people
laugh
at
such
things
and
boast
that
philosophers
cannot
tell
them
about
such
matters
but
they
do
not
understand
that
philosophers
laugh
at
them
for
they
do
not
fall
into
a
ditch
just
because
they
lie
in
one
for
all
time
and
because
they
cannot
see
what
exists
above
them
he
also
showed
according
to
diogenes
i
26
that
a
wise
man
if
he
wishes
can
easily
acquire
riches
it
is
more
important
that
he
fixed
that
the
year
as
solar
year
should
have
365
days
the
anecdote
of
the
golden
tripod
to
be
given
to
the
wisest
man
is
recorded
by
diogenes
i
2733
and
it
carries
with
it
considerable
weight
because
he
combines
all
the
different
versions
of
the
story
the
tripod
was
given
to
thales
or
to
bias
thales
gave
it
to
some
one
else
and
thus
it
went
through
a
circle
until
it
again
came
to
thales
the
latter
or
else
solon
decided
that
apollo
was
wisest
and
sent
it
to
didyma
or
to
delphi
thales
died
according
to
diogenes
i
38
aged
seventyeight
or
ninety
in
the
58th
olympiad
according
to
tennemann
vol
i
p
414
it
was
in
olympiad
59
2
543
bc
when
pythagoras
came
to
crotona
diogenes
relates
that
he
died
at
one
of
the
games
overcome
by
heat
and
thirst
we
have
no
writings
by
thales
and
we
do
not
know
whether
he
was
in
the
habit
of
writing
diogenes
laertius
i
23
34
35
speaks
of
two
hundred
verses
on
astronomy
and
some
maxims
such
as
it
is
not
the
many
words
that
have
most
meaning
as
to
his
philosophy
he
is
universally
recognized
as
the
first
natural
philosopher
but
all
one
knows
of
him
is
little
and
yet
we
seem
to
know
the
most
of
what
there
is
for
since
we
find
that
the
further
philosophic
progress
of
which
his
speculative
idea
was
capable
and
the
understanding
of
his
propositions
which
they
alone
could
have
make
their
first
appearance
and
form
particular
epochs
with
the
philosophers
succeeding
him
who
may
be
recognized
thereby
this
development
ascribed
to
thales
never
took
place
with
him
at
all
thus
if
it
is
the
case
that
a
number
of
his
other
reflections
have
been
lost
they
cannot
have
had
any
particular
speculative
value
and
his
philosophy
does
not
show
itself
to
be
an
imperfect
system
from
want
of
information
about
it
but
because
the
first
philosophy
cannot
be
a
system
we
must
listen
to
aristotle
as
regards
these
ancient
philosophers
for
he
speaks
most
sympathetically
of
them
in
the
passage
of
most
importance
metaph
i
3
he
says
since
it
is
clear
that
we
must
acquire
the
science
of
first
causes



seeing
that
we
say
that
a
person
knows
a
thing
when
he
becomes
acquainted
with
its
cause
there
are
we
must
recollect
four
causesbeing
and
form
first
for
the
why
is
finally
led
back
to
the
notion
but
yet
the
first
why
is
a
cause
and
principle
matter
and
substratum
second
the
cause
whence
comes
the
beginning
of
movement
third
and
fourth
the
cause
which
is
opposed
to
this
the
aim
in
view
and
the
good
for
that
is
the
end
of
every
origination
hence
we
would
make
mention
of
those
who
have
undertaken
the
investigation
of
being
before
us
and
have
speculated
regarding
the
truth
for
they
openly
advance
certain
principles
and
first
causes
if
we
take
them
under
our
consideration
it
will
be
of
this
advantage
so
far
as
our
present
investigation
goes
that
we
shall
either
find
other
kinds
of
causes
or
be
enabled
to
have
so
much
the
more
confidence
in
those
just
named
most
of
the
earliest
philosophers
have
placed
the
principles
of
everything
in
something
in
the
form
of
matter



for
that
from
which
everything
existent
comes
and
out
of
which
it
takes
its
origin
as
its
first
source
and
into
which
it
finally
sinks
as
substance

ever
remains
the
same
and
only
changes
in
its
particular
qualities

and
this
is
called
the
element

and
this
the
principle
of
all
that
exists
the
absolute
prius
on
this
account
they
maintain
that
nothing
arises
or
passes
away
because
the
same
nature
always
remains
for
instance
we
say
that
absolutely
speaking
socrates
neither
originates
if
he
becomes
beautiful
or
musical
nor
does
he
pass
away
if
he
loses
these
qualities
because
the
subject


socrates
remains
the
same
and
so
it
is
with
all
else
for
there
must
be
one
nature
or
more
than
one
from
which
all
else
arises
because
it
maintains
its
existence


that
means
that
in
its
change
there
is
no
reality
or
truth
all
do
not
coincide
as
to
the
number
of
this
principle
or
as
to
its
description

thales
the
founder
of
this
philosophy
which
recognizes
something
material
as
the
principle
and
substance
of
all
that
is
says
that
it
is
water
hence
he
likewise
asserts
the
earth
to
be
founded
on
water
water
is
thus
the

the
first
ground
and
according
to
senecas
statement
qust
nat
vi
6
it
seems
to
him
to
be
not
so
much
the
inside
of
the
earth
as
what
encloses
it
which
is
the
universal
existence
for
thales
considered
that
the
whole
earth
has
water
as
its
support
subjecto
humore
and
that
it
swims
thereon
we
might
first
of
all
expect
some
explanation
of
the
application
of
these
principles
as
for
example
how
it
is
to
be
proved
that
water
is
the
universal
substance
and
in
what
way
particular
forms
are
deduced
from
it
but
as
to
this
we
must
say
that
of
thales
in
particular
we
know
nothing
more
than
his
principle
which
is
that
water
is
the
god
over
all
no
more
do
we
know
anything
further
of
anaximander
anaximenes
and
diogenes
than
their
principles
aristotle
brings
forward
a
conjecture
as
to
how
thales
derived
everything
directly
out
of
water
perhaps

the
conclusions
of
thales
have
been
brought
about
from
the
reflection
that
it
was
evident
that
all
nourishment
is
moist
and
warmth
itself
comes
out
of
moisture
and
thereby
life
continues
but
that
from
which
anything
generates
is
the
principle
of
all
things
this
was
one
reason
for
holding
this
theory
and
another
reason
is
contained
in
the
fact
that
all
germs
are
moist
in
character
and
water
is
the
principle
of
what
is
moist
it
is
necessary
to
remark
that
the
circumstances
introduced
by
aristotle
with
a
perhaps
which
are
supposed
to
have
brought
about
the
conclusions
of
thales
making
water
the
absolute
essence
of
everything
are
not
adduced
as
the
grounds
acknowledged
by
thales
and
furthermore
they
can
hardly
be
called
grounds
for
what
aristotle
does
is
rather
to
establish
as
we
would
say
from
actuality
that
the
latter
corresponds
to
the
universal
idea
of
water
his
successors
as
for
instance

remarks
with
great
reason
that
plutarch
omits
the
perhaps
for
plutarch
says
thales
suggests

that
everything
takes
its
origin
from
water
and
resolves
itself
into
the
same
because
as
the
germs
of
all
that
live
have
moisture
as
the
principle
of
life
all
else
might
likewise

take
its
principle
from
moisture
for
all
plants
draw
their
nourishment
and
thus
bear
fruit
from
water
and
if
they
are
without
it
fade
away
and
even
the
fires
of
sun
and
stars
and
world
are
fed
through
the
evaporation
of
water
aristotle
is
contented
with
simply
showing
in
regard
to
moisture
that
at
least
it
is
everywhere
to
be
found
since
plutarch
gives
more
definite
grounds
for
holding
that
water
is
the
simple
essence
of
things
we
must
see
whether
things
in
so
far
as
they
are
simple
essence
are
water

the
germ
of
the
animal
of
moist
nature
is
undoubtedly
the
animal
as
the
simple
actual
or
as
the
essence
of
its
actuality
or
undeveloped
actuality

if
with
plants
water
may
be
regarded
as
for
their
nourishment
nourishment
is
still
only
the
being
of
a
thing
as
formless
substance
that
first
becomes
individualized
by
individuality
and
thus
succeeds
in
obtaining
form

to
make
sun
moon
and
the
whole
world
arise
through
evaporation
like
the
food
of
plants
certainly
approximates
to
the
idea
of
the
ancients
who
did
not
allow
the
sun
and
moon
to
have
obtained
independence
as
we
do
there
are
also
some
continues
aristotle
who
hold
that
all
the
ancients
who
at
the
first
and
long
before
the
present
generation
made
theology
their
study
understood
nature
thus
they
made
oceanus
and
tethys
the
producers
of
all
origination


and
water
which
by
the
poets
is
called
styx
the
oath
of
the
gods
for
what
is
most
ancient
is
most
revered
and
the
oath
is
that
most
held
in
reverence
this
old
tradition
has
within
it
speculative
significance
if
anything
cannot
be
proved
or
is
devoid
of
objective
form
such
as
we
have
in
respect
of
payment
in
a
discharge
or
in
witnesses
who
have
seen
the
transaction
the
oath
the
confirmation
of
myself
as
object
expresses
the
fact
that
my
assurance
is
absolute
truth
now
since
by
way
of
confirmation
men
swear
by
what
is
best
by
what
is
absolutely
certain
and
the
gods
swore
by
the
subterranean
water
it
follows
that
the
essence
of
pure
thought
the
inmost
being
the
reality
in
which
consciousness
finds
its
truth
is
water
i
so
to
speak
express
this
clear
certainty
of
myself
as
object
as
god
1
the
closer
consideration
of
this
principle
in
its
bearings
would
have
no
interest
for
since
the
whole
philosophy
of
thales
lies
in
the
fact
that
water
is
this
principle
the
only
point
of
interest
can
be
to
ask
how
far
that
principle
is
important
and
speculative
thales
comprehends
essence
as
devoid
of
form
while
the
sensuous
certitude
of
each
thing
in
its
individuality
is
not
questioned
this
objective
actuality
is
now
to
be
raised
into
the
notion
that
reflects
itself
into
itself
and
is
itself
to
be
set
forth
as
notion
in
commencement
this
is
seen
in
the
worlds
being
manifested
as
water
or
as
a
simple
universal
fluid
is
in
its
notion
life
and
hence
it
is
water
itself
spiritually
expressed
in
the
socalled
grounds
or
reasons
on
the
contrary
water
has
the
form
of
existent
universal
we
certainly
grant
this
universal
activity
of
water
and
for
that
reason
call
it
an
element
a
physical
universal
power
but
while
we
find
it
thus
to
be
the
universal
of
activity
we
also
find
it
to
be
this
actual
not
everywhere
but
in
proximity
to
other
elementsearth
air
and
fire
water
thus
has
not
got
a
sensuous
universality
but
a
speculative
one
merely
to
be
speculative
universality
however
would
necessitate
its
being
notion
and
having
what
is
sensuous
removed
here
we
have
the
strife
between
sensuous
universality
and
universality
of
the
notion
the
real
essence
of
nature
has
to
be
defined
that
is
nature
has
to
be
expressed
as
the
simple
essence
of
thought
now
simple
essence
the
notion
of
the
universal
is
that
which
is
devoid
of
form
but
this
water
as
it
is
comes
into
the
determination
of
form
and
is
thus
in
relation
to
others
a
particular
existence
just
like
everything
that
is
natural
yet
as
regards
the
other
elements
water
is
determined
as
formless
and
simple
while
the
earth
is
that
which
has
points
air
is
the
element
of
all
change
and
fire
evidently
changes
into
itself
now
if
the
need
of
unity
impels
us
to
recognize
for
separate
things
a
universal
water
although
it
has
the
drawback
of
being
a
particular
thing
can
easily
be
utilized
as
the
one
both
on
account
of
its
neutrality
and
because
it
is
more
material
than
air
the
proposition
of
thales
that
water
is
the
absolute
or
as
the
ancients
say
the
principle
is
the
beginning
of
philosophy
because
with
it
the
consciousness
is
arrived
at
that
essence
truth
that
which
is
alone
in
and
for
itself
are
one
a
departure
from
what
is
in
our
sensuous
perception
here
takes
place
man
recedes
from
this
immediate
existence
we
must
be
able
to
forget
that
we
are
accustomed
to
a
rich
concrete
world
of
thought
with
us
the
very
child
learns
there
is
one
god
in
heaven
invisible
such
determinations
are
not
yet
present
here
the
world
of
thought
must
first
be
formed
and
there
is
as
yet
no
pure
unity
man
has
nature
before
him
as
water
air
stars
the
arch
of
the
heavens
and
the
horizon
of
his
ideas
is
limited
to
this
the
imagination
has
indeed
its
gods
but
its
content
still
is
natural
the
greeks
had
considered
sun
mountains
earth
sea
rivers
c
as
independent
powers
revered
them
as
gods
and
elevated
them
by
the
imagination
to
activity
movement
consciousness
and
will
what
there
is
besides
like
the
conceptions
of
homer
for
instance
is
something
in
which
thought
could
not
find
satisfaction
it
produces
mere
images
of
the
imagination
endlessly
endowed
with
animation
and
form
but
destitute
of
simple
unity
it
must
undoubtedly
be
said
that
in
this
unconsciousness
of
an
intellectual
world
one
must
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
great
robustness
of
mind
evinced
in
not
granting
this
plenitude
of
existence
to
the
natural
world
but
in
reducing
it
to
a
simple
substance
which
as
the
ever
enduring
principle
neither
originates
nor
disappears
while
the
gods
have
a
theogony
and
are
manifold
and
changing
this
wild
endlessly
varied
imagination
of
homer
is
set
at
rest
by
the
proposition
that
existence
is
water
this
conflict
of
an
endless
quantity
of
principles
all
these
ideas
that
a
particular
object
is
an
independent
truth
a
selfsufficient
power
over
others
existing
in
its
own
right
are
taken
away
and
it
is
shown
likewise
that
there
is
only
one
universal
the
universal
selfexistent
the
simple
unimaginative
perception
the
thought
that
is
one
and
one
alone
this
universal
stands
in
direct
relationship
to
the
particular
and
to
the
existence
of
the
world
as
manifested
the
first
thing
implied
in
what
has
been
said
is
that
the
particular
existence
has
no
independence
is
not
true
in
and
for
itself
but
is
only
an
accidental
modification
but
the
affirmative
point
of
view
is
that
all
other
things
proceed
from
the
one
that
the
one
remains
thereby
the
substance
from
which
all
other
things
proceed
and
it
is
only
through
a
determination
which
is
accidental
and
external
that
the
particular
existence
has
its
being
it
is
similarly
the
case
that
all
particular
existence
is
transient
that
is
it
loses
the
form
of
particular
and
again
becomes
the
universal
water
the
simple
proposition
of
thales
therefore
is
philosophy
because
in
it
water
though
sensuous
is
not
looked
at
in
its
particularity
as
opposed
to
other
natural
things
but
as
thought
in
which
everything
is
resolved
and
comprehended
thus
we
approach
the
divorce
of
the
absolute
from
the
finite
but
it
is
not
to
be
thought
that
the
unity
stands
above
and
that
down
here
we
have
the
finite
world
this
idea
is
often
found
in
the
common
conception
of
godwhere
permanence
is
attributed
to
the
world
and
where
men
often
represent
two
kinds
of
actuality
to
themselves
a
sensuous
and
a
supersensuous
world
of
equal
standing
the
philosophic
point
of
view
is
that
the
one
is
alone
the
truly
actual
and
here
we
must
take
actual
in
its
higher
significance
because
we
call
everything
actual
in
common
life
the
second
circumstance
to
be
remembered
is
that
with
the
ancient
philosophers
the
principle
has
a
definite
and
at
first
a
physical
form
to
us
this
does
not
appear
to
be
philosophic
but
only
physical
in
this
case
however
matter
has
philosophic
significance
thales
theory
is
thus
a
natural
philosophy
because
this
universal
essence
is
determined
as
real
consequently
the
absolute
is
determined
as
the
unity
of
thought
and
being
2
now
if
we
have
this
undifferentiated
principle
predominating
the
question
arises
as
to
the
determination
of
this
first
principle
the
transition
from
universal
to
particular
at
once
becomes
essential
and
it
begins
with
the
determination
of
activity
the
necessity
for
such
arises
here
that
which
is
to
be
a
veritable
principle
must
not
have
a
onesided
particular
form
but
in
it
the
difference
must
itself
be
absolute
while
other
principles
are
only
special
kinds
of
forms
the
fact
that
the
absolute
is
what
determines
itself
is
already
more
concrete
we
have
the
activity
and
the
higher
selfconsciousness
of
the
spiritual
principle
by
which
the
form
has
worked
itself
into
being
absolute
form
the
totality
of
form
since
it
is
most
profound
this
comes
latest
what
has
first
to
be
done
is
merely
to
look
at
things
as
determined
form
is
lacking
to
water
as
conceived
by
thales
how
is
this
accorded
to
it
the
method
is
stated
and
stated
by
aristotle
but
not
directly
of
thales
in
which
particular
forms
have
arisen
out
of
water
it
is
said
to
be
through
a
process
of
condensation
and
rarefaction



or
as
it
may
be
better
put
through
greater
or
less
intensity

in
reference
to
this
cites
from

where
there
is
no
mention
of
condensation
and
rarefaction
as
regards
thales
and
further
de

where
it
is
only
said
that
those
who
uphold
water
or
air
or
something
finer
than
water
or
coarser
than
air
define
difference
as
density
and
rarity
but
nothing
is
said
of
its
being
thales
who
gave
expression
to
this
distinction
tiedmann
vol
i
p
38
quotes
yet
other
authorities
it
was
however
later
on
that
this
distinction
was
first
ascribed
to
thales22
thus
much
is
made
out
that
for
the
first
time
in
this
natural
philosophy
as
in
the
modern
that
which
is
essential
in
form
is
really
the
quantitative
difference
in
its
existence
this
merely
quantitative
difference
however
which
as
the
increasing
and
decreasing
density
of
water
constitutes
its
only
formdetermination
is
an
external
expression
of
the
absolute
difference
it
is
an
unessential
distinction
set
up
through
another
and
is
not
the
inner
difference
of
the
notion
in
itself
it
is
therefore
not
worth
while
to
spend
more
time
over
it
difference
as
regards
the
notion
has
no
physical
significance
but
differences
or
the
simple
duality
of
form
in
the
sides
of
its
opposition
must
be
comprehended
as
universally
in
the
notion
on
this
account
a
sensuous
interpretation
must
not
be
given
to
the
material
that
is
to
particular
determinations
as
when
it
is
definitely
said
that
rare
water
is
air
rare
air
fiery
ether
thick
water
mud
which
then
becomes
earth
according
to
this
air
would
be
the
rarefaction
of
the
first
water
ether
the
rarefaction
of
air
and
earth
and
mud
the
sediment
of
water
as
sensuous
difference
or
change
the
division
here
appears
as
something
manifested
for
consciousness
the
moderns
have
experimented
in
making
thicker
and
thinner
what
to
the
senses
is
the
same
change
has
consequently
a
double
sense
one
with
reference
to
existence
and
another
with
reference
to
the
notion
when
change
is
considered
by
the
ancients
it
is
usually
supposed
to
have
to
do
with
a
change
in
what
exists
and
thus
for
instance
inquiry
would
be
made
as
to
whether
water
can
be
changed
through
chemical
action
such
as
heat
distillation
c
into
earth
finite
chemistry
is
confined
to
this
but
what
is
meant
in
all
ancient
philosophies
is
change
as
regards
the
notion
that
is
to
say
water
does
not
become
converted
into
air
or
space
and
time
in
retorts
c
but
in
every
philosophic
idea
this
transition
of
one
quality
into
another
takes
place
ie
this
inward
connection
is
shown
in
the
notion
according
to
which
no
one
thing
can
subsist
independently
and
without
the
other
for
the
life
of
nature
has
its
subsistence
in
the
fact
that
one
thing
is
necessarily
related
to
the
other
we
certainly
are
accustomed
to
believe
that
if
water
were
taken
away
it
would
indeed
fare
badly
with
plants
and
animals
but
that
stones
would
still
remain
or
that
of
colours
blue
could
be
abstracted
without
harming
in
the
least
yellow
or
red
as
regards
merely
empirical
existence
it
may
easily
be
shown
that
each
quality
exists
on
its
own
account
but
in
the
notion
they
only
are
through
one
another
and
by
virtue
of
an
inward
necessity
we
certainly
see
this
also
in
living
matter
where
things
happen
in
another
way
for
here
the
notion
comes
into
existence
thus
if
for
example
we
abstract
the
heart
the
lungs
and
all
else
collapse
and
in
the
same
way
all
nature
exists
only
in
the
unity
of
all
its
parts
just
as
the
brain
can
exist
only
in
unity
with
the
other
organs
3
if
the
form
is
however
only
expressed
in
both
its
sides
as
condensation
and
rarefaction
it
is
not
in
and
for
itself
for
to
be
this
it
must
be
grasped
as
the
absolute
notion
and
as
an
endlessly
forming
unity
what
is
said
on
this
point
by
aristotle
de
anima
i

also

is
this
thales
seems
according
to
what
is
said
of
him
to
consider
the
soul
as
something
having
movement
for
he
says
of
the
loadstone
that
it
has
a
soul
since
it
moves
the
iron
diogenes
laertius
i
24
adds
amber
to
this
from
which
we
see
that
even
thales
knew
about
electricity
although
another
explanation
of
it
is
that

was
besides
a
metal
aldobrandini
says
of
this
passage
in
diogenes
that
it
is
a
stone
which
is
so
hostile
to
poison
that
when
touched
by
such
it
immediately
hisses
the
above
remark
by
aristotle
is
perverted
by
diogenes
to
such
an
extent
that
he
says
thales
has
likewise
ascribed
a
soul
to
what
is
lifeless
however
this
is
not
the
question
for
the
point
is
how
he
thought
of
absolute
form
and
whether
he
expressed
the
idea
generally
as
soul
so
that
absolute
essence
should
be
the
unity
of
simple
essence
and
form
diogenes
certainly
says
further
of
thales
i
27
the
world
is
animated
and
full
of
demons
and
plutarch
de
plac
phil
i
7
says
he
called
god
the
intelligence

of
the
world
but
all
the
ancients
and
particularly
aristotle
ascribe
this
expression
unanimously
to
anaxagoras
as
the
one
who
first
said
that
the

is
the
principle
of
things
thus
it
does
not
conduce
to
the
further
determination
of
form
according
to
thales
to
find
in
cicero

this
passage
thales
says
that
water
is
the
beginning
of
everything
but
god
is
the
mind
which
forms
all
that
is
out
of

thales
may
certainly
have
spoken
of
god
but
cicero
has
added
the
statement
that
he
comprehended
him
as
the

which
formed
everything
out
of
water
tiedmann
vol
i
p
42
declares
the
passage
to
be
possibly
corrupt
since
cicero
later
on
c
11
says
of
anaxagoras
that
he
first
maintained
the
order
of
things
to
have
been
brought
about
through
the
infinite
power
of
mind
however
the
epicurean
in
whose
mouth
these
words
are
put
speaks
with
confidence
only
fearing
that
he
should
appear
to
have
any
doubts
c
8
both
previously
and
subsequently
of
other
philosophers
rather
foolishly
so
that
this
description
is
given
merely
as
a
jest
aristotle
understands
historic
accuracy
better
and
therefore
we
must
follow
him
but
to
those
who
make
it
their
business
to
find
everywhere
the
conception
of
the
creation
of
the
world
by
god
that
passage
in
cicero
is
a
great
source
of
delight
and
it
is
a
much
disputed
point
whether
thales
is
to
be
counted
amongst
those
who
accepted
the
existence
of
a
god
the
theism
of
thales
is
maintained
by
plouquet
whilst
others
would
have
him
to
be
an
atheist
or
polytheist
because
he
says
that
everything
is
full
of
demons
however
this
question
as
to
whether
thales
believed
in
god
does
not
concern
us
here
for
acceptation
faith
popular
religion
are
not
in
question
we
only
have
to
do
with
the
philosophic
determination
of
absolute
existence
and
if
thales
did
speak
of
god
as
constituting
everything
out
of
this
same
water
that
would
not
give
us
any
further
information
about
this
existence
we
should
have
spoken
unphilosophically
of
thales
because
we
should
have
used
an
empty
word
without
inquiring
about
its
speculative
significance
similarly
the
word
worldsoul
is
useless
because
its
being
is
not
thereby
expressed
thus
all
these
further
as
also
later
assertions
do
not
justify
us
in
maintaining
that
thales
comprehended
form
in
the
absolute
in
a
definite
manner
on
the
contrary
the
rest
of
the
history
of
philosophical
development
refutes
this
view
we
see
that
form
certainly
seems
to
be
shown
forth
in
existence
but
as
yet
this
unity
is
no
further
developed
the
idea
that
the
magnet
has
a
soul
is
indeed
always
better
than
saying
that
it
has
the
power
of
attraction
for
power
is
a
quality
which
is
considered
as
a
predicate
separable
from
matter
while
soul
is
movement
in
unison
with
matter
in
its
essence
an
idea
such
as
this
of
thales
stands
isolated
however
and
has
no
further
relation
to
his
absolute
thought
thus
in
fact
the
philosophy
of
thales
is
comprised
in
the
following
simple
elements
a
it
has
constituted
an
abstraction
in
order
to
comprehend
nature
in
a
simple
sensuous
essence
b
it
has
brought
forth
the
notion
of
ground
or
principle
that
is
it
has
defined
water
to
be
the
infinite
notion
the
simple
essence
of
thought
without
determining
it
further
as
the
difference
of
quantity
that
is
the
limited
significance
of
this
principle
of
thales

anaximander
anaximander
was
also
of
miletus
and
he
was
a
friend
of
thales
the
latter
says
cicero
acad
quaest
iv
37
could
not
convince
him
that
everything
consisted
of
water
anaximanders
father
was
called
praxiades
the
date
of
his
birth
is
not
quite
certain
according
to
tennemann

is
put

while
diogenes
laertius
ii
i

says
taking
his
information
from
apollodorus
an
athenian
that
in
ol
58
2
547
bc
he
was
sixtyfour
years
old
and
that
he
died
soon
after
that
is
to
say
about
the
date
of
thales
death
and
taking
for
granted
that
he
died
in
his
ninetieth
year
thales
must
have
been
nearly
twentyeight
years
older
than
anaximander
it
is
related
of
anaximander
that
he
lived
in
samos
with
the
tyrant
polycrates
where
were
pythagoras
and
anacreon
also
themistius
according
to
brucker
pt
i
p
478
says
of
him
that
he
first
put
his
philosophic
thoughts
into
writing
but
this
is
also
recorded
of
others
as
for
example
of
pherecydes
who
was
older
than
he
anaximander
is
said
to
have
written
about
nature
the
fixed
stars
the
sphere
besides
other
matters
he
further
produced
something
like
a
map
showing
the
boundary

of
land
and
sea
he
also
made
other
mathematical
inventions
such
as
a
sundial
that
he
put
up
in
lacedmon
and
instruments
by
which
the
course
of
the
sun
was
shown
and
the
equinox
determined
a
chart
of
the
heavens
was
likewise
made
by
him
his
philosophical
reflections
are
not
comprehensive
and
do
not
extend
as
far
as
to
determination
diogenes
says
in
the
passage
quoted
before
he
adduced
the
infinite


the
undetermined
as
principle
and
element
he
neither
determined
it
as
air
or
water
or
any
such
thing
there
are
however
few
attributes
of
this
infinite
given

it
is
the
principle
of
all
becoming
and
passing
away
at
long
intervals
infinite
worlds
or
gods
rise
out
of
it
and
again
they
pass
away
into
the
same
this
has
quite
an
oriental
tone
he
gives
as
a
reason
that
the
principle
is
to
be
determined
as
the
infinite
the
fact
that
it
does
not
need
material
for
continuous
origination
it
contains
everything
in
itself
and
rules
over
all
it
is
divine
immortal
and
never
passes
away23

out
of
the
one
anaximander
separates
the
opposites
which
are
contained
in
it
as
do
empedocles
and
anaxagoras
thus
everything
in
this
medley
is
certainly
there
but
undetermined24
that
is
everything
is
really
contained
therein
in
possibility

so
that
says
aristotle
metaphys
xi
2
it
is
not
only
that
everything
arises
accidentally
out
of
what
is
not
but
everything
also
arises
from
what
is
although
it
is
from
incipient
being
which
is
not
yet
in
actuality
diogenes

the
parts
of
the
infinite
change
but
it
itself
is
unchangeable

lastly
it
is
said
that
the
infinitude
is
in
size
and
not
in
number
and
anaximander
differs
thus
from
anaxagoras
empedocles
and
the
other
atomists
who
maintain
the
absolute
discretion
of
the
infinite
while
anaximander
upholds
its
absolute
continuity25
aristotle
metaphys
i
8
speaks
also
of
a
principle
which
is
neither
water
nor
air
but
is
thicker
than
air
and
thinner
than
water
many
have
connected
this
idea
with
anaximander
and
it
is
possible
that
it
belongs
to
him
the
advance
made
by
the
determination
of
the
principle
as
infinite
in
comprehensiveness
rests
in
the
fact
that
absolute
essence
no
longer
is
a
simple
universal
but
one
which
negates
the
finite
at
the
same
time
viewed
from
the
material
side
anaximander
removes
the
individuality
of
the
element
of
water
his
objective
principle
does
not
appear
to
be
material
and
it
may
be
understood
as
thought
but
it
is
clear
that
he
did
not
mean
anything
else
than
matter
generally
universal
matter26
plutarch
reproaches
anaximander
for
not
saying
what

his
infinite
is
whether
air
water
or
earth
but
a
definite
quality
such
as
one
of
these
is
transient
matter
determined
as
infinitude
means
the
motion
of
positing
definite
forms
and
again
abolishing
the
separation
true
and
infinite
being
is
to
be
shown
in
this
and
not
in
negative
absence
of
limit
this
universality
and
negation
of
the
finite
is
however
our
operation
only
in
describing
matter
as
infinite
anaximander
does
not
seem
to
have
said
that
this
is
its
infinitude
he
has
said
further
and
in
this
according
to
theophrastus
he
agrees
with
anaxagoras
in
the
infinite
the
like
separates
itself
from
the
unlike
and
allies
itself
to
the
like
thus
what
in
the
whole
was
gold
becomes
gold
what
was
earth
earth
c
so
that
properly
nothing
originates
seeing
that
it
was
already
there27
these
however
are
poor
determinations
which
only
show
the
necessity
of
the
transition
from
the
undetermined
to
the
determined
for
this
still
takes
place
here
in
an
unsatisfying
way
as
to
the
further
question
of
how
the
infinite
determines
the
opposite
in
its
separation
it
seems
that
the
theory
of
the
quantitative
distinction
of
condensation
and
rarefaction
was
held
by
anaximander
as
well
as
by
thales
those
who
come
later
designate
the
process
of
separation
from
the
infinite

supposes
man
to

he
found
that

a

was
indeed
essential
and
air
has
the
additional
advantage
of
being

the

of

expressly
says
p

a
that
the
first
principle
was
to
him
one
and
infinite
in
nature
as
it
was
to
anaximander
but
it
was
not
indefinite
as
with
the
latter
but
determined
that
is
it
was
air
which
however
he
seems
to
have
understood
as
endowed
with
soul
plutarch
characterizes
anaximenes
mode
of
representation
which
makes
everything
proceed
from

on
it
was
called

therein

thus
as

the

anaximenes
shows
very
clearly
the
nature
of
his
essence
in
the
soul
and
he
thus
points
out
what
may
be
called
the
transition
of
natural
philosophy
into
the
philosophy
of
consciousness
or
the
surrender
of
the
objective
form
of
principle
the
nature
of
this
principle
has
hitherto
been
determined
in
a
manner
which
is
foreign
and
negative
to
consciousness
both
its
reality
water
or
air
and
the
infinite
are
a
beyond
to
consciousness
but
soul
is
the
universal
medium
it
is
a
collection
of
conceptions
which
pass
away
and
come
forth
while
the
unity
and
continuity
never
cease
it
is
active
as
well
as
passive
from
its
unity
severing
asunder
the
conceptions
and
sublating
them
and
it
is
present
to
itself
in
its
infinitude
so
that
negative
signification
and
positive
come
into
unison

more

the

diogenes

are
also
called

but
we
know
nothing
more
of
them
than
their
names
and
that
they
gave
their
adherence
to
one
principle
or
the
other
we
shall
leave
these
now
and
go
on
to
pythagoras
who
was
a
contemporary
of
anaximander
but
the
continuity
of
the
development
of
the
principle
of
physical
philosophy
necessitated
our
taking
anaximenes
with
him
we
see
that
as
aristotle
said
they
placed
the
first
principle
in
a
form
of
matterin
air
and
water
first
and
then
if
we
may
so
define

essence

remarks
called
earth
the
principle
because
it
appears
to
be
the
most
complex
element



for
it
seems
to
be
an
aggregate
of
many
units
water
on
the
contrary
is
the
one
and
it
is
transparent
it
manifests
in
sensuous
guise
the
form
of
unity
with
itself
and
this
is
also
so
with
air
fire
matter
c
the
principle
has
to
be
one
and
hence
must
have
inherent
unity
with
itself
if
it
shows
a
manifold
nature
as
does
the
earth
it
is
not
one
with
itself
but
manifold
this
is
what
we
have
to
say
about
the
early
ionic
philosophy
the
importance
of
these
poor
abstract
thoughts
lies
a
in
the
comprehension
of
a
universal
substance
in
everything
and
b
in
the
fact
that
it
is
formless
and
not
encumbered
by
sensuous
ideas
no
one
recognized
better
the
deficiencies
in
this
philosophy
than
did
aristotle
in
the
work
already
quoted
two
points
appear
in
his
criticism
of
these
three
modes
of
determining
the
absolute
those
who
maintain
the
original
principle
to
be
matter
fall
short
in
many
ways
in
the
first
place
they
merely
give
the
corporeal
element
and
not
the
incorporeal
for
there
also
is
such
in
treating
of
nature
in
order
to
show
its
essence
it
is
necessary
to
deal
with
it
in
its
entirety
and
everything
found
in
it
must
be
considered
that
is
certainly
but
an
empirical
instance
aristotle
maintains
the
incorporeal
to
be
a
form
of
things
opposed
to
the
material
and
indicates
that
the
absolute
must
not
be
determined
in
a
onesided
manner
because
the
principle
of
these
philosophers
is
material
only
they
do
not
manifest
the
incorporeal
side
nor
is
the
object
shown
to
be
notion
matter
is
indeed
itself
immaterial
as
this
reflection
into
consciousness
but
such
philosophers
do
not
know
that
what
they
express
is
an
existence
of
consciousness
thus
the
first
great
defect
here
rests
in
the
fact
that
the
universal
is
expressed
in
a
particular
form
secondly
aristotle
says
metaph
i
3
from
this
it
may
be
seen
that
first
cause
has
only
been
by
all
these
expressed
in
the
form
of
matter
but
because
they
proceeded
thus
the
thing
itself
opened
out
their
way
for
them
and
forced
them
into
further
investigation
for
whether
origin
and
decay
are
derived
from
one
or
more
the
question
alike
arises
how
does
it
happen
and
what
is
the
cause
of
it
for
the
fundamental
substance


does
not
make
itself
to
change
just
as
neither
wood
nor
metal
are
themselves
the
cause
of
change
wood
neither
forms
a
bed
nor
does
brass
a
statue
but
something
else
is
the
cause
of
the
change
to
investigate
this
however
is
to
investigate
the
other
principle
which
as
we
would
say
is
the
principle
of
motion
this
criticism
holds
good
even
now
where
the
absolute
is
represented
as
the
one
fixed
substance
aristotle
says
that
change
is
not
conceivable
out
of
matter
as
such
or
out
of
water
not
itself
having
motion
he
reproaches
the
older
philosophers
for
the
fact
that
they
have
not
investigated
the
principle
of
motion
for
which
men
care
most
further
object
is
altogether
absent
there
is
no
determination
of
activity
hence
aristotle
says
in
the
former
passage
in
that
they
undertake
to
give
the
cause
of
origin
and
decay
they
in
fact
remove
the
cause
of
movement
because
they
make
the
principle
to
be
a
simple
body
earth
being
excepted
they
do
not
comprehend
the
mutual
origination
and
decay
whereby
the
one
arises
out
of
the
other
i
am
here
referring
to
water
air
fire
and
earth
this
origination
is
to
be
shown
as
separation
or
as
union
and
hence
the
contradiction
comes
about
that
one
in
time
comes
earlier
than
the
other
that
is
because
this
kind
of
origination
is
the
method
which
they
have
adopted
the
way
taken
is
from
the
simple
universal
through
the
particular
to
the
individual
as
what
comes
latest
water
air
and
fire
are
however
universal
fire
seems
to
be
most
suitable
for
this
element
seeing
that
it
is
the
most
subtle
thus
those
who
made
it
to
be
the
principle
most
adequately
gave
expression
to
this
method

of
origination
and
others
thought
very
similarly
for
else
why
should
no
one
have
made
the
earth
an
element
in
conformity
with
the
popular
idea
hesiod
says
that
it
was
the
original
bodyso
ancient
and
so
common
was
this
idea
but
what
in
becoming
comes
later
is
the
first
in
nature
however
these
philosophers
did
not
understand
this
so
because
they
were
ruled
by
the
process
of
becoming
only
without
again
sublating
it
or
knowing
that
first
formal
universal
as
such
and
manifesting
the
third
the
totality
or
unity
of
matter
and
form
as
essence
here
we
see
the
absolute
is
not
yet
the
selfdetermining
the
notion
turned
back
into
itself
but
only
a
dead
abstraction
the
moderns
were
the
first
says
aristotle
metaph
i

to
understand
the
fundamental
principle
more
in
the
form
of
genus
we
are
able
to
follow
the
three
moments
in
the
ionic
philosophy

the
original
essence
is
water

anaximanders
infinite
is
descriptive
of
movement
simple
going
out
of
and
coming
back
into
the
simple
universal
aspects
of
formcondensation
and
rarefaction

the
air
is
compared
to
the
soul
it
is
now
requisite
that
what
is
viewed
as
reality
should
be
brought
into
the
notion
in
so
doing
we
see
that
the
moments
of
division
condensation
and
rarefaction
are
not
in
any
way
antagonistic
to
the
notion
this
transition
to
pythagoras
or
the
manifestation
of
the
real
side
as
the
ideal
is
thought
breaking
free
from
what
is
sensuous
and
therefore
it
is
a
separation
between
the
intelligible
and
the
real
b
pythagoras
and
the
pythagoreans
the
later
neopythagoreans
have
written
many
extensive
biographies
of
pythagoras
and
are
especially
diffuse
as
regards
the
pythagorean
brotherhood
but
it
must
be
taken
into
consideration
that
these
often
distorted
statements
must
not
be
regarded
as
historical
the
life
of
pythagoras
thus
first
comes
to
us
in
history
through
the
medium
of
the
ideas
belonging
to
the
first
centuries
after
christ
and
more
or
less
in
the
style
in
which
the
life
of
christ
is
written
on
the
ground
of
ordinary
actuality
and
not
in
a
poetic
atmosphere
it
appears
to
be
the
intermingling
of
many
marvellous
and
extravagant
tales
and
to
take
its
origin
in
part
from
eastern
ideas
and
in
part
from
western
in
acknowledging
the
remarkable
nature
of
his
life
and
genius
and
of
the
life
which
he
inculcated
on
his
followers
it
was
added
that
his
dealings
were
not
with
right
things
and
that
he
was
a
magician
and
one
who
had
intercourse
with
higher
beings
all
the
ideas
of
magic
that
medley
of
unnatural
and
natural
the
mysteries
which
pervade
a
clouded
miserable
imagination
and
the
wild
ideas
of
distorted
brains
have
attached
themselves
to
him
however
corrupt
the
history
of
his
life
his
philosophy
is
as
much
so
everything
engendered
by
christian
melancholy
and
love
of
allegory
has
been
identified
with
it
the
treatment
of
plato
in
christian
times
has
quite
a
different
character
numbers
have
been
much
used
as
the
expression
of
ideas
and
this
on
the
one
hand
has
a
semblance
of
profundity
for
the
fact
that
another
significance
than
that
immediately
presented
is
implied
in
them
is
evident
at
once
but
how
much
there
is
within
them
is
neither
known
by
him
who
speaks
nor
by
him
who
seeks
to
understand
it
is
like
the
witches
rhyme
one
time
one
in
goethes
faust
the
less
clear
the
thoughts
the
deeper
they
appear
what
is
most
essential
but
most
difficult
the
expression
of
oneself
in
definite
conceptions
is
omitted
thus
pythagoras
philosophy
since
much
has
been
added
to
it
by
those
who
wrote
of
it
may
similarly
appear
as
the
mysterious
product
of
minds
as
shallow
and
empty
as
they
are
dark
fortunately
however
we
have
a
special
knowledge
of
the
theoretic
speculative
side
of
it
and
that
indeed
from
aristotle
and
sextus
empiricus
who
have
taken
considerable
trouble
with
it
although
later
pythagoreans
disparage
aristotle
on
account
of
his
exposition
he
has
a
place
above
any
such
disparagement
and
therefore
to
them
no
attention
must
be
given
in
later
times
a
quantity
of
writings
were
disseminated
and
foisted
upon
pythagoras
diogenes
laertius
viii

7
mentions
many
which
were
by
him
and
others
which
were
set
down
to
him
in
order
to
obtain
authority
for
them
but
in
the
first
place
we
have
no
writings
by
pythagoras
and
secondly
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
ever
did
exist
we
have
quotations
from
these
in
unsatisfactory
fragments
not
from
pythagoras
but
from
pythagoreans
it
cannot
be
decisively
determined
which
developments
and
interpretations
belonged
to
the
ancients
and
which
to
the
moderns
yet
with
pythagoras
and
the
ancient
pythagoreans
the
determinations
were
not
worked
out
in
so
concrete
a
way
as
later
as
to
the
life
of
pythagoras
we
hear
from
diogenes
laertius
viii

that
he
flourished
about
the
60th
olympiad
540
bc
his
birth
is
usually
placed
in
the
49th
or
50th
olympiad

earlierin
the

ie
608
bc
he
was
thus
contemporaneous
with
thales
and
anaximander
if
thales
birth
were
in
the
38th
olympiad
and
that
of
pythagoras
in
the
43rd
pythagoras
was
only
twentyone
years
younger
than
he
he
either
only
differed
by
a
couple
of
years
from
anaximander
ol
42
3
in
age
or
the
latter
was
twentysix
years
older
anaximenes
was
from
twenty
to
twentyfive
years
younger
than
pythagoras
his
birthplace
was
the
island
of
samos
and
hence
he
belonged
to
the
greeks
of
asia
minor
which
place
we
have
hitherto
found
to
be
the
seat
of
philosophy
pythagoras
is
said
by
herodotus
iv
93
to
96
to
have
been
the
son
of
mnesarchus
with
whom
zalmoxis
served
as
slave
in
samos
zalmoxis
obtained
freedom
and
riches
became
ruler
of
the
get
and
asserted
that
he
and
his
people
would
not
die
he
built
a
subterranean
habitation
and
there
withdrew
himself
from
his
subjects
after
four
years
he
reappeared31
hence
the
getans
believed
in
immortality
herodotus
thinks
however
that
zalmoxis
was
undoubtedly
much
older
than
pythagoras
his
youth
was
spent
at
the
court
of
polycrates
under
whose
rule
samos
was
brought
not
only
to
wealth
but
also
to
the
possession
of
culture
and
art
in
this
prosperous
period
according
to
herodotus
iii
39
it
possessed
a
fleet
of
a
hundred
ships
his
father
was
an
artist
or
engraver
but
reports
vary
as
to
this
as
also
as
to
his
country
some
saying
that
his
family
was
of
tyrrhenian
origin
and
did
not
go
to
samos
till
after
pythagoras
birth
that
may
be
as
it
will
for
his
youth
was
spent
in
samos
and
he
must
hence
have
been
naturalized
there
and
to
it
he
belongs
he
soon
journeyed
to
the
main
land
of
asia
minor
and
is
said
there
to
have
become
acquainted
with
thales
from
thence
he
travelled
to
phnicia
and
egypt
as
iamblichus
iii
13
14
says
in
his
biography
of
pythagoras
with
both
countries
asia
minor
had
many
links
commercial
and
political
and
it
is
related
that
he
was
recommended
by
polycrates
to
king
amasis
who
according
to
herodotus
ii
154
attracted
many
greeks
to
the
country
and
had
greek
troops
and
colonies
the
narratives
of
further
journeys
into
the
interior
of
asia
to
the
persian
magicians
and
indians
seem
to
be
altogether
fabulous
although
travelling
then
as
now
was
considered
to
be
a
means
of
culture
as
pythagoras
travelled
with
a
scientific
purpose
it
is
said
that
he
had
himself
initiated
into
nearly
all
the
mysteries
of
greeks
and
of
barbarians
and
thus
he
obtained
admission
into
the
order
or
caste
of
the
egyptian
priesthood
these
mysteries
that
we
meet
with
amongst
the
greeks
and
which
are
held
to
be
the
sources
of
much
wisdom
appear
in
their
religion
to
have
stood
in
the
relationship
of
doctrine
to
worship
this
last
existed
in
offerings
and
solemn
festivals
only
but
to
ordinary
conceptions
to
a
consciousness
of
these
conceptions
there
is
no
transition
visible
unless
they
were
preserved
in
poems
as
traditions
the
doctrines
themselves
or
the
act
of
bringing
the
actual
home
to
the
conception
seems
to
have
been
confined
to
the
mysteries
we
find
it
to
be
the
case
however
that
it
is
not
only
the
ideas
as
in
our
teaching
but
also
the
body
that
is
laid
claim
tothat
there
was
brought
home
to
man
by
sending
him
to
wander
amongst
his
fellowmen
both
the
abandonment
of
his
sensuous
consciousness
and
the
purification
and
sanctification
of
the
body
of
philosophic
matter
however
there
is
as
little
openly
declared
as
possible
and
just
as
we
know
the
system
of
freemasonry
there
is
no
secret
in
those
mysteries
his
alliance
with
the
egyptian
priesthood
had
a
most
important
influence
upon
pythagoras
not
through
the
derivation
of
profound
speculative
wisdom
therefrom
but
by
the
idea
obtained
through
it
of
the
realization
of
the
moral
consciousness
of
man
the
individual
he
learned
must
attend
to
himself
if
inwardly
and
to
the
outer
world
he
is
to
be
meritorious
and
to
bring
himself
morally
formed
and
fashioned
into
actuality
this
is
a
conception
which
he
subsequently
carried
out
and
it
is
as
interesting
a
matter
as
his
speculative
philosophy
just
as
the
priests
constituted
a
particular
rank
and
were
educated
for
it
they
also
had
a
special
rule
which
was
binding
throughout
the
whole
moral
life
from
egypt
pythagoras
thus
without
doubt
brought
the
idea
of
his
order
which
was
a
regular
community
brought
together
for
purposes
of
scientific
and
moral
culture
which
endured
during
the
whole
of
life
egypt
at
that
time
was
regarded
as
a
highly
cultured
country
and
it
was
so
when
compared
with
greece
this
is
shown
even
in
the
differences
of
caste
which
assumes
a
division
amongst
the
great
branches
of
life
and
work
such
as
the
industrial
scientific
and
religious
but
beyond
this
we
need
not
seek
great
scientific
knowledge
amongst
the
egyptians
nor
think
that
pythagoras
got
his
science
there
aristotle
metaph
i
only
says
that
in
egypt
mathematical
sciences
first
commenced
for
there
the
nation
of
priests
had
leisure32
pythagoras
stayed
a
long
time
in
egypt
and
returned
from
thence
to
samos
but
he
found
the
internal
affairs
of
his
own
country
in
confusion
and
left
it
soon
after
according
to
herodotus
account
iii
4547
polycrates
hadnot
as
tyrantbanished
many
citizens
from
samos
who
sought
and
found
support
amongst
the
lacedmonians
and
a
civil
war
had
broken
out
the
spartans
had
at
an
earlier
period
given
assistance
to
the
others
for
as
thucydides
says
i
18
to
them
thanks
were
generally
ascribed
for
having
abolished
the
rule
of
the
few
and
caused
a
reversion
to
the
system
of
giving
public
power
to
the
people
later
on
they
did
the
opposite
abolishing
democracy
and
introducing
aristocracy
pythagoras
family
was
necessarily
involved
in
these
unpleasant
relations
and
a
condition
of
internal
strife
was
not
congenial
to
pythagoras
seeing
that
he
no
longer
took
an
interest
in
political
life
and
that
he
saw
in
it
an
unsuitable
soil
for
carrying
out
his
plans
he
traversed
greece
and
betook
himself
from
thence
to
italy
in
the
lower
parts
of
which
greek
colonies
from
various
states
and
for
various
motives
had
settled
and
there
flourished
as
important
trading
towns
rich
in
people
and
possessions
in
crotona
he
settled
down
and
lived
in
independence
neither
as
a
statesman
warrior
nor
political
lawgiver
to
the
people
so
far
as
external
life
was
concerned
but
as
a
public
teacher
with
the
provision
that
his
teaching
should
not
be
taken
up
with
mere
conviction
but
should
also
regulate
the
whole
moral
life
of
the
individual
diogenes
laertius
says
that
he
first
gave
himself
the
name

instead
of

and
men
called
this
modesty
as
if
he
thereby
expressed
not
the
possession
of
wisdom
but
only
the
struggle
towards
it
as
towards
an
end
which
cannot
be
attained33
but

at
the
same
time
means
a
wise
man
who
is
also
practical
and
that
not
in
his
own
interest
only
for
that
requires
no
wisdom
seeing
that
every
sincere
and
moral
man
does
what
is
best
from
his
own
point
of
view
thus

signifies
more
particularly
the
opposite
to
participation
in
practical
matters
that
is
in
public
affairs
philosophy
is
thus
not
the
love
of
wisdom
as
of
something
which
one
sets
oneself
to
acquire
it
is
no
unfulfilled
desire

means
a
man
whose
relation
to
wisdom
is
that
of
making
it
his
object
this
relationship
is
contemplation
and
not
mere
being
but
it
must
be
consciously
that
men
apply
themselves
to
this
the
man
who
likes
wine

is
certainly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
man
who
is
full
of
wine
or
a
drunkard
then
does

signify
only
a
futile
aspiration
for
wine
what
pythagoras
contrived
and
effected
in
italy
is
told
us
by
later
eulogists
rather
than
by
historians
in
the
history
of
pythagoras
by
malchus
this
was
the
syrian
name
of
porphyry
many
strange
things
are
related
and
with
the
neoplatonists
the
contrast
between
their
deep
insight
and
their
belief
in
the
miraculous
is
surprising
for
instance
seeing
that
the
later
biographers
of
pythagoras
had
already
related
a
quantity
of
marvels
they
now
proceeded
to
add
yet
more
to
these
with
reference
to
his
appearance
in
italy
it
appears
that
they
were
exerting
themselves
to
place
him
as
they
afterwards
did
with
apollonius
of
tyana
in
opposition
to
christ
for
the
wonders
which
they
tell
of
him
seem
partly
to
be
an
amplification
of
those
in
the
new
testament
and
in
part
they
are
altogether
absurd
for
instance
they
make
pythagoras
begin
his
career
in
italy
with
a
miracle
when
he
landed
in
the
bay
of
tarentum
at
crotona
he
encountered
fishermen
on
the
way
to
the
town
who
had
caught
nothing
he
called
upon
them
to
draw
their
nets
once
more
and
foretold
the
number
of
fishes
that
would
be
found
in
them
the
fishermen
marvelling
at
this
prophecy
promised
him
that
if
it
came
true
they
would
do
whatever
he
desired
it
came
to
pass
as
he
said
and
pythagoras
then
desired
them
to
throw
the
fishes
alive
back
into
the
sea
for
the
pythagoreans
ate
no
flesh
and
it
is
further
related
as
a
miracle
which
then
took
place
that
none
of
the
fishes
whilst
they
were
out
of
the
water
died
during
the
counting
this
is
the
kind
of
miracle
that
is
recorded
and
the
stories
with
which
his
biographers
fill
his
life
are
of
the
same
silly
nature
they
then
make
him
effect
such
a
general
impression
upon
the
mind
of
italy
that
all
the
towns
reformed
upon
their
luxurious
and
depraved
customs
and
the
tyrants
partly
gave
up
their
powers
voluntarily
and
partly
they
were
driven
out
they
thereby
however
commit
such
historical
errors
as
to
make
charondas
and
zaleucus
who
lived
long
before
pythagoras
his
disciples
and
similarly
to
ascribe
the
expulsion
and
death
of
the
tyrant
phalaris
to
him
and
to
his
action34
apart
from
these
fables
there
remains
as
an
historic
fact
the
great
work
which
he
accomplished
and
this
he
did
chiefly
by
establishing
a
school
and
by
the
great
influence
of
his
order
upon
the
principal
part
of
the
grecoitalian
states
or
rather
by
means
of
the
rule
which
was
exercised
in
these
states
through
this
order
which
lasted
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
it
is
related
of
him
that
he
was
a
very
handsome
man
and
of
a
majestic
appearance
which
captivated
as
much
as
it
commanded
respect
with
this
natural
dignity
nobility
of
manners
and
the
calm
propriety
of
his
demeanour
he
united
external
peculiarities
through
which
he
seemed
a
remarkable
and
mysterious
being
he
wore
a
white
linen
garment
and
refrained
from
partaking
of
certain
foods35
particular
personality
as
also
the
externalities
of
dress
and
the
like
are
no
longer
of
importance
men
let
themselves
be
guided
by
general
custom
and
fashion
since
it
is
a
matter
outside
of
and
indifferent
to
them
not
to
have
their
own
will
here
for
we
hand
over
the
contingent
to
the
contingent
and
only
follow
the
external
rationality
that
consists
in
identity
and
universality
to
this
outward
personality
there
was
added
great
eloquence
and
profound
perception
not
only
did
he
undertake
to
impart
this
to
his
individual
friends
but
he
proceeded
to
bring
a
general
influence
to
bear
on
public
culture
both
in
regard
to
understanding
and
to
the
whole
manner
of
life
and
morals
he
not
merely
instructed
his
friends
but
associated
them
in
a
particular
life
in
order
to
constitute
them
into
persons
and
make
them
skilful
in
business
and
eminent
in
morals
the
institute
of
pythagoras
grew
into
a
league
which
included
all
men
and
all
life
in
its
embrace
for
it
was
an
elaborately
fashioned
piece
of
work
and
excellently
plastic
in
design
of
the
regulations
of
pythagoras
league
we
have
descriptions
from
his
successors
more
especially
from
the
neoplatonists
who
are
particularly
diffuse
as
regards
its
laws
the
league
had
on
the
whole
the
character
of
a
voluntary
priesthood
or
a
monastic
order
of
modern
times
whoever
wished
to
be
received
was
proved
in
respect
of
his
education
and
obedience
and
information
was
collected
about
his
conduct
inclinations
and
occupations
the
members
were
subject
to
a
special
training
in
which
a
difference
was
made
amongst
those
received
in
that
some
were
exoteric
and
some
esoteric
these
last
were
initiated
into
the
highest
branches
of
science
and
since
political
operations
were
not
excluded
from
the
order
they
were
also
engaged
in
active
politics
the
former
had
to
go
through
a
novitiate
of
five
years
each
member
must
have
surrendered
his
means
to
the
order
but
he
received
them
again
on
retiring
and
in
the
probationary
period
silence
was
enjoined
36
this
obligation
to
cease
from
idle
talk
may
be
called
an
essential
condition
for
all
culture
and
learning
with
it
men
must
begin
if
they
wish
to
comprehend
the
thoughts
of
others
and
relinquish
their
own
ideas
we
are
in
the
habit
of
saying
that
the
understanding
is
cultivated
through
questioning
objecting
and
replying
c
but
in
fact
it
is
not
thus
formed
but
made
from
without
what
is
inward
in
man
is
by
culture
got
at
and
developed
hence
though
he
remains
silent
he
is
none
the
poorer
in
thought
or
denser
of
mind
he
rather
acquires
thereby
the
power
of
apprehension
and
comes
to
know
that
his
ideas
and
objections
are
valueless
and
as
he
learns
that
such
ideas
are
valueless
he
ceases
to
have
them
now
the
fact
that
in
pythagoras
there
is
a
separation
between
those
in
the
course
of
preparation
and
those
initiated
as
also
that
silence
is
particularly
enjoined
seems
most
certainly
to
indicate
that
in
his
brotherhood
both
were
formal
elements
and
not
merely
as
present
in
the
nature
of
things
as
might
occur
spontaneously
in
the
individual
without
any
special
law
or
the
application
of
any
particular
consideration
but
here
it
is
important
to
remark
that
pythagoras
may
be
regarded
as
the
first
instructor
in
greece
who
introduced
the
teachings
of
science
neither
thales
who
was
earlier
than
he
nor
his
contemporary
anaximander
taught
scientifically
but
only
imparted
their
ideas
to
their
friends
there
were
generally
speaking
no
sciences
at
that
time
there
was
neither
a
science
of
philosophy
mathematics
jurisprudence
or
anything
else
but
merely
isolated
propositions
and
facts
respecting
these
subjects
what
was
taught
was
the
use
of
arms
theorems
music
the
singing
of
homers
or
hesiods
songs
tripod
chants
c
or
other
arts
this
teaching
is
accomplished
in
quite
another
way
now
if
we
said
that
pythagoras
had
introduced
the
teaching
of
science
amongst
a
people
who
though
like
the
greeks
untaught
therein
were
not
stupid
but
most
lively
cultured
and
loquacious
the
external
conditions
of
such
teaching
might
in
so
far
be
given
as
follows
he
would
distinguish
amongst
those
who
as
yet
had
no
idea
of
the
process
of
learning
a
science
so
that
those
who
first
began
should
be
excluded
from
that
which
was
to
be
imparted
to
those
further
on
and

he
would
make
them
leave
the
unscientific
mode
of
speaking
of
such
matters
or
their
idle
prattle
alone
and
for
the
first
time
study
science
but
the
fact
that
this
action
both
appeared
to
be
formal
and
likewise
required
to
be
made
such
was
on
account
of
its
unwonted
character
a
necessary
one
just
because
the
followers
of
pythagoras
were
not
only
numerous
necessitating
a
definite
form
and
order
but
also
generally
speaking
they
lived
continually
together
thus
a
particular
form
was
natural
to
pythagoras
because
it
was
the
very
first
time
that
a
teacher
in
greece
arrived
at
a
totality
or
a
new
principle
through
the
cultivation
of
the
intelligence
mind
and
will
this
common
life
had
not
only
the
educational
side
and
that
founded
on
the
exercise
of
physical
ingenuity
or
skill
but
included
also
that
of
the
moral
culture
of
practical
men
but
even
now
everything
relating
to
morality
appears
and
is
or
becomes
altogether
formal
or
rather
this
is
so
in
as
far
as
it
is
consciously
thought
of
as
in
this
relation
for
to
be
formal
is
to
be
universal
that
which
is
opposed
to
the
individual
it
appears
so
particularly
to
him
who
compares
the
universal
and
the
individual
and
consciously
reflects
over
both
but
this
difference
disappears
for
those
living
therein
to
whom
it
is
ordinary
habit
finally
we
have
sufficient
and
full
accounts
of
the
outward
forms
observed
by
the
pythagoreans
in
their
common
life
and
also
of
their
discipline
for
much
of
this
however
we
are
indebted
to
the
impressions
of
later
writers
in
the
league
a
life
regulated
in
all
respects
was
advocated
first
of
all
it
is
told
us
that
the
members
made
themselves
known
by
a
similar
dressthe
white
linen
of
pythagoras
they
had
a
very
strict
order
for
each
day
of
which
each
hour
had
its
work
the
morning
directly
after
rising
was
set
aside
for
recalling
to
memory
the
history
of
the
previous
day
because
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
day
depends
chiefly
on
the
previous
day
similarly
the
most
constant
selfexamination
was
made
the
duty
of
the
evening
in
order
to
find
whether
the
deeds
done
in
the
day
were
right
or
wrong
true
culture
is
not
the
vanity
of
directing
so
much
attention
to
oneself
and
occupying
oneself
with
oneself
as
an
individual
but
the
selfoblivion
that
absorbs
oneself
in
the
matter
in
hand
and
in
the
universal
it
is
this
consideration
of
the
thing
in
hand
that
is
alone
essential
while
that
dangerous
useless
anxious
state
does
away
with
freedom
they
had
also
to
learn
by
heart
from
homer
and
from
hesiod
and
all
through
the
day
they
occupied
themselves
much
with
musicone
of
the
principal
parts
of
greek
education
and
culture37
gymnastic
exercises
in
wrestling
racing
throwing
and
so
on
were
with
them
also
enforced
by
rule
they
dined
together
and
here
too
they
had
peculiar
customs
but
of
these
the
accounts
are
different
honey
and
bread
were
made
their
principal
food
and
water
the
principal
and
indeed
only
drink
they
must
thus
have
entirely
refrained
from
eating
meat
as
being
associated
with
metempsychosis
a
distinction
was
also
made
regarding
vegetablesbeans
for
example
being
forbidden
on
account
of
this
respect
for
beans
they
were
much
derided
yet
in
the
subsequent
destruction
of
the
political
league
several
pythagoreans
being
pursued
preferred
to
die
than
to
damage
a
field
of
beans38
the
order
the
moral
discipline
which
characterized
them
the
common
intercourse
of
men
did
not
however
endure
long
for
even
in
pythagoras
lifetime
the
affairs
of
his
league
must
have
become
involved
since
he
found
enemies
who
forcibly
overthrew
him
he
drew
down
upon
him
it
is
said
the
envy
of
others
and
was

to

and
thus
of
having
an

pense
the
real
fact
of
the
case
was
that
the
individual
belonged
not
entirely
to
his
town
but
also
to
another
in
this
catastrophe
pythagoras
himself
according
to
tennemann
vol
i
p
414
met
his
death
in
the
69th
olympiad
504
bc
in
a
rising
of
the
people
against
these
aristocrats
but
it
is
uncertain
whether
it
happened
in
crotona
or
in
metapontum
or
in
a
war
between
the
syracusans
and
the
agrigentines
there
is
also
much
difference
of
opinion
about
the
age
of
pythagoras
for
it
is
given
sometimes
as
80
and
sometimes
as
10439
for
the
rest
the
unity
of
the
pythagorean
school
the
friendship
of
the
members
and
the
connecting
bond
of
culture
have
even
in
later
times
remained
but
not
in
the
formal
character
of
a
league
because
what
is
external
must
pass
away
the
history
of
magna
grcia
is
in
general
little
known
but
even
in
platos40
time
we
find
pythagoreans
appearing
at
the
head
of
states
or
as
a
political
power
the
pythagorean
brotherhood
had
no
relation
with
greek
public
and
religious
life
and
therefore
could
not
endure
for
long
in
egypt
and
in
asia
exclusiveness
and
priestly
influence
have
their
home
but
greece
in
its
freedom
could
not
let
the
eastern
separation
of
caste
exist
freedom
here
is
the
principle
of
civic
life
but
still
it
is
not
yet
determined
as
principle
in
the
relations
of
public
and
private
law
with
us
the
individual
is
free
since
all
are
alike
before
the
law
diversity
in
customs
in
political
relations
and
opinions
may
thus
exist
and
must
indeed
so
do
in
organic
states
in
democratic
greece
on
the
contrary
manners
the
external
mode
of
life
necessarily
preserved
a
certain
similarity
and
the
stamp
of
similarity
remained
impressed
on
these
wider
spheres
for
the
exceptional
condition
of
the
pythagoreans
who
could
not
take
their
part
as
free
citizens
but
were
dependent
on
the
plans
and
ends
of
a
combination
and
led
an
exclusive
religious
life
there
was
no
place
in
greece
the
preservation
of
the
mysteries
certainly
belonged
to
the
eumolpid
and
other
special
forms
of
worship
to
other
particular
families
but
they
were
not
regarded
in
a
political
sense
as
of
fixed
and
definite
castes
but
as
priests
usually
are
politicians
citizens
men
like
their
fellows
nor
as
with
the
christians
was
the
separation
of
religious
persons
driven
to
the
extreme
of
monastic
rule
in
ordinary
civic
life
in
greece
no
one
could
prosper
or
maintain
his
position
who
held
peculiar
principles
or
even
secrets
and
differed
in
outward
modes
of
life
and
clothing
for
what
evidently
united
and
distinguished
them
was
their
community
of
principles
and
lifewhether
anything
was
good
for
the
commonwealth
or
not
was
by
them
publicly
and
openly
discussed
the
greeks
are
above
having
particular
clothing
maintaining
special
customs
of
washing
rising
practising
music
and
distinguishing
between
pure
and
impure
foods
this
they
say
is
partly
the
affair
of
the
particular
individual
and
of
his
personal
freedom
and
has
no
common
end
in
view
and
partly
it
is
a
general
custom
and
usage
for
everybody
alike
what
is
most
important
to
us
is
the
pythagorean
philosophynot
the
philosophy
of
pythagoras
so
much
as
that
of
the
pythagoreans
as
aristotle
and
sextus
express
it
the
two
must
certainly
be
distinguished
and
from
comparing
what
is
given
out
as
pythagorean
doctrine
many
anomalies
and
discrepancies
become
evident
as
we
shall
see
plato
bears
the
blame
of
having
destroyed
pythagorean
philosophy
through
absorbing
what
is
pythagorean
in
it
into
his
own
but
the
pythagorean
philosophy
itself
developed
to
a
point
which
left
it
quite
other
than
what
at
first
it
was
we
hear
of
many
followers
of
pythagoras
in
history
who
have
arrived
at
this
or
that
conclusion
such
as
alcmon
and
philolaus
and
we
see
in
many
cases
the
simple
undeveloped
form
contrasted
with
the
further
stages
of
development
in
which
thought
comes
forth
in
definiteness
and
power
we
need
however
go
no
further
into
the
historical
side
of
the
distinction
for
we
can
only
consider
the
pythagorean
philosophy
generally
similarly
we
must
separate
what
is
known
to
belong
to
the
neoplatonists
and
neopythagoreans
and
for
this
end
we
have
sources
to
draw
from
which
are
earlier
than
this
period
namely
the
express
statements
found
in
aristotle
and
sextus
the
pythagorean
philosophy
forms
the
transition
from
realistic
to
intellectual
philosophy
the
ionic
school
said
that
essence
or
principle
is
a
definite
material
the
next
conclusion
is

that
the
absolute
is
not
grasped
in
natural
form
but
as
a
thought
determination

then
it
follows
that
determinations
must
be
posited
while
the
beginning
was
altogether
undetermined
the
pythagorean
philosophy
has
done
both
1
the
system
of
numbers
thus
the
original
and
simple
proposition
of
the
pythagorean
philosophy
is
according
to
aristotle
metaph
i
5
that
number
is
the
reality
of
things
and
the
constitution
of
the
whole
universe
in
its
determinations
is
an
harmonious
system
of
numbers
and
of
their
relations
in
what
sense
is
this
statement
to
be
taken
the
fundamental
determination
of
number
is
its
being
a
measure
if
we
say
that
everything
is
quantitatively
or
qualitatively
determined
the
size
and
measure
is
only
one
aspect
or
characteristic
which
is
present
in
everything
but
the
meaning
here
is
that
number
itself
is
the
essence
and
the
substance
of
things
and
not
alone
their
form
what
first
strikes
us
as
surprising
is
the
boldness
of
such
language
which
at
once
sets
aside
everything
which
to
the
ordinary
idea
is
real
and
true
doing
away
with
sensuous
existence
and
making
it
to
be
the
creation
of
thought
existence
is
expressed
as
something
which
is
not
sensuous
and
thus
what
to
the
senses
and
to
old
ideas
is
altogether
foreign
is
raised
into
and
expressed
as
substance
and
as
true
being
but
at
the
same
time
the
necessity
is
shown
for
making
number
to
be
likewise
notion
to
manifest
it
as
the
activity
of
its
unity
with
being
for
to
us
number
does
not
seem
to
be
in
immediate
unity
with
the
notion
now
although
this
principle
appears
to
us
to
be
fanciful
and
wild
we
find
in
it
that
number
is
not
merely
something
sensuous
therefore
it
brings
determination
with
it
universal
distinctions
and
antitheses
the
ancients
had
a
very
good
knowledge
of
these
aristotle
metaph
i
6
says
of
plato
he
maintained
that
the
mathematical
elements
in
things
are
found
outside
of
what
is
merely
sensuous
and
of
ideas
being
between
both
it
differs
from
what
is
sensuous
in
that
it
is
eternal
and
unchangeable
and
from
ideas
in
that
it
possesses
multiplicity
and
hence
each
can
resemble
and
be
similar
to
another
while
each
idea
is
for
itself
one
alone
that
is
number
can
be
repeated
thus
it
is
not
sensuous
and
still
not
yet
thought
in
the
life
of
pythagoras
this
is
further
said
by
malchus
46
47
pythagoras
propounded
philosophy
in
this
wise
in
order
to
loose
thought
from
its
fetters
without
thought
nothing
true
can
be
discerned
or
known
thought
hears
and
sees
everything
in
itself
the
rest
is
lame
and
blind
to
obtain
his
end
pythagoras
makes
use
of
mathematics
since
this
stands
midway
between
what
is
sensuous
and
thought
as
a
kind
of
preliminary
to
what
is
in
and
for
itself
malchus
quotes
further
48
53
a
passage
from
an
early
writer
moderatus
because
the
pythagoreans
could
not
clearly
express
the
absolute
and
the
first
principles
through
thought
they
made
use
of
numbers
of
mathematics
because
in
this
form
determinations
could
be
easily
expressed
for
instance
similarity
could
be
expressed
as
one
dissimilarity
as
two
this
mode
of
teaching
through
the
use
of
numbers
whilst
it
was
the
first
philosophy
is
superseded
on
account
of
its
mysterious
nature
plato
speusippus
aristotle
c
have
stolen
the
fruits
of
their
work
from
the
pythagoreans
by
making
a
simple
use
of
their
principle
in
this
passage
a
perfect
knowledge
of
numbers
is
evident
the
enigmatic
character
of
the
determination
through
number
is
what
most
engages
our
attention
the
numbers
of
arithmetic
answers
to
thoughtdeterminations
for
number
has
the
one
as
element
and
principle
the
one
however
is
a
category
of
beingforself
and
thus
of
identity
with
self
in
that
it
excludes
all
else
and
is
indifferent
to
what
is
other
the
further
determinations
of
number
are
only
further
combinations
and
repetitions
of
the
one
which
all
through
remains
fixed
and
external
number
thus
is
the
most
utterly
dead
notionless
continuity
possible
it
is
an
entirely
external
and
mechanical
process
which
is
without
necessity
hence
number
is
not
immediate
notion
but
only
a
beginning
of
thought
and
a
beginning
in
the
worst
possible
way
it
is
the
notion
in
its
extremest
externality
in
quantitative
form
and
in
that
of
indifferent
distinction
in
so
far
the
one
has
within
itself
both
the
principle
of
thought
and
that
of
materiality
or
the
determination
of
the
sensuous
in
order
that
anything
should
have
the
form
of
notion
it
must
immediately
in
itself
as
determined
relate
itself
to
its
opposite
just
as
positive
is
related
to
negative
and
in
this
simple
movement
of
the
notion
we
find
the
ideality
of
differences
and
negation
of
independence
to
be
the
chief
determination
on
the
other
hand
in
the
number
three
for
instance
there
are
always
three
units
of
which
each
is
independent
and
this
is
what
constitutes
both
their
defect
and
their
enigmatic
character
for
since
the
essence
of
the
notion
is
innate
numbers
are
the
most
worthless
instruments
for
expressing
notiondeterminations
now
the
pythagoreans
did
not
accept
numbers
in
this
indifferent
way
but
as
notion
at
least
they
say
that
phenomena
must
be
composed
of
simple
elements
and
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
nature
of
things
if
the
principle
of
the
universe
pertained
to
sensuous
phenomena
the
elements
and
principles
are
thus
not
only
intangible
and
invisible
but
altogether
incorporeal41
but
how
they
have
come
to
make
numbers
the
original
principle
or
the
absolute
notion
is
better
shown
from
what
aristotle
says
in
his
metaphysics
i
5
although
he
is
shorter
than
he
would
have
been
because
he
alleges
that
elsewhere
infra
p
214
he
has
spoken
of
it
in
numbers
they
thought
that
they
perceived
much
greater
similitude
to
what
is
and
what
takes
place
than
in
fire
water
or
earth
since
a
certain
property
of
numbers


is
justice
so
is
it
with

the
soul
and
understanding
another
property
is
opportunity
and
so
on
since
they
further
saw
the
conditions
and
relations
of
what
is
harmonious
present
in
numbers
and
since
numbers
are
at
the
basis
of
all
natural
things
they
considered
numbers
to
be
the
elements
of
everything
and
the
whole
heavens
to
be
a
harmony
and
number
in
the
pythagoreans
we
see
the
necessity
for
one
enduring
universal
idea
as
a
thoughtdetermination
aristotle

speaking
of
ideas
says
according
to
heraclitus
everything
sensuous
flows
on
and
thus
there
cannot
be
a
science
of
the
sensuous
from
this
conviction
the
doctrine
of
ideas
sprang
socrates
is
the
first
to
define
the
universal
through
inductive
methods
the
pythagoreans
formerly
concerned
themselves
merely
with
a
few
matters
of
which
they
derived
the
notions
from
numbersas
for
example
with
what
opportuneness
or
right
or
marriage
are
it
is
impossible
to
discern
what
interest
this
in
itself
can
have
the
only
thing
which
is
necessary
for
us
as
regards
the
pythagoreans
is
to
recognize
any
indications
of
the
idea
in
which
there
may
be
a
progressive
principle
this
is
the
whole
of
the
pythagorean
philosophy
taken
generally
we
now
have
to
come
to
closer
quarters
and
to
consider
the
determinations
or
universal
significance
in
the
pythagorean
system
numbers
seem
partly
to
be
themselves
allied
to
categoriesthat
is
to
be
at
once
the
thoughtdeterminations
of
unity
of
opposition
and
of
the
unity
of
these
two
moments
in
part
the
pythagoreans
from
the
very
first
gave

they

c
with
him
they
are
for
the
most

the
pythagoreans
did
not
remain
content
with
this
for
they
gave
them
the
more
concrete
determinations

of

are
wanting
universal
determinations
are
only
found
and
established
in
a
quite
dogmatic
form
and
hence
the
determinations
are
dry
destitute
of
process
or
dialectic
and
stationary
a
the
pythagoreans
say
that
the
first
simple
notion
is
unity

not
the
discrete
multifarious
arithmetic
one
but
identity
as

all
numbers
come
under
the
notion
of
the
one
for
duality
is
one
duality
and
triplicity
is
equally
a
one
but
the
number
ten
is
the
one
chief
number
this
moved
pythagoras
to
assert
unity
to
be
the
principle
of
things
because
through
partaking
of
it
each
is
called
one
that
is
to
say
the
pure
contemplation
of
the
implicit
being
of
a
thing
is
the
one
the
being
like
self
to
all
else
it
is
not
implicit
but
a
relationship
to
what
is
other
things
however
are
much
more
determined
than
being
merely
this
dry
one
the
pythagoreans
have
expressed
this
remarkable
relationship
of
the
entirely
abstract
one
to
the
concrete
existence
of
things
through
simulation

the
same
difficulty
which
they
here
encounter
is
also
found
in
platos
ideas
since
they
stand
over
against
the
concrete
as
species
the
relation
of
concrete
to
universal
is
naturally
an
important
point
aristotle
metaph
i

ascribes
the
expression
participation

to
plato
who
took
it
in
place
of
the
pythagorean
expression
simulation
simulation
is
a
figurative
childish
way
of
putting
the
relationship
participation
is
undoubtedly
more
definite
but
aristotle
says
with
justice
that
both
are
insufficient
that
plato
has
not
here
arrived
at
any
further
development
but
has
only
substituted
another
name
to
say
that
ideas
are
prototypes
and
that
other
things
participate
in
them
is
empty
talk
and
a
poetic
metaphor
for
what
is
the
active
principle
that
looks
upon
the
ideas

simulation
and
participation
are
nothing
more
than
other
names
for
relation
to
give
names
is
easy
but
it
is
another
thing
to
comprehend
b
what
comes
next
is
the
opposition
the
duality

the
distinction
the
particular
such
determinations
have
value
even
now
in
philosophy
pythagoras
merely
brought
them
first
to
consciousness
now
as
this
unity
relates
to
multiplicity
or
this
beinglikeself
to
being
another
different
applications
are
possible
and
the
pythagoreans
have
expressed
themselves
variously
as
to
the
forms
which
this
first
opposition
takes

they
said
according
to
aristotle
metaph
i
5
the
elements
of
number
are
the
even
and
the
odd
the
latter
is
the
finite
or
principle
of
limitation
and
the
former
is
the
infinite
thus
the
unity
proceeds
from
both
and
out
of
this
again
comes

the
elements
of
immediate
number
are

numbers
the
opposition
of
these
elements
first
appears
in
arithmetical
form
rather
than
as
thought
but
the
one
is
as
yet
no
number
because
as

it
is
not
quantity

says
aristotle
gives
in
his
writings
on
the
pythagoreans
the
reason
why
in
their
view
the
one
partakes
of
the
nature
of
even
and
odd
that
is
one
posited
as
even
makes
odd
as
odd
it
makes
even
this
is
what
it
could
not
do
unless
it
partook
of
both
natures
for
which
reason
they
also
called

if
we
follow
the
absolute
idea
in
this
first

opposition
will
also

as
something
different


undetermined

results
because
no
one
of
the
determined
or
otherwise
limited
numbers
is
this
duality
but
all
are
known
through
their
participation
in
it
as
has
been
said
of
unity
there
are
according
to
this
two
principles
in
things
the
first
unity
through

in
which
all

also

as

moment
in
the
notion

unity

them
with
one
another
we
may
either
consider
the
unity
to
be
form

the
other
way

if
on
the
other
hand
we
take
form
as
the
simple
activity
of
absolute
form
the
one
is
what
determines
and
duality
as
the
potentiality
of

as

aristotle
met
i
6
says
that
it
is
characteristic
of
plato
that
he
makes
out
of
matter
many
but
with
him
the
form
originates
only
once
whereas
out
of
one
matter
only
one
table
proceeds
whoever
brings
form
to
matter
in
spite
of
its
unity
makes
many
tables
he
also
ascribes
this
to
plato
that
instead
of
showing
the
undetermined
to
be
simple





he
made
of
it
a
dualitythe
great
and
small

further
consideration
of
this
opposition
in
which
pythagoreans
differ
from
one
another
shows
us
the
imperfect
beginning
of
a
table
of
categories
which
were
then
brought
forward
by
them
as
later
on
by
aristotle
hence
the
latter
was
reproached
for
having
borrowed
these
thoughtdeterminations
from
them
and
it
certainly
was
the
case
that
the
pythagoreans
first
made
the
opposite
to
be
an
essential
moment
in
the
absolute
they
further
determined
the
abstract
and
simple
notions
although
it
was
in
an
inadequate
way
since
their
table
presents
a
mixture
of
antitheses
in
the
ordinary
idea
and
the
notion
without
following
these
up
more
fully
aristotle
met
i
5
ascribes
these
determinations
either
to
pythagoras
himself
or
else
to
alcmon
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
pythagoras
old
age
so
that
either
alcmon
took
them
from
the
pythagoreans
or
the
latter
took
them
from
him
of
these
antitheses
or
coordinates
to
which
all
things
are
traced
ten

given
for
according
to
the
pythagoreans

a
number
of
great
significance

the
square
and
the

this
is
certainly
an
attempt
towards
a
development
of
the
idea
of
speculative
philosophy
in
itself
ie
in
notions
but
the
attempt
does
not
seem
to
have
gone
further
than
this
simple
enumeration
it
is
very
important
that
at
first
only
a
collection
of
general
thoughtdeterminations
should
be
made
as
was
done
by
aristotle
but
what
we
here
see
with
the
pythagoreans
is
only
a
rude
beginning
of
the
further
determination
of
antitheses
without
order
and
sense
and
very
similar
to
the
indian
enumeration
of
principles
and
substances

we
find
the
further
progress
of
these
determinations
in
sextus
adv
math
x
262277
when
he
speaks
about
an
exposition
of
the
later
pythagoreans
it
is
a
very
good
and
well
considered
account
of
the
pythagorean
theories
which
has
some
thought
in
it
the
exposition
follows
these
lines
the
fact
that
these
two
principles
are
the
principles
of
the
whole
is
shown
by
the
pythagoreans
in
manifold
ways

there
are
three
methods
of
thinking
things
firstly
in
accordance
with
diversity
secondly
with
opposition
and
thirdly
according
to
relation

what
is
considered
in
its
mere
diversity
is
considered
for
itself
this
is
the
case
with
those
subjects
in
which
each
relates
only
to
itself
such
as
horse
plant
earth
air
water
and
fire
such
matters
are
thought
of
as
detached
and
not
in
relation
to
others
this
is
the
determination
of
identity
with
self
or
of
independence

in
reference
to
opposition
the
one
is
determined
as
evidently
contrasting
with
the
other
we
have
examples
of
this
in
good
and
evil
right
and
wrong
sacred
and
profane
rest
and
movement
c

according
to
relation


we
have
the
object
which
is
determined
in
accordance
with
its
relationship
to
others
such
as
right
and
left
over
and
under
double
and
half
one
is
only
comprehensible
from
the
other
for
i
cannot
tell
which
is
my
left
excepting
by
my
right
each
of
these
relations
in
its
opposition
is
likewise
set
up
for
itself
in
a
position
of
independence
the
difference
between
relationship
and
opposition
is
that
in
opposition
the
coming
into
existence
of
the
one
is
at
the
expense
of
the
other
and
conversely
if
motion
is
taken
away
rest
commences
if
motion
begins
rest
ceases
if
health
is
taken
away
sickness
begins
and
conversely
in
a
condition
of
relationship
on
the
contrary
both
take
their
rise
and
both
similarly
cease
together
if
the
right
is
removed
so
also
is
the
left
the
double
goes
and
the
half
is
destroyed
what
is
here
taken
away
is
taken
not
only
as
regards
its
opposition
but
also
in
its
existence
a
second
difference
is
that
what
is
in
opposition
has
no
middle
for
example
between
sickness
and
health
life
and
death
rest
and
motion
there
is
no
third
relativity
on
the
contrary
has
a
middle
for
between
larger
and
smaller
there
is
the
like
and
between
too
large
and
too
small
the
right
size
is
the
medium
pure
opposition
passes
through
nullity
to
opposition
immediate
extremes
on
the
other
hand
subsist
in
a
third
or
middle
state
but
in
such
a
case
no
longer
as
opposed
this
exposition
shows
a
certain
regard
for
universal
logical
determinations
which
now
and
always
have
the
greatest
possible
importance
and
are
moments
in
all
conceptions
and
in
everything
that
is
the
nature
of
these
opposites
is
indeed
not
considered
here
but
it
is
of
importance
that
they
should
be
brought
to
consciousness

now
since
these
three
represent
three
different
genera
the
subjects
and
the
twofold
opposite
there
must
be
a
higher
genus
over
each
of
them
which
takes
the
first
place
since
the
genus
comes
before
its
subordinate
kinds
if
the
universal
is
taken
away
so
is
the
kind
on
the
other
hand
if
the
kind
not
the
genus
for
the
former
depends
on
the
latter
but
not
the
contrary
way

the
pythagoreans
have
declared
the
one
to
be
the
highest
genus
of
what
is
considered
as
in
and
for
itself
of
subjects
in
their
diversity
this
is
properly
speaking
nothing
more
than
translating
the
determinations
of
the
notion
into
numbers

what
is
in
opposition
has
they
say
as
its
genus
the
like
and
the
unlike
rest
is
the
like
for
it
is
capable
of
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
but
movement
is
the
unlike
thus
what
is
according
to
nature
is
like
itself
it
is
a
point
which
is
not
capable
of
being
intensified

what
is
opposed
to
it
is
unlike
health
is
like
sickness
is
unlike

the
genus
of
that
which
is
in
an
indifferent
relationship
is
excess
and
want
the
more
and
the
less
in
this
we
have
the
quantitative
relation
just
as
we
formerly
had
the
qualitative

we
now
come
for
the
first
time
to
the
two
opposites
these
three
genera
of
what
is
for
itself
in
opposition
and
in
relationship
must
now
come
underyet
simpler
highergenera
ie
thoughtdeterminations
similarity
reduces
itself
to
the
determination
of
unity
the
genus
of
the
subjects
is
the
very
being
on
its
own
account
dissimilarity
however
consists
of
excess
and
want
but
both
of
these
come
under
undetermined
duality
they
are
the
undetermined
opposition
opposition
generally
thus
from
all
these
relationships
the
first
unity
and
the
undetermined
duality
proceed
the
pythagoreans
said
that
such
are
found
to
be
the
universal
modes
of
things
from
these
there
first
comes
the
one
of
numbers
and
the
two
of
numbers
from
the
first
unity
the
one
from
the
unity
and
the
undetermined
duality
the
two
for
twice
the
one
is
two
the
other
numbers
take
their
origin
in
a
similar
way
for
the
unity
over
moves
forward
and
the
undetermined
duality
generates
the
two
this
transition
of
qualitative
into
quantitative
opposition
is
not
clear
hence
underlying
these
principles
unity
is
the
active
principle
or
form
but
the
two
is
the
passive
matter
and
just
as
they
make
numbers
arise
from
them
so
do
they
make
the
system
of
the
world
and
that
which
is
contained
in
it
the
nature
of
these
determinations
is
to
be
found
in
transition
and
in
movement
the
deeper
significance
of
this
reflection
rests
in
the
connection
of
universal
thoughtdeterminations
with
arithmetic
numbersin
subordinating
these
and
making
the
universal
genus
first
before
i
say
anything
of
the
further
sequence
of
these
numbers
it
must
be
remarked
that
they
as
we
see
them
represented
here
are
pure
notions

the
absolute
simple
essence
divides
itself
into
unity
and
multiplicity
of
which
the
one
sublates
the
other
and
at
the
same
time
it
has
its
existence
in
the
opposition

the
opposition
has
at
the
same
time
subsistence
and
in
this
is
found
the
manifold
nature
of
equivalent
things

the
return
of
absolute
essence
into
itself
is
the
negative
unity
of
the
individual
subject
and
of
the
universal
or
positive
this
is
in
fact
the
pure
speculative
idea
of
absolute
existence
it
is
this
movement
with
plato
the
idea
is
nothing
else
the
speculative
makes
its
appearance
here
as
speculative
whoever
does
not
know
the
speculative
does
not
believe
that
in
indicating
simple
notions
such
as
these
absolute
essence
is
expressed
one
many
like
unlike
more
or
less
are
trivial
empty
dry
moments
that
there
should
be
contained
in
them
absolute
essence
the
riches
and
the
organization
of
the
natural
as
of
the
spiritual
world
does
not
seem
possible
to
him
who
accustomed
to
ordinary
ideas
has
not
gone
back
from
sensuous
existence
into
thought
it
does
not
seem
to
such
a
one
that
god
is
in
a
speculative
sense
expressed
therebythat
what
is
most
sublime
can
be
put
in
those
common
words
what
is
deepest
in
what
is
so
well
known
selfevident
and
open
and
what
is
richest
in
the
poverty
of
these
abstractions
it
is
at
first
in
opposition
to
common
reality
that
this
idea
of
reality
as
the
manifold
of
simple
essence
has
in
itself
its
opposition
and
the
subsistence
of
the
same
this
essential
simple
notion
of
reality
is
elevation
into
thought
but
it
is
not
flight
from
what
is
real
but
the
expression
of
the
real
itself
in
its
essence
we
here
find
the
reason
which
expresses
its
essence
and
absolute
reality
is
unity
immediately
in
itself
thus
it
is
preeminently
in
relation
to
this
reality
that
the
difficulties
of
those
who
do
not
think
speculatively
have
become
so
intense
what
is
its
relation
to
common
reality
what
has
taken
place
is
just
what
happens
with
the
platonic
ideas
which
approximate
very
closely
to
these
numbers
or
rather
to
pure
notions
that
is
to
say
the
first
question
is
numbers
where
are
they
dispersed
through
space
dwelling
in
independence
in
the
heaven
of
ideas
they
are
not
things
immediately
in
themselves
for
a
thing
a
substance
is
something
quite
other
than
a
number
a
body
bears
no
similarity
to
it
to
this
we
may
answer
that
the
pythagoreans
did
not
signify
anything
like
that
which
we
understand
by
prototypesas
if
ideas
as
the
laws
and
relations
of
things
were
present
in
a
creative
consciousness
as
thoughts
in
the
divine
understanding
separated
from
things
as
are
the
thoughts
of
an
artist
from
his
work
still
less
did
they
mean
only
subjective
thoughts
in
our
consciousness
for
we
use
the
absolute
antithesis
as
the
explanation
of
the
existence
of
qualities
in
things
but
what
determines
is
the
real
substance
of
what
exists
so
that
each
thing
is
essentially
just
its
having
in
it
unity
duality
as
also
their
antithesis
and
connection
aristotle
met
i

puts
it
clearly
thus
it
is
characteristic
of
the
pythagoreans
that
they
did
not
maintain
the
finite
and
the
infinite
and
the
one
to
be
like
fire
earth
c
different
natures
or
to
have
another
reality
than
things
for
the
infinite
and
the
abstract
one
are
to
them
the
substance
of
the
things
of
which
they
are
predicated
hence
too
they
said
number
is
the
essence
of
all
things
thus
they
do
not
separate
numbers
from
things
but
consider
them
to
be
things
themselves
number
to
them
is
the
principle
and
matter
of
things
as
also
their
qualities
and
forces
hence
it
is
thought
as
substance
or
the
thing
as
it
is
in
the
reality
of
thought
these
abstract
determinations
then
became
more
concretely
determined
especially
by
the
later
philosophers
in
their
speculations
regarding
god
we
may
instance
iamblichus
for
example
in
the
work


ascribed
to
him
by
porphyry
and
nicomachus
those
philosophers
sought
to
raise
the
character
of
popular
religion
for
they
inserted
such
thoughtdeterminations
as
these
into
religious
conceptions
by
monas
they
understood
nothing
other
than
god
they
also
call
it
mind
the
hermaphrodite
which
contains
both
determinations
odd
as
well
as
even
and
likewise
substance

chaos
because
it
is
undetermined

and

they
called
the
duad
by
similar
names
such
as
matter
and
then
the
principle
of
the
unlike
strife
that
which
begets
isis
c
c
the
triad

has
now
become
a
most
important
number
seeing
that
in
it
the
monad
has
reached
reality
and
perfection
the
monad
proceeds
through
the
duad
and
again
brought
into
unity
with
this
undetermined
manifold
it
is
the
triad
unity
and
multiplicity
are
present
in
the
triad
in
the
worst
possible
wayas
an
external
combination
but
however
abstractly
this
is
understood
the
triad
is
still
a
profound
form
the
triad
then
is
held
to
be
the
first
perfect
form
in
the
universal
aristotle
de
clo
i
1
puts
this
very
clearly
the
corporeal
has
no
dimension
outside
of
the
three
hence
the
pythagoreans
also
say
that
the
all
and
everything
is
determined
through
triplicity
that
is
it
has
absolute
form
for
the
number
of
the
whole
has
end
middle
and
beginning
and
this
is
the
triad
nevertheless
there
is
something
superficial
in
the
wish
to
bring
everything
under
it
as
is
done
in
the
systematization
of
the
more
modern
natural
philosophy
therefore
we
too
taking
this
determination
from
nature
make
use
of
it
in
the
worship
of
the
gods
so
that
we
believe
them
to
have
been
properly
apostrophized
only
when
we
have
called
upon
them
three
times
in
prayer
two
we
call
both
but
not
all
we
speak
first
of
three
as
all
what
is
determined
through
three
is
the
first
totality

what
is
in
triple
form
is
perfectly
divided
some
is
merely
in
one
other
is
only
in
two
but
this
is
all
what
is
perfect
or
has
reality
is
its
identity
opposition
and
unity
like
number
generally
but
in
triplicity
this
is
actual
because
it
has
beginning
middle
and
end
each
thing
is
simple
as
beginning
it
is
other
or
manifold
as
middle
and
its
end
is
the
return
of
its
other
nature
into
unity
or
mind
if
we
take
this
triplicity
from
a
thing
we
negate
it
and
make
of
it
an
abstract
construction
of
thought
it
is
now
comprehensible
that
christians
sought
and
found
the
trinity
in
this
threefold
nature
it
has
often
been
made
a
superficial
reason
for
objecting
to
them
sometimes
the
idea
of
the
trinity
as
it
was
present
to
the
ancients
was
considered
as
above
reason
as
a
secret
and
hence
too
high
sometimes
it
was
deemed
too
absurd
but
from
the
one
cause
or
from
the
other
they
did
not
wish
to
bring
it
into
closer
relation
to
reason
if
there
is
a
meaning
in
this
trinity
we
must
try
to
understand
it
it
would
be
an
anomalous
thing
if
there
were
nothing
in
what
has
for
two
thousand
years
been
the
holiest
christian
idea
if
it
were
too
holy
to
be
brought
down
to
the
level
of
reason
or
were
something
now
quite
obsolete
so
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
good
taste
and
sense
to
try
to
find
a
meaning
in
it
it
is
the
notion
of
the
trinity
alone
of
which
we
can
speak
and
not
of
the
idea
of
father
and
son
for
we
am
not
dealing
with
these
natural
relationships
d
the
four

is
the
triad
but
more
developed
and
hence
with
the
pythagoreans
it
held
a
high
position
that
the
tetrad
should
be
considered
to
be
thus
complete
reminds
one
of
the
four
elements
the
physical
and
the
chemical
the
four
continents
c
in
nature
four
is
found
to
be
present
everywhere
and
hence
this
number
is
even
now
equally
esteemed
in
natural
philosophy
as
the
square
of
two
the
fourfold
is
the
perfection
of
the
twofold

as
itonly
having
itself
as
determination
ie
being
multiplied
with
itselfreturns
into
identity
with
itself
but
in
the
triad
the
tetrad
is
in
so
far
contained
as
that
the
former
is
the
unity
the
otherbeing
and
the
union
of
both
these
moments
and
thus
since
the
difference
as
posited
is
a
double
if
we
count
it
four
moments
result
to
make
this
clearer
the
tetrad
is
comprehended
as
the

the
efficient
active
four
from

and

and
afterwards
this
is
by
the
pythagoreans
made
the
most
notable
number
in
the
fragments
of
a
poem
of
empedocles

originally
was
a
pythagorean

only
the
external
and
superficial
one
of
number
there
is
no
notion
present
although
the
tetraktus
does
not
mean

so
much
as

of
the

says
in
a

the
divine
number
goes
on
till
from
the
still
unprofaned
sanctuary
of
the
monad
it
reaches
to
the
holy
tetrad
which
creates
the
mother
of
all
that
is
which
received
all
within

of

what
we
find
about
the
progression
of
the
other
numbers
is
more
indefinite
and
unsatisfying
and
the
notion
loses
itself
in
them
up
to
five
there
may
certainly
be
a
kind
of
thought
in
numbers
but
from
six
onwards
they
are
merely
arbitrary
determinations

application
of
the
system
to
the
universe
this
simple
idea
and
the
simple
reality
contained
therein
must
now
however
be
further
developed
in
order
to
come
to
reality
as
it
is
when
put
together
and
expanded
the
question
now
meets
us
as
to
how
in
this
relation
the
pythagoreans
passed
from
abstract
logical
determinations
to
forms
which
indicate
the
concrete
use
of
numbers
in
what
pertains
to
space
or
music
determinations
of
objects
formed
by
the
pythagoreans
through
numbers
still
bear
a
somewhat
closer
relation
to
the
thing
but
when
they
enter
the
region
of
the
concrete
in
nature
and
in
mind
numbers
become
purely
formal
and
empty

to
show
how
the
pythagoreans
constructed

undoubtedly
we
have
in
them
to
do
with
such
ideal
principles
for
numbers
are
in
fact
perfect
determinations
of
abstract
space
that
is
to
say
if
we
begin
with
the
point
the
first
negation
of
vacuity
the
point
corresponds
to
unity
it
is
indivisible
and
the
principle
of
lines
as
the
unity
is
that
of
numbers
while
the
point
exists
as
the
monad
or
one
the
line
expresses
the
duad
or
two
for
both
become
comprehensible

the
line
is
the
pure
relationship
of
two
points
and
is
without
breadth
surface
results
from
the
threefold
but
the
solid
figure
or
body
belongs
to
the
fourfold
and
in
it
there
are
three
dimensions
present
others
say
that
body
consists
of
one
point
ie
its
essence
is
one
point
for
the
flowing
point
makes
the
line
the
flowing
line
however
makes
surface
and
this
surface
makes
body
they
distinguish
themselves
from
the
first
mentioned
in
that
the
former
make
numbers
primarily
proceed
from
the
monad
and
the
undetermined
duad
and
then
points
and
lines
plane
surfaces
and
solid
figures
from
numbers
while
they
construct
all
from
one
point
to
the
first
distinction
is
opposition
or
form
set
forth
as
duality
the
others
have
form
as
activity
thus
what
is
corporeal
is
formed
under
the
directing
influence
of
numbers
but
from
them
also
proceed
the
definite
bodies
water
air
fire
and
the
whole
universe
generally
which
they
declare
to
be
harmonious
this
harmony
is
one
which
again
consists
of
numeral
relations
only
which
constitute
the
various
concords
of
the
absolute
harmony
we
must
here
remark
that
the
progression
from
the
point
to
actual
space
also
has
the
signification
of
occupation
of
space
for
according
to
their
fundamental
tenets
and
teaching
says
aristotle

i
8
they
speak
of
sensuously
perceptible
bodies
in
nowise
differently
from
those
which
are
mathematical
since
lines
and
surfaces
are
only
abstract
moments
in
space
external
construction
likewise
proceeds
from
here
very
well
on
the
other
hand
the
transition
from
the
occupation
of
space
generally
to
what
is
determined
to
water
earth
c
is
quite
another
thing
and
is
more
difficult
or
rather
the
pythagoreans
have
not
taken
this
step
for
the
universe
itself
has
with
them
the
speculative
simple
form
which
is
found
in
the
fact
of
being
represented
as
a
system
of
numberrelations
but
with
all
this
the
physical
is
not
yet
determined
b
another
application
or
exhibition
of
the
essential
nature
of
the
determination
of
numbers
is
to
be
found
in
the
relations
of
music
and
it
is
more
especially
in
their
case
that
number
constitutes
the
determining
factor
the
differences
here
show
themselves
as
various
relations
of
numbers
and
this
mode
of
determining
what
is
musical
is
the
only
one
the
relation
borne
by
tones
to
one
another
is
founded
on
quantitative
differences
whereby
harmonies
may
be
formed
in
distinction
to
others
by
which
discords
are
constituted
the
pythagoreans
according
to
porphyry

treated
music
as
something
soulinstructing
and
scholastic
psychagogisches
und
pdagogisches
pythagoras
was
the
first
to
discern
that
musical
relations
these
audible
differences
are
mathematically
determinable
that
what
we
hear
as
consonance
and
dissonance
is
a
mathematical
arrangement
the
subjective
and
in
the
case
of
hearing
simple
feeling
which
however
exists
inherently
in
relation
pythagoras
has
justified
to
the
understanding
and
he
attained
his
object
by
means
of
fixed
determinations
for
to
him
the
discovery
of
the
fundamental
tones
of
harmony
are
ascribed
and
these
rest
on
the
most
simple
numberrelations
iamblichus

says
that
pythagoras
in
passing
by
the
workshop
of
a
smith
observed
the
strokes
that
gave
forth
a
particular
chord
he
then
took
into
consideration
the
weight
of
the
hammer
giving
forth
a
certain
harmony
and
from
that
determined
mathematically
the
tone
as
related
thereto44
and
finally
he
applied
the
same
and
experimented
in
strings
by
which
means
there
were
three
different
relations
presented
to
himdiapason
diapente
and
diatessaron
it
is
known
that
the
tone
of
a
string
or
in
the
wind
instrument
of
its
equivalent
the
column
of
air
in
a
reed
depends
on
three
conditions
on
its
length
on
its
thickness
and
on
the
amount
of
tension
now
if
we
have
two
strings
of
equal
thickness
and
length
a
difference
in
tension
brings
about
a
difference
in
sound
if
we
want
to
know
what
tone
any
string
has
we
have
only
to
consider
its
tension
and
this
may
be
measured
by
the
weight
depending
from
the
string
by
means
of
which
it
is
extended
pythagoras
here
found
that
if
one
string
were
weighted
with
twelve
pounds
and
another
with
six


1

it
would
produce
the
musical
chord
of
the
octave


the
proportion
of
8

12
or
of
2

would
give
the
chord
of
the
fifth

proportion
of

or
3

the

a
different
number
of
vibrations
in
like
times
determines
the
height
and
depth
of
the
tone
and
this
number
is
likewise
proportionate
to
the
weight
if
thickness
and
length
are
equal
in
the
first
case
the
more
distended
string
makes
as
many
vibrations
again
as
the
other
in
the
second
case
it
makes
three
vibrations
for
the
others
two
and
so
it
goes
on
here
number
is
the
real
factor
which
determines
the
difference
for
tone
as
the
vibration
of
a
body
is
only
a
quantitatively
determined
quiver
or
movement
that
is
a
determination
made
through
space
and
time
for
there
can
be
no
determination
for
the
difference
excepting
that
of
number
or
the
amount
of
vibrations
in
one
time
and
hence
a
determination
made
through
numbers
is
nowhere
more
in
place
than
here
there
certainly
are
also
qualitative
differences
such
as
those
existing
between
the
tones
of
metals
and
catgut
strings
and
between
the
human
voice
and
wind
instruments
but
the
peculiar
musical
relation
borne
by
the
tone
of
one
instrument
to
another
in
which
harmony
is
to
be
found
is
a
relationship
of
numbers
from
this
point
the
pythagoreans
enter
into
further
applications
of
the
theory
of
music
in
which
we
cannot
follow
them
the

priori
law
of
progression
and
the
necessity
of
movement
in
numberrelations
is
a
matter
which
is
entirely
dark
minds
confused
may
wander
about
at
will
for
everywhere
ideas
are
hinted
at
and
superficial
harmonies
present
themselves
and
disappear
again
but
in
all
that
treats
of
the
further
construction
of
the
universe
as
a
numerical
system
we
have
the
whole
extent
of
the
confusion
and
turbidity
of
thought
belonging
to
the
later
pythagoreans
we
cannot
say
how
much
pains
they
took
to
express
philosophic
thought
in
a
system
of
numbers
and
also
to
understand
the
expressions
given
utterance
to
by
others
and
to
put
in
them
all
the
meaning
possible
when
they
determined
the
physical
and
the
moral
universe
by
means
of
numbers
everything
came
into
indefinite
and
insipid
relationships
in
which
the
notion
disappeared
in
this
matter
however
so
far
as
the
older
pythagoreans
are
concerned
we
are
acquainted
with
the
main
principles
only
plato
exemplifies
to
us
the
conception
of
the
universe
as
a
system
of
numbers
but
cicero
and
the
ancients
always
call
these
numbers
the
platonic
and
it
does
not
appear
that
they
were
ascribed
to
the
pythagoreans
it
was
thus
later
on
that
this
came
to
be
said
even
in
ciceros
time
they
had
become
proverbially
dark
and
there
is
but
little
after
all
that
is
really
old
c
the
pythagoreans
further
constructed
the
heavenly
bodies
of
the
visible
universe
by
means
of
numbers
and
here
we
see
at
once
the
barrenness
and
abstraction
present
in
the
determination
of
numbers
aristotle
says
met
i
5
because
they
defined
numbers
to
be
the
principles
of
all
nature
they
brought
under
numbers
and
their
relationships
all
determinations
and
all
sections
both
of
the
heavens
and
of
all
nature
and
where
anything
did
not
altogether
conform
they
sought
to
supply
the
deficiency
in
order
to
bring
about
a
harmony
for
instance
as
the
ten
or
dekad
appeared
to
them
to
be
the
perfect
number
or
that
which
embraces
the
whole
essence
of
numbers
they
said
that
the
spheres
moving
in
the
heavens
must
be
ten
but
as
only
nine
of
these
are
visible
they
made
out
a
tenth
the
antichthone

these
nine
are
first
the
milky
way
or
the
fixed
stars
and
after
that
the
seven
stars
which
were
then
all
held
to
be
planets
saturn
jupiter
mars
venus
mercury
the
sun
moon
and
in
the
last
and
ninth
place
the
earth
the
tenth
is
thus
the
antichthone
and
in
regard
to
this
it
must
remain
uncertain
whether
the
pythagoreans
considered
it
to
be
the
side
of
the
earth
which
is
turned
away
or
as
quite
another
body

physical
character
of

fire

by
the
pythagoreans
placed
in

but
the
earth
was
made

that
moved
around
this
central

in
a

this
circle
is
then
a
sphere
which
as
the
most
perfect
of
figures
corresponds
to
the
dekad
we
here
find
a
certain
similarity
to
our
ideas
of
the
solar
system
but
the
pythagoreans
did
not
believe
the
fire
to
be
the
sun
they
thus
says
aristotle
rely
not
on
sensuous
appearance
but
on
reasons
just
as
we
form
conclusions
in
accordance
with
reasons
as
opposed
to
sensuous
appearances
and
indeed
this
comes
to
us
still
as
the
first
example
of
things
being
in
themselves
different
from
what
they
appear

fire

which
is
in
the
centre
they
called
jupiters

now
these
ten
spheres
make
like
all
that
is
in

a

but
each
makes
a
different
one
according
to
the
difference
in
its
size
and

this
is
determined
by
means
of
the
different
distances
which
bear
an
harmonious
relationship
to
one
another
in

with

by
this
means
an
harmonious
sound
arises
in
the

universal

we
must
acknowledge
the
grandeur
of
this
idea
of
determining
everything
in
the
system
of
the
heavenly
spheres
through

which
have
a
necessary
connection
amongst
themselves

have
to
be
conceived
of

thus
necessarily

it
is
a

of

which
must
also
form
the
basis

essence
of
what
can
be
heard

we
have
comprehended
here
in
thought
a
system
of
the
universe
the
solar
system
is
alone
rational
to
us
for
the
other
stars
are
devoid
of
interest
to
say
that
there
is
music
in
the
spheres
and
that
these
movements
are
tones
may
seem
just
as
comprehensible
to
us
as
to
say
that
the
sun
is
still
and
the
earth
moves
although
both
are
opposed
to
the
dictates
of
sense
for
seeing
that
we
do
not
see
the
movement
it
may
be
that
we
do
not
hear
the
notes
and
there
is
little
difficulty
in
imagining
a
universal
silence
in
these
vast
spheres
since
we
do
not
hear
the
chorus
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
give
a
reason
for
not
hearing
this
music
the
pythagoreans
say
according
to
the
last
quoted
passage
of
aristotle
that
we
do
not
hear
it
because
we
live
in
it
like
the
smith
who
gets
accustomed
to
the
blows
of
his
hammer
since
it
belongs
to
our
substance
and
is
identical
with
ourselves
nothing
else
such
as
silence
by
which
we
might
know
the
other
comes
into
relationship
with
us
for
we
are
conceived
of
as
entirely
within
the
movement
but
the
movement
does
not
become
a
tone
in
the
first
place
because
pure
space
and
time
the
elements
in
movement
can
only
raise
themselves
into
a
proper
voice
unstimulated
from
without
in
an
animate
body
and
movement
first
reaches
this
definite
characteristic
individuality
in
the
animal
proper
and
in
the
next
place
because
the
heavenly
bodies
are
not
related
to
one
another
as
bodies
whose
sound
requires
for
its
production
contact
friction
or
shock
in
response
to
which
and
as
the
negation
of
its
particularity
its
own
momentary
individuality
resounds
in
elasticity
for
heavenly
bodies
are
independent
of
one
another
and
have
only
a
general
nonindividual
free
motion
we
may
thus
set
aside
sound
the
music
of
the
spheres
is
indeed
a
wonderful
conception
but
it
is
devoid
of
any
real
interest
for
us
if
we
retain
the
conception
that
motion
as
measure
is
a
necessarily
connected
system
of
numbers
as
the
only
rational
part
of
the
theory
we
must
maintain
that
nothing
further
has
transpired
to
the
present
day
in
a
certain
way
indeed
we
have
made
an
advance
upon
pythagoras
we
have
learned
from
kepler
about
laws
about
eccentricity
and
the
relation
of
distances
to
the
times
of
revolution
but
no
amount
of
mathematics
has
as
yet
been
able
to
give
us
the
laws
of
progression
in
the
harmony
through
which
the
distances
are
determined
we
know
empirical
numbers
well
enough
but
everything
has
the
semblance
of
accident
and
not
of
necessity
we
are
acquainted
with
an
approximate
rule
of
distances
and
thus
have
correctly
foretold
the
existence
of
planets
where
ceres
vesta
pallas
c
were
afterwards
discoveredthat
is
between
mars
and
jupiter
but
astronomy
has
not
as
yet
found
in
it
a
consistent
sequence
in
which
there
is
rationality
on
the
other
hand
it
even
looks
with
disdain
on
the
appearance
of
regularity
presented
by
this
sequence
which
is
however
on
its
own
account
a
most
important
matter
and
one
which
should
not
be
forgotten
d
the
pythagoreans
also
applied
their
principle
to
the
soul
and
thus
determined
what
is
spiritual
as

aristotle

goes
on
to
tell
that
they
thought
that
solar
corpuscles
are
soul
others
that
it
is
what
moves
them
they
adopted
this
idea
because
the
corpuscles
are
ever
moving
even
in
perfect
stillness
and
hence
they
must
have
motion
of
their
own
this
does
not
signify
much
but
it
is
evident
from
it
that
the
determination
of
selfmovement
was
sought
for
in
the
soul
the
pythagoreans
made
a
further
application
of
numberconceptions
to
the
soul
after
another
form
which
aristotle
describes
in
the

these
ideas
which
we
must
however
ascribe
to
later
pythagoreans
we
may
undoubtedly
find
some
adequacy
for
while
thought
is
pure
universality
knowledge
deals
with
something
other
since
it
gives
itself
a
determination
and
a
content
but
feeling
is
the
most
developed
in
its
determinateness
now
because
the
soul
moves
itself
it
is
the
selfmoving

yet
we
never

the

hence
also
the

it

bound
up
with

it
consists
of
elements
and
is
divided
according
to

it

unfortunately

not
given

a
profound
knowledge
of
the
harmony
of
the

but
yet
they
are
forms
which
themselves
remain
dark
because
they
are
clumsy

unsuitable
there
is
always
a
forcible

nothing
has
the
pliability
of
thought
but
thought
itself
it
is
remarkable
that
the
pythagoreans
have
grasped
the

as
a
system
which
is
a
counterpart
of

difficult
and
when
done
it
always
must
be
arbitrary
there
is
still
something
worthy
of
attention
in
what
is
said
by
the
pythagoreans
in
reference
to
the
soul
and
this
is
their
doctrine

the

the
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
extends
even
to
india
and
without
doubt
pythagoras
took
it
from
the
egyptians
indeed
herodotus
ii

expressly
says
so
after
he
speaks
of
the

ideas
of
the
egyptians
as
to
the
lower
world
he
continues
the
egyptians
were
the
first
to
say
that
the
soul
of
man
is
immortal
and
that
when
the
body
disappears
it
goes
into
another
living
being
and
when
it
has
gone
through
all
the
animals
of
land
and
sea
and
likewise

it
again

the

connection

that

these

also

amongst

are

who
earlier

very
various
and
foolish
stories
as
in

copied
from

egyptian
priesthood
so
must
we
here
set
aside
this
oriental
and
ungreek
idea
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
both
were
too
far
removed
from
the
greek
spirit
to
have
had
a
place
and
a
development
there
with
the
greeks
the
consciousness
of
a
higher
freer
individuality
has
become
too
strong
to
allow
any
permanence
to
the
idea
of
metempsychosis
according
to
which
man
this
independent
and
selfsufficing
being
takes
the
form
of
a
beast
they
have
indeed
the
conception
of
men
as
becoming
springs
of
water
trees
animals
c
but
the
idea
of
degradation
which
comes
as
a
consequence
of
sin
lies
at
its
root
aristotle

shortly
and
in
his
own
manner
deals
with
and
annihilates
this
idea
of
the
pythagoreans
they
do
not
say
for
what
reason
soul
dwells
in
body
nor
how
the
latter
is
related
to
it
for
owing
to
their
unity
of
nature
when
one
acts
the
other
suffers
one
moves
and
the
other
is
moved
but
none
of
this
happens
in
what
is
mutually
contingent
according
to
the
pythagorean
myths
any
soul
takes
to
any
body
which
is
much
like
making
architects
take
to
flutes
for
crafts
must
necessarily
have
tools
and
soul
body
but
each
tool
must
have
its
proper
form
and
kind
it
is
implied
in
the
transmigration
of
souls
that
the
organization
of
the
body
is
something
accidental
to
the
human
soul
this
refutation
by
aristotle
is
complete
the
eternal
idea
of
metempsychosis
had
philosophic
interest
only
as
the
inner
notion
permeating
all
these
forms
the
oriental
unity
which
appears
in
everything
we
have
not
got
this
signification
here
or
at
best
we
have
but
a
glimmering
of
it
if
we
say
that
the
particular
soul
is
as
a
definite
thing
to
wander
about
throughout
all
we
find
firstly
that
the
soul
is
not
a
thing
such
as
leibnitz
monad
which
like
a
bubble
in
the
cup
of
coffee
is
possibly
a
sentient
thinking
soul
in
the
second
place
an
empty
identity
of
the
soulthing
such
as
this
has
no
interest
in

to
immortality

practical

regards
the
practical
philosophy
of
pythagoras
which
is
closely
connected
with
what
has
gone
before
there
is
but
little
that
is
philosophic
known
to
us
aristotle
magn
moral
i
1
says
of
him
that
he
first
sought
to
speak
of
virtue
but
not
in
the
right
way
for
because
he
deduced
the
virtues
from
numbers
he
could
not
form
of
them
any
proper
theory
the
pythagoreans
adopted
ten
virtues
as
well
as
ten
heavenly
spheres
justice
amongst
others
is
described
as
the
number
which
is
like
itself
in
like
manner


it
is
an
even
number
which
remains
even
when
multiplied
with
itself
justice
is
preeminently
what
remains
like
itself
but
this
is
an
altogether
abstract
determination
which
applies
to
much
that
is
and
which
does
not
exhaust
the
concrete
thus
remaining
quite
indeterminate
under
the
name
of
the
golden
words
we
have
a
collection
of
hexameters
which
are
a
succession
of
moral
reflections
but
which
are
rightly
ascribed
to
later
pythagoreans
they
are
old
wellknown
moral
maxims
which
are
expressed
in
a
simple
and
dignified
way
but
which
do
not
contain
anything
remarkable
they
begin
with
the
direction
to
honour
the
immortal
gods
as
they
are
by
law
established
and
further
honour
the
oath
and
then
the
illustrious
heroes
elsewhere
they
go
on
to
direct
honour
to
be
paid
to
parents
and
to
relatives
c47
such
matter
does
not
deserve
to
be
regarded
as
philosophy
although
it
is
of
importance
in
the
process
of
development
the
transition
from
the
form
of
outward
morals
to
morality
as
existent
is
more
important
as
in
thales
time
lawgivers
and
administrators
of
states
were
preeminent
in
possessing
a
physical
philosophy
so
we
see
that
with
pythagoras
practical
philosophy
is
advocated
as
the
means
of
constituting
a
moral
life
there
we
have
the
speculative
idea
the
absolute
essence
in
its
reality
and
in
a
definite
sensuous
existence
and
similarly
the
moral
life
is
submerged
in
actuality
as
the
universal
spirit
of
a
people
and
as
their
laws
and
rule
in
pythagoras
on
the
contrary
we
have
the
reality
of
absolute
essence
raised
in
speculation
out
of
sensuous
reality
and
expressed
though
still
imperfectly
as
the
essence
of
thought
morality
is
likewise
partly
raised
out
of
actuality
as
ordinarily
known
it
is
certainly
a
moral
disposition
of
all
actuality
but
as
a
brotherhood
and
not
as
the
life
of
a
people
the
pythagorean
league
is
an
arbitrary
existence
and
not
a
part
of
the
constitution
recognized
by
public
sanction
and
in
his
person
pythagoras
isolated
himself
as
teacher
as
he
also
did
his
followers
the
universal
consciousness
the
spirit
of
a
people
is
the
substance
of
which
the
accident
is
the
individual
consciousness
the
speculative
is
thus
the
fact
that
pure
universal
law
is
absolute
individual
consciousness
so
that
this
last
because
it
draws
therefrom
its
growth
and
nourishment
becomes
universal
selfconsciousness
these
two
sides
do
not
however
come
to
us
in
the
form
of
the
opposition
it
is
first
of
all
in
morality
that
there
is
properly
this
notion
of
the
absolute
individuality
of
consciousness
which
does
everything
on
its
own
account
but
we
see
that
it
was
really
present
to
the
mind
of
pythagoras
that
the
substance
of
morality
is
the
universal
from
an
example
in
diogenes
laertius
viii
16
a
pythagorean
answered
to
the
question
of
a
father
who
inquired
as
to
the
best
education
he
could
give
his
son
that
it
should
be
that
which
would
make
him
the
citizen
of
a
wellregulated
state
this
answer
is
great
and
true
to
the
great
principle
of
living
in
the
spirit
of
ones
people
all
other
circumstances
are
subordinate
nowadays
men
try
to
keep
education
free
from
the
spirit
of
the
times
but
they
cannot
withdraw
themselves
from
this
supreme
power
the
state
for
even
if
they
try
to
separate
themselves
they
unconsciously
remain
beneath
this
universal
the
speculative
meaning
of
the
practical
philosophy
of
pythagoras
thus
is
that
in
this
signification
the
individual
consciousness
shall
obtain
a
moral
reality
in
the
brotherhood
but
as
number
is
a
middle
thing
between
the
sensuous
and
notion
the
pythagorean
brotherhood
is
a
middle
between
universal
actual
morality
and
maintaining
that
in
true
morality
the
individual
as
an
individual
is
responsible
for
his
own
behaviour
this
morality
ceases
to
be
universal
spirit
if
we
wish
to
see
practical
philosophy
reappear
we
shall
find
it
but
on
the
whole
we
shall
not
see
it
become
really
speculative
until
very
recent
times
we
may
satisfy
ourselves
with
this
as
giving
us
an
idea
of
the
pythagorean
system
i
will
however
shortly
give
the
principal
points
of
the
criticism
which
aristotle
met
i
8
makes
upon
the
pythagorean
numberform
he
says
justly
in
the
first
place
if
only
the
limited
and
the
unlimited
the
even
and
odd
are
made
fundamental
ideas
the
pythagoreans
do
not
explain
how
movement
arises
and
how
without
movement
and
change
there
can
be
coming
into
being
and
passing
away
or
the
conditions
and
activities
of
heavenly
objects
this
defect
is
significant
arithmetical
numbers
are
dry
forms
and
barren
principles
in
which
life
and
movement
are
deficient
aristotle
says
secondly
from
number
no
other
corporeal
determinations
such
as
weight
and
lightness
are
conceivable
or
number
thus
cannot
pass
into
what
is
concrete
they
say
that
there
is
no
number
outside
of
those
in
the
heavenly
spheres
for
instance
a
heavenly
sphere
and
a
virtue
or
a
natural
manifestation
in
the
earth
are
determined
as
one
and
the
same
number
each
of
the
first
numbers
may
be
exhibited
in
each
thing
or
quality
but
in
so
far
as
number
is
made
to
express
a
further
determination
this
quite
abstract
quantitative
difference
becomes
altogether
formal
it
is
as
if
the
plant
were
five
because
it
has
five
stamens
this
is
just
as
superficial
as
are
determination
through
elements
or
through
particular
portions
of
the
globe
it
is
a
method
as
formal
as
that
by
which
men
now
try
to
apply
the
categories
of
electricity
magnetism
galvanism
compression
and
expansion
of
manly
and
of
womanly
to
everything
it
is
a
purely
empty
system
of
determination
where
reality
should
be
dealt
with
to
pythagoras
and
his
disciples
there
are
moreover
many
scientific
conclusions
and
discoveries
ascribed
which
however
do
not
concern
us
at
all
thus
according
to
diogenes
laertius
viii
14
27
he
is
said
to
have
known
that
the
morning
and
evening
star
is
the
same
and
that
the
moon
derives
her
light
from
the
sun
we
have
already
mentioned
what
he
says
of
music
but
what
is
best
known
is
the
pythagorean
theorem
it
really
is
the
main
proposition
in
geometry
and
cannot
be
regarded
like
any
other
theorem
according
to
diogenes
viii
12
pythagoras
on
discovering
the
theorem
sacrificed
a
hecatomb
so
important
did
he
think
it
and
it
may
indeed
seem
remarkable
that
his
joy
should
have
gone
so
far
as
to
ordain
a
great
feast
to
which
rich
men
and
all
the
people
were
invited
it
was
worth
the
trouble
it
was
a
rejoicing
a
feast
of
spiritual
cognitionat
the
cost
of
the
oxen
other
ideas
which
are
brought
forward
by
the
pythagoreans
casually
and
without
any
connection
have
no
philosophic
interest
and
need
only
be
mentioned
aristotle
for
instance
says
phys
iv
6
that
the
pythagoreans
believed
in
an
empty
space
which
the
heavens
inspire
and
an
empty
space
which
separates
natural
things
and
brings
about
the
distinction
between
continuous
and
discrete
it
first
exists
in
numbers
and
makes
them
to
be
different
diogenes
laertius
viii
2628
says
much
more
all
of
which
is
dull
this
is
like
the
later
writers
who
generally
speaking
take
up
what
is
external
and
devoid
of
any
intellectual
meaning
the
air
which
encircles
the
earth
is
immovable

at
least
through
itself
and
diseased
and
all
that
is
in
it
is
mortal
but
what
is
highest
is
in
continual
movement
pure
and
healthy
and
in
it
everything
is
immortaldivine
sun
moon
and
the
other
stars
are
gods
for
in
them
warmth
has
predominance
and
is
the
cause
of
life
man
is
related
to
the
gods
because
he
participates
in
warmth
and
hence
god
cares
for
us
a
ray
penetrates
from
the
sun
through
the
thick
and
cold
ether
and
gives
life
to
everything
they
call

the

c
the
eleatic
school
the
pythagorean
philosophy
has
not
yet
got
the
speculative
form
of
expression
for
the
notion
numbers
are
not
pure
notion
but
notion
in
the
form
of
ordinary
idea
or
sensuous
perception
and
hence
a
mixture
of
both
this
expression
of
absolute
essence
in
what
is
a
pure
notion
or
something
thought
and
the
movement
of
the
notion
or
of
thought
is
that
which
we
find
must
come
next
and
this
we
discover
in
the
eleatic
school
in
it
we
see
thought
becoming
free
for
itself
and
in
that
which
the
eleatics
express
as
absolute
essence
we
see
thought
grasp
itself
in
purity
and
the
movement
of
thought
in
notions
in
the
physical
philosophy
we
saw
movement
represented
as
an
objective
movement
as
an
origination
and
passing
away
the
pythagoreans
similarly
did
not
reflect
upon
these
notions
and
also
treated
their
essence
number
as
fleeting
but
since
alteration
is
now
grasped
in
its
highest
abstraction
as
nothing
this
objective
movement
changes
into
a
subjective
one
comes
over
to
the
side
of
consciousness
and
existence
becomes
the
unmoved
we
here
find
the
beginning
of
dialectic
ie
simply
the
pure
movement
of
thought
in
notions
likewise
we
see
the
opposition
of
thought
to
outward
appearance
or
sensuous
being
or
of
that
which
is
implicit
to
the
beingforanother
of
this
implicitness
and
in
the
objective
existence
we
see
the
contradiction
which
it
has
in
itself
or
dialectic
proper
when
we
reflect
in
anticipation
on
how
the
course
of
pure
thought
must
be
formed
we
find

that
pure
thought
pure
being
the
one
manifests
itself
immediately
in
its
rigid
isolation
and
selfidentity
and
everything
else
as
null

that
the
hitherto
timid
thoughtwhich
after
it
is
strengthened
ascribes
value
to
the
other
and
constitutes
itself
therefromshows
that
it
then
grasps
the
other
in
its
simplicity
and
even
in
so
doing
shows
its
nullity

finally
thought
manifests
the
other
in
the
manifold
nature
of
its
determinations
we
shall
see
this
in
the
development
and
culture
of
the
eleatics
in
history
these
eleatic
propositions
still
have
interest
for
philosophy
and
are
moments
which
must
necessarily
there
appear
xenophanes
parmenides
melissus
and
zeno
are
to
be
reckoned
as
belonging
to
this
school
xenophanes
may
be
regarded
as
the
founder
of
it
parmenides
is
supposed
to
have
been
his
pupil
and
melissus
and
especially
zeno
are
called
the
pupils
of
parmenides
in
fact
they
are
to
be
taken
together
as
forming
the
eleatic
school
later
on
it
lost
the
name
being
then
called
sophistic
and
its
locality
was
transferred
to
greece
proper
what
xenophanes
began
parmenides
and
melissus
developed
further
and
similarly
zeno
perfected
what
these
two
taught
aristotle
metaph
i
5
characterizes
the
first
three
thus
parmenides
seems
to
comprehend
the
one
as
notion



melissus
as
matter



hence
the
former
says
that
it
is
limited

and
the
latter
that
it
is
unlimited

but
xenophanes
who
was
the
first
of
them
to
express
the
theory
of
the
one
made
the
matter
no
plainer

nor
did
he
deal
with
either
of
these
aspects

but
looking
into
the
heavensas
we
say
into
the
bluesaid
god
is
the
one
xenophanes
and
melissus
are
on
the
whole
less
civilized


parmenides
however
is
more
acute


there
is
less
to
say
of
xenophanes
and
melissus
and
what
has
come
to
us
from
the
latter
in
particularin
fragments
and
derived
from
the
sayings
of
othersis
still
in
a
state
of
ferment
and
in
his
case
there
is
least
knowledge
obtainable
on
the
whole
philosophic
utterances
and
notions
are
still
poor
and
it
was
in
zeno
that
philosophy
first
attained
to
a
purer
expression
of
itself

xenophanes
the
period
at
which
he
lived
is
clear
enough
and
as
this
suffices
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
that
the
year
of
his
birth
and
of
his
death
is
unknown
according
to
diogenes
laertius
ix
18
he
was
contemporary
with
anaximander
and
pythagoras
of
his
circumstances
further
than
this
it
is
only
known
that
he
for
reasons
which
are
unknown
escaped
from
his
native
town
colophon
in
asia
minor
to
magna
grcia
and
resided
for
the
most
part
at
zancle
now
messina
and
catana
still
called
catania
in
sicily
i
find
it
nowhere
said
by
the
ancients
that
he
lived
at
elea
although
all
recent
writers
on
the
history
of
philosophy
repeat
it
one
after
the
other
tennemann
in
particular
says

151
and

that
about
the
61st

he
repaired
from

to

diogenes
laertius
ix

however
only
says
that
he
flourished
about
the
60th
olympiad
and
that
he
made
two
thousand
verses
on
the
colonization
of
elea
from
which
it
might
be
easily
concluded
that
he
was
also
born
at
elea
strabo

this
in
the
beginning
of
his
sixth
bookwhen
describing

parmenides

hundred
years

as
the
immediate
product
of
pure
thought
is
in
its
immediacy
being
for
us
the
determination
of
being
is
already
known
and
trivial
but
if
we
know
about
being
the
one
we
place
this
as
a
particular
determination
in
a
line
with
all
the
rest
here
on
the
contrary
it
signifies
that
all
else
has
no
reality
and
is
only
a
semblance
we
must
forget
our
own
ideas
we
know
of
god
as
spirit
but
because
the
greeks
only
had
before
them
the
sensuous
world
these
gods
of
their
imagination
and
found
in
them
no
satisfaction
they
rejected
all
as
being
untrue
and
thus
came
to
pure
thought
this
is
a
wonderful
advance
and
thought
thus
becomes
for
the
first
time
free
for
itself
in
the
eleatic
school
being
the
one
of
the
eleatic
school
is
just
this
immersion
in
the
abyss
of
the
abstract
identity
of
the
understanding
just
as
this
comes
first
so
it
also
comes
last
as
that
to
which
the
understanding
comes
back
and
this
is
proved
in
recent
times
when
god
is
grasped
only
as
the
highest
being
if
we
say
of
god
that
this
the
highest
being
is
outside
of
and
over
us
we
can
know
nothing
more
of
it
but
that
it
is
and
thus
it
is
the
undetermined
for
if
we
knew
of
determinations
this
would
be
to
possess
knowledge
the
truth
then
simply
is
that
god
is
the
one
not
in
the
sense
that
there
is
one
god
this
is
another
determination
but
only
that
he
is
identical
with
himself
in
this
there
is
no
other
determination
any
more
than
in
the
utterance
of
the
eleatic
school
modern
thought
has
indeed
passed
through
a
longer
path
not
only
through
what
is
sensuous
but
also
through
philosophic
ideas
and
predicates
of
god
to
this
all
negating
abstraction
but
the
content
the
result
arrived
at
is
the
same
with
this
the
dialectic
reasoning
of
the
eleatics
is
closely
connected
in
respect
that
they
have
also
proved
that
nothing
can
originate
or
pass
away
this
deduction
is
to
be
found
in

it
is
impossible
he
says49
that
if
anything
is
it
arises
and
he
even
applies
this
to
the
godhead
for
it
must
arise
either
from
the
like
or
from
the
unlike
but
both
are
equally
impossible
for
it
is
no
more
probable
that
the
like
should
be
engendered
from
the
like
than
that
it
should
engender
it
for
the
like
must
have
determinations
identical
with
one
another
in
acknowledging
similarity
the
distinction
between
begetting
and
begotten
falls
away
just
as
little
can
unlike
arise
from
unlike
for
if
from
the
weaker
the
stronger
takes
its
rise
or
from
the
smaller
the
greater
or
from
the
worse
the
better
or
if
conversely
the
worse
proceeds
from
the
better
nonbeing
would
result
from
being
this
is
impossible
and
thus
god
is
eternal
the
same
thing
has
been
expressed
as
pantheism
or
spinozaism
which
rests
on
the
proposition
ex
nihilo
fit
nihil
the
unity
of
god
is
further
proved
by
xenophanes
if
god
is
the
mightiest
he
must
be
one
for
were
he
two
or
more
he
would
not
have
dominion
over
the
others
but
not
having
dominion
over
the
others
he
could
not
be
god
thus
were
there
several
they
would
be
relatively
more
powerful
or
weaker
and
thus
they
would
not
be
gods
for
gods
nature
is
to
have
nothing
mightier
than
he
were
they
equal
god
would
no
longer
possess
the
quality
of
being
the
mightiest
for
the
like
is
neither
worse
nor
better
than
the
likeor
it
does
not
differ
therefrom
hence
if
god
is
and
is
such
as
this
he
is
only
one
he
could
not
were
there
several
do
what
he
willed
since
he
is
one
he
is
everywhere
alike
he
hears
sees
and
has
also
the
other
senses
everywhere
for
were
this
not
the
case
the
parts
of
god
would
be
one
more
powerful
than
the
other
which
is
impossible
since
god
is
everywhere
alike
he
has
a
spherical
form
for
he
is
not
here
thus
and
elsewhere
different
but
is
everywhere
the
same
since
he
is
eternal
and
one
and
spherical
in
form
he
is
neither
unlimited
nor
limited
to
be
unlimited
is
nonbeing
for
that
has
neither
middle
beginning
end
nor
part
and
what
is
unlimited
corresponds
to
this
description
but
whatever
nonbeing
is
being
is
not
mutual
limitation
would
take
place
if
there
were
several
but
since
there
is
only
one
it
is
not
limited
the
one
does
not
move
itself
nor
is
it
unmoved
to
be
unmoved
is
nonbeing
for
to
it
none
other
comes
nor
does
it
go
into
another
but
to
be
moved
must
mean
to
be
several
for
one
must
move
into
another
thus
the
one
neither
rests
nor
is
it
moved
for
it
is
neither
nonbeing
nor
is

neither

neither

draws
this
conclusion
that
either
there
is
nothing
excepting
god
or
all
else
is
eternal
we
here
see
a
dialectic
which
may
be
called
metaphysical
reasoning
in
which
the
principle
of
identity
is
fundamental
the
nothing
is
like
nothing
and
does
not
pass
into
being
or
conversely
thus
nothing
can
originate
from
like
this
the
oldest
mode
of
argument
holds
its
place
even
to
the
present
day
as
for
example
in
the
socalled
proof
of
the
unity
of
god
this
proceeding
consists
of
making
presuppositions
such
as
the
power
of
god
and
from
them
drawing
conclusions
and
denying
the
existence
of
predicates
that
is
the
usual
course
in
our
mode
of
reasoning
in
respect
of
determinations
it
must
be
remarked
that
they
as
being
negative
are
all
kept
apart
from
the
positive
and
merely
real
being
we
reach
this
abstraction
by
a
more
ordinary
way
and
do
not
require
a
dialectic
such
as
that
of
the
eleatic
school
we
say
god
is
unchangeable
change
concerns
finite
things
alone
which
we
represent
as
an
empirical
proposition
on
the
one
hand
we
thus
have
finite
things
and
change
and
on
the
other
unchangeableness
in
this
abstract
absolute
unity
with
itself
it
is
the
same
separation
only
that
we
also
allow
the
finite
to
be
being
which
the
eleatics
deny
or
else
we
too
proceed
from
finite
things
to
kinds
and
genera
leaving
the
negative
out
bit
by
bit
and
the
highest
order
of
all
is
god
who
as
the
highest
being
is
affirmative
only
but
devoid
of
any
determination
or
we
pass
from
what
is
finite
to
the
infinite
for
we
say
that
the
finite
as
limited
must
have
its
basis
in
the
infinite
in
all
these
different
forms
which
are
quite
familiar
to
us
there
is
the
same
difficult
question
which
exists
in
reference
to
the
eleatic
thought
whence
comes
determination
and
how
is
it
to
be
graspedhow
is
it
in
the
one
leaving
the
finite
aside
and
also
how
does
the
infinite
pass
out
into
the
finite
the
eleatics
in
their
reflections
were
distinguished
from
this
our
ordinary
reflecting
thought
in
that
they
went
speculatively
to
work
the
speculative
element
being
that
change
does
not
exist
at
all
and
that
they
thus
showed
that
as
being
was
presupposed
change
in
itself
is
contradictory
and
inconceivable
for
from
the
one
from
being
the
determination
of
the
negative
of
the
manifold
is
withdrawn
thus
while
we
in
our
conception
allow
the
actuality
of
the
finite
world
the
eleatics
are
more
consistent
in
that
they
proceeded
to
say
that
only
the
one
exists
and
that
the
negative
does
not
exist
at
alla
consequence
which
if
it
necessarily
arouses
in
us
surprise
still
none
the
less
remains
a
great
abstraction
sceptics
saw
in

point

such
as
these
no
man
at

knew

he
ever
know

sextus
generalizing
explains
this
in
the
first
passage
thus
let
us
imagine
that
in
a
house
in
which
are
many
valuables
there
were
those
who
sought
for
gold
by
night
in
such
a
case
everyone
would
think
that
he
had
found
the
gold
but
would
not
know
certainly
whether
he
actually
had
found
it
thus
philosophers
come
into
this
world
as
into
a
great
house
to
seek
the
truth
but
were
they
to
reach
it
they
could
not
tell
whether
they
really
had
attained
to
it
the
indefinite
expressions
of
xenophanes
might
also
merely
mean
that
none
knows
that
which
he
xenophanes
here
makes
known
in
the
second
passage
sextus
puts
it
thus
xenophanes
does
not
make
all
knowledge
void
but
only
the
scientific
and
infallible
opinionative
knowledge
is
however
left
he
expresses
this
in
saying
that
opinion
cleaves
to
all
so
that
with
him
the
criterion
is
made
to
be
opinion
ie
the
apparent
and
not
that
which
is
firm
and
sure
parmenides
on
the
contrary
condemns
opinion
but
from
his
doctrine
of
the
one
there
follows
the
annihilation
of
ordinary
ideas
which
is
what
he
did
in
the
foregoing
dialectic
it
is
evident
however
that
nobody
could
know
the
truth
which
he
hereby
utters
if
a
thought
such
as
this
passed
through
ones
head
one
could
not
tell
that
it
was
true
and
in
such
a
case
it
would
only
be
an
opinion
we
here
find
in
xenophanes
a
double
consciousness
a
pure
consciousness
and
consciousness
of
being
and
a
consciousness
of
opinion
the
former
was
to
him
the
consciousness
of
the
divine
and
it
is
the
pure
dialectic
which
is
negatively
related
to
all
that
is
determined
and
which
annuls
it

manner

parmenides
is
a
striking
figure
in
the
eleatic
school
and
he
arrives
at
more
definite
conceptions
than
does
xenophanes
he
was
according
to
diogenes
ix
21
born
at
elea
of
a
rich
and
honourable
race
of
his
life
however
little
is
known
aristotle
only
says

that
he
was

scholar

calls
him
a
friend

of
xenophanes
diogenes
laertius
further
states
he
heard
anaximander
and
xenophanes
also
but
did
not
follow
the
latter
which
seems
only
to
refer
to
his
place
of
abode
but
he
lived
with
aminias
and
diochartes
the
pythagorean
attached
himself
to
the
latter
and
by
the
former
and
not
by
xenophanes
was
prevailed
upon
to
lead
a
quiet
life
that
the
period
in
which
his
life
falls
comes
between
xenophanes
and
zenoso
that
he
is
contemporaneous
with
them
though
younger
than
the
former
and
older
than
the
latteris
ascertained
according
to

he
flourished
about
the
69th

what
is
most
important
is
his
journey
to
athens
with
zeno
where
plato
makes
them
talk
with
socrates
this
may
be
accepted
generally
but
what
is
strictly
historical
in
it
cannot
be
ascertained
in
the
thtetus
plato
makes
socrates
reply
to
the
invitation
to
examine
the
eleatic
system
for
melissus
and
the
others
who
assert
the
all
to
be
one
at
rest
i
have
a
certain
respect
i
have
even
more
for
parmenides
for
to
speak
in
homeric
language
he
seems
to
me
both
venerable
and
strong
i
knew
him
when
he
was
an
old
man
and
i
was
still
quite
young
and
i
heard
wonderful
things
from
him52
and
in
the
platonic
dialogue
parmenides
p

where
as
is
well
known
the
conversation
is
carried
on
by

and
socrates
the
historic
circumstances
of
this
interview
are
related
in
detail
parmenides
was
very
old
had
hair
which
was
quite
grey
was
beautiful
in
countenance
about
sixtyfive
years
old

places
the
journey
in
the
80th

bc
thus
socrates
since
he
was
born
in
olympiad
77
4
469
bc
would
seem
to
have
been
still
too
young
to
have
carried
on
a
dialogue
such
as
plato
describes
and
the
principal
matter
of
this
dialogue
which
is
written
in
the
spirit
of
the
eleatic
school
belongs
to
plato
himself
besides
we
know
from
parmenides
life
that
he
stood
in
high
respect
with
his
fellowcitizens
at
elea
whose
prosperity
must
be
chiefly
ascribed
to
the
laws
which
parmenides
gave
them53
we
also
find
in
the

of
cebes
towards
the
beginning
a
parmenidian
life
used
synonymously
with
a
moral
life
it
must
be
remarked
that
here
where
the
eleatic
school
is
definitely
treated
of
plato
does
not
speak
of
xenophanes
at
all
but
only
of
melissus
and
parmenides
the
fact
that
plato
in
one
of
his
dialogues
likewise
accords
the
chief
part
to
parmenides
and
puts
in
his
mouth
the
most
lofty
dialectic
that
ever
was
given
does
not
concern
us
here
if
with
xenophanes
by
the
proposition
that
out
of
nothing
nothing
comes
origination
and
what
depends
upon
or
can
be
traced
back
to
it
is
denied
the
opposition
between
being
and
nonbeing
makes
its
appearance
still
more
clearly
with
parmenides
though
still
unconsciously
sextus
empiricus
and
simplicius
have
preserved
to
us
the
most
important
fragments
from
the
poems
of
parmenides
for
parmenides

propounded

majestic
it
is
written
after
the
manner
of
the
times

in
it

there
is
an
energetic
impetuous
soul
which
strives
with

the

are
the
two
roads
of

the
one
which

the
other
that

which

i
must
tell
you
a
path
quite
devoid

thou

neither

the
way

the

wander

to
confuse
them

to
ascribe
the

to

to
distinguish

but
the
truth
is
only
the
is
this
is
neither
begotten
of
anything

nor

entire
alone
in

without

thou
seek

thee
neither

neither
can
it
be

thought
that
the
is
is
not
what
necessity
had
either
later
or
earlier
made
it
begin
from
the
nothing
thus
must
it
throughout
only
be
or
not
be
nor
will
any
force
of
conviction
ever
make
something
else
arise
out
of
that
which
is
not
thus
origination
has
disappeared
and
decease
is
incredible
being
is
not
separable
for
it
is
entirely
like
itself
it
is
nowhere
more
else
would
it
not
hold
together
nor
is
it
less
for
everything
is
full
of
being
the
all
is
one
coherent
whole
for
being
flows
into
unison
with
being
it
is
unchangeable
and
rests
securely
in
itself
the
force
of
necessity
holds
it
within
the
bounds
of
limitation
it
cannot
hence
be
said
that
it
is
imperfect
for
it
is
without
defect
while
nonexistence
is
wanting
in
all
this
being
is
not
the
undetermined

for
it
is
kept
within
the
limits
of
necessity
we
similarly
find
in
aristotle
that
limitation
is
ascribed
to
parmenides
the
sense
in
which
the
expression
limit
is
to
be
taken
is
uncertain
according
to
parmenides
however
this
absolute
limitation
is
as

absolute
necessity
clearly
determined
in
itself
and
it
is
an
important
fact
that
he
went
beyond
the
uncultured
conception
of
the
infinite
thought
and
that
on
account
of
which
thought
is
are
the
same
for
not
without
that
which
is
in
which
it
expresses
itself




wilt
thou
find
thought
seeing
that
it
is
nothing
and
will
be
nothing
outside
of
that
which
is
that
is
the
main
point
thought
produces
itself
and
what
is
produced
is
a
thought
thought
is
thus
identical
with
being
for
there
is
nothing
beside
being
this
great
affirmation
plotinus
in
quoting
v
ennead
i
8
this
last
fragment
says
parmenides
adopted
this
point
of
view
inasmuch
as
he
did
not
place
being
in
sensuous
things
identifying
being
with
thought
he
maintained
it
to
be
unchangeable
the
sophists
concluded
from
this
all
is
truth
there
is
no
error
for
error
is
the
nonexistent
that
which
is
not
to
be
thought
since
in
this
an
advance
into
the
region
of
the
ideal
is
observable
parmenides
began
philosophy
proper
a
man
now
constitutes
himself
free
from
all
ideas
and
opinions
denies
their
truth
and
says
necessity
alone
being
is
the
truth
this
beginning
is
certainly
still
dim
and
indefinite
and
we
cannot
say
much
of
what
it
involves
but
to
take
up
this
position
certainly
is
to
develop
philosophy
proper
which
has
not
hitherto
existed
the
dialectic
that
the
transient
has

we
have
further
metaphorical
images
from
parmenides
since
the
utmost
limit
of
being
is
perfect
it
resembles
on
every
side
the
form
of
a
well
rounded
sphere
which
from
its
centre
extends
in
all
directions
equally
for
it
can
be
neither
larger
or
smaller
in
one
part
or
another
there
is
no
nonbeing
which
prevents
it
from
attaining
to
the
likefrom
coming
into
unity
with
itselfand
there
is
no
being
where
it
was
devoid
of
being
here
more
and
there
less
because
the
all
is
without
defect
it
is
in
all
places
in
the
same
way
like
itself
in
its
determinations
plotinus
in
the
passage
quoted
says
he
compares
being
with
the
spherical
form
because
it
comprehends
all
in
itself
and
thought
is
not
outside
of
this
but
is
contained
in
it
and
simplicius
says
we
must
not
wonder
at
him
for
on
account
of
the
poetic
form
he
adopts
a
mythological
fiction

it
immediately
strikes
us
that
the
sphere
is
limited
and
furthermore
in
space
and
hence
another
must
be
above
it
but
then
the
notion
of
the
sphere
is
the
similarity
of
withholding
the
different
notwithstanding
that
even
the
undifferentiated
must
be
expressed
hence
this
image
is
inconsistent

this
doctrine

men
have
two

of

one
of
which
should
not

in

they
are

they

them

the

the

identical

throughout

not
identical
with
the
other
for
that
is
also
for
itself
on
the

there
is
what

aristotle

i

and
the
other
historians
likewise
unanimously
attribute
to
parmenides
the
fact
that
he
sets
forth
two
principles
for
the
system
of
manifest
things
warmth
and
cold
through
the
union
of
which
everything
is
light
fire
is
the
active
and
animate
night
cold
is
called

passive
parmenides
also
speaks
like
a
pythagoreanhe
was
called


by
straboin
the
following
and
likewise
mythological
conception
there
are
circlets
wound
round
one
another
one
of
which
is
of
the
rare
element
and
the
other
of
the
dense
between
which
others
are
to
be
found
composed
of
light
and
darkness
mingled
those
which
are
less
are
of
impure
fire
but
those
over
them
of
night
through
which
proceed
the
forces
of
the
flames
that
which
holds
this
all
together
however
is
something
fixed
like
a
wall
under
which
there
is
a
fiery
wreath
and
the
most
central
of
the
rare
spheres
again
is
fiery
the
most
central
of
those
mixed
is
the
goddess
that
reigns
over
all
the
divider

dice
and
necessity
for
she
is
the
principle
of
all
earthly
produce
and
intermingling
which
impels
the
male
to
mix
with
the
female

conversely

mingled
c54
it
still
remains
to
us
to
explain
the
manner
in
which
parmenides
regarded
sensation
and
thought
which
may
undoubtedly
at
first
sight
seem
to
be
materialistic
theophrastus55
for
example

in
this
regard
parmenides
said
nothing
more
than
that
there
are
two
elements
knowledge
is
determined
according
to
the
preponderance
of
the
one
or
of
the
other
for
according
as
warmth
or
cold
predominate
thought
varies
it
becomes
better
and
purer
through
warmth
and
yet
it
requires
also
a
certain
balance
for
as
in
each
man
there
still
is
in
his
dispersive
limbs
an
intermingling
so
is
the
understanding
of
man
for
that
which
is
thought
by
men
is
the
nature
of
the
limbs
both
in
one
and
all
for
thought
is
indeed
the
most56
he
thus
takes
sensation
and
thought
to
be
the
same
and
makes
remembrance
and
oblivion
to
arise
from
these
through
mingling
them
but
whether
in
the
intermingling
they
take
an
equal
place
whether
this
is
thought
or
not
and
what
condition
this
is
he
leaves
quite
undetermined
but
that
he
ascribes
sensation
to
the
opposites
in
and
for
themselves
is
clear
because
he
says
the
dead
do
not
feel
light
or
warmth
or
hear
voices
because
the
fire
is
out
of
them
they
feel
cold
stillness
and
the
opposite
however
and
speaking
generally
each
existence
has
a
certain
knowledge
in
fact
this
view
of
parmenides
is
really
the
opposite
of
materialism
for
materialism
consists
in
putting
together
the
soul
from
parts
or
independent
forces

the

it

of
him
that
he
associated
with

he
was
born
in

was

in

to

too
there
is

to

him

with

has
preserved
several
fragments
of
his
prose
writings
on
nature
which
show
the
same
kind
of
thoughts
and
arguments
as
we
find
in
parmenides
but
in
part
somewhat
more
developed
it
was
a
question
whether
the
reasoning
in
which
it
is
shown
that
change
does
not
exist
or
contradicts
itself
which
by
aristotle
in
his
incomplete
and
in
some
parts
most
corrupt
work
on
xenophanes
zeno
and
gorgias
c
2
was
ascribed
to
xenophanes
did
not
really
belong
to
melissus57
since
the
beginning
in
which
we
are
told
whose
reasoning
it
is
is
wanting
conjecture
only
applies
it
to
xenophanes
the
writing
begins
with
the
words
he
says
without
any
name
being
given
it
thus
depends
on
the
superscription
alone
whether
aristotle
speaks
of
the
philosophy
of
xenophanes
or
not
and
it
must
be
noticed
that
different
hands
have
put
different
superscriptions
indeed
there
is
in
this
work
c
2
an
opinion
of
xenophanes
mentioned
in
such
a
way
that
it
appears
as
though
had
what
was
previously
quoted
by
aristotle
been
by
him
ascribed
to
xenophanes
the
expression
would
have
been
different
it
is
possible
that
zeno
is
meant
as
the
internal
evidence
abundantly
shows
there
is
in
it
a
dialectic
more
developed
in
form
more
real
reflexion
than
from
the
verses
could
be
expected
not
from
xenophanes
alone
but
even
from
parmenides
for
aristotle
expressly
says
that
xenophanes
does
not
yet
determine
with
precision
thus
the
cultured
reasoning
contained
in
aristotle
must
certainly
be
denied
to
xenophanes
at
least
it
is
so
far
certain
that
xenophanes
himself
did
not
know
how
to
express
his
thoughts
in
a
manner
so
orderly
and
precise
as
that
found
here
we
find
it
said
if
anything
is
it
is
eternal

eternity
is
an
awkward
word
for
it
immediately
makes
us
think
of
time
and
mingle
past
and
future
as
an
infinite
length
of
time
but
what
is
meant
is
that

is
the
selfidentical
supersensuous
unchangeable
pure
present
which
is
without
any
timeconception
it
is
origination
and
change
are
shut
out
if
it
commences
it
does
so
out
of
nothing
or
out
of
being
it
is
impossible
that
anything
should
arise
from
the
nothing
if
everything
could
have
arisen
or
could
it
merely
not
have
been
everything
eternally
it
would
equally
have
arisen
out
of
nothing
for
if
everything
had
arisen
nothing
would
once
have
existed
if
some
were
alone
the
existent
out
of
which
the
rest
sprang
the
one
would
be
more
and
greater
but
the
more
and
greater
would
thus
have
arisen
out
of
the
nothing
of
itself
for
in
the
less
there
is
not
its
more
nor
in
the
smaller
its
greater
simplicius
makes
this
note
to
the
physics
of
aristotle
p
22
b
no
more
can
anything
arise
out
of
the
existent
for
the
existent
already
is
and
thus
does
not
first
arise
from
the
existent
as
eternal
the
existent
also
is
unlimited
since
it
has
no
beginning
from
which
it
came
nor
end
in
which
it
ceases
the
infinite
all
is
one
for
if
there
were
two
or
more
they
would
limit
one
another
and
thus
have
a
beginning
and
end
the
one
would
be
the
nothing
of
the
other
and
come
forth
from
this
nothing
this
one
is
like
itself
for
if
it
were
unlike
it
would
no
longer
be
the
one
that
was
posited
but
many
this
one
is
likewise
immovable
inasmuch
as
it
does
not
move
itself
since
it
does
not
pass
out
into
anything
in
passing
out
it
would
require
to
do
so
into
what
is
full
or
what
is
empty
it
could
not
be
into
the
full
for
that
is
an
impossibility
and
just
as
little
could
it
be
into
what
is
empty
for
that
is
the
nothing
the
one
therefore
is
in
this
way
devoid
of
pain
or
suffering
not
changing
in
position
or
form
or
mingling
with
what
is
different
for
all
these
determinations
involve
the
origination
of
nonbeing
and
passing
away
of
being
which
is
impossible
thus
here
again
the
contradiction
which
takes
place
when
origination
and
passing
away
are
spoken
of
is
revealed
now
melissus
places
opinion
in
opposition
to
this
truth
the
change
and
multiplicity
extinguished
in
being
appears
on
the
other
side
in
consciousness
as
in
what
is
opinionative
it
is
necessary
to
say
this
if
only
the
negative
side
the
removal
of
these
moments
the
absolute
as
destitute
of
predicate
is
laid
hold
of
in
sensuous
perception
the
opposite
is
present
for
us
that
is
to
say
a
number
of
things
their
change
their
origination
and
passing
away
and
their
intermingling
thus
that
first
knowledge
must
take
its
place
beside
this
second
which
has
as
much
certainty
for
ordinary
consciousness
as
the
first
melissus
does
not
seem
to
have
decided
for
the
one
or
the
other
but
oscillating
between
both
to
have
limited
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
to
the
statement
that
speaking
generally
between
two
opposite
modes
of
presentation
the
more
probable
opinion
is
to
be
preferred
but
that
what
is
so
preferred
is
only
to
be
regarded
as
the
stronger
opinion
and
not
as
truth
this
is
what
aristotle
says
of
him
since
aristotle
in
distinguishing
his
philosophy
from
the
philosophy
of
parmenides
maintains
that
in
the
first
place
parmenides
seems
to
understand
the
one
as
the
principle
of
thought
and
melissus
as
matter
we
must
remark
that
this
distinction
falls
away
in
pure
existence
being
or
the
one
pure
matter
as
also
pure
thought
if
i
am
to
speak
of
such
a
distinction
are
not
present
to
parmenides
and
melissus
since
they
are
abrogated
and
it
must
only
be
in
the
manner
of
his
expression
that
one
of
themaccording
to
aristotle
phys
i
2
on
account
of
his
clumsier
mode
of
treatment

could
seem
to
have
conceived
of
the
other
sense
if
the
difference
consisted
secondly
in
the
fact
that
parmenides
regarded
the
one
as
limited
and
melissus
as
unlimited
this
limitation
of
the
one
would
in
effect
immediately
contradict
the
philosophy
of
parmenides
for
since
limit
is
the
nonbeing
of
being
nonbeing
would
thus
be
posited
but
when
parmenides
speaks
of
limit
we
see
that
his
poetic
language
is
not
altogether
exact
limit
however
as
pure
limit
is
just
simple
being
and
absolute
negativity
in
which
all
else
said
and
set
forth
is
sublated
necessity
as
this
pure
negativity
and
movement
within
itself
although
impassive
thought
is
absolutely
bound
to
its
opposite
in
the
third
place
it
may
be
said
that
parmenides
set
forth
a
concomitant
philosophy
of
opinion
or
reality
to
which
being
as
existence
for
thought
was
thus
more
opposed
than
was
the
case
with
melissus

zeno
what
specially
characterizes
zeno
is
the
dialectic
which
properly
speaking
begins
with
him
he
is
the
master
of
the
eleatic
school
in
whom
its
pure
thought
arrives
at
the
movement
of
the
notion
in
itself
and
becomes
the
pure
soul
of
science
that
is
to
say
in
the
eleatics
hitherto
considered
we
only
have
the
proposition
the
nothing
has
no
reality
and
is
not
at
all
and
thus
what
is
called
origin
and
decease
disappears
with
zeno
on
the
contrary
we
certainly
see
just
such
an
assertion
of
the
one
and
removal
of
what
contradicts
it
but
we
also
see
that
this
assertion
is
not
made
the
starting
point
for
reason
begins
by
calmly
demonstrating
in
that
which
is
established
as
existent
its
negation
parmenides
asserts
that
the
all
is
immutable
for
in
change
the
nonbeing
of
that
which
is
would
be
asserted
but
being
only
is
in
saying
that
nonbeing
is
the
subject
and
the
predicate
contradict
themselves
zeno
on
the
other
hand
says
assert
your
change
in
it
as
change
there
is
the
negation
to
it
or
it
is
nothing
to
the
former
change
existed
as
motion
definite
and
complete
zeno
protested
against
motion
as
such
or
pure
motion
pure
being
is
not
motion
it
is
rather
the
negation
of
motion
we
find
it
specially
interesting
that
there
is
in
zeno
the
higher
consciousness
the
consciousness
that
when
one
determination
is
denied
this
negation
is
itself
again
a
determination
and
then
in
the
absolute
negation
not
one
determination
but
both
the
opposites
must
be
negated
zeno
anticipated
this
and
because
he
foresaw
that
being
is
the
opposite
of
nothing
he
denied
of
the
one
what
must
be
said
of
the
nothing
but
the
same
thing
must
occur
with
all
the
rest
we
find
this
higher
dialectic
in
platos
parmenides
here
it
only
breaks
forth
in
respect
to
some
determinations
and
not
to
the
determination
of
the
one
and
of
being
the
higher
consciousness
is
the
consciousness
of
the
nullity
of
being
as
of
what
is
determined
as
against
the
nothing
partly
found
in
heraclitus
and
then
in
the
sophists
with
them
it
never
has
any
truth
it
has
no
existence
in
itself
but
is
only
the
foranother
or
the
assurance
of
the
individual
consciousness
and
assurance
as
refutation

is
the
youngest
and
lived
most
in
company
with

the
latter
became
very
fond
of
him

adopted
him
as
a

his

and
he
was
esteemed
particularly
as
a

plato
mentions
that
men
came
to
him
from
athens
and
other
places
in
order
to
profit
from
his
learning58
proud
selfsufficiency
is
ascribed
to
him
by
diogenes
ix

because
hewith

various

for

for
the

in

that

freed

the

is
given
differently
but
an
exact
historical
account
has
not
been
recorded
in
the
following
way
and
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
he
entered
into
a
plot
to
overthrow
the
tyrant
but
this
was
betrayed
when
the
tyrant
now
in
face
of
the
people
caused
him
to
be
tortured
in
every
possible
way
to
get
from
him
an
avowal
of
his
confederates
and
when
he
questioned
him
about
the
enemies
of
the
state
zeno
first
named
to
the
tyrant
all
his
friends
as
participators
in
the
plot
and
then
spoke
of
the
tyrant
himself
as
the
pest
of
the
state
the
powerful
remonstrances
or
the
horrible
tortures
and
death
of
zeno
aroused
the
citizens
inspired
them
with
courage
to
fall
upon
the
tyrant
kill
him
and
liberate
themselves
the
manner
of
the
end
and
his
violent
and
furious
state
of
mind
is
very
variously
depicted
he
is
said
to
have
pretended
to
wish
to
say
something
into
the
tyrants
ear
and
then
to
have
bitten
his
ear
and
thus
held
him
fast
until
he
was
slain
by
the
others
others
say
that
he
seized
him
by
the
nose
between
his
teeth
others
that
as
on
his
reply
great
tortures
were
applied
he
bit
off
his
tongue
and
spat
it
into
the
tyrants
face
to
show
him
that
he
could
get
nothing
from
him
and
that
he
then
was
pounded
in
a
mortar59
it
has
just
been
noticed
that
zeno
had
the
very
important
character
of
being
the
originator
of
the
true
objective
dialectic
xenophanes
parmenides
and
melissus
start
with
the
proposition
nothing
is
nothing
the
nothing
does
not
exist
at
all
or
the
like
is
real
existence
that
is
they
make
one
of
the
opposed
predicates
to
be
existence
now
when
they
encounter
the
opposite
in
a
determination
they
demolish
this
determination
but
it
is
only
demolished
through
another
through
my
assertion
through
the
distinction
that
i
form
by
which
one
side
is
made
to
be
the
true
and
the
other
the
null
we
have
proceeded
from
a
definite
proposition
the
nullity
of
the
opposite
does
not
appear
in
itself
it
is
not
that
it
abrogates
itself
ie
that
it
contains
a
contradiction
in
itself
for
instance
i
assert
of
something
that
it
is
the
null
then
i
show
this
by
hypothesis
in
motion
and
it
follows
that
it
is
the
null
but
another
consciousness
does
not
assert
this
i
declare
one
thing
to
be
directly
true
another
has
the
right
of
asserting
something
else
as
directly
true
that
is
to
say
motion
similarly
what
seems
to
be
the
case
when
one
philosophic
system
contradicts
another
is
that
the
first
is
preestablished
and
that
men
starting
from
this
point
of
view
combat
the
other
the
matter
is
thus
easily
settled
by
saying
the
other
has
no
truth
because
it
does
not
agree
with
me
and
the
other
has
the
right
to
say
the
same
it
does
not
help
if
i
prove
my
system
or
my
proposition
and
then
conclude
that
thus
the
opposite
is
false
to
this
other
proposition
the
first
always
seems
to
be
foreign
and
external
falsity
must
not
be
demonstrated
through
another
and
as
untrue
because
the
opposite
is
true
but
in
itself
we
find
this
rational
perception
in
zeno
in

this
dialectic
is
very
well
described
for
plato
makes
socrates
say
of
it
zeno
in
his
writings
asserts
fundamentally
the
same
as
does
parmenides
that
all
is
one
but
he
would
feign
delude
us
into
believing
that
he
was
telling
something
new
parmenides
thus
shows
in
his
poems
that
all
is
one
zeno
on
the
contrary
shows
that
the
many
cannot
be
zeno
replies
that
he
wrote
thus
really
against
those
who
try
to
make
parmenides
position
ridiculous
for
they
try
to
show
what
absurdities
and
selfcontradictions
can
be
derived
from
his
statements
he
thus
combats
those
who
deduce
being
from
the
many
in
order
to
show
that
far
more
absurdities
arise
from
this
than
from
the
statements
of
parmenides
that
is
the
special
aim
of
objective
dialectic
in
which
we
no
longer
maintain
simple
thought
for
itself
but
see
the
battle
fought
with
new
vigour
within
the
enemys
camp
dialectic
has
in
zeno
this
negative
side
but
it
has
also
to
be
considered
from
its
positive
side
according
to
the
ordinary
ideas
of
science
where
propositions
result
from
proof
proof
is
the
movement
of
intelligence
a
connection
brought
about
by
mediation
dialectic
is
either

external
dialectic
in
which
this
movement
is
different
from
the
comprehension
of
the
movement
or

not
a
movement
of
our
intelligence
only
but
what
proceeds
from
the
nature
of
the
thing
itself
ie
from
the
pure
notion
of
the
content
the
former
is
a
manner
of
regarding
objects
in
such
a
way
that
reasons
are
revealed
and
new
light
thrown
by
means
of
which
all
that
was
supposed
to
be
firmly
fixed
is
made
to
totter
there
may
be
reasons
which
are
altogether
external
too
and
we
shall
speak
further
of
this
dialectic
when
dealing
with
the
sophists
the
other
dialectic
however
is
the
immanent
contemplation
of
the
object
it
is
taken
for
itself
without
previous
hypothesis
idea
or
obligation
not
under
any
outward
conditions
laws
or
causes
we
have
to
put
ourselves
right
into
the
thing
to
consider
the
object
in
itself
and
to
take
it
in
the
determinations
which
it
has
in
regarding
it
thus
it
shows
from
itself
that
it
contains
opposed
determinations
and
thus
breaks
up
this
dialectic
we
more
especially
find
in
the
ancients
the
subjective
dialectic
which
reasons
from
external
grounds
is
moderate
for
it
grants
that
in
the
right
there
is
what
is
not
right
and
in
the
false
the
true
true
dialectic
leaves
nothing
whatever
to
its
object
as
if
the
latter
were
deficient
on
one
side
only
for
it
disintegrates
itself
in
the
entirety
of
its
nature
the
result
of
this
dialectic
is
null
the
negative
the
affirmative
in
it
does
not
yet
appear
this
true
dialectic
may
be
associated
with
the
work
of
the
eleatics
but
in
their
case
the
real
meaning
and
quality
of
philosophic
understanding
was
not
great
for
they
got
no
further
than
the
fact
that
through
contradiction
the
object
is
a
nothing
zenos
dialectic
of
matter
has
not
been
refuted
to
the
present
day
even
now
we
have
not
got
beyond
it
and
the
matter
is
left
in
uncertainty
simplicius
writing
on
the
physics
of
aristotle
p
30
says
zeno
proves
that
if
the
many
is
it
must
be
great
and
small
if
great
the
many
must
be
infinite
in
number
it
must
have
gone
beyond
the
manifold
as
indifferent
limit
into
the
infinite
but
what
is
infinite
is
no
longer
large
and
no
longer
many
for
it
is
the
negation
of
the
many
if
small
it
must
be
so
small
as
to
have
no
size
like
atoms
here
he
shows
that
what
has
neither
size
thickness
nor
mass
cannot
be
for
if
it
were
added
to
another
it
would
not
cause
its
increase
were
it
that
is
to
say
to
have
no
size
and
be
added
thereto
it
could
not
supplement
the
size
of
the
other
and
consequently
that
which
is
added
is
nothing
similarly
were
it
taken
away
the
other
would
not
be
made
less
and
thus
it
is
nothing
if
what
has
being
is
each
existence
necessarily
has
size
and
thickness
is
outside
of
one
another
and
one
is
separate
from
the
other
the
same
applies
to
all
else



for
it
too
has
size
and
in
it
there
is
what
mutually
differs



but
it
is
the
same
thing
to
say
something
once
and
to
say
it
over
and
over
again
in
it
nothing
can
be
a
last
nor
will
there
not
be
another
to
the
other
thus
if
many
are
they
are
small
and
great
small
so
that
they
have
no
size
great
so
that
they
are
infinite

all
objectively
dialectical
but
the
particulars
which
we
find
in
the
parmenides
of
plato
are
not
his
for
zenos
consciousness
we
see
simple
unmoved
thought
disappear
but
become
thinking
movement
in
that
he
combats
sensuous
movement
he
concedes
it
the
reason
that
dialectic
first
fell
on
movement
is
that
the
dialectic
is
itself
this
movement
or
movement
itself
the
dialectic
of
all
that
is
the
thing
as
selfmoving
has
its
dialectic
in
itself
and
movement
is
the
becoming
another
selfabrogation
if
aristotle
says
that
zeno
denied
movement
because
it
contains
an
inner
contradiction
it
is
not
to
be
understood
to
mean
that
movement
did
not
exist
at
all
the
point
is
not
that
there
is
movement
and
that
this
phenomenon
exists
the
fact
that
there
is
movement
is
as
sensuously
certain
as
that
there
are
elephants
it
is
not
in
this
sense
that
zeno
meant
to
deny
movement
the
point
in
question
concerns
its
truth
movement
however
is
held
to
be
untrue
because
the
conception
of
it
involves
a
contradiction
by
that
he
meant
to
say
that
no
true
being
can
be
predicated
of
it
zenos
utterances
are
to
be
looked
at
from
this
point
of
view
not
as
being
directed
against
the
reality
of
motion
as
would
at
first
appear
but
as
pointing
out
how
movement
must
necessarily
be
determined
and
showing
the
course
which
must
be
taken
zeno
now
brings
forward
four
different
arguments
against
motion
the
proofs
rest
on
the
infinite
divisibility
of
space
and
time
a
this
is
his
first
form
of
argumentmovement
has
no
truth
because
what
is
in
motion
must
first
reach
the
middle
of
the
space
before
arriving
at
the
end
aristotle
expresses
this
thus
shortly
because
he
had
earlier
treated
of
and
worked
out
the
subject
at
length
this
is
to
be
taken
as
indicating
generally
that
the
continuity
of
space
is
presupposed
what
moves
itself
must
reach
a
certain
end
this
way
is
a
whole
in
order
to
traverse
the
whole
what
is
in
motion
must
first
pass
over
the
half
and
now
the
end
of
this
half
is
considered
as
being
the
end
but
this
half
of
space
is
again
a
whole
that
which
also
has
a
half
and
the
half
of
this
half
must
first
have
been
reached
and
so
on
into
infinity
zeno
here
arrives
at
the
infinite
divisibility
of
space
because
space
and
time
are
absolutely
continuous
there
is
no
point
at
which
the
division
can
stop
every
dimension
and
every
time
and
space
always
have
a
dimension
is
again
divisible
into
two
halves
which
must
be
measured
off
and
however
small
a
space
we
have
the
same
conditions
reappear
movement
would
be
the
act
of
passing
through
these
infinite
moments
and
would
therefore
never
end
thus
what
is
in
motion
cannot
reach
its
end
it
is
known
how
diogenes
of
sinope
the
cynic
quite
simply
refuted
these
arguments
against
movement
without
speaking
he
rose
and
walked
about
contradicting
them
by
action60
but
when
reasons
are
disputed
the
only
valid
refutation
is
one
derived
from
reasons
men
have
not
merely
to
satisfy
themselves
by
sensuous
assurance
but
also
to
understand
to
refute
objections
is
to
prove
their
nonexistence
as
when
they
are
made
to
fall
away
and
can
hence
be
adduced
no
longer
but
it
is
necessary
to
think
of
motion
as
zeno
thought
of
it
and
yet
to
carry
this
theory
of
motion
further
still
we
have
here
the
spurious
infinite
or
pure
appearance
whose
simple
principle
philosophy
demonstrates
as
universal
notion
for
the
first
time
making
its
appearance
as
developed
in
its
contradiction
in
the
history
of
philosophy
a
consciousness
of
this
contradiction
is
also
attained
movement
this
pure
phenomenon
appears
as
something
thought
and
shown
forth
in
its
real
beingthat
is
in
its
distinction
of
pure
selfidentity
and
pure
negativity
the
point
as
distinguished
from
continuity
to
us
there
is
no
contradiction
in
the
idea
that
the
here
of
space
and
the
now
of
time
are
considered
as
a
continuity
and
length
but
their
notion
is
selfcontradictory
selfidentity
or
continuity
is
absolute
cohesion
the
destruction
of
all
difference
of
all
negation
of
being
for
self
the
point
on
the
contrary
is
pure
beingforself
absolute
selfdistinction
and
the
destruction
of
all
identity
and
all
connection
with
what
is
different
both
of
these
however
are
in
space
and
time
placed
in
one
space
and
time
are
thus
the
contradiction
it
is
necessary
first
of
all
to
show
the
contradiction
in
movement
for
in
movement
that
which
is
opposed
is
to
ordinary
conceptions
inevitably
manifested
movement
is
just
the
reality
of
time
and
space
and
because
this
appears
and
is
made
manifest
the
apparent
contradiction
is
demonstrated
and
it
is
this
contradiction
that
zeno
notices
the
limitation
of
bisection
which
is
involved
in
the
continuity
of
space
is
not
absolute
limitation
for
that
which
is
limited
is
again
continuity
however
this
continuity
is
again
not
absolute
for
the
opposite
has
to
be
exhibited
in
it
the
limitation
of
bisection
but
the
limitation
of
continuity
is
still
not
thereby
established
the
half
is
still
continuous
and
so
on
into
infinity
in
that
we
say
into
infinity
we
place
before
ourselves
a
beyond
outside
of
the
ordinary
conception
which
cannot
reach
so
far
it
is
certainly
an
endless
going
forth
but
in
the
notion
it
is
present
it
is
a
progression
from
one
opposed
determination
to
others
from
continuity
to
negativity
from
negativity
to
continuity
but
both
of
these
are
before
us
of
these
moments
one
in
the
process
may
be
called
the
true
one
zeno
first
asserts
continuous
progression
in
such
a
way
that
no
limited
space
can
be
arrived
at
as
ultimate
or
zeno
upholds
progression
in
this
limitation
the
general
explanation
which
aristotle
gives
to
this
contradiction
is
that
space
and
time
are
not
infinitely
divided
but
are
only
divisible
but
it
now
appears
that
because
they
are
divisiblethat
is
in
potentialitythey
must
actually
be
infinitely
divided
for
else
they
could
not
be
divided
into
infinity
that
is
the
general
answer
of
the
ordinary
man
in
endeavouring
to
refute
the
explanation
of
aristotle

that

well
as
negativity
or
the

as

not
as

i
can
divide

into
infinitude
but
i
only
can
do
so
i
do
not
really
divide
it
into
infinitude
this
is
the
infinite
that
no
one
of
its
moments
has
reality
it
never
does
happen
that
in

there

they
are

ie
in
the
simple

or
in
the

in

if
you
will
for
in
thought
in
ordinary
conception
what
is
set
forth
both
is
and
is
not
at
the
same
time
what
is
represented
either
as
such
or
as
an
image
of
the
conception
is
not
a
thing
it
has
no
being
and
yet
it
is
not
nothing
space
and
time
furthermore
as
quantum
form
a
limited
extension
and
thus
can
be
measured
off
just
as
i
do
not
actually
divide
space
neither
does
the
body
which
is
in
motion
the
partition
of
space
as
divided
is
not
absolute
discontinuity
punktualitt
nor
is
pure
continuity
the
undivided
and
indivisible
likewise
time
is
not
pure
negativity
or
discontinuity
but
also
continuity
both
are
manifested
in
motion
in
which
the
notions
have
their
reality
for
ordinary
conceptionpure
negativity
as
time
continuity
as
space
motion
itself
is
just
this
actual
unity
in
the
opposition
and
the
sequence
of
both
moments
in
this
unity
to
comprehend
motion
is
to
express
its
essence
in
the
form
of
notion
ie
as
unity
of
negativity
and
continuity
but
in
them
neither
continuity
nor
discreteness
can
be
exhibited
as
the
true
existence
if
we
represent
space
or
time
to
ourselves
as
infinitely
divided
we
have
an
infinitude
of
points
but
continuity
is
present
therein
as
a
space
which
comprehends
them
as
notion
however
continuity
is
the
fact
that
all
these
are
alike
and
thus
in
reality
they
do
not
appear
one
out
of
the
other
like
points
but
both
these
moments
make
their
appearance
as
existent
if
they
are
manifested
indifferently
their
notion
is
no
longer
posited
but
their
existence
in
them
as
existent
negativity
is
a
limited
size
and
they
exist
as
limited
space
and
time
actual
motion
is
progression
through
a
limited
space
and
a
limited
time
and
not
through
infinite
space
and
infinite
time
that
what
is
in
motion
must
reach
the
half
is
the
assertion
of
continuity
ie
the
possibility
of
division
as
mere
possibility
it
is
thus
always
possible
in
every
space
however
small
it
is
said
that
it
is
plain
that
the
half
must
be
reached
but
in
so
saying
everything
is
allowed
including
the
fact
that
it
never
will
be
reached
for
to
say
so
in
one
case
is
the
same
as
saying
it
an
infinite
number
of
times
we
mean
on
the
contrary
that
in
a
larger
space
the
half
can
be
allowed
but
we
conceive
that
we
must
somewhere
attain
to
a
space
so
small
that
no
halving
is
possible
or
an
indivisible
noncontinuous
space
which
is
no
space
this
however
is
false
for
continuity
is
a
necessary
determination
there
is
undoubtedly
a
smallest
in
space
ie
a
negation
of
continuity
but
the
negation
is
something
quite
abstract
abstract
adherence
to
the
subdivision
indicated
that
is
to
continuous
bisection
into
infinitude
is
likewise
false
for
in
the
conception
of
a
half
the
interruption
of
continuity
is
involved
we
must
say
that
there
is
no
half
of
space
for
space
is
continuous
a
piece
of
wood
may
be
broken
into
two
halves
but
not
space
and
space
only
exists
in
movement
it
might
equally
be
said
that
space
consists
of
an
endless
number
of
points
ie
of
infinitely
many
limits
and
thus
cannot
be
traversed
men
think
themselves
able
to
go
from
one
indivisible
point
to
another
but
they
do
not
thereby
get
any
further
for
of
these
there
is
an
unlimited
number
continuity
is
split
up
into
its
opposite
a
number
which
is
indefinite
that
is
to
say
if
continuity
is
not
admitted
there
is
no
motion
it
is
false
to
assert
that
it
is
possible
when
one
is
reached
or
that
which
is
not
continuous
for
motion
is
connection
thus
when
it
was
said
that
continuity
is
the
presupposed
possibility
of
infinite
division
continuity
is
only
the
hypothesis
but
what
is
exhibited
in
this
continuity
is
the
being
of
infinitely
many
abstractly
absolute
limits
b
the
second
proof
which
is
also
the
presupposition
of
continuity
and
the
manifestation
of
division
is
called
achilles
the
swift
the
ancients
loved
to
clothe
difficulties
in
sensuous
representations
of
two
bodies
moving
in
one
direction
one
of
which
is

and
the
other
following
at
a
fixed
distance
and
moving
quicker
than
the
first
we
know
that
the
second
will
overtake
the
first
but
zeno
says
the
slower
can
never
be
overtaken
by
the
quicker
and
he
proves
it
thus
the
second
one
requires
a
certain
space
of
time
to
reach
the
place
from
which
the
one
pursued
started
at
the
beginning
of
the
given
period
thus
during
the
time
in
which
the
second
reached
the
point
where
the
first
was
the
latter
went
over
a
new
space
which
the
second
has
again
to
pass
through
in
a
part
of
this
period
and
in
this
way
it
goes
into

quicker
motion
does
not
help
the
second
body
at
all
in
passing
over
the
interval
of
space
by
which
he
is
behind
the
time
which
he
requires

always
has
at
its
avail
in

to
accomplish
some
although
an
ever
shorter
advance
and
this
because
of
the
continual
division
never
quite
disappears
aristotle
in
speaking
of
this
puts
it
shortly
thus
this
proof
asserts
the
same
endless
divisibility
but
it
is
untrue
for
the
quick
will
overtake
the
slow
body
if
the
limits
to
be
traversed
be
granted
to
it
this
answer
is
correct
and
contains
all
that
can
be
said
that
is
there
are
in
this
representation
two
periods
of
time
and
two
distances
which
are
separated
from
one
another
ie
they
are
limited
in
relation
to
one
another
when
on
the
contrary
we
admit
that
time
and
space
are
continuous
so
that
two
periods
of
time
or
points
of
space
are
related
to
one
another
as
continuous
they
are
while
being
two
not
two
but
identical
in
ordinary
language
we
solve
the
matter
in
the
easiest
way
for
we
say
because
the
second
is
quicker
it
covers
a
greater
distance
in
the
same
time
as
the
slow
it
can
therefore
come
to
the
place
from
which
the
first
started
and
get
further
still
after
b
at
the
end
of
the
first
hour
arrives
at
d
and
a
at
e
a
in
one
and
the
same
period
that
is
in
the
second
hour
goes
over
the
distance
e
g
and
b
the
distance
d
g
but
this
period
of
time
which
should
be
one
is
divisible
into
that
in
which
b
accomplishes
d
e
and
that
in
which
b
passes
through
e
g
a
has
a
start
of
the
first
by
which
it
gets
over
the
distance
e
f
so
that
a
is
at
f
at
the
same
period
as
b
is
at
e
the
limitation
which
according
to
aristotle
is
to
be
overcome
which
must
be
penetrated
is
thus
that
of
time
since
it
is
continuous
it
must
for
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
be
said
that
what
is
divisible
into
two
spaces
of
time
is
to
be
conceived
of
as
one
in
which
b
gets
from
d
to
e
and
from
e
to
g
while
a
passes
over
the
distance
e
g
in
motion
two
periods
as
well
as
two
points
in
space
are
indeed
one
if
we
wish
to
make
motion
clear
to
ourselves
we
say
that
the
body
is
in
one
place
and
then
it
goes
to
another
because
it
moves
it
is
no
longer
in
the
first
but
yet
not
in
the
second
were
it
in
either
it
would
be
at
rest
where
then
is
it
if
we
say
that
it
is
between
both
this
is
to
convey
nothing
at
all
for
were
it
between
both
it
would
be
in
a
place
and
this
presents
the
same
difficulty
but
movement
means
to
be
in
this
place
and
not
to
be
in
it
and
thus
to
be
in
both
alike
this
is
the
continuity
of
space
and
time
which
first
makes
motion
possible
zeno
in
the
deduction
made
by
him
brought
both
these
points
into
forcible
opposition
the
discretion
of
space
and
time
we
also
uphold
but
there
must
also
be
granted
to
them
the
overstepping
of
limits
ie
the
exhibition
of
limits
as
not
being
or
as
being
divided
periods
of
time
which
are
also
not
divided
in
our
ordinary
ideas
we
find
the
same
determinations
as
those
on
which
the
dialectic
of
zeno
rests
we
arrive
at
saying
though
unwillingly
that
in
one
period
two
distances
of
space
are
traversed
but
we
do
not
say
that
the
quicker
comprehends
two
moments
of
time
in
one
for
that
we
fix
a
definite
space
but
in
order
that
the
slower
may
lose
its
precedence
it
must
be
said
that
it
loses
its
advantage
of
a
moment
of
time
and
indirectly
the
moment
of
space
zeno
makes
limit
division
the
moment
of
discretion
in
space
and
time
the
only
element
which
is
enforced
in
the
whole
of
his
conclusions
and
hence
results
the
contradiction
the
difficulty
is
to
overcome
thought
for
what
makes
the
difficulty
is
always
thought
alone
since
it
keeps
apart
the
moments
of
an
object
which
in
their
separation
are
really
united
it
brought
about
the
fall
for
man
ate
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
but
it
also
remedies
these
evils
c
the
third
form
according
to
aristotle
is
as
followszeno
says
the
flying
arrow
rests
and
for
the
reason
that
what
is
in
motion
is
always
in
the
selfsame
now
and
the
selfsame
here
in
the
indistinguishable
it
is
here
and
here
and
here
it
can
be
said
of
the
arrow
that
it
is
always
the
same
for
it
is
always
in
the
same
space
and
the
same
time
it
does
not
get
beyond
its
space
does
not
take
in
another
that
is
a
greater
or
smaller
space
that
however
is
what
we
call
rest
and
not
motion
in
the
here
and
now
the
becoming
other
is
abrogated
limitation
indeed
being
established
but
only
as
moment
since
in
the
here
and
now
as
such
there
is
no
difference
continuity
is
here
made
to
prevail
against
the
mere
belief
in
diversity
each
place
is
a
different
place
and
thus
the
same
true
objective
difference
does
not
come
forth
in
these
sensuous
relations
but
in
the
spiritual
this
is
also
apparent
in
mechanics
of
two
bodies
the
question
as
to
which
moves
presents
itself
before
us
it
requires
more
than
two
placesthree
at
leastto
determine
which
of
them
moves
but
it
is
correct
to
say
this
that
motion
is
plainly
relative
whether
in
absolute
space
the
eye
for
instance
rests
or
whether
it
moves
is
all
the
same
or
according
to
a
proposition
brought
forward
by
newton
if
two
bodies
move
round
one
another
in
a
circle
it
may
be
asked
whether
the
one
rests
or
both
move
newton
tries
to
decide
this
by
means
of
an
external
circumstance
the
strain
on
the
string
when
i
walk
on
a
ship
in
a
direction
opposed
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
this
is
in
relation
to
the
ship
motion
and
in
relation
to
all
else
rest
in
both
the
first
proofs
continuity
in
progression
has
the
predominance
there
is
no
absolute
limit
but
an
overstepping
of
all
limits
here
the
opposite
is
established
absolute
limitation
the
interruption
of
continuity
without
however
passing
into
something
else
while
discretion
is
presupposed
continuity
is
maintained
aristotle
says
of
this
proof
it
arises
from
the
fact
that
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
time
consists
of
the
now
for
if
this
is
not
conceded
the
conclusions
will
not
follow
d
the
fourth
proof
aristotle
continues
is
derived
from
similar
bodies
which
move
in
opposite
directions
in
the
space
beside
a
similar
body
and
with
equal
velocity
one
from
one
end
of
the
space
the
other
from
the
middle
it
necessarily
results
from
this
that
half
the
time
is
equal
to
the
double
of
it
the
fallacy
rests
in
this
that
zeno
supposes
that
what
is
beside
the
moving
body
and
what
is
beside
the
body
at
rest
move
through
an
equal
distance
in
equal
time
with
equal
velocity
which
however
is
untrue

the

an

ensues

this
is
the
dialectic

he
had
a
knowledge
of
the

which
our
ideas
of

contain

showed
in

their
contradiction
kants
antinomies
do
no
more
than
zeno
did
here
the
general
result
of
the
eleatic
dialectic
has
thus
become
the
truth
is
the
one
all
else
is
untrue
just
as
the
kantian
philosophy
resulted
in
we
know
appearances
only
on
the
whole
the
principle
is
the
same
the
content
of
knowledge
is
only
an
appearance
and
not
truth
but
there
is
also
a
great
difference
present
that
is
to
say
zeno
and
the
eleatics
in
their
proposition
signified
that
the
sensuous
world
with
its
multitudinous
forms
is
in
itself
appearance
only
and
has
no
truth
but
kant
does
not
mean
this
for
he
asserts
because
we
apply
the
activity
of
our
thought
to
the
outer
world
we
constitute
it
appearance
what
is
without
first
becomes
an
untruth
by
the
fact
that
we
put
therein
a
mass
of
determinations
only
our
knowledge
the
spiritual
is
thus
appearance
the
world
is
in
itself
absolute
truth
it
is
our
action
alone
that
ruins
it
our
work
is
good
for
nothing
it
shows
excessive
humility
of
mind
to
believe
that
knowledge
has
no
value
but
christ
says
are
ye
not
better
than
the
sparrows
and
we
are
so
inasmuch
as
we
are
thinking
as
sensuous
we
are
as
good
or
as
bad
as
sparrows
zenos

it
became
general
we
here
leave
the
eleatic
school
which
perpetuates
itself
in
leucippus
and
on
the
other
side
in
the
sophists
in
such
a
way
that
these
last
extended
the
eleatic
conceptions
to
all
reality
and
gave
to
it
the
relation
of
consciousness
the
former
however
as
one
who
later
on
worked
out
the
notion
in
its
abstraction
makes
a
physical
application
of
it
and
one
which
is
opposed
to
consciousness
there
are
several
other
eleatics
mentioned
to
tennemanns
surprise
who
however
cannot
interest
us
it
is
so
unexpected
he
says
vol
i
p
190
that
the
eleatic
system
should
find
disciples
and
yet
sextus
mentions
a
certain
xeniades
d
heraclitus
if
we
put
aside
the
ionics
who
did
not
understand
the
absolute
as
thought
and
the
pythagoreans
likewise
we
have
the
pure
being
of
the
eleatics
and
the
dialectic
which
denies
all
finite
relationships
thought
to
the
latter
is
the
process
of
such
manifestations
the
world
in
itself
is
the
apparent
and
pure
being
alone
the
true
the
dialectic
of
zeno
thus
lays
hold
of
the
determinations
which
rest
in
the
content
itself
but
it
may
in
so
far
also
be
called
subjective
dialectic
inasmuch
as
it
rests
in
the
contemplative
subject
and
the
one
without
this
movement
of
the
dialectic
is
abstract
identity
the
next
step
from
the
existence
of
the
dialectic
as
movement
in
the
subject
is
that
it
must
necessarily
itself
become
objective
if
aristotle
blames
thales
for
doing
away
with
motion
because
change
cannot
be
understood
from
being
and
likewise
misses
the
actual
in
the
pythagorean
numbers
and
platonic
ideas
taken
as
the
substances
of
the
things
which
participate
in
them
heraclitus
at
least
understands
the
absolute
as
just
this
process
of
the
dialectic
the
dialectic
is
thus
threfold

the
external
dialectic
a
reasoning
which
goes
over
and
over
again
without
ever
reaching
the
soul
of
the
thing

immanent
dialectic
of
the
object
but
falling
within
the
contemplation
of
the
subject

the
objectivity
of
heraclitus
which
takes
the
dialectic
itself
as
principle
the
advance
requisite
and
made
by
heraclitus
is
the
progression
from
being
as
the
first
immediate
thought
to
the
category
of
becoming
as
the
second
this
is
the
first
concrete
the
absolute
as
in
it
the
unity
of
opposites
thus
with
heraclitus
the
philosophic
idea
is
to
be
met
with
in
its
speculative
form
the
reasoning
of

of

says

that
heraclitus
flourished
about
the
69th
olympiad
500
bc
and
that
he
was
of
ephesus
and
in
part
contemporaneous
with
parmenides
he
began
the
separation
and
withdrawal
of
philosophers
from
public
affairs
and
the
interests
of
the
country
and
devoted
himself
in

we
find
much
of
it
quoted
in

he
got
his

indubitably

side
only
in

to
its

as
being
the
untrue
in

we
see
the
perfection
of
knowledge
so
far
as
it
has
gone
a
perfecting
of
the
idea
into
a
totality
which
is
the
beginning
of
philosophy
since
it
expresses
the
essence
of
the
idea
the
notion
of
the
infinite
the
potentially
and
actively
existent
as
that
which
it

in

day

was
the

of

of

saying

the

as
the
unity
of
distinct
opposites
and
indeed
of
the
pure
opposition
of
being
and
nonbeing
but
with
the
eleatics
we
have
the
abstract
understanding
that
being
is
alone
the
truth
we
say
in
place
of
using
the
expression
of
heraclitus
that
the
absolute
is
the
unity
of
being
and
nonbeing
when
we
understand
that
proposition
as
that
being
is
and
yet
is
not
this
does
not
seem
to
make
much
sense
but
only
to
imply
complete
negation
and
want
of
thought

we
have
another
sentence
that
gives
the
meaning
of
the
principle

is
in

subsists

does
it
ever
remain

same

plato
further
says
of
heraclitus
he
compares
things
to
the
current
of
a
river
no
one
can
go
twice
into
the
same

aristotle

clo

goes
on
to
say
that
heraclitus
declares
that
there
is
only
one
that
remains
and
from
out
of
this
all
else
is
formed
all
except
this
one
is
not
enduring

this
universal
principle
is
better
characterized
as
becoming
the
truth
of
being
since
everything
is
and
is
not
heraclitus
hereby
expressed
that
everything
is
becoming
not
merely
does
origination
belong
to
it
but
passing
away
as
well
both
are
not
independent
but
identical
it
is
a
great
advance
in
thought
to
pass
from
being
to
becoming
even
if
as
the
first
unity
of
opposite
determinations
it
is
still
abstract
because
in
this
relationship
both
must
be
unrestful
and
therefore
contain
within
themselves
the
principle
of
life
the
lack
of
motion
which
aristotle
has
demonstrated
in
the
earlier
philosophies
is
supplied
and
this
last
is
even
made
to
be
the
principle
this
philosophy
is
thus
not
one
past
and
gone
its
principle
is
essential
and
is
to

not

the

thought
in

is

negative

nothing

we
here

altogether
immediate
and
general
but
when
we
look
closer
we
find
that
heraclitus
also
conceived
of
the
opposites
and
their
unification
in
a
more
definite
manner
he
says

the

of

principle
the

separated
from

makes
itself
one
with
itself
like
the
harmony
of
the
bow

the

he
then
makes
eryximachus
who
speaks
in
the

criticize
this
thus
in
harmony
there
is
discord
or
it
arises
from
opposites
for
harmony
does
not
arise
from
height
and
depth
in
that
they
are
different
but
from
their
union
through
the
art
of

but
this
does
not
contradict
heraclitus
who
means
the

thing
that
which
is
simple
the
repetition
of
a
tone
is
no
harmony
difference
is
clearly
necessary
to
harmony
or
a
definite
antithesis
for
it
is
the
absolute
becoming
and
not
mere
change
the
real
fact
is
that
each
particular
tone
is
different
from
anothernot
abstractly
so
from
any
other
but
from
its
otherand
thus
it
also
can
be
one
each
particular
only
is
in
so
far
as
its
opposite
is
implicitly
contained
in
its
notion
subjectivity
is
thus
the
other
of
objectivity
and
not
of
a
piece
of
paper
which
would
be
meaningless
since
each
is
the
other
of
the

as

we
here
have
their
identity

it
may
seem

it
is
speculative

this

the
independence
of

natural
philosophy
in
his
system
heraclitus
did
not
rest
content
with
thus
expressing
himself
in
notions
or
with
what
is
purely
logical
but
in
addition
to
this
universal
form
in
which
he
advanced
his
principle
he
gave
his
idea
a
real
and
more
natural
form
and
hence
he
is
still
reckoned
as
belonging
to
the
ionic
school
of
natural
philosophers
however
as
regards
this
form
of
reality
historians
are
at
variance
most
of
them
and
amongst
others
aristotle
met
i

say
that
he
maintained
fire
to
be
the
existent
principle
others
according
to

say
it
was

and

again
assert
that

rather
than

even
time
is
in

given
as
the

the
question
arises
as
to
how
this
diversity
is
to
be
comprehended
it
must
not
be
believed
that
all
these
accounts
are
to
be
ascribed
to
the
inaccuracy
of
historians
for
the
witnesses
are
of
the
best
like
aristotle
and
sextus
empiricus
who
do
not
speak
casually
of
these
forms
but
definitely
without
however
remarking
upon
any
such
differences
and
contradictions
we
seem
to
have
a
better
reason
in
the
obscurity
of
the
writing
of
heraclitus
which
might
by
the
confusion
of
its
expression
give
occasion
to
misunderstanding
but
when
regarded
closer
this
difficulty
which
is
evident
when
merely
looked
at
superficially
disappears
it
is
in
the
profoundly
significant
conceptions
of
heraclitus
that
the
true
way
out
of
this
difficulty
manifests
itself
heraclitus
could
no
longer
like
thales
express
water
air
or
anything
similar
as
an
absolute
principlehe
could
no
longer
do
so
in
the
form
of
a
primeval
element
from
which
the
rest
proceedsbecause
he
thought
of
being
as
identical
with
nonbeing
or
the
infinite
notion
thus
the
existent
absolute
principle
cannot
with
him
come
forth
as
a
definite
and
actual
thing
such
as
water
but
must
be
water
in
alteration
or
as
process
only
a
understanding
the
abstract
process
as

it

is
an
unfortunate
expression
the
sceptics
frequently
pick
out
the
crudest
expressions
or
make
thoughts
crude
in
the
first
place
so
that
they
may
afterwards
dispense
with
them
corporeal
here
means
abstract
sensuousness
time
as
the
first
sensuous
existence
is
the
abstract
representation
of
process
it
is
because
heraclitus
did
not
rest
at
the
logical
expression
of
becoming
but
gave
to
his
principle
the
form
of
the
existent
that
it
was
necessary
that
time
should
first
present
itself
to
him
as
such
for
in
the
sensuously
perceptible
it
is
the
first
form
of
becoming
time
is
pure
becoming
as
perceived
the
pure
notion
that
which
is
simple
and
the
harmony
issuing
from
absolute
opposites
its
essential
nature
is
to
be
and
not
to
be
in
one
unity
and
besides
this
it
has
no
other
character
it
is
not
that
time
is
or
is
not
for
time
is
nonbeing
immediately
in
being
and
being
immediately
in
nonbeing
it
is
the
transition
out
of
being
into
nonbeing
the
abstract
notion
but
in
an
objective
form
ie
in
so
far
as
it
is
for
us
in
time
there
is
no
past
and
future
but
only
the
now
and
this
is
but
is
not
as
regards
the
past
and
this
nonbeing
as
future
turns
round
into
being
if
we
were
to
say
how
that
which
heraclitus
recognized
as
principle
might
in
the
pure
form
in
which
he
recognized
it
exist
for
consciousness
we
could
mention
nothing
else
but
time
and
it
quite
accords
with
the
principle
of
thought
in
heraclitus
to
define
time
as
the
first
form
of
becoming
b
but
this
pure
objective
notion
must
realize
itself
more
fully
and
thus
we
find
in
fact
that
heraclitus
determined
the
process
in
a
more
markedly
physical
manner
in
time
we
have
the
moments
of
being
and
nonbeing
manifested
as
negative
only
or
as
vanishing
immediately
if
we
wish
to
express
both
these
moments
as
one
independent
totality
the
question
is
asked
which
physical
existence
corresponds
to
this
determination
to
heraclitus
the
truth
is
to
have
grasped
the
essential
being
of
nature
ie
to
have
represented
it
as
implicitly
infinite
as
process
in
itself
and
consequently
it
is
evident
to
us
that
heraclitus
could
not
say
that
the
primary
principle
is
air
water
or
any
such
thing
they
are
not
themselves
process
but
fire
is
process
and
thus
he
maintains
fire
to
be
the
elementary
principle
and
this
is
the
real
form
of
the
heraclitean
principle
the
soul
and
substance
of
the
natureprocess
fire
is
physical
time
absolute
unrest
absolute
disintegration
of
existence
the
passing
away
of
the
other
but
also
of
itself
and
hence
we
can
understand
how
heraclitus
proceeding
from
his
fundamental
determination
could
quite
logically
call
fire
the
notion
of
the
process
c
he
further
made
this
fire
to
be
a
real
process
because
its
reality
is
for
itself
the
whole
process
the
moments
have
become
concretely
determined
fire
as
the
metamorphosis
of
bodily
things
is
the
transformation
and
exhalation
of
the
determinate
for
this
process
heraclitus
used
a
particular
wordevaporation
but
it
is
rather
transition
aristotle
de
anim
i
2
says
of
heraclitus
in
this
regard
that
according
to
his
view
the
soul
is
the
principle
because
it
is
evaporation
the
origination
of
everything
it
is
what
is
most
incorporeal
and
always
in
a
state
of
flux
this
is
quite
applicable
to
the
primary
principle
of
heraclitus
furthermore
he
determined
the
real
process
in
its
abstract
moments
by
separating
two
sides
in
itthe
way
upwards


and
the
way
downwards

the
one
being
division
in
that
it
is
the
existence
of
opposites
and
the
other
the
unification
of
these
existent
opposites
corresponding
to
these
he
had
according
to
diogenes
ix
8
the
further
determinations
of
enmity
and
strife


and
friendship
and
harmony


of
these
two
enmity
and
strife
is
that
which
is
the
principle
of
the
origination
of
differences
but
what
leads
to
combustion
is
harmony
and
peace
in
enmity
amongst
men
the
one
sets
himself
up
independently
of
the
other
or
is
for
himself
and
realizes
himself
but
unity
and
peace
is
sinking
out
of
independence
into
indivisibility
or
nonreality
everything
is
threfold
and
thereby
real
unity
nature
is
the
neverresting
and
the
all
is
the
transition
out
of
the
one
into
the
other
from
division
into
unity
and
from
unity
into
division
the
more
detailed
accounts
of
this
real
process
are
in
great
measure
deficient
and
contradictory
in
this
connection
it
is
in
some
accounts63
said
of
heraclitus
that
he
defined
it
thus
of
the
forms
taken
by
fire
there
is
first
of
all
the
sea
and
then
of
it
half
is
the
earth
and
the
other
half
the
lightning
flash

the
fire
which
springs
up
this
is
general
and
very
obscure
diogenes
laertius
ix

says
fire
is
condensed
into
moisture
and
when
concrete
it
becomes
water
water
hardens
into
earth
and
this
is
the
way
downwards
the
earth
then
again
becomes
fluid
and
from
it
moisture
supervenes
and
from
this
the
evaporation
of
the
sea
from
which
all
else
arises
this
is
the
way
upwards
water
divides
into
a
dark
evaporation
becoming
earth
and
into
what
is
pure
sparkling
becoming
fire
and
burning
in
the
solar
sphere
what
is
fiery
becomes
meteors
planets
and
stars
these
are
thus
not
still
dead
stars
but
are
regarded
as
in
becoming
as
being
eternally
productive
we
thus
have
on
the
whole
a
metamorphosis
of
fire
these
oriental
metaphorical
expressions
are
however
in
heraclitus
not
to
be
taken
in
their
strictly
sensuous
signification
and
as
if
these
changes
were
present
to
the
outward
observation
but
they
depict
the
nature
of
these
elements
by
which
the
earth
eternally
creates
its
suns
and
comets
nature
is
thus
a
circle
with
this
in
view
we
find
heraclitus
according

falsely
assert
to
be
a
conflagration
of
the
world
what
heraclitus
is
said
to
have
spoken
of
as
a
conflagration
of
this
world
was
thought
to
be
an
imaginary
idea
that
after
a
certain
timeas
according
to
our
ideas
at
the
end
of
the
worldthe
world
would
disappear
in
flames
but
we
see
at
once
from
passages
which
are
most
clear64
that
this
conflagration
is
not
meant
but
that
it
is
the
perpetual
burning
up
as
the
becoming
of
friendship
the
universal
life
and
the
universal
process
of
the
universe
in
respect
of
the
fact
that
according
to
heraclitus
fire
is
the
animating
or
the
soul
we
find
in
plutarch

p

ed
xyl
an
expression
which
may
seem
odd
namely
that
the
driest
soul
is
the
best
we
certainly
do
not
esteem
the
most
moist
the
best
but
on
the
other
hand
the
one
which
is
most
alive
however
dry
here
signifies
fiery
and
thus
the
driest
soul
is
pure
fire
and
this
is
not
lifeless
but
life
itself
these
are
the
principal
moments
of
the
real
lifeprocess
i
will
stop
here
a
moment
because
we
here
find
expressed
the
whole
notion
of
speculative
reflection
regarding
nature
in
this
notion
one
moment
and
one
element
goes
over
into
the
other
fire
becomes
water
water
earth
and
fire
the
contention
about
the
transmutation
and
immutability
of
the
elements
is
an
old
one
in
this
conception
the
ordinary
sensuous
science
of
nature
separates
itself
from
natural
philosophy
in
the
speculative
point
of
view
which
is
that
of
heraclitus
the
simple
substance
in
fire
and
the
other
elements
in
itself
becomes
metamorphosed
in
the
other
all
transition
is
abolished
and
only
an
external
separation
of
what
is
already
there
is
maintained
water
is
just
water
fire
is
fire
c
if
the
former
point
of
view
upholds
transmutation
the
latter
believes
in
the
possibility
of
demonstrating
the
opposite
it
no
longer
indeed
maintains
water
fire
c
to
be
simple
realities
for
it
resolves
them
into
hydrogen
oxygen
c
but
it
asserts
their
immutability
it
justly
asserts
that
what
is
asserted
and
implied
in
the
speculative
point
of
view
must
also
have
the
truth
of
actuality
for
if
to
be
the
speculative
means
to
be
the
very
nature
and
principle
of
its
elements
this
must
likewise
be
present
we
are
wrong
in
representing
the
speculative
to
be
something
existent
only
in
thought
or
inwardly
which
is
no
one
knows
where
it
is
really
present
but
men
of
learning
shut
their
eyes
to
it
because
of
their
limited
point
of
view
if
we
listen
to
their
account
they
only
observe
and
say
what
they
see
but
their
observation
is
not
true
for
unconsciously
they
transform
what
is
seen
through
their
limited
and
stereotyped
conception
the
strife
is
not
due
to
the
opposition
between
observation
and
the
absolute
notion
but
between
the
one
notion
and
the
other
they
show
that
changessuch
as
that
of
water
into
earthare
nonexistent
even
in
modern
times
this
transformation
was
indeed
maintained
for
when
water
was
distilled
a
residuum
of
earth
was
found
on
this
subject
however
lavoisier
carried
on
a
number
of
very
conclusive
researches
he
weighed
all
the
receptacles
and
it
was
shown
that
the
residuum
proceeded
from
the
vessels
there
is
a
superficial
process
that
does
not
carry
us
beyond
the
determinate
nature
of
substance
they
say
in
reference
to
it
water
does
not
change
into
air
but
only
into
moisture
and
moisture
always
condenses
back
into
water
again
but
in
this
they
merely
fix
on
a
onesided
insufficient
process
and
give
it
out
to
be
the
absolute
process
in
the
real
process
of
nature
they
however
found
by
experience
that
the
crystal
dissolved
gives
water
and
in
the
crystal
water
is
lost
and
solidifies
or
becomes
the
socalled
water
of
crystallization
they
found
that
the
evaporation
of
the
earth
is
not
to
be
found
as
moisture
in
outward
form
in
the
air
for
air
remains
quite
pure
or
hydrogen
entirely
disappears
in
pure
air
they
have
sought
in
vain
to
find
hydrogen
in
the
atmospheric
air
similarly
they
discovered
that
quite
dry
air
in
which
they
can
show
neither
moisture
nor
hydrogen
passes
into
mist
rain
c
these
are
their
observations
but
they
spoilt
all
their
perceptions
of
changes
by
the
fixed
conception
which
they
brought
with
them
of
whole
and
part
and
of
consistence
out
of
parts
and
of
the
previous
presence
as
such
of
what
manifests
itself
in
coming
into
existence
when
the
crystal
dissolved
reveals
water
they
say
it
is
not
that
water
has
arisen
for
it
was
already
present
there
when
water
in
its
decomposition
reveals
hydrogen
and
oxygen
that
means
according
to
them
these
last
have
not
arisen
for
they
were
already
there
as
such
as
the
parts
of
which
the
water
subsists
but
they
can
neither
demonstrate
water
in
crystal
nor
oxygen
and
hydrogen
in
water
and
the
same
is
true
of
latent
heat
as
we
find
in
all
expression
of
perception
and
experience
as
soon
as
men
speak
there
is
a
notion
present
it
cannot
be
withheld
for
in
consciousness
there
always
is
a
touch
of
universality
and
truth
for
the
notion
is
the
real
principle
but
it
is
only
to
cultured
reason
that
it
is
absolute
notion
and
not
if
it
remains
as
here
confined
in
a
determinate
form
hence
these
men
necessarily
attain
to
their
limits
and
they
are
troubled
because
they
do
not
find
hydrogen
in
air
hygrometers
flasks
full
of
air
brought
down
from
heights
by
an
airballoon
do
not
show
it
to
exist
and
similarly
the
water
of
crystallization
is
no
longer
water
but
is
changed
into
earth
to
come
back
to
heraclitus
there
is
only
one
thing
wanting
to
the
process
which
is
that
its
simple
principle
should
be
recognized
as
universal
notion
the
permanence
and
rest
which
aristotle
gives
may
be
missed
heraclitus
indeed
says
that
everything
flows
on
that
nothing
is
existent
and
only
the
one
remains
but
that
is
the
notion
of
the
unity
which
only
exists
in
opposition
and
not
of
that
reflected
within
itself
this
one
in
its
unity
with
the
movement
of
the
individuals
is
the
genus
or
in
its
infinitude
the
simple
notion
as
thought
as
such
the
idea
has
still
to
be
determined
and
we
shall
thus
find
it
again
as
the

of
anaxagoras
the
universal
is
the
immediate
simple
unity
in
opposition
which
goes
back
into
itself
as
a
process
of
differences
but
this
is
also
found
in
heraclitus
he
called
this
unity
in
opposition
fate

or
necessity65
and
the
notion
of
necessity
is
none
other
than
this
that
determinateness
constitutes
the
principle
of
the
existent
as
individual
but
in
that
very
way
relates
it
to
its
opposite
this
is
the
absolute
connection

that
permeates
the
being
of
the
whole
he
calls
this
the
ethereal
body
the
seed
of
the
becoming
of
everything66
that
to
him
is
the
idea
the
universal
as
reality
as

else
to
consider
and
that
is
what
position
in
this

heraclitus
gives
to

his
philosophy
has
on
the
whole
a
bent
towards
a

logical

how
is
it

i
shall

here
in

detail
it
is
a
beautiful
natural
childlike
manner
of

of
the

the

of
the

of
the

and
the
necessity
of
objectivity
make
their
first
appearance
here
several
passages
from
heraclitus
are
preserved
respecting
his
views
of
knowledge
from
his
principle
that
everything
that
is

the

that
he
holds

the

with

the

in

the

to

rather
what
may
be
called
a
condition
but
here
it
is
taken
as
the
whole
of

for
in

the

the
mind
as
individual
unity
only
loses
objectivity
is
not
in
individuality
universal
is
not
the
thought
which
has
itself
as
object
in
a
waking
condition
however
the
understandinggazing
through
the
channels
of
sense
as
though
it
were
through
a
window
and
forming
a
relationship
with
the
surroundingsmaintains
the
logical
power
we
here
have
the
ideal
in
its
native
simplicity
in
the
same
way
as
coals
which
come
near
fire
themselves
take
fire
but
apart
from
it
go
out
the
part
which
is
cut
off
from
the
surroundings
in
our
bodies
becomes
through
the
separation
almost
irrational
this
confutes
those
who
think
that
god
gives
wisdom
in
sleep
or
in
somnambulism
but
in
connection
with
the
many
channels
it
becomes
similar
to
the
whole
this
whole
the
universal
and
divine
understanding
in
unity
with
which
we
are
logical
is
according
to
heraclitus
the
essence
of
truth
hence
that
which
appears
as
the
universal
to
all
carries
with
it
conviction
for
it
has
part
in
the
universal
and
divine
logos
while
what
is
subscribed
to
by
an
individual
carries
with
it
no
conviction
from
the
opposite
cause
he
says
in
the
beginning
of
his
book
on
nature
since
the
surroundings
are
reason
men
are
irrational
both
before
they
hear
and
when
they
first
hear
for
since
what
happens
happens
according
to
this
reason
they
are
still
inexperienced
when
they
search
the
sayings
and
the
works
which
i
expound
distinguishing
the
nature
of
everything
and
explaining
its
relations
but
other
men
do
not
know
what
they
do
awake
just
as
they
forget
what
they
do
in
sleep
heraclitus
says
further
we
do
and
think
everything
in
that
we
participate
in
the
divine
understanding

hence
we
must
follow
the
universal
understanding
but
many
live
as
if
they
had
an
understanding

of
their
own
the
understanding
is
however
nothing
but
interpretation
being
conscious
of
the
manner
in
which
all
is
ordered
hence
in
so
far
as
we
participate
in
the
knowledge

of
it
we
are
in
the
truth
but
in
so
far
as
we
are
singular

we
are
in
error
great
and
important
words
we
cannot
speak
of
truth
in
a
truer
or
less
prejudiced
way
consciousness
as
consciousness
of
the
universal
is
alone
consciousness
of
truth
but
consciousness
of
individuality
and
action
as
individual
an
originality
which
becomes
a
singularity
of
content
or
of
form
is
the
untrue
and
bad
wickedness
and
error
thus
are
constituted
by
isolating
thought
and
thereby
bringing
about
a
separation
from
the
universal
men
usually
consider
when
they
speak
of
thinking
something
that
it
must
be
something
particular
but
this
is
quite
a
delusion
however
much
heraclitus
may
maintain
that
there
is
no
truth
in
sensuous
knowledge
because
all
that
exists
is
in
a
state
of
flux
and
that
the
existence
of
sensuous
certainty
is
not
while
it
is
he
maintains
the
objective
method
in
knowledge
to
be
none
the
less
necessary
the
rational
the
true
that
which
i
know
is
indeed
a
withdrawal
from
the
objective
as
from
what
is
sensuous
individual
definite
and
existent
but
what
reason
knows
within
itself
is
necessity
or
the
universal
of
being
it
is
the
principle
of
thought
as
it
is
the
principle
of
the
world
it
is
this
contemplation
of
truth
that
spinoza
in
his
ethics
p

ed
paul
calls
a
contemplation
of
things
in
the
guise
of
eternity
the
beingforself
of
reason
is
not
an
objectless
consciousness
or
a
dream
but
a
knowledge
that
which
is
for
itself
but
this
beingforself
is
awake
or
is
objective
and
universal
ie
is
the
same
for
all
the
dream
is
a
knowledge
of
something
of
which
i
alone
know
fancy
may
be
instanced
as
just
such
a
dream
similarly
it
is
by
feeling
that
something
is
for
me
alone
and
that
i
have
something
in
me
as
in
this
subject
the
feeling
may
profess
to
be
ever
so
elevated
yet
it
really
is
the
case
that
for
me
as
this
subject
it
is
what
i
feel
and
not
an
object
independent
of
me
but
in
truth
the
object
is
for
me
something
essentially
free
and
i
am
for
myself
devoid
of
subjectivity
similarly
this
object
is
no
imaginary
one
made
an
object
by
me
alone
but
is
in
itself
a
universal
there
are
besides
many
other
fragments
of
heraclitus
solitary
expressions
such
as
his
saying
men
are
mortal
gods
and
gods
immortal
men
living
is
death
to
the
former
and
dying
is
their
life67
life
is
the
death
of
the
gods
death
is
the
life
of
the
gods
the
divine
is
the
rising
through
thought
above
mere
nature
which
belongs
to
death
hence
heraclitus
also
says
according
to
sextus
adv
math
vii
349
the
power
of
thinking
is
outside
the
body
which
in
a
remarkable
way
tennemann
makes
into

we
further
read
heraclitus
says
that
both
life
and
death
are
united
in
our
life
as
in
our
death
for
if
we
live
our
souls
are
dead
and
buried
in
us
but
if
we
die
our
souls
arise
and
live
we
may
in
fact
say
of
heraclitus
what
socrates
said
what
remains
to
us
of
heraclitus
is
excellent
and
we
must
conjecture
of
what
is
lost
that
it
was
as
excellent
or
if
we
wish
to
consider
fate
so
just
as
always
to
preserve
to
posterity
what
is
best
we
must
at
least
say
of
what
we
have
of
heraclitus
that
it
is
worthy
of
this
preservation
e
empedocles
leucippus
and
democritus
we
shall
take
leucippus
and
democritus
with
empedocles
in
them
there
is
manifested
the
ideality
of
the
sensuous
and
also
universal
determinateness
or
a
transition
to
the
universal
empedocles
was
a
pythagorean
italian
whose
tendencies
were
ionic
leucippus
and
democritus
who
incline
to
the
italians
in
that
they
carried
on
the
eleatic
school
are
more
interesting
both
these
philosophers
belong
to
the
same
philosophic
system
they
must
be
taken
together
as
regards
their
philosophic
thought
and
considered
thus68
leucippus
is
the
older
and
democritus
perfected
what
the
former
began
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
what
properly
speaking
belongs
to
him
historically
it
is
certainly
recorded
that
he
developed
leucippus
thought
and
there
is
too
some
of
his
work
preserved
but
it
is
not
worthy
of
quotation
in
empedocles
we
see
the
commencement
of
the
determination
and
separation
of
principles
the
becoming
conscious
of
difference
is
an
essential
moment
but
the
principles
here
have
in
part
the
character
of
physical
being
and
though
partaking
also
of
ideal
being
this
form
is
not
yet
thoughtform
on
the
other
hand
we
find
in
leucippus
and
democritus
the
more
ideal
principles
the
atom
and
the
nothing
and
we
also
find
thoughtdetermination
more
immersed
in
the
objectivethat
is
the
beginning
of
a
metaphysics
of
body
or
pure
notions
possess
the
significance
of
the
material
and
thus
pass
over
thought
into
objective
form
but
the
teaching
is
on
the
whole
immature
and
is
incapable
of
giving
satisfaction

leucippus

nothing
is
accurately
known
of
the
circumstances
of
leucippus
life
not
even
where
he
was

like

him
out
to

miletus
it
is
definitely
stated
that
he
was
a
disciple

a
friend
of
zeno
yet
he
seems
to
have
been
almost
contemporaneous
with
him
as
well
as
with
heraclitus
it
is
less
doubtful
that
democritus
belonged
to

on
the

his
connection
with
the
abderites
has
been
much
discussed
and
many
bad
anecdotes
are
told
regarding
it

that
his

its
passage
to
greece
diogenes
tells

that
he
expended
his
means
which
were
considerable
on
journeys
to
egypt
and
in
penetrating
into
the
east
but
this
last
is
not
authentic
his
possessions
are
stated
to
have
amounted
to
a

if
an
attic
talent
was
worth
about
from
1000
to
1200
thalers
he
must
undoubtedly
have
been
able
to
get
far
enough
with
that
it

ix

goes
on
after
he
returned
from
his
journeys
into
his
own
country
he
lived
very
quietly
for
he
had
consumed
all
his
substance
but
he
was
supported
by
his
brother
and
attained
to
high
honour
amongst
his
countrymennot
through
his
philosophy
butby
some
prophetic
utterances
according
to
the
law
however
he
who
ran
through
his
fathers
means
could
not
have
a
place
in

paternal

to
give
no
place
to

calumniator

speakeras
though
he
had
spent
his

through

read
his
work

to
the
abderites
and
the
latter
gave
him
a
present
of
500
talents
had
his
statue
publicly
erected
and
buried
him
with
great
pomp
when
at
100
years
old
he
died
that
this
was
also
an
abderite
jest
those
who
left
us
this
narrative
at
least
did
not
see
leucippus
is
the
originator
of
the
famous
atomic
system
which
as
recently
revived
is
held
to
be
the
principle
of
rational
science
if
we
take
this
system
on
its
own
account
it
is
certainly
very
barren
and
there
is
not
much
to
be
looked
for
in
it
but
it
must
be
allowed
that
we
are
greatly
indebted
to
leucippus
because
as
it
is
expressed
in
our
ordinary
physics
he
separated
the
universal
and
the
sensuous
or
the
primary
and
the
secondary
or
the
essential
and
the
nonessential
qualities
of
body
the
universal
quality
means
in
speculative
language
the
fact
that
the
corporeal
is
really
universally
determined
through
the
notion
or
the
principle
of
body
leucippus
understood
the
determinate
nature
of
being
not
in
a
superficial
manner
but
in
a
speculative
when
it
is
said
that
body
has
those
universal
qualities
such
as
form
impenetrability
and
weight
we
think
that
the
indeterminate
conception
of
body
is
the
essence
and
that
its
essence
is
something
other
than
these
qualities
but
speculatively
essential
existence
is
just
universal
determinations
they
are
existent
in
themselves
or
the
abstract
content
and
the
reality
of
existence
to
body
as
such
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
determination
of
reality
but
pure
singularity
but
it
is
the
unity
of
opposites
and
the
unity
of
these
predicates
constitutes
its
reality
let
us
recollect
that
in
the
eleatic
philosophy
being
and
nonbeing
were
looked
at
as
in
opposition
that
only
being
is
and
nonbeing
in
which
category
we
find
motion
change
c
is
not
being
is
not
as
yet
the
unity
turning
back
and
turned
back
into
itself
like
heraclitus
motion
and
the
universal
it
may
be
said
of
the
point
of
view
that
difference
change
motion
c
fall
within
sensuous
immediate
perception
that
the
assertion
that
only
being
is
is
as
contradictory
to
appearances
as
to
thought
for
the
nothing
that
which
the

is
or
within
the
heraclitean
idea
being
and
nonbeing
are
the
same
being
is
but
nonbeing
since
it
is
one
with
being
is
as
well
or
being
is
both
the
predicate
of
being
and
of
nonbeing
but
being
and
nonbeing
are
both
expressed
as
having
the
qualities
of
objectivity
or
as
they
are
for
sensuous
perception
and
hence
they
are
the
opposition
of
full
and
empty
leucippus
says
this
he
expresses
as
existent
what
was
really
present
to
the
eleatics
aristotle
says
met
i

leucippus
and
his
friend
democritus
maintain
that
the
full
and
the
empty
are
the
elements
and
they
call
the
one
the
existent
and
the
other
the
nonexistent
that
is
the
full
and
solid
are
the
existent
the
empty
and
rare
the
nonexistent
hence
they
also
say
that
being
is
no
more
than
nonbeing
because
the
empty
is
as
well
as
the
bodily
and
these
form
the
material
sources
of
everything
the
full
has
the
atom
as
its
principle
the
absolute
what
exists
in
and
for
itself
is
thus
the
atom
and
the
empty





this
is
an
important
if
at
the
same
time
an
insufficient
explanation
it
is
not
atoms
as
we
should
speak
of
them
such
for
example
as
we
represent
to
ourselves
as
floating
in
the
air
that
are
alone
the
principle
for
the
intervening
nothing
is
just
as
essential
thus
here
we
have
the
first
appearance
of
the
atomic
system
we
must
now
give
the
further
signification
and
determination
of
this
principle
a
the
logical
principle
the
principal
point
of
consideration
is
the
one
existent
for
itself
this
determination
is
a
great
principle
and
one
which
we
have
not
hitherto
had
parmenides
establishes
being
or
the
abstract
universal
heraclitus
process
the
determination
of
beingforself
belongs
to
leucippus
parmenides
says
that
the
nothing
does
not
exist
at
all
with
heraclitus
becoming
existed
only
as
the
transition
of
being
into
nothing
where
each
is
negated
but
the
view
that
each
is
simply
at
home
with
itself
the
positive
as
the
selfexistent
one
and
the
negative
as
empty
is
what
came
to
consciousness
in
leucippus
and
became
the
absolute
determination
the
atomic
principle
in
this
manner
has
not
passed
away
for
it
must
from
this
point
of
view
always
exist
the
beingforself
must
in
every
logical
philosophy69
be
an
essential
moment
and
yet
it
must
not
be
put
forward
as
ultimate
in
the
logical
progression
from
being
and
becoming
to
this
thoughtdetermination
being
as
existent
here
and
now70
certainly
first
appears
but
this
last
belongs
to
the
sphere
of
finality
and
hence
cannot
be
the
principle
of
philosophy
thus
though
the
development
of
philosophy
in
history
must
correspond
to
the
development
of
logical
philosophy
there
will
still
be
passages
in
it
which
are
absent
in
historical
development
for
instance
if
we
wished
to
make
being
as
existent
here
the
principle
it
would
be
what
we
have
in
consciousnessthere
are
things
these
things
are
finite
and
bear
a
relation
to
one
anotherbut
this
is
the
category
of
our
unthinking
knowledge
of
appearance
beingforself
on
the
other
hand
is
as
being
simple
relation
to
itself
but
through
negation
of
the
otherbeing
if
i
say
i
am
for
myself
i
not
only
am
but
i
negate
in
me
all
else
exclude
it
from
me
in
so
far
as
it
seems
to
me
to
be
external
as
negation
of
other
being
which
is
just
negation
in
relation
to
me
beingforself
is
the
negation
of
negation
and
thus
affirmation
and
this
is
as
i
call
it
absolute
negativity
in
which
mediation
indeed
is
present
but
a
mediation
which
is
just
as
really
taken
away
the
principle
of
the
one
is
altogether
ideal
and
belongs
entirely
to
thought
even
though
we
wish
to
say
that
atoms
exist
the
atom
may
be
taken
materially
but
it
is
supersensuous
purely
intellectual
in
our
times
too
more
especially
through
the
instrumentality
of
gassendi
this
conception
of
atoms
has
been
renewed
the
atoms
of
leucippus
are
however
not
molecules
the
small
particles
of
physics
in
leucippus
according
to
aristotle
de
gen
et
corr
i
8
there
is
to
be
found
the
idea
that
atoms
are
invisible
because
of
the
smallness
of
their
body
which
is
much
like
the
way
in
which
molecules
are
nowadays
spoken
of
but
this
is
merely
a
way
of
speaking
of
them
the
one
can
neither
be
seen
nor
shown
with
magnifying
glasses
or
measures
because
it
is
an
abstraction
of
thought
what
is
shown
is
always
matter
that
is
put
together
it
is
just
as
futile
when
as
in
modern
times
men
try
by
the
microscope
to
investigate
the
inmost
part
of
the
organism
the
soul
and
think
they
can
discover
it
by
means
of
sight
and
feeling
thus
the
principle
of
the
one
is
altogether
ideal
but
not
in
the
sense
of
being
in
thought
or
in
the
head
alone
but
in
such
a
way
that
thought
is
made
the
true
essence
of
things
leucippus
understood
it
so
and
his
philosophy
is
consequently
not
at
all
empirical
tennemann
vol

p
261
on
the
other
hand
says
quite
wrongly
the
system
of
leucippus
is
opposed
to
that
of
the
eleatics
he
recognizes
the
empirical
world
as
the
only
objective
reality
and
body
as
the
only
kind
of
existence
but
the
atom
and
the
vacuum
are
not
things
of
experience
leucippus
says
that
it
is
not
the
senses
through
which
we
become
conscious
of
the
truth
and
thereby
he
has
established
an
idealism
in
the
higher
sense
and
not
one
which
is
merely
subjective
b
the
constitution
of
the
world
however
abstract
this
principle
might
be
to
leucippus
he
was
anxious
to
make
it
concrete
the
meaning
of
atom
is
the
individual
the
indivisible
in
another
form
the
one
is
thus
individuality
the
determination
of
subjectivity
the
universal
and
on
the
other
side
the
individual
are
great
determinations
which
are
involved
in
everything
and
men
first
know
what
they
have
in
these
abstract
determinations
when
they
recognize
in
the
concrete
that
even
there
they
are
predominant
to
leucippus
and
democritus
this
principle
which
afterwards
came
to
light
with
epicurus
remained
physical
but
it
also
appears
in
what
is
intellectual
mind
indeed
is
also
an
atom
and
one
but
as
one
within
itself
it
is
at
the
same
time
infinitely
full
in
freedom
right
and
law
in
exercising
will
our
only
concern
is
with
this
opposition
of
universality
and
individuality
in
the
sphere
of
the
state
the
point
of
view
that
the
single
will
is
as
an
atom
the
absolute
may
be
maintained
the
more
modern
theories
of
the
state
which
also
made
themselves
of
practical
effect
are
of
this
kind
the
state
must
rest
on
the
universal
that
is
on
the
will
that
exists
in
and
for
itself
if
it
rests
on
that
of
the
individual
it
becomes
atomic
and
is
comprehended
in
accordance
with
the
thoughtdetermination
of
the
one
as
is
the
case
in
rousseaus
contrat
social
from
what
aristotle
tells
us
in
the
passage
last
quoted
leucippus
idea
of
all
that
is
concrete
and
actual
is
further
this
the
full
is
nothing
simple
for
it
is
an
infinitely
manifold
these
infinitely
many
move
in
the
vacuum
for
the
vacuum
exists
their
conglomeration
brings
about
origination
that
is
of
an
existing
thing
or
what
is
for
the
senses
disintegration
and
separation
result
in
passing
away
all
other
categories
are
included
here
activity
and
passivity
subsist
in
the
fact
that
they
are
contiguous
but
their
contiguity
is
not
their
becoming
one
for
from
that
which
is
truly
abstractly
one
there
does
not
come
a
number
nor
from
that
which
is
truly
many
one
or
it
may
be
said
they
are
in
fact
neither
passive
nor
active
for
they
merely
abide
through
the
vacuum
without
having
as
their
principle
process
atoms
thus
are
even
in
their
apparent
union
in
that
which
we
call
things
separated
from
one
another
through
the
vacuum
which
is
purely
negative
and
foreign
to
them
ie
their
relation
is
not
inherent
in
themselves
but
is
with
something
other
than
them
in
which
they
remain
what
they
are
this
vacuum
the
negative
in
relation
to
the
affirmative
is
also
the
principle
of
the
movement
of
atoms
they
are
so
to
speak
solicited
by
the
vacuum
to
fill
up
and
to
negate
it
these
are
the
doctrines
of
the
atomists
we
see
that
we
have
reached
the
extreme
limits
of
these
thoughts
for
when
relation
comes
into
question
we
step
beyond
them
being
and
nonbeing
as
something
thought
which
when
represented
for
consciousness
as
differing
in
regard
to
one
another
are
the
plenum
and
the
vacuum
have
no
diversity
in
themselves
for
the
plenum
has
likewise
negativity
in
itself
as
independent
it
excludes
what
is
different
it
is
one
and
infinitely
many
ones
while
the
vacuum
is
not
exclusive
but
pure
continuity
both
these
opposites
the
one
and
continuity
being
now
settled
nothing
is
easier
to
imagine
than
that
atoms
should
float
in
existent
continuity
now
being
separated
and
now
united
and
thus
that
their
union
should
be
only
a
superficial
relation
or
a
synthesis
that
is
not
determined
through
the
inherent
nature
of
what
is
united
but
in
which
these
selfexistent
beings
really
remain
separated
still
but
this
is
an
altogether
external
relationship
the
purely
independent
is
united
to
the
independent
and
thus
a
mechanical
combination
alone
results
all
that
is
living
spiritual
c
is
then
merely
thrown
together
and
change
origination
creation
are
simple
union
however
highly
these
principles
are
to
be
esteemed
as
a
forward
step
they
at
once
reveal
to
us
their
total
inadequacy
as
is
also
the
case
when
we
enter
with
them
on
further
concrete
determinations
nevertheless
we
need
not
add
what
is
in
great
measure
added
by
the
conception
of
a
later
date
that
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
chaos
a
void
filled
with
atoms
which
afterwards
became
united
and
orderly
and
that
the
world
thereby
arose
it
is
now
and
ever
that
what
implicitly
exists
is
the
plenum
and
the
vacuum
the
satisfying
point
of
view
which
natural
science
found
in
such
thoughts
is
just
the
simple
fact
that
in
these
the
existent
is
in
its
antithesis
as
what
is
thought
and
what
is
opposed
to
thought
and
is
hereby
what
exists
in
and
for
itself
the
atomists
are
therefore
generally
speaking
opposed
to
the
idea
of
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
this
world
by
means
of
a
foreign
principle
it
is
in
the
theory
of
atoms
that
science
first
feels
released
from
the
sense
of
having
no
foundation
for
the
world
for
if
nature
is
represented
as
created
and
held
together
by
another
it
is
conceived
of
as
not
existent
in
itself
and
thus
as
having
its
notion
outside
itself
ie
its
principle
or
origin
is
foreign
to
it
and
it
has
no
principle
as
such
only
being
conceivable
from
the
will
of
another
as
it
is
it
is
contingent
devoid
of
necessity
and
notion
in
itself
in
the
conception
of
the
atomist
however
we
have
the
conception
of
the
inherency
of
nature
that
is
to
say
thought
finds
itself
in
it
or
its
principle
is
in
itself
something
thought
and
the
notion
finds
its
satisfaction
in
conceiving
and
establishing
it
as
notion
in
abstract
existence
nature
has
its
ground
in
itself
and
is
simply
for
itself
the
atom
and
the
vacuum
are
just
such
simple
notions
but
we
cannot
here
see
or
find
more
than
the
formal
fact
that
quite
general
and
simple
principles
the
antithesis
between
the
one
and
continuity
are
represented
if
we
proceed
from
a
wider
richer
point
of
view
in
nature
and
demand
that
from
the
atomic
theory
it
too
must
be
made
comprehensible
the
satisfaction
at
once
disappears
and
we
see
the
impossibility
of
getting
any
further
hence
we
must
get
beyond
these
pure
thoughts
of
continuity
and
discontinuity
for
these
negations
the
units
are
not
in
and
for
themselves
the
atoms
are
indivisible
and
like
themselves
or
their
principle
is
made
pure
continuity
so
that
they
may
be
said
to
come
directly
into
one
clump
the
conception
certainly
keeps
them
separate
and
gives
them
a
sensuously
represented
being
but
if
they
are
alike
they
are
as
pure
continuity
the
same
as
what
is
empty
but
that
which
is
is
concrete
and
determined
how
then
can
diversity
be
conceived
of
from
these
principles
whence
comes
the
determinate
character
of
plants
colour
form
the
point
is
that
though
these
atoms
as
small
particles
may
be
allowed
to
subsist
as
independent
their
union
becomes
merely
a
combination
which
is
altogether
external
and
accidental
the
determinate
difference
is
missed
the
one
as
that
which
is
for
itself
loses
all
its
determinateness
if
various
matters
electrical
magnetic
and
luminous
are
assumed
and
at
the
same
time
a
mechanical
shifting
about
of
molecules
on
the
one
hand
unity
is
quite
disregarded
and
on
the
other
no
rational
word
is
uttered
in
regard
to
the
transition
of
phenomena
but
only
what
is
tautological
since
leucippus
and
democritus
wished
to
go
further
the
necessity
of
a
more
definite
distinction
than
this
superficial
one
of
union
and
separation
was
introduced
and
they
sought
to
bring
this
about
by
ascribing
diversity
to
atoms
and
indeed
by
making
their
diversity
infinite
aristotle
met
i
4
says
this
diversity
they
sought
to
determine
in
three
ways
they
say
that
atoms
differ
in
figure
as
a
does
from
n
in
order
place
as
an
from
na
in
positionas
to
whether
they
stand
upright
or
lieas
z
from
n
from
these
all
other
differences
must
come
we
see
that
figure
order
and
posture
are
again
external
relationships
indifferent
determinations
ie
unessential
relations
which
do
not
affect
the
nature
of
the
thing
in
itself
nor
its
immanent
determinateness
for
their
unity
is
only
in
another
taken
on
its
own
account
this
difference
is
indeed
inconsistent
for
as
the
entirely
simple
one
the
atoms
are
perfectly
alike
and
thus
any
such
diversity
cannot
come
into
question
we
here
have
an
endeavour
to
lead
the
sensuous
back
into
few
determinations
aristotle
de
gen
et
corr
i
8
says
in
this
connection
of
leucippus
he
wished
to
bring
the
conception
of
the
phenomenal
and
sensuous
perception
nearer
and
thereby
represented
movement
origination
and
decease
as
existent
in
themselves
in
this
we
see
no
more
than
that
actuality
from
him
receives
its
rights
while
others
speak
only
of
deception
but
when
leucippus
in
the
end
represents
the
atom
as
also
fashioned
in
itself
he
brings
existence
certainly
so
much
nearer
to
sensuous
perception
but
not
to
the
notion
we
must
indeed
go
on
to
fashioning
but
so
far
we
are
still
a
long
way
off
from
the
determination
of
continuity
and
discretion
aristotle
de
sensu
4
therefore
says
democritus
and
most
of
the
other
ancient
philosophers
are
when
they
speak
of
what
is
sensuous
very
awkward
because
they
wish
to
make
all
that
is
felt
into
something
tangible
they
reduce
everything
to
what
is
evident
to
the
sense
of
touch
black
being
rough
and
white
smooth
all
sensuous
qualities
are
thus
only
led
back
to
form
to
the
various
ways
of
uniting
molecules
which
make
any
particular
thing
capable
of
being
tasted
or
smelt
and
this
endeavour
is
one
which
is
also
made
by
the
atomists
of
modern
times
the
french
particularly
from
descartes
onward
stand
in
this
category
it
is
the
instinct
of
reason
to
understand
the
phenomenal
and
the
perceptible
only
the
way
is
false
it
is
a
quite
unmeaning
undetermined
universality
since
figure
order
posture
and
form
constitute
the
only
determination
of
what
is
in
itself
nothing
is
said
as
to
how
these
moments
are
experienced
as
colour
and
indeed
variety
of
colour
c
the
transition
to
other
than
mechanical
determinations
is
not
made
or
it
shows
itself
to
be
shallow
and
barren
how
it
was
that
leucippus
from
these
poor
principles
of
atoms
and
of
the
vacuum
which
he
never
got
beyond
because
he
took
them
to
be
the
absolute
hazarded
a
construction
of
the
whole
world
which
may
appear
to
us
as
strange
as
it
is
empty
diogenes
laertius
tells
us
ix
3133
in
an
account
which
seems
meaningless
enough
but
the
nature
of
the
subject
allows
of
little
better
and
we
can
do
no
more
than
observe
from
it
the
barrenness
of
this
conception
it
runs
thus
atoms
divergent
in
form
propel
themselves
through
their
separation
from
the
infinite
into
the
great
vacuum
democritus
adds
to
this
by
means
of
their
mutual
resistance

and
a
tremulous
swinging
motion
71
here
gathered
they
form
one
vortex

where
by
dashing
together
and
revolving
round
in
all
sorts
of
ways
the
like
are
separated
off
with
the
like
but
since
they
are
of
equal
weight
when
they
cannot
on
account
of
their
number
move
in
any
way
the
finer
go
into
outer
vacuum
being
so
to
speak
forced
out
and
the
others
remain
together
and
being
entangled
run
one
against
another
and
form
the
first
round
system
but
this
stands
apart
like
a
husk
that
holds
within
it
all
sorts
of
bodies
since
these
in
pressing
towards
the
middle
make
a
vortex
movement
this
encircling
skin
becomes
thin
because
from
the
action
of
the
vortex
they
are
continually
running
together
the
earth
arises
in
this
way
because
these
bodies
collected
in
the
middle
remain
together
that
which
encircles
and
which
is
like
a
husk
again
becomes
increased
by
means
of
the
adherence
of
external
bodies
and
since
it
also
moves
within
the
vortex
it
draws
everything
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
to
itself
the
union
of
some
of
these
bodies
again
forms
a
system
first
the
moist
and
slimy
and
then
the
dry
and
that
which
circles
in
the
vortex
of
the
whole
after
that
being
ignited
they
constitute
the
substance
of
the
stars
the
outer
circle
is
the
sun
the
inner
the
moon
c
this
is
an
empty
representation
there
is
no
interest
in
these
dry
confused
ideas
of
circlemotion
and
of
what
is
later
on
called
attraction
and
repulsion
beyond
the
fact
that
the
different
kinds
of
motion
are
looked
at
as
the
principle
of
matter
c
the
soul
finally
aristotle
relates
de
anim
i

that
in
regard
to
the
soul
leucippus
and
democritus
said
that
it
is
spherical
atoms
we
find
further
from
plutarch
de
plac
phil
iv

that
democritus
applied
himself
to
the
relation
borne
by
consciousness
to
the
explanation
amongst
other
things
of
the
origin
of
feelings
because
with
him
the
conceptions
that
from
things
fine
surfaces
so
to
speak
free
themselves
and
fly
into
the
eyes
ears
c
first
began
we
see
that
thus
far
democritus
expressed
the
difference
between
the
moments
of
implicit
being
and
beingforanother
more
distinctly
for
he
said

according

and
so
do
cold

and

only
the
indivisible

but
by
this
the
way
is
at
once
opened
up
to
the
false
idealism
that
means
to
be
done
with
what
is
objective
by
bringing
it
into
relation
with
consciousness
merely
saying
of
it
that
it
is
my
feeling
thereby
sensuous
individuality
is
indeed
annulled
in
the
form
of
being
but
it
still
remains
the
same
sensuous
manifold
a
sensuously
notionless
manifold
of

is
established

which
there

his
works
are
earlier
but
not
only
did
he
philosophize
earlier
as
regards
time
that
is
at
a
younger
age
but
in
reference
to
the
stage
reached
by
the
notion
his
philosophy
is
earlier
and
less
mature
than
that
of
anaxagoras
from
diogenes

of

he
also
seems
to
have
been
a
kind
of
magician
and
sorcerer
like
pythagoras
during
his
life
he
was
much
respected
by
his
fellowcitizens
and
after
his
death
a
statue
was
erected
to
him
in
his
native
town
his
fame
extended
very
far
he
did
not
live
apart
like
heraclitus
but
in
the
exercise
of
great
influence
on
the
affairs
of
the
town
of
agrigentum
like
parmenides
in
elea
he
acquired
the
credit
after
the
death
of
meton
the
ruler
of
agrigentum
of
bringing
about
a
free
constitution
and
equal
rights
to
all
citizens
he
likewise
frustrated
several
attempts
which
were
made
by
people
of
agrigentum
to
seize
upon
the
rulership
of
their
city
and
when
the
esteem
of
his
fellowcitizens
rose
so
high
that
they
offered
him
the
crown
he
rejected
their
offers
and
lived
ever
after
amongst
them
as
a
respected
private
individual
both
of
his
life
and
death
much
which
was
fabulous
was
told
seeing
that
he
was
famous
in
life
we
are
told
that
he
wished
not
to
appear
to
die
an
ordinary
death
as
a
proof
that
he
was
not
a
mortal
man
but
had
merely
passed
out
of
sight
after
a
feast
he
is
said
either
to
have
suddenly
disappeared
or
else
to
have
been
on
etna
with
his
friends
and
suddenly
to
have
been
seen
of
them
no
more
but
what
became
of
him
was
revealed
by
the
fact
that
one
of
his
shoes
was
thrown
up
by
etna
and
found
by
one
of
his
friends
this
made
it
clear
that
he
threw
himself
into
etna
thereby
to
withdraw
himself
from
the
notice
of
mankind
and
to
give
rise
to
the
idea
that
he
did
not
really
die
but
that
he
was
taken
up
amongst
the
gods
the
origin
and
occasion
for
this
fable
seems
to
lie

with
them
he
is
sometimes
considered
to
have
been
a
pythagorean
like
parmenides
and
zeno
but
this
is
the
only
ground
for
such
a
statement
it
is
a
question
whether
he
belonged
to
the
league
his
philosophy
has
no
resemblance
to
the
pythagorean
according
to
diogenes
laertius

he
was
also
called
zenos
fellowpupil
there
have
indeed
been
many
isolated
reflections
of
a
physical
kind
preserved
to
us
as
also
some
words
of
exhortation
and
in
him
thought
as
penetrating
within
reality
and
the
knowledge
of
nature
seem
to
have
attained
to
greater
breadth
and
compass
we
find
in
him
however
less
speculative
depth
than
in
heraclitus
but
a
notion
more
imbued
with
the
point
of
view
of
reality
and
a
culture
derived
from
natural
philosophy
or
the
contemplation
of
nature
empedocles
is
more
poetic
than
definitely
philosophical
he
is
not
very
interesting
and
much
cannot
be
made
of
his
philosophy
as
to
the
particular
notion
which
governs
it
and
which
really
begins
in
it
to
appear
we
may
call
it
combination
or
synthesis
it
is
as
combination
that
the
unity
of
opposites
first
presents
itself
this
notion
first
opening
up
with
heraclitus
is
while
in
a
condition
of
rest
conceived
of
as
combination
before
thought
grasps
the
universal
in
anaxagoras
empedocles
synthesis
as
a
completion
of
the
relationship
thus
belongs
to
heraclitus
whose
speculative
idea
though
in
reality
is
process
but
this
is
so
without
the
individual
moments
in
reality
being
mutually
related
as
notions
empedocles
conception
of
synthesis
holds
good
to
the
present
day
he
also
is
the
originator
of
the
common
idea
that
has
even
come
down
to
us
of
regarding
the
four
known
physical
elements
of
fire
air
water
and
earth
as
fundamental
by
chemists
they
are
certainly
no
longer
held
to
be
elements
because
they
understand
by
elements
a
simple
chemical
substance
i
will
now
give
empedocles
ideas
shortly
and
draw
the
many
units
mentioned
into
the
connection
of
a
whole
his
general
ideas
aristotle75
shortly
sums
up
thus
to
the
three
elements
fire
air
and
water
each
of
which
was
in
turn
considered
as
the
principle
from
which
everything
proceeded
empedocles
added
the
earth
as
the
fourth
corporeal
element
saying
that
it
is
these
which
always
remain
the
same
never
becoming
but
being
united
and
separated
as
the
more
or
the
less
combining
into
one
and
coming
out
of
one
carbon
metal
c
are
not
something
existing
in
and
for
itself
which
remains
constant
and
never
becomes
thus
nothing
metaphysical
is
signified
by
them
but
with
empedocles
this
undoubtedly
is
the
case
every
particular
thing
arises
through
some
kind
of
union
of
the
four
these
four
elements
to
our
ordinary
idea
are
not
so
many
sensuous
things
if
we
consider
them
as
universal
elements
for
looked
at
sensuously
there
are
various
other
sensuous
things
all
that
is
organic
for
example
is
of
another
kind
and
further
earth
as
one
as
simple
pure
earth
does
not
exist
for
it
is
in
manifold
determinateness
in
the
idea
of
four
elements
we
have
the
elevation
of
sensuous
ideas
into
thought
aristotle
further
says
in
reference
to
the
abstract
notion
of
their
relation
to
one
another
met
i

that
empedocles
did
not
only
require
the
four
elements
as
principles
but
also
friendship
and
strife
which
we
have
already
met
with
in
heraclitus
it
is
at
once
evident
that
these
are
of
another
kind
because
they
are
properly
speaking
universal
he
has
the
four
natural
elements
as
the
real
and
friendship
and
strife
as
the
ideal
principles
so
that
six
elements
of
which
sextus76
often
speaks
make
their
appearance
in
lines
that
aristotle

for
us
there
we
have
the
idea
that

the
very
totality
of

so
on
empedocles
also
speaks
of
the
process
of
these
elements
but
he
did
not
comprehend
it
further
the
point
to
be
remarked
is
that
he
represented
their
unity
as
a
combination
in
this
synthetic
union
which
is
a
superficial
relation
devoid
of
notion
being
partly
related
and
partly
unrelated
the
contradiction
necessarily
results
that
at
one
time
the
unity
of
elements
is
established
and
at
another
their
separation
the
unity
is
not
the
universal
unity
in
which
they
are
moments
being
even
in
their
diversity
one
and
in
their
unity
different
for
these
two
moments
unity
and
diversity
fall
asunder
and
union
and
separation
are
quite
indeterminate
relationships
empedocles
says
in
the
first
book
of
his
poem
on
nature
as
given
by
sturz
p
517
v
106109
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
nature
only
a
combination
and
separation
of
what
is
combined
it
is
merely
called
nature
by
men
that
is
to
say
that
which
constitutes
anything
as
being
its
elements
or
parts
is
not
as
yet
called
its
nature
but
only
its
determinate
unity
for
example
the
nature
of
an
animal
is
its
constant
and
real
determinateness
its
kind
its
universality
which
is
simple
but
empedocles
does
away
with
nature
in
this
sense
for
every
thing
according
to
him
is
the
combination
of
simple
elements
and
thus
not
in
itself
the
universal
simple
and
true
this
is
not
what
is
signified
by
us
when
we
speak
of
nature
now
this
nature
in
which
a
thing
moves
in
accordance
with
its
own
end
aristotle
de

misses
in
empedocles
in
later
times
this
conception
was
still
further
lost
because
the
elements
were
thus
existent
simply
in
themselves
there
was
properly
speaking
no
process
established
in
them
for
in
process
they
are
only
vanishing
moments
and
not
existent
in
themselves
being
thus
implicit
they
must
have
been
unchangeable
or
they
could
not
constitute
themselves
into
a
unity
for
in
the
one
their
subsistence
or
their
implicit
existence
would
be
destroyed
but
because
empedocles
says
that
things
subsist
from
these
elements
he
immediately
establishes
their
unity
these
are
the
principal
points
in
empedocles
philosophy
i
will
quote
the
remarks
that
aristotle
met
i
4
makes
in
this
regard

if
we
wish
to
follow
this
up
and
do
so
in
accordance
with
the
understanding
not
merely
stumbling
over
it
like
empedocles
we
should
say
that
friendship
is
the
principle
of
good
and
strife
the
principle
of
evil
so
that
in
a
measure
we
may
assert
that
empedocles
maintainedand
was
the
first
to
do
sothat
the
evil
and
the
good
are
the
absolute
principles
because
the
good
is
the
principle
of
all
good
and
the
bad
the
principle
of
all
evil
aristotle
shows
the
trace
of
universality
present
here
for
to
him
it
may
be
termed
essential
in
dealing
with
the
notion
of
the
principle
that
which
is
in
and
for
itself
but
this
is
only
the
notion
or
the
thought
which
is
present
in
and
for
itself
we
have
not
yet
seen
such
a
principle
for
we
find
it
first
in
anaxagoras
if
aristotle
found
the
principle
of
motion
missed
in
ancient
philosophers
in
the
becoming
of
heraclitus
he
again
missed
in
heraclitus
the
still
deeper
principle
of
the
good
and
hence
wished
to
discover
it
in
empedocles
by
the
good
the
why
is
to
be
understood
that
which
is
an
end
in
and
for
itself
which
is
clearly
established
in
itself
which
is
on
its
own
account
and
through
which
all
else
is
the
end
has
the
determination
of
activity
the
bringing
forth
of
itself
so
that
it
as
end
to
itself
is
the
idea
the
notion
that
makes
itself
objective
and
in
its
objectivity
is
identical
with
itself
aristotle
thus
entirely
controverts
heraclitus
because
his
principle
is
change
alone
without
remaining
like
self
maintaining
self
and
going
back
within
self

aristotle
also
says
in
criticizing
further
the
relationship
and
determination
of
these
two
universal
principles
of
friendship
and
strife
as
of
union
and
separation
that
empedocles
neither
adequately
made
use
of
them
nor
discovered
in
them
what
they
involved



for
with
him
friendship
frequently
divides
and
strife
unites
that
is
when
the
all
falls
asunder
through
strife
amongst
the
elements
fire
is
thereby
united
into
one
and
so
is
each
of
the
other
elements
the
separation
of
the
elements
which
are
comprised
within
the
all
is
just
as
necessarily
the
union
amongst
themselves
of
the
parts
of
each
element
that
which
on
the
one
hand
is
the
coming
into
separation
as
independent
is
at
the
same
time
something
united
within
itself
but
when
everything
through
friendship
goes
back
into
one
it
is
necessary
that
the
parts
of
each
element
undergo
separation
again
the
being
in
one
is
itself
a
manifold
a
diverse
relation
of
the
four
diversities
and
thus
the
going
together
is
likewise
a
separation
this
is
the
case
generally
with
all
determinateness
that
it
must
in
itself
be
the
opposite
and
must
manifest
itself
as
such
the
remark
that
speaking
generally
there
is
no
union
without
separation
no
separation
without
union
is
a
profound
one
identity
and
nonidentity
are
thoughtdeterminations
of
this
kind
which
cannot
be
separated
the
reproach
made
by
aristotle
is
one
that
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
thing
and
when
aristotle
says
that
empedocles
although
younger
than
heraclitus
was
the
first
to
maintain
such
principles
because
he
did
not
assert
that
the
principle
of
motion
is
one
but
that
it
is
different
and
opposed
this
certainly
relates
to
the
fact
that
he
thought
it
was
in
empedocles
that
he
first
found
design
although
his
utterances
on
the
subject
were
dubious

as
to
the
real
moments
in
which
this
ideal
realizes
itself
aristotle
further
says
he
does
not
speak
of
them
as
fourequivalents
in
juxtapositionbut
on
the
contrary
as
two
fire
he
puts
by
itself
on
the
one
side
and
the
three
others
earth
air
and
water
on
the
other
what
would
be
most
interesting
is
the
determination
of
their
relationship

in
what
deals
with
the
relationship
of
the
two
ideal
moments
friendship
and
strife
and
of
the
four
real
elements
there
is
thus
nothing
rational
for
empedocles
according
to
aristotle
met
xii
10
did
not
properly
separate
but
coordinated
them
so
that
we
often
see
them
in
proximity
and
counted
as
having
equal
value
but
it
is
selfevident
that
empedocles
also
separated
these
two
sides
the
real
and
the
ideal
and
expressed
thought
as
their
relation

aristotle
says
with
justice
de
gen
et
corr
i
1
that
empedocles
contradicts
both
himself
and
appearances
for
at
one
time
he
maintains
that
none
of
the
elements
springs
out
of
the
other
but
all
else
comes
from
them
and
at
another
time
he
makes
them
into
a
whole
through
friendship
and
again
destroys
this
unity
through
strife
thus
through
particular
differences
and
qualities
one
becomes
water
the
other
fire
c
now
if
the
particular
differences
are
taken
away
and
they
can
be
taken
away
since
they
have
arisen
it
is
evident
that
water
arises
from
earth
and
the
reverse
the
all
was
not
yet
fire
earth
water
and
air
when
these
were
still
one
so
that
it
is
not
clear
whether
he
made
the
one
or
the
many
to
be
properly
speaking
real
existence
because
the
elements
become
one
their
special
character
that
through
which
water
is
water
is
nothing
in
itself
that
is
they
are
passing
into
something
different
but
this
contradicts
the
statement
that
they
are
the
absolute
elements
or
that
they
are
implicit
he
considers
actual
things
as
an
intermingling
of
elements
but
in
regard
to
their
first
origin
he
thinks
that
everything
springs
from
one
through
friendship
and
strife
this
customary
absence
of
thought
is
in
the
nature
of
synthetic
conceptions
it
now
upholds
unity
then

who
came
before

at

as
aristotle
says
hitherto
philosophers
may
be
compared
to
the
fencers
who
fence
in
an
unscientific
way
just
as
the
latter
often
make
good
thrusts
in
their
struggle
though
not
by
any
skill
these
philosophers
seem
to
speak
without
any
knowledge
of
what
they
say
now
if
anaxagoras
as
a
sober
man
amongst
drunkards
was
the
first
to
reach
this
consciousnessfor
he
says
that
pure
thought
is
the
actually
existent
universal
and
truehe
yet
to
a
considerable
extent
still
thrusts
into
space
the
connection
of
his
philosophy
with
what
precedes
is
as
follows
in
heraclitus
idea
as
motion
all
moments
are
absolutely
vanishing
empedocles
represents
the
gathering
together
of
this
motion
into
a
unity
but
into
a
synthetic
unity
and
with
leucippus
and
democritus
it
is
the
same
with
empedocles
however
the
moments
of
this
unity
are
the
existent
elements
of
fire

c
and
with
the
others
pure
abstractions
implicit
being

but
in
this
way

is
directly
asserted
for
the
opposing
elements

no
longer
any
sensuous
support
we
have
had

they
are

not

are
they

the

the

however
taken
from

they
are

sort
of

anaxagoras
now
says
that
it
is
not

or

really
are

that
it
is

itself

all
embracing
which

the

from

itself
while
in
the
synthesis
of

what
is

is
still
apart
from
it

independent
and

not

however
thought
as
pure
free
process
in
itself
is
the
selfdetermining
universal
and
is
not
distinguished
from
conscious
thought
in
anaxagoras
quite
new
ground

thus
opened
up
anaxagoras
concludes
this
period
and
after
him
a
fresh
one
begins
in
accordance
with
the
favourite
idea
of
there
being
a
genealogical
descent
of
principles
from
the
teacher
to
the
taught
because
he
was
an
ionian
he
is
often
represented
as
perpetuating
the
ionic
school
and
as
an
ionic
philosopher
hermotimus
of
clazomen
too
was
his
teacher
to
support
this
theory
diogenes
laertius
ii

makes
him
a
disciple
of
anaximenes
whose
birth
is
however
placed
in
ol
5558
or
about
sixty
years
earlier
than
that
of
anaxagoras
aristotle
says
met
i
3
that
anaxagoras
first
began
by
these
determinations
to
express
absolute
reality
as
understanding
aristotle
and
others
after
him
such
as

mention
the
bare
fact
that
hermotimus
gave
rise
to
this
conception
but
it
was
clearly
due
to
anaxagoras
little
is
gained
if
such
a
fact
were
true
since
we
learn
no
more
about
the
philosophy
of
hermotimus
it
cannot
have
been
much
others
have
made
numerous
historical
researches
respecting
this
hermotimus
the
name
we
have
already
mentioned
amongst
those
of
whom
it
is
said
that
pythagoras
existed
in
them
before
he
lived
as
pythagoras
we
also
have
a
story
of
hermotimus
to
the
effect
that
he
possessed
the
peculiar
gift
of
being
able
to
make
his
soul
quit
his
body
but
this
did
him
bad
service
in
the
end
since
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
a
dispute
and
who
besides
knew
very
well
how
matters
stood
showed
to
their
acquaintances
this
souldeserted
body
as
dead
and
it
was
burnt
before
the
soul
reinstated
itselfwhich
soul
must
have
been
astonished80
it
is
not
worth
while
to
investigate
what
lies
at
the
ground
of
these
ancient
stories
ie
into
how
we
should
regard
the
matter
we
may
think
of
it
as
implying
a
state
of
ecstasy
we
must
consider
the
life
of
anaxagoras
before
his
philosophy

to
diogenes

bc
comes
earlier
than
democritus
and
in
age
also
precedes
empedocles
yet
on
the
whole
he
was
contemporaneous
with
these
as
also
with
parmenides
he
was
as
old
as
zeno
and
lived
somewhat
earlier
than
socrates
but
still
they
were
acquainted
with
one
another
his
native
town
was
clazomen
in
lydia
not
very
far
from
colophon
and
ephesus
and
situated
on
an
isthmus
by
which
a
great
peninsula
is
connected
with
the
mainland
his
life
is
shortly
summed
up
in
the
statement
that
he
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
the
sciences
withdrew
from
public
affairs
according
to
valerius
maximus

made

to

415
in
the
fortyfifth
year
of
his
age
in
the
81st
olympiad
456
bc
and
at
a
propitious
time
he
came
to
athens
with
him
we
thus
find
philosophy
in
greece
proper
where
so
far
there
had
been
none
and
coming
indeed
as
far
as
athens
hitherto
either
asia
minor
or
italy
had
been
the
seat
of
philosophy
though
when
the
inhabitants
of
asia
minor
fell
under
persian
rule
with
their
loss
of
freedom
it
expired
amongst
them
anaxagoras
himself
a
native
of
asia
minor
lived
in
the
important
period
between
the
war
of
the
medes
and
the
age
of
pericles
principally
in
athens
which
had
now
reached
the
zenith
of
its
greatness
for
it
was
both
the
head
of
grecian
power
and
the
seat
and
centre
of
the
arts
and
sciences
athens
after
the
persian
wars
brought
the
greater
part
of
the
greek
islands
into
subjection
as
also
a
number
of
maritime
towns
in
thrace
and
even
further
into
the
black
sea
as
the
greatest
artists
collected
in
athens
so
also
did
the
most
noted
philosophers
and
sophists
live
therea
circle
of
luminaries
in
the
arts
and
sciences
such
as
we
have
in
schylus
sophocles
aristophanes
thucydides
diogenes
of
apollonia
protagoras
anaxagoras
and
others
from
asia
minor
pericles
then
ruled
the
state
and
raised
it
to
that
height
of
splendour
which
may
be
called
the
golden
age
in
athenian
life
anaxagoras
although
living
in
the
most
flourishing
time
of
athenian
life
touches
on
its
decay
or
rather
reaches
the
first
threatening
of
that
decay
which
ended
in
a
total
extermination
of
this
beautiful
life
what
is
of
special
interest
at
this
time
is
the
opposition
between
athens
and
lacedmon
the
two
greek
nations
which
contended
with
one
another
for
the
foremost
place
in
greece
here
we
must
therefore
allude
to
the
principles
of
these
celebrated
states
while
the
lacedmonians
had
no
arts
or
sciences
athens
had
to
thank
the
character
of
its
constitution
and
of
its
whole
spirit
for
the
fact
that
it
was
the
seat
of
the
sciences
and
fine
arts
but
the
constitution
of
lacedmon
is
also
worthy
of
high
esteem
for
it
regulated
and
restrained
the
high
doric
spirit
and
its
principal
feature
was
that
all
personal
peculiarity
was
subordinated
or
rather
sacrificed
to
the
general
aim
of
the
life
of
the
state
and
the
individual
had
the
consciousness
of
his
honour
and
sufficiency
only
in
the
consciousness
of
working
for
the
state
a
people
of
such
genuine
unity
in
whom
the
will
of
the
individual
had
properly
speaking
quite
disappeared
were
united
by
an
indestructible
bond
and
lacedmon
was
hence
placed
at
the
head
of
greece
and
obtained
the
leadership
which
we
find
it
held
among
the
argives
in
the
days
of
troy
this
is
a
great
principle
which
must
exist
in
every
true
state
but
which
with
the
lacedmonians
retained
its
onesided
character
this
onesidedness
was
avoided
by
the
athenians
and
by
that
means
they
became
the
greater
in
lacedmon
personality
proper
was
so
much
disregarded
that
the
individual
could
not
have
free
development
or
expression
individuality
was
not
recognized
and
hence
not
brought
into
harmony
with
the
common
end
of
the
state
this
abrogation
of
the
rights
of
subjectivity
which
expressed
in
his
own
way
is
also
found
in
platos
republic
was
carried
very
far
with
the
lacedmonians
but
the
universal
is
living
spirit
only
in
so
far
as
the
individual
consciousness
finds
itself
as
such
within
it
the
universal
is
not
constituted
of
the
immediate
life
and
being
of
the
individual
the
mere
substance
but
formed
of
conscious
life
as
individuality
which
separates
itself
from
the
universal
is
powerless
and
falls
to
the
ground
the
onesided
universal
the
morality
of
individuality
cannot
stand
firm
the
lacedmonian
spirit
which
had
not
taken
into
account
the
freedom
of
consciousness
and
whose
universal
had
isolated
itself
therefrom
had
hence
to
see
it
break
forth
in
opposition
to
the
universal
and
though
the
first
to
come
forward
as
the
liberators
of
greece
from
its
tyranny
were
the
spartans
whom
even
athens
thanks
for
the
expulsion
of
the
descendants
of
pisistratus
their
relationship
to
their
confederates
soon
passes
into
that
of
common
mean
tyranny
within
the
state
it
likewise
ends
in
a
harsh
aristocracy
just
as
the
fixed
equilibrium
of
property
each
family
retaining
its
inheritance
and
through
forbidding
the
possession
of
money
or
trade
and
commerce
preventing
the
possibility
of
inequality
in
riches
passes
into
an
avarice
which
as
opposed
to
this
universal
is
brutal
and
mean
this
essential
moment
of
particularity
not
being
taken
into
the
state
and
hence
not
made
legal
and
moral
moral
first
of
all
comes
forth
as
vice
in
a
rational
organization
all
the
elements
of
the
idea
are
present
if
the
liver
were
isolated
as
bile
it
would
become
not
more
and
not
less
active
but
becoming
antagonistic
it
would
isolate
itself
from
the
corporate
economy
of
the
body
solon
on
the
contrary
gave
to
the
athenians
not
only
equality
of
laws
and
unity
of
spirit
in
their
constitution
which
was
a
purer
democracy
than
in
sparta
but
although
each
citizen
had
his
substantial
consciousness
in
unity
with
the
laws
of
the
state
he
also
gave
free
play
to
the
individual
mind
so
that
each
might
do
as
he
would
and
might
find
expression
for
himself
solon
entrusted
the
executive
to
the
people
not
to
the
ephors
and
this
became
selfgovernment
after
the
displacement
of
the
tyrants
and
thus
in
truth
a
free
people
arose
the
individual
had
the
whole
within
himself
as
he
had
his
consciousness
and
action
in
the
whole
thus
we
see
in
this
principle
the
formation
of
free
consciousness
and
the
freedom
of
individuality
in
its
greatness
the
principle
of
subjective
freedom
appears
at
first
however
still
in
unison
with
the
universal
principle
of
greek
morality
as
established
by
law
and
even
with
mythology
and
thus
in
its
promulgation
because
the
genius
of
its
conceptions
could
develop
freely
it
brought
about
these
masterpieces
in
the
beautiful
plastic
arts
and
the
immortal
works
of
poetry
and
history
the
principle
of
subjectivity
had
thus
far
not
taken
the
form
that
particularity
as
such
should
be
set
free
and
that
its
content
should
be
a
subjectively
particular
at
least
distinguished
from
the
universal
principle
universal
morality
universal
religion
universal
laws
thus
we
do
not
see
the
carrying
out
of
isolated
ideas
but
the
great
moral
solid
divine
content
made
in
these
works
object
for
consciousness
and
generally
brought
before
consciousness
later
we
shall
find
the
form
of
subjectivity
becoming
free
for
itself
and
appearing
in
opposition
to
the
substantial
to
morality
religion
and
law
the
basis
of
this
principle
of
subjectivity
though
it
is
still
a
merely
general
one
we
now
see
in
anaxagoras
but
amongst
this
noble
free
and
cultured
people
of
athens
he
who
had
the
happiness
to
be
first
was
pericles
and
this
circumstance
raised
him
in
the
estimation
of
the
individual
to
a
place
so
high
that
few
could
reach
it
of
all
that
is
great
amongst
men
the
power
of
ruling
over
the
will
of
men
who
have
but
one
will
is
the
greatest
for
this
controlling
individuality
must
be
both
the
most
universal
and
the
most
livinga
lot
for
a
mortal
being
than
which
hardly
any
better
can
be
found
his
individuality
was
according
to
plutarch
in
pericle

as
deep
as
it
was
perfect
as
serious
he
never
laughed
as
full
of
energy
and
restfulness
athens
had
him
the
whole
day
long
thucydides
has
preserved
some
of
pericles
speeches
to
the
people
which
allow
of
few
works
being
compared
to
them
under
pericles
the
highest
culture
of
the
moral
commonwealth
is
to
be
found
the
juncture
where
individuality
is
still
under
and
also
in
the
universal
presently
individuality
prevails
because
its
activity
falls
into
extremes
since
the
state
as
state
is
not
yet
independently
organized
within
itself
because
the
essence
of
the
athenian
state
was
the
common
spirit
and
the
religious
faith
of
individuals
in
this
constituted
their
essence
there
disappears
with
the
disappearance
of
this
faith
the
inner
being
of
the
people
since
the
spirit
is
not
in
the
form
of
the
notion
as
it
is
in
our
states
the
speedy
transition
to
this
last
is
the

subjectivity
as
being
selfreflection
when
anaxagoras
at
this
time
the
principle
of
which
has
just
been
given
came
to
athens
he
was
sought
out
by
pericles
and
as
his
friend
lived
in
very
intimate
relations
with
him
before
the
latter
occupied
himself
with
public
affairs
but
plutarch
in
pericle
4
16
also
relates
that
anaxagoras
came
to
want
because
pericles
neglected
himdid
not
supply
the
illuminating
lamp
with
oil
a
more
important
matter
is
that
anaxagoras
as
happened
later
with
socrates
and
many
other
philosophers
was
accused
of
despising
those
whom
the
people
accepted
as
gods
the
prose
of
the
understanding
came
into
contact
with
the
poetic
religious
point
of
view
it
is
distinctly
said
by
diogenes
laertius
ii
12
that
anaxagoras
believed
the
sun
and
stars
to
be
burning
stones
and
he
is
according
to
plutarch
in
pericle
6
blamed
for
having
explained
something
that
the
prophets
stated
to
be
a
marvellous
omen
in
a
natural
way
it
quite
tallies
with
this
that
he
is
said
to
have
foretold
that
on
the
day
of
gospotamos
where
the
athenians
lost
their
last
fleet
against
lysander
a
stone
should
fall
from
heaven81
the
general
remark
might
be
made
of
thales
anaximander
c
that
the
sun
moon
earth
and
stars
were
counted
as
mere
things
ie
as
objects
external
to
mind
and
that
they
no
longer
held
them
to
be
living
gods
but
represented
them
in
different
wayswhich
ideas
for
the
rest
deserve
no
further
consideration
since
these
matters
belong
properly
to
ordinary
learning
things
may
be
derived
from
thought
thought
really
brings
about
the
result
that
certain
objects
which
may
be
called
divine
and
certain
conceptions
of
these
which
may
be
called
poetic
together
with
the
whole
range
of
superstitious
beliefs
are
demolishedthey
are
brought
down
to
being
what
are
called
natural
things
for
in
thought
as
the
identity
of
itself
and
of
being
mind
knows
itself
as
the
truly
actual
so
that
for
mind
in
thought
the
unspiritual
and
material
is
brought
down
to
being
mere
things
to
the
negative
of
mind
all
the
ideas
of
those
philosophers
have
this
in
common
that
nature
is
through
them
undeified
they
brought
the
poetic
view
of
nature
down
to
the
prosaic
and
destroyed
the
poetic
point
of
view
which
ascribes
to
all
that
is
now
considered
to
be
lifeless
a
life
proper
to
itself
perhaps
also
sensation
and
it
may
be
a
being
after
the
usual
order
of
consciousness
the
loss
of
this
point
of
view
is
not
to
be
lamented
as
if
unity
with
nature
pure
faith
innocent
purity
and
childlike
spirit
went
with
it
innocent
and
childlike
it
may
certainly
have
been
but
reason
is
just
the
going
forth
from
such
innocence
and
unity
with
nature
so
soon
as
mind
grasps
itself
is
for
itself
it
must
for
that
very
reason
confront
the
other
of
itself
as
a
negation
of
consciousness
ie
look
on
it
as
something
devoid
of
mind
an
unconscious
and
lifeless
thing
and
it
must
first
come
to
itself
through
this
opposition
there
is
in
this
a
fixing
of
selfmoving
things
such
as
are
met
with
in
the
myths
of
the
ancients
who
relate
such
tales
as
that
the
argonauts
secured
the
rocks
on
the
straits
of
the
hellespont
which
formerly
moved
like
scissors
similarly
progressive
culture
consolidated
that
which
formerly
was
thought
to
have
its
own
motion
and
life
in
itself
and
made
it
into
unmoving
matter
this
transition
of
the
mythical
point
of
view
into
the
prosaic
here
comes
to
be
recognized
by
the
athenians
a
prosaic
point
of
view
such
as
this
assumes
that
man
has
requirements
quite
different
from
those
he
formerly
had
in
this
we
find
traces
of
the
powerful
necessary
conversion
brought
about
in
the
ideas
of
man
through
the
strengthening
of
thought
through
knowledge
of
himself
and
through
philosophy
the
institution
of
charges
of
atheism
which
we
shall
touch
upon
more
fully
in
dealing
with
socrates
is
in
anaxagoras
case
quite
comprehensible
from
the
specific
reason
that
the
athenians
who
were
envious
of
pericles
who
contended
with
him
for
the
first
place
and
who
did
not
venture
to
proceed
against
him
openly
took
his
favourites
to
law
and
sought
through
charges
against
his
friend
to
injure
him
thus
his
friend
aspasia
was
brought
under
accusation
and
the
noble
pericles
had
according
to
plutarch
in
pericle
32
in
order
to
save
her
from
condemnation
to
beg
the
individual
citizens
of
athens
with
tears
for
her
acquittal
the
athenian
people
in
their
freedom
demanded
such
acts
of
the
potentates
to
whom
they
allowed
supremacy
for
thereby
an
acknowledgment
was
given
of
their
subordination
to
the
people
they
thus
made
themselves
the
nemesis
in
respect
to
the
high
place
accorded
to
the
great
for
they
placed
themselves
in
a
position
of
equality
with
these
while
these
again
made
evident
their
dependence
subjection
and
powerlessness
before
the
others
what
is
told
about
the
result
of
this
charge
against
anaxagoras
is
quite
contradictory
and
uncertain
pericles
certainly
saved
him
from
condemnation
to
death
he
was
either
as
some
say
condemned
only
to
banishment
after
pericles
had
led
him
before
the
people
speaking
and
entreating
for
him
after
by
reason
of
his
age
attenuation
and
weakness
the
sympathy
of
the
people
had
been
aroused
or
else
as
others
say
with
the
help
of
pericles
he
escaped
from
athens
and
was
in
absence
condemned
to
death
the
judgment
never
being
executed
upon
him
others
again
say
that
he
was
liberated
but
from
the
vexation
that
he
felt
respecting
these
charges
and
from
apprehension
as
to
their
repetition
he
voluntarily
left
athens
and
at
about
sixty
or
seventy
years
of
age
he
died

the
universal
principle
the
logical
principle
of
anaxagoras
was
that
he
recognized
the

as
the
simple
absolute
essence
of
the
world
the
simplicity
of
the

is
not
a
being
but
a
universality
which
is
distinguished
from
itself
though
in
such
a
way
that
the
distinction
is
immediately
sublated
and
the
identity
is
set
forth
for
itself
this
universal
for
itself
sundered
exists
in
purity
only
as
thought
it
exists
also
in
nature
as
objective
existence
but
in
that
case
no
longer
purely
for
itself
but
as
having
particularity
as
an
immediate
in
it
space
and
time
are
for
example
the
most
ideal
universal
facts
in
nature
as
such
but
there
is
no
pure
space
no
pure
time
and
motion
any
more
than
any
pure
matterfor
this
universal
is
immediately
defined
space
air
earth
c
in
thought
when
i
say
i
am
i
or
i

i
i
certainly
distinguish
something
from
me
but
the
pure
unity
remains
there
is
no
movement
but
a
distinction
which
is
not
distinguished
or
the
beingforme
and
in
all
that
i
think
if
the
thought
has
a
definite
content
it
is
my
thought
i
am
thus
known
to
myself
in
this
object
this
universal
which
thus
exists
for
itself
and
the
individual
or
thought
and
being
thus
however
come
into
definite
opposition
here
the
speculative
unity
of
this
universal
with
the
individual
should
be
considered
as
it
is
posited
as
absolute
unity
but
the
comprehension
of
the
notion
itself
is
certainly
not
found
with
the
ancients
we
need
not
expect
a
pure
notion
such
as
one
of
an
understanding
realizing
itself
into
a
system
organized
as
a
universe
how
anaxagoras
enunciated
the
notion
of
the

aristotle
de
anim
i
2
goes
on
to
tell
anaxagoras
maintains
that
the
soul
is
the
principle
of
movement
yet
he
does
not
always
express
himself
fully
about
the
soul
and

he
seems
to
separate

and
soul
from
one
another
and
still
he
makes
use
of
them
as
though
they
were
the
same
existence
only
that
by
preference
he
makes
the

the
principle
of
everything
he
certainly
speaks
frequently
of
the

as
of
the
cause
of
the
beautiful
and
right
but
another
time
he
calls
it
the
soul
for
it
is
in
all
animals
in
large
as
well
as
small
the
higher
kind
and
the
lower
it
alone
of
all
existence
is
the
simple
unadulterated
and
pure
it
is
devoid
of
pain
and
is
not
in
community
with
any
other83
what
we
therefore
have
to
do
is
to
show
from
the
principle
of
motion
that
it
is
the
selfmoving
and
this
thought
is
as
existent
for
itself
as
soul
the
selfmoving
is
only
immediately
individual
the

however
as
simple
is
the
universal
thought
moves
on
account
of
something
the
end
is
the
first
simple
which
makes
itself
result
this
principle
with
the
ancients
is
grasped
as
good
and
evil
ie
end
as
positive
and
negative
this
determination
is
a
very
important
one
but
with
anaxagoras
it
was
not
fully
worked
out
while
in
the
first
place
the
principles
are
material
from
these
aristotle
then
distinguishes
determination
and
form
and
thirdly
he
finds
in
the
process
of
heraclitus
the
principle
of
motion
then
in
the
fourth
place
there
comes
the
reason
why
the
determination
of
end
with
the

this
is
the
concrete
in
itself
aristotle
adds
in
the
abovementioned
passage
p
192
according
to
these
men
the
ionians
and
others
and
in
reference
to
such
causes
water
fire
c
since
they
are
not
sufficient
to
beget
the
nature
of
things
the
philosophers
are
as
already
said
compelled
by
the
truth
to
go
on
to
the
principle
following

for
neither
the
earth
nor
any
other
principle
is
capable
of
explaining
the
fact
that
while
on
the
one
hand
all
is
good
and
beautiful
on
the
other
something
else
is
produced
and
those
men
do
not
seem
to
have
thought
that
this
was
so
nor
is
it
seemly
to
abandon
such
matters
to
hazard

and
to
chance
goodness
and
beauty
express
the
simple
restful
notion
and
change
the
notion
in
its
movement
with
this
principle
comes
the
determination
of
an
understanding
as
of
selfdetermining
activity
this
has
hitherto
been
wanting
for
the
becoming
of
heraclitus
which
is
only
process
is
not
yet
as
fate
the
independently
selfdetermining
by
this
we
must
not
represent
to
ourselves
subjective
thought
in
thinking
we
think
immediately
of
our
thought
as
it
is
in
consciousness
here
on
the
contrary
quite
objective
thought
is
meant
active
understandingas
we
say
there
is
reason
in
the
world
or
we
speak
of
genera
in
nature
which
are
the

the

through
an

wood
this
external
form
which
is
called
the
understanding
immediately
occurs
to
us
in
speaking
of
the
understanding
but
here
the
universal
is
meant
that
which
is
the
immanent
nature
of
the
object
itself
the

is
thus
not
a
thinking
existence
from
without
which
regulates
the
world
by
such
the
meaning
present
to
anaxagoras
would
be
quite
destroyed
and
all
its
philosophic
interest
taken
away
for
to
speak
of
an
individual
a
unit
from
without
is
to
fall
into
the
ordinary
conception
and
its
dualism
a
socalled
thinking
principle
is
no
longer
a
thought
but
is
a
subject
but
still
the
true
universal
is
for
all
that
not
abstract
but
the
universal
is
just
the
determining
in
and
out
of
itself
of
the
particular
in
and
for
itself
in
this
activity
which
is
independently
selfdetermining
the
fact
is
at
once
implied
that
the
activity
because
it
constitutes
process
retains
itself
as
the
universal
selfidentical
fire
which
according
to
heraclitus
was
process
dies
away
and
merely
passes
over
without
independent
existence
into
the
opposite
it
is
certainly
also
a
circle
and
a
return
to
fire
but
the
principle
does
not
retain
itself
in
its
determinateness
as
the
universal
seeing
that
a
simple
passing
into
the
opposite
takes
place
this
relation
to
itself
in
determination
which
we
see
appearing
in
anaxagoras
now
however
contains
the
determination
of
the
universal
though
it
is
not
formally
expressed
and
therein
we
have
the
end
or
the
good
i
have
just
recently
p
316
spoken
of
the
notion
of
the
end
yet
by
that
we
must
not
merely
think
of
the
form
of
the
end
as
it
is
in
us
in
conscious
beings
at
first
end
in
as
far
as
i
have
it
is
my
conception
which
is
for
itself
and
the
realization
of
which
depends
on
my
wish
if
i
carry
it
out
and
if
i
am
not
unskilful
the
object
produced
must
be
conformable
to
the
end
containing
nothing
but
it
there
is
a
transition
from
subjectivity
to
objectivity
through
which
this
opposition
is
always
again
sublated
because
i
am
discontented
with
my
end
in
that
it
is
only
subjective
my
activity
consists
in
removing
this
defect
and
making
it
objective
in
objectivity
the
end
has
retained
itself
for
instance
if
i
have
the
end
in
view
of
building
a
house
and
am
active
for
that
end
the
house
results
in
which
my
end
is
realized
but
we
must
not
as
we
usually
do
abide
at
the
conception
of
this
subjective
end
in
this
case
both
i
and
the
end
exist
independently
and
externally
in
relation
to
each
other
in
the
conception
that
god
as
wisdom
rules
the
world
in
accordance
with
an
end
for
instance
the
end
is
posited
for
itself
in
a
wise
figuratively
conceiving
being
but
the
universal
of
end
is
the
fact
that
since
it
is
a
determination
independently
fixed
that
rules
present
existence
the
end
is
the
truth
the
soul
of
a
thing
the
good
in
the
end
gives
content
to
itself
so
that
while
it
is
active
with
this
content
and
after
it
has
entered
into
externality
no
other
content
comes
forth
than
what
was
already
present
the
best
example
of
this
is
presented
in
life
it
has
desires
and
these
desires
are
its
ends
as
merely
living
however
it
knows
nothing
of
these
ends
but
yet
they
are
first
immediate
determinations
which
are
established
the
animal
works
at
satisfying
these
desires
ie
at
reaching
the
end
it
relates
itself
to
external
things
partly
mechanically
partly
chemically
but
the
character
of
its
activity
does
not
remain
mechanical
or
chemical
the
product
is
rather
the
animal
itself
which
as
its
own
end
brings
forth
in
its
activity
only
itself
since
it
negates
and
overturns
those
mechanical
or
chemical
relationships
in
mechanical
and
chemical
process
on
the
other
hand
the
result
is
something
different
in
which
the
subject
does
not
retain
itself
but
in
the
end
beginning
and
end
are
alike
for
we
posit
the
subjective
objectively
in
order
to
receive
it
again
selfpreservation
is
a
continual
production
by
which
nothing
new
but
always
the
old
arises
it
is
a
taking
back
of
activity
for
the
production
of
itself
thus
this
selfdetermining
activity
which
is
then
active
on
something
else
enters
into
opposition
but
it
again
negates
the
opposition
governs
it
in
it
reflects
upon
itself
it
is
the
end
the
thought
that
which
conserves
itself
in
its
selfdetermination
the
development
of
these
moments
is
the
business
of
philosophy
from
henceforth
but
if
we
look
more
closely
as
to
how
far
anaxagoras
has
got
in
the
development
of
this
thought
we
find
nothing
further
than
the
activity
determining
from
out
of
itself
which
sets
up
a
limit
or
measure
further
than
the
determination
of
measure
development
does
not
go
anaxagoras
gives
us
no
more
concrete
definition
of
the

and
this
we
are
still
left
to
consider
we
thus
have
nothing
more
than
the
abstract
determination
of
the
concrete
in
itself
the
abovementioned
predicates
which
anaxagoras
gives
the

may
thus
indeed
be
affirmed
but
they
are
on
their
own
account
onesided
only

the
homomeri
this
is
the
one
side
in
the
principle
of
anaxagoras
we
now
have
to
consider
the
going
forth
of
the

into
further
determinations
this
remaining
part
of
the
philosophy
of
anaxagoras
at
first
however
makes
us
think
that
the
hopes
in
which
such
a
principle
justified
us
must
be
very
much
diminished
on
the
other
side
this
universal
is
confronted
by
being

the
manifold
generally
potentiality
as
distinguished
from
the
former
as
actuality
for
if
the
good
or
the
end
is
also
determined
as
potentiality
the
universal
as
the
selfmoving
may
rather
be
called
the
actual

aristotle
says
in
an
important
passage
met
i
8
if
any
one
should
say
of
anaxagoras
that
he
adopted
two
principles
he
would
rest
his
statement
on
a
point
respecting
which
the
latter
never
really
clearly
defined
himself
but
which
he
had
necessarily
to
acknowledge
to
those
who
adduced
it
that

anaxagoras
says
that
originally
everything
is
mingled

where
nothing
is

separated
no

is

all
is

except
the

this
is
unmingled
and
pure
with
this
in

it
thus
occurs
to
him
to
denominate
as
principles

for
it
alone
is
single
and
unmingled

we
call
the
indeterminate
before
it
has
become
determined
or
partakes
of
any
kind
of
form
this

principle

celebrated

this

aristotle
says
anaxagoras
sets
forth
in
respect
of
the

infinitely
many
principles

he
maintained

he

been
alike
ie

as
in
a

the
homomeri
become
clearer
if
we
compare
them
with
the
conceptions
of
leucippus
and
democritus
and
others
in
leucippus
and

says
further
on
this
point
anaxagoras
asserts
of
the
elements
the
opposite
to
empedocles
for
the
latter
takes
as
original
principles
fire
air
earth
and
water
through
whose
union
all
things
arise
on
the
other
hand
anaxagoras
maintains
what
are
of
like
parts
such
as
flesh
bones
or
the
like
to
be
simple
materials
such
things
as
water
and
fire
on
the
contrary
are
a
mixture
of
the
original
elements
for
any
one
of
these
four
consists
of
the
infinite
admixture
of
all
invisible
existing
things
of
like
parts
which
hence
come
forth
from
these
the
principle
held
good
for
him
as
for
the
eleatics
that
the
like
only
comes
out
of
the
like
there
is
no
transition
into
the
opposite
no
union
of
opposites
possible
all
change
is
hence
to
him
only
a
separation
and
union
of
the
like
change
as
true
change
would
be
a
becoming
out
of
the
negative
of
itself
that
is
because
anaxagoras
says
aristotle
phys
i
4
partook
of
the
view
of
all
physicists
that
it
is
impossible
that
anything
can
come
out
of
nothing
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
admit
that
what
becomes
was
already
present
as
an
existent
but
that
on
account
of
its
small
size
it
was
imperceptible
to
us
this
point
of
view
is
also
quite
different
from
the
conception
of
thales
and
heraclitus
in
which
not
only
the
possibility
but
the
actuality
of
the
transformation
of
these
like
qualitative
differences
is
essentially
maintained
but
to
anaxagoras
with
whom
the
elements
are
a
mingled
chaos
formed
therefrom
having
only
an
apparent
uniformity
concrete
things
arise
through
the
severance
of
these
infinitely
many
principles
from
such
a
chaos
since
like
finds
like
respecting
the
difference
between
empedocles
and
anaxagoras
there
is
further
what
aristotle
adds
in
the
same
place
the
former
allows
a
change

in
these
conditions
the
latter
only
their
one
appearance
the
conception
of
democritus
is
similar
to
that
of
anaxagoras
in
so
far
as
that
an
infinite
manifold
is
the
original
source
but
with
anaxagoras
the
determination
of
the
fundamental
principles
appears
to
contain
that
which
we
consider
as
organized
and
to
be
by
no
means
an
independently
existent
simple
thus
perfectly
individualized
atoms
such
as
particles
of
flesh
and
of
gold
form
through
their
coming
together
that
which
appears
to
be
organized
that
comes
near
our
ordinary
ideas
means
of
nourishment
it
is
thought
contain
such
parts
as
are
homogeneous
to
blood
flesh
c
anaxagoras
hence
says
according
to
aristotle
de
gen
anim
i
18
flesh
comes
to
flesh
through
food
digestion
is
thus
nothing
more
than
the
taking
up
of
the
homogeneous
and
separation
of
the
heterogeneous
all
nourishment
and
growth
is
thus
not
true
assimilation
but
only
increase
because
each
internal
organ
of
the
animal
only
draws
its
parts
to
itself
out
of
the
various
plants
bodies
c
death
is
on
the
other
hand
the
separation
of
the
like
and
the
mingling
with
the
heterogeneous
the
activity
of
the

as
the
sundering
of
the
like
out
of
the
chaos
and
the
putting
together
of
the
like
as
also
the
setting
at
liberty
again
of
this
like
is
certainly
simple
and
relative
to
itself
but
purely
formal
and
thus
for
itself
contentless
this
is
the
general
standpoint
of
the
philosophy
of
anaxagoras
and
quite
the
same
standpoint
which
in
more
recent
times
reigns
in
chemistry
for
instance
flesh
is
certainly
no
longer
regarded
as
simple
but
as
being
hydrogen
c
the
chemical
elements
are
oxygen
hydrogen
carbon
and
metals
c
chemistry
says
if
you
want
to
know
what
flesh
wood
stone
c
really
are
you
must
set
forth
their
simple
elements
and
these
are
ultimate
it
also
says
that
much
is
only
relatively
simple
eg
platinum
consists
of
three
or
four
metals
water
and
air
were
similarly
long
held
to
be
simple
but
chemistry
at
length
analyzed
them
from
this
chemical
point
of
view
the
simple
principles
of
natural
things
are
determined
as
infinitely
qualitative
and
thus
accepted
as
unchangeable
and
invariable
so
that
all
else
consists
only
of
the
combination
of
these
simples
man
according
to
this
is
a
collection
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
some
earth
oxides
phosphorus
c
it
is
a
favourite
idea
of
the
physicists
to
place
in
the
water
or
in
the
air
oxygen
and
carbon
which
exist
and
only
require
to
be
separated
this
idea
of
anaxagoras
certainly
also
differs
from
modern
chemistry
that
which
we
consider
as
concrete
is
for
him
qualitatively
determined
or
elementary
yet
he
allows
with
regard
to
flesh
that
the
parts
are
not
all
alike
for
this
reason
they
say

not
particularly
of
anaxagoraseverything
is
contained
in
everything
for
they
saw
everything
arise
out
of
everything
it
only
appears
to
be
different
and
is
called
different
in
accordance
with
the
predominating
number
of
the
particular
kind
of
parts
which
have
mingled
themselves
with
others
in
truth
the
whole
is
not
white
or
black
or
sweet
or
flesh
or
bones
but
the
homomeri
which
have
most
accumulated
in
any
place
bring
about
the
result
that
the
whole
appears
to
us
as
this
determinate
as
thus
each
thing
contains
all
other
things
water
air
bones
fruits
c
on
the
other
hand
the
water
contains
flesh
as
flesh
bones
c
into
this
infinitely
manifold
nature
of
the
principles
anaxagoras
thus
goes
back
the
sensuous
has
first
arisen
through
the
accumulation
of
all
those
parts
and
in
it
the
one
kind
of
parts
then
has
a
predominance
while
he
defines
absolute
existence
as
universal
we
see
here
that
in
objective
existence
or
in
matter
universality
and
thought
abandon
anaxagoras
the
implicit
is
to
him
indeed
no
absolutely
sensuous
being
the
homomeri
are
the
nonsensuous
ie
the
invisible
and
inaudible
c
this
is
the
highest
point
reached
by
common
physicists
in
passing
from
sensuous
being
to
the
nonsensuous
as
to
the
mere
negation
of
the
beingforus
but
the
positive
side
is
that
existent
being
is
itself
universal
the
objective
is
to
anaxagoras
certainly
the

but
for
him
the
otherbeing
is
a
mixture
of
simple
elements
which
are
neither
flesh
nor
fish
red
nor
blue
again
this
simple
is
not
simple
in
itself
but
in
its
essence
consists
of
homomeri
which
are
however
so
small
that
they
are
imperceptible
the
smallness
thus
does
not
take
away
their
existence
for
they
are
still
there
but
existence
is
just
the
being
perceptible
to
sight
smell
c
these
infinitely
small
homomeri
undoubtedly
disappear
in
a
more
complete
conception
flesh
for
instance
is
such
itself
but
it
is
also
a
mixture
of
everything
ie
it
is
not
simple
further
analysis
equally
shows
how
such
a
conception
must
to
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
become
confused
on
the
one
side
each
form
is
thus
in
its
main
elements
original
and
these
parts
together
constitute
a
corporeal
whole
this
whole
has
however
on
the
other
side
to
contain
everything
in
itself
the

then
is
only
what
binds
and
separates
what
divides
and
arranges
das
diakosmirende
this
may
suffice
us
however
easily
we
may
get
confused
with
the
homomeri
of
anaxagoras
we
must
hold
fast
to
the
main
determination
the
homomeri
still
form
a
striking
conception
and
it
may
be
asked
how
it
conforms
with
the
rest
of
anaxagoras
principle
3
the
relation
of
the
two
now
as
to
the
relation
of
the

to
that
matter
both
are
not
speculatively
posited
as
one
for
the
relation
itself
is
not
set
forth
as
one
nor
has
the
notion
penetrated
it
here
the
ideas
become
in
some
measure
superficial
and
in
some
measure
the
conceptions
are
more
consistent
as
regards
the
particular
than
they
at
first
appear
because
the
understanding
is
the
selfdetermining
the
content
is
end
it
retains
itself
in
relation
to
what
is
different
it
does
not
arise
and
pass
away
although
it
is
in
activity
the
conception
of
anaxagoras
that
concrete
principles
subsist
and
retain
themselves
is
thus
consistent
he
abolishes
arising
and
passing
away
and
accepts
only
an
external
change
a
uniting
together
and
a
severance
of
what
is
so
united
the
principles
are
concrete
and
have
content
ie
so
many
ends
in
the
change
that
takes
place
the
principles
really
retain
themselves
like
only
goes
with
like
even
if
the
chaotic
mixture
is
a
combination
of
the
unlike
but
this
is
only
a
combination
and
not
an
individual
living
form
which
maintains
itself
binding
like
to
like
thus
however
rude
these
ideas
are
they
are
still
really
in
harmony
with
the

but
if
the

is
with
anaxagoras
the
moving
soul
in
all
it
yet
remains
to
the
real
as
the
soul
of
the
world
and
the
organic
system
of
the
whole
a
mere
word
for
the
living
as
living
since
the
soul
was
conceived
of
as
principle
the
ancients
demanded
no
further
principle
for
it
is
the
selfmoving
but
for
determinateness
which
the
animal
is
as
element
in
the
system
of
the
whole
they
again
required
only
the
universal
of
these
determinations
anaxagoras
calls
the
understanding
such
a
principle
and
in
fact
the
absolute
notion
as
simple
existence
the
selfidentical
in
its
differences
the
dividing
the
realityestablishing
must
be
known
as
such
but
that
anaxagoras
showed
forth
the
understanding
in
the
universe
or
had
grasped
it
as
a
rational
systemof
this
not
only
do
we
not
find
a
trace
but
the
ancients
expressly
say
that
he
simply
let
the
matter
pass
just
as
when
we
say
that
the
world
or
nature
is
a
great
system
the
world
is
wisely
ordered
or
is
generally
speaking
rational
by
this
we
are
shown
no
more
of
the
realization
of
this
reason
or
the
comprehensibility
of
the
world
the

of
anaxagoras
is
thus
still
formal
although
the
identity
of
the
principle
with
the
realization
was
recognized
aristotle
met
i
4
recognizes
the
insufficiency
of
the
anaxagorean
principle
anaxagoras
indeed
requires
the

for
his
formation
of
the
worldsystem
that
is
when
he
has
a
difficulty
in
showing
the
reason
for
which
it
is
in
accordance
with
necessity
he
brings
it
in
otherwise
he
employs
anything
for
the
sake
of
explanation
rather
than
thought
it
is
nowhere
more
clearly
set
forth
that
the

of
anaxagoras
is
still
formal
than
in
the
wellknown
passage
out
of
platos
phdo
p
9799
steph
p
8589
bekk
which
is
noteworthy
for
its
exposition
of
the
philosophy
of
anaxagoras
socrates
according
to
plato
states
most
definitely
both
what
the
absolute
to
them
was
and
why
anaxagoras
did
not
satisfy
them
i
quote
this
because
it
will
best
of
all
lead
us
on
to
the
main
conception
which
we
recognize
in
the
philosophic
consciousness
of
the
ancients
at
the
same
time
it
is
an
example
of
the
loquacity
of
socrates
socrates
understanding
of
the

as
end
is
better
because
its
determinations
are
congenial
to
him
so
that
we
also
see
in
it
the
principal
forms
that
appear
in
socrates
plato
makes
socrates
in
prison
an
hour
before
his
death
relate
at
considerable
length
his
experiences
with
regard
to
anaxagoras
when
i
heard
it
read
from
a
book
of
anaxagoras
that
he
said
that
the
understanding
is
the
disposer
of
the
world
and
the
first
cause
i
rejoiced
in
such
a
cause
and
i
held
that
if
mind
apportioned
out
all
reality
it
would
apportion
it
for
the
best
the
end
would
be
shown
forth
now
if
anyone
wished
to
find
the
cause
of
the
individual
thing
how
it
becomes
and
how
it
passes
away
or
how
it
is
he
must
discover
this
from
what
is
best
for
that
thing
whether
it
is
being
or
in
some
way
suffering
or
doing
that
the
understanding
is
cause
or
that
everything
is
made
for
the
best
means
the
same
thing
this
will
become
clearer
from
the
opposite
it
is
further
said
for
this
reason
a
man
has
only
to
consider
for
himself
as
for
all
others
what
is
best
and
most
perfect
and
then
he
would
of
necessity
know
the
worse
for
the
same
science
comprises
both
thus
reflecting
i
rejoiced
that
i
could
believe
that
i
had
found
in
anaxagoras
a
teacher
of
the
cause
of
existence
of
the
good
such
as
i
approved
of
he
would
i
believed
tell
me
whether
the
earth
was
flat
or
round
and
if
he
told
me
this
he
would
show
me
the
cause
and
necessity
of
the
fact
because
he
would
show
me
the
one
or
the
other
as
being
the
better
and
if
he
said
that
the
earth
is
in
the
centre
he
would
show
me
that
it
was
better
that
it
should
be
in
the
centre
ie
its
implicitly
and
explicitly
determined
end
and
not
utility
as
an
externally
determined
end
and
when
he
had
shown
me
this
i
should
be
satisfied
though
he
brought
forward
no
other
kind
of
causes
for
the
same
would
hold
good
for
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
other
stars
their
respective
velocities
returnings
and
other
conditions
because
he
assigned
its
cause
to
each
and
to
all
in
common
i
thought
that
he
would
explain
what
was
best
for
each
and
what
was
best
for
all
the
free
implicitly
and
explicitly
existent
idea
the
absolute
end
i
would
not
have
given
up
this
hope
for
a
great
deal
but
seized
these
writings
zealously
and
read
them
as
soon
as
possible
in
order
to
learn
as
soon
as
possible
the
good
and
the
evil
these
bright
hopes
faded
when
i
saw
that
he
did
not
require
thought
at
all
nor
any
reason
for
the
formation
of
things
but
had
recourse
to
air
fire
water
and
many
other
eccentricities
we
here
see
how
to
what
is
best
according
to
the
understanding
the
relation
of
final
end
that
which
we
call
natural
causes
is
opposed
just
as
in
leibnitz
the
operating
and
the
final
causes
are
different
socrates
explains
this
in
the
following
way
it
appears
to
me
to
be
as
if
some
one
were
to
say
that
socrates
performs
all
his
actions
with
understanding
and
then
in
going
on
to
give
the
reasons
for
each
of
my
actions
were
to
say
that
i
sit
here
because
my
body
consists
of
bones
and
muscles
the
bones
are
fixed
and
have
joints
that
divide
them

but
the
muscles
have
the
power
of
extending
and
bending
and
they
cover
the
bones
with
flesh
and
skin
it
is
as
though
he
were
further
to
bring
forward
as
the
cause
of
my
talking
with
you
other
similar
causes
sounds
and
air
hearing
and
a
thousand
other
things
but
omitted
to
give
the
true
cause
free
independent
determination
which
is
that
the
athenians
judged
it
fit
to
condemn
me
and
therefore
i
judged
it
better
and
more
just
to
sit
here
and
to
suffer
the
punishment
which
they
accorded
we
must
recollect
that
one
of
his
friends
had
arranged
everything
for
the
flight
of
socrates
but
that
he
refused
to
go
for
else
by
the
dog
of
egypt
how
long
ago
would
these
bones
and
muscles
have
gone
to
megara
or
to
boeotia
had
they
been
moved
only
by
their
opinion
of
what
was
best
and
had
i
not
considered
it
juster
and
better
to
bear
the
punishment
which
the
state
laid
upon
me
instead
of
escaping
and
fleeing
from
it
plato
here
correctly
places
the
two
kinds
of
reason
and
cause
in
opposition
to
one
anotherthe
cause
proceeding
from
ends
and
the
inferior
subject
and
merely
external
causes
of
chemistry
mechanism
cin
order
to
show
the
discrepancy
between
them
as
here
exemplified
in
the
case
of
a
man
with
consciousness
anaxagoras
seems
to
define
an
end
and
to
wish
to
proceed
from
it
but
he
immediately
lets
this
go
again
and
proceeds
to
quite
external
causes
but
to
call
these
these
bones
and
muscles
causes
is
quite
improper
if
however
anyone
were
to
say
that
without
having
bones
and
muscles
and
whatever
else
i
have
i
could
not
do
that
which
i
consider
best
he
would
be
quite
right
but
to
say
that
from
such
causes
i
do
that
which
i
do
and
do
with
understanding
to
say
that
i
do
not
do
it
from
the
choice
of
what
is
bestto
make
such
an
assertion
shows
a
great
want
of
consideration
it
signifies
an
incapacity
to
distinguish
that
the
one
is
the
true
cause
and
the
other
is
only
that
without
which
the
cause
could
not
operate
ie
the
conditions
this
is
a
good
example
for
showing
that
we
miss
the
end
in
such
modes
of
explanation
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
a
good
example
because
it
is
taken
from
the
kingdom
of
the
selfconscious
will
where
deliberate
and
not
unconscious
end
reigns
in
this
criticism
of
the
anaxagorean

we
can
certainly
see
it
generally
expressed
that
anaxagoras
made
no
application
of
his

to
reality
but
the
positive
element
in
the
conclusion
of
socrates
seems
on
the
other
hand
to
be
unsatisfying
because
it
goes
to
the
other
extreme
namely
to
desire
causes
for
nature
which
do
not
appear
to
be
in
it
but
which
fall
outside
of
it
in
consciousness
for
what
is
good
and
beautiful
is
partly
due
to
the
thought
of
consciousness
as
such
end
or
purposive
action
is
mainly
an
act
of
consciousness
and
not
of
nature
but
in
so
far
as
ends
become
posited
in
nature
the
end
as
end
on
the
other
hand
falls
outside
of
it
in
our
judgment
only
as
such
it
is
not
in
nature
itself
for
in
it
there
are
only
what
we
call
natural
causes
and
for
its
comprehension
we
have
only
to
seek
and
show
causes
that
are
immanent
according
to
this
we
distinguish
for
instance
in
socrates
the
end
and
ground
of
his
action
as
consciousness
and
the
causes
of
his
actual
action
and
the
latter
we
would
undoubtedly
seek
in
his
bones
muscles
nerves
c
since
we
banish
the
consideration
of
nature
in
relation
to
endsas
present
in
our
thought
and
not
existent
in
naturewe
also
banish
from
our
consideration
teleological
explanations
in
nature
formerly
admired
eg
that
grass
grows
that
animals
may
eat
it
and
that
these
last
exist
and
eat
grass
so
that
we
may
eat
them
the
end
of
trees
is
said
to
be
that
their
fruit
may
be
consumed
and
that
they
should
give
us
wood
for
heat
many
animals
have
skins
for
warm
clothing
the
sea
in
northern
climates
floats
timber
to
the
shores
because
on
these
shores
themselves
no
wood
grows
and
the
inhabitants
can
hence
obtain
it
and
so
on
thus
presented
the
end
the
good
lies
outside
of
the
thing
itself
the
nature
of
a
thing
then
becomes
considered
not
in
and
for
itself
but
only
in
relation
to
another
which
is
nothing
to
it
thus
because
things
are
only
useful
for
an
end
this
determination
is
not
their
own
but
one
foreign
to
them
the
tree
the
grass
is
as
natural
existence
independent
and
this
adaptation
of
it
to
an
end
such
as
making
grass
that
which
is
to
be
eaten
does
not
concern
the
grass
as
grass
just
as
it
does
not
concern
the
animal
that
man
should
clothe
himself
in
his
skin
socrates
may
hence
seem
to
miss
in
anaxagoras
this
mode
of
looking
at
nature
but
this
to
us
familiar
way
of
regarding
the
good
and
expedient
is
on
the
one
hand
not
the
only
one
and
does
not
represent
platos
meaning
while
on
the
other
it
is
likewise
necessary
we
have
not
to
represent
the
good
or
the
end
in
so
onesided
a
manner
that
we
think
of
it
existing
as
such
in
the
perceiving
mind
and
in
opposition
to
what
is
but
set
free
from
this
form
we
must
take
it
in
its
essence
as
the
idea
of
all
existence
the
nature
of
things
must
be
recognized
in
accordance
with
the
notion
which
is
the
independent
unfettered
consideration
of
things
and
because
it
is
that
which
things
are
in
and
for
themselves
it
controls
the
relationship
of
natural
causes
this
notion
is
the
end
the
true
cause
but
that
which
recedes
into
itself
it
is
the
implicitly
existent
first
from
which
movement
proceeds
and
which
becomes
result
it
is
not
only
an
end
present
in
the
imagination
before
its
actuality
exists
but
is
also
present
in
reality
becoming
is
the
movement
through
which
a
reality
or
totality
becomes
in
the
animal
or
plant
its
essence
as
universal
genus
is
that
which
begins
its
movement
and
brings
it
forth
but
this
whole
is
not
the
product
of
something
foreign
but
its
own
product
what
is
already
present
as
germ
or
seed
thus
it
is
called
end
the
selfproducing
that
which
in
its
becoming
is
already
implicitly
existent
the
idea
is
not
a
particular
thing
which
might
have
another
content
than
reality
or
appear
quite
different
the
opposition
is
the
merely
formal
opposition
of
possibility
and
actuality
the
active
impelling
substance
and
the
product
are
the
same
this
realization
goes
right
through
the
opposition
the
negative
in
the
universal
is
just
this
process
the
genus
sets
itself
in
a
state
of
opposition
as
individual
and
universal
and
thus
in
what
lives
the
genus
realizes
itself
in
the
opposition
of
races
which
are
opposed
but
whose
principle
is
the
universal
genus
they
as
individuals
aim
at
their
own
selfpreservation
as
individuals
in
eating
drinking
c
but
what
they
thereby
bring
to
pass
is
genus
individuals
sublate
themselves
but
genus
is
that
which
is
ever
brought
forth
plants
bring
forth
only
the
same
plants
whose
ground
is
the
universal
in
accordance
with
this
the
distinction
between
what
have
been
badly
named
natural
causes
and
the
final
causes
has
to
be
determined
now
if
i
isolate
individuality
and
merely
regard
it
as
movement
and
the
moments
of
the
same
i
show
what
are
natural
causes
for
example
where
has
this
life
taken
its
origin
through
the
generation
of
this
its
father
and
mother
what
is
the
cause
of
these
fruits
the
tree
whose
juices
so
distil
themselves
that
the
fruit
forthwith
arises
answers
of
this
kind
give
the
causes
ie
the
individuality
opposed
to
an
individuality
but
their
principle
is
the
genus
now
nature
cannot
represent
essence
as
such
the
end
of
generation
is
the
sublation
of
the
individuality
of
being
but
nature
which
in
existence
certainly
brings
about
this
sublation
of
individuality
does
not
set
the
universal
in
its
place
but
another
individual
bones
muscles
c
bring
forth
a
movement
they
are
causes
but
they
themselves
are
so
through
other
causes
and
so
on
into
infinitude
the
universal
however
takes
them
up
into
itself
as
moments
which
undoubtedly
appear
in
movement
as
causes
though
the
fundamental
ground
of
these
parts
actually
is
the
whole
it
is
not
they
which
come
first
but
the
result
into
which
the
juices
of
the
plants
c
pass
is
the
first
just
as
in
origination
it
appears
only
as
product
as
seed
that
which
constitutes
the
beginning
and
the
end
even
though
they
be
in
different
individuals
their
real
nature
is
the
same
but
such
a
genus
is
itself
a
particular
genus
and
is
essentially
related
to
another
eg
the
idea
of
the
plant
to
that
of
the
animal
the
universal
moves
on
this
looks
like
external
teleologythat
plants
are
eaten
by
animals
c
in
which
their
limitation
as
genus
lies
the
genus
of
the
plant
has
the
absolute
totality
of
its
realization
in
the
animal
the
animal
in
the
conscious
existence
just
as
the
earth
has
it
in
the
plant
this
is
the
system
of
the
whole
in
which
each
moment
is
transitory
the
double
method
of
considering
the
matter
thus
is
that
each
idea
is
a
circle
within
itself
the
plant
or
the
animal
the
good
of
its
kind
and
on
the
other
hand
each
is
a
moment
in
the
universal
good
if
i
consider
the
animal
merely
as
externally
adapted
to
an
end
as
created
for
something
else
i
consider
it
in
a
onesided
way
it
is
real
existence
in
and
for
itself
universal
but
it
is
just
as
onesided
to
say
that
the
plant
for
instance
is
only
in
and
for
itself
only
end
to
itself
only
shut
up
within
itself
and
going
back
into
itself
for
each
idea
is
a
circle
which
is
complete
in
itself
but
whose
completion
is
likewise
a
passing
into
another
circle
it
is
a
vortex
whose
middle
point
that
into
which
it
returns
is
found
directly
in
the
periphery
of
a
higher
circle
which
swallows
it
up
thus
for
the
first
time
we
reach
the
determination
of
an
end
in
the
world
which
is
immanent
within
it
these
explanations
are
necessary
here
since
hereafter
we
see
the
speculative
idea
coming
more
into
the
universal
it
was
formerly
expressed
as
being
and
the
moments
and
movements
were
called
existent
what
has
to
be
avoided
in
this
transition
is
that
we
should
thereby
think
that
being
is
given
up
and
that
we
pass
into
consciousness
as
opposed
to
being
in
so
doing
the
universal
would
lose
all
its
speculative
significance
the
universal
is
immanent
in
nature
this
is
the
meaning
which
is
present
when
we
represent
to
ourselves
that
thought
constitutes
orders
c
the
world
it
is
not
so
to
speak
the
activity
of
the
individual
consciousness
in
which
i
stand
here
on
one
side
and
opposite
to
me
an
actuality
matter
which
i
form
dispose
and
order
as
i
will
for
the
universal
thought
must
abide
in
philosophy
without
this
opposition
being
pure
being
is
universal
when
we
thereby
keep
in
mind
that
being
is
absolute
abstraction
pure
thought
but
being
as
it
is
thus
set
forth
as
being
has
the
significance
of
the
opposite
to
this
beingreflectedintoitself
to
thought
and
recollection
the
universal
on
the
contrary
has
reflection
immediately
in
itself
so
far
the
ancients
really
got
it
does
not
seem
far
universal
is
a
dry
determination
everyone
knows
about
the
universal
but
not
of
it
as
real
existence
thought
indeed
reaches
to
the
invisibility
of
the
sensuous
not
to
the
positive
determinateness
of
thinking
it
as
universal
but
only
to
the
predicateless
absolute
as
to
the
merely
negative
and
that
is
as
far
as
the
common
ideas
of
the
present
day
have
come
with
this
discovery
of
thought
we
conclude
the
first
section
and
enter
upon
the
second
period
the
profit
to
be
derived
from
the
first
period
is
not
very
great
some
indeed
think
that
there
is
still
some
special
wisdom
in
it
but
thought
is
still
young
the
determinations
are
thus
still
poor
abstract
and
arid
thought
here
has
but
few
determinationswater
being
number
cand
these
cannot
endure
the
universal
must
go
forth
on
its
own
account
as
the
selfdetermining
activity
and
this
we
find
it
doing
in
anaxagoras
alone
we
have
still
to
consider
the
relationship
of
the
universal
as
opposed
to
being
or
consciousness
as
such
in
its
relation
to
what
is
by
anaxagoras
determination
of
real
existence
this
relationship
of
consciousness
is
also
determined
in
this
regard
nothing
satisfactory
can
be
found
for
he
recognized
on
the
one
hand
thought
as
real
existence
without
however
bringing
this
thought
to
bear
on
ordinary
reality
thus
on
the
other
hand
this
is
destitute
of
thought
and
independent
an
infinite
number
of
homomeri
ie
an
infinite
amount
of
a
sensuous
implicit
existence
which
now
however
is
sensuous
being
for
existent
being
is
an
accumulation
of
homomeri
the
relationship
borne
by
consciousness
to
real
existence
may
likewise
be
various
anaxagoras
could
thus
either
say
that
the
truth
is
only
in
thought
and
in
rational
knowledge
or
that
it
is
sensuous
perception
for
in
this
we
have
the
homomeri
which
are
themselves
implicit
thus
in
the
first
place
we
find
from
himas
sextus
tells
us
adv
math
vii
8991
that
the
understanding

is
the
criterion
of
the
truth
the
senses
cannot
judge
of
the
truth
on
account
of
their
weaknessweakness
for
the
homomeri
are
the
infinitely
small
the
senses
could
not
grasp
them
do
not
know
that
they
have
to
be
something

anaxagoras
is
said
to
have
asserted
that
there
is
a
medium
between
contradiction

so
that
everything
is
untrue
for
because
the
two
sides
of
the
opposition
are
mingled
what
is
mingled
is
neither
good
nor
not
good

not
true
aristotle
also
quotes
another
time
from
him

that
one
of
his
apothegms
to
his
disciples
was
that
to
them
things
were
as
they
supposed
them
this
may
relate
to
the
fact
that
because
existent
being
is
an
accumulation
of
homomeri
which
are
what
really
exists
sensuous
perception
takes
things
as
they
are
in
truth
there
is
little
more
to
be
made
of
this
but
here
we
have
the
beginning
of
a
more
distinct
development
of
the
relationship
of
consciousness
to
being
the
development
of
the
nature
of
knowledge
as
a
knowledge
of
the
true
the
mind
has
gone
forth
to
express
real
existence
as
thought
and
thus
real
existence
as
existent
is
in
consciousness
as
such
it
is
implicit
but
likewise
in
consciousness
this
being
is
such
only
in
so
far
as
consciousness
recognizes
it
and
real
existence
is
only
the
knowledge
of
it
the
mind
has
no
longer
to
seek
existence
in
something
foreign
since
it
is
in
itself
for
what
formerly
appeared
foreign
is
thought
ie
consciousness
has
this
real
existence
in
itself
but
this
consciousness
in
opposition
is
an
individual
consciousness
thereby
in
fact
implicit
being
is
sublated
for
the
implicit
is
what
is
not
opposed
not
singled
out
but
universal
it
is
indeed
known
but
what
is
only
is
in
knowledge
or
it
is
no
other
being
than
that
of
the
knowledge
of
consciousness
we
see
this
development
of
the
universal
in
which
real
existence
goes
right
over
to
the
side
of
consciousness
in
the
so
much
decried
worldly
wisdom
of
the
sophists
we
may
view
this
as
indicating
that
the
negative
nature
of
the
universal
is
now
developing
chapter
ii
first
period
second
division
from
the
sophists
to
the
socratics
in
this
second
division
we
have
first
to
consider
more
particularly
the
sophists
secondly
socrates
and
thirdly
the
socratics
while
we
distinguish
from
these
plato
and
take
him
along
with
aristotle
in
the
third
division
the

which
is
at
first
only
grasped
in
a
very
subjective
manner
as
end
that
is
to
say
as
that
which
is
end
to
men
ie
the
good
in
plato
and
aristotle
became
understood
in
what
is
on
the
whole
an
objective
way
as
genus
or
idea
because
thought
has
now
become
set
forth
as
principle
and
this
at
first
presents
a
subjective
appearance
as
being
the
subjective
activity
of
thought
there
now
sets
in
since
the
absolute
is
posited
as
subject
an
age
of
subjective
reflection
ie
there
begins
in
this
periodwhich
coincides
with
the
disintegration
of
greece
in
the
peloponnesian
warthe
principle
of
modern
times
since
in
the

of
anaxagoras
as
the
still
formal
selfdetermining
activity
determination
is
as
yet
quite
undetermined
general
and
abstract
and
along
with
that
contentless
throughout
the
universal
standpoint
is
the
immediate
necessity
of
going
on
to
a
content
which
begins
actual
determination
but
what
is
this
absolute
universal
content
which
abstract
thought
as
selfdetermining
activity
gives
itself
that
is
the
real
question
here
consciousness
now
confronts
the
untrammeled
thought
of
those
ancient
philosophers
whose
general
ideas
we
have
considered
while
hitherto
the
subject
when
it
reflected
on
the
absolute
only
produced
thoughts
and
had
this
content
before
it
it
is
now
seen
that
what
is
here
present
is
not
the
whole
but
that
the
thinking
subject
likewise
really
belongs
to
the
totality
of
the
objective
furthermore
this
subjectivity
of
thought
has
again
the
double
character
of
at
once
being
the
infinite
selfrelating
form
which
as
this
pure
activity
of
the
universal
receives
contentdeterminations
and
on
the
other
hand
as
consciousness
reflects
that
it
is
the
thinking
subject
which
is
thus
positing
of
also
being
a
return
of
spirit
from
objectivity
into
itself
thus
if
thought
because
it
immersed
itself
in
the
object
had
as
such
and
like
the

of
anaxagoras
at
first
no
content
because
this
stood
on
the
other
side
so
now
with
the
return
of
thought
as
to
the
consciousness
that
the
subject
is
what
thinks
we
have
the
other
sidethat
what
has
to
be
dealt
with
is
the
attainment
of
a
truly
absolute
content
this
content
taken
abstractly
may
itself
be
again
a
double
one
either
the
i
is
in
respect
of
determination
the
real
when
it
makes
itself
and
its
interests
the
content
or
the
content
becomes
determined
as
the
altogether
universal
according
to
this
we
have
two
questions
to
deal
with
which
arehow
the
determination
of
what
is
in
and
for
itself
is
to
be
comprehended
and
how
this
is
likewise
in
immediate
relation
to
the
i
as
thinking
it
comes
to
pass
in
philosophy
that
although
the
i
is
the
positing
yet
the
posited
content
of
that
which
is
thought
is
the
object
existent
in
and
for
itself
if
one
were
to
remain
at
saying
that
the
i
is
that
which
posits
this
would
be
the
false
idealism
of
modern
times
in
earlier
times
men
did
not
remain
at
saying
that
what
is
thought
is
bad
because
i
posit
it
to
the
sophists
the
content
is
mine
and
subjective
socrates
grasped
the
content
which
is
in
and
for
itself
and
the
followers
of
socrates
have
in
direct
connection
with
him
merely
further
defined
this
content
athe
sophists
the
notion
which
reason
has
found
in
anaxagoras
to
be
real
existence
is
the
simple
negative
into
which
all
determination
all
that
is
existent
and
individual
sinks
before
the
notion
nothing
can
exist
for
it
is
simply
the
predicateless
absolute
to
which
everything
is
clearly
a
moment
only
for
it
there
is
thus
nothing
so
to
speak
permanently
fixed
and
sealed
the
notion
is
just
the
constant
change
of
heraclitus
the
movement
the
causticity
which
nothing
can
resist
thus
the
notion
which
finds
itself
finds
itself
as
the
absolute
power
before
which
everything
vanishes
and
thereby
all
things
all
existence
everything
held
to
be
secure
is
now
made
fleeting
this
securitywhether
it
be
a
security
of
natural
being
or
the
security
of
definite
conceptions
principles
customs
and
lawsbecomes
vacillation
and
loses
its
stability
as
universal
such
principles
c
certainly
themselves
pertain
to
the
notion
yet
their
universality
is
only
their
form
for
the
content
which
they
have
as
determinate
falls
into
movement
we
see
this
movement
arising
in
the
socalled
sophists
whom
we
here
encounter
for
the
first
time
they
gave
themselves
the
name

as
teachers
of
wisdom
ie
as
those
who
could
make
wise

the
learning
of
the
sophists
is
thus
directly
the
opposite
to
ours
which
only
aspires
to
acquire
information
and
investigate
what
is
and
has
beenit
is
a
mass
of
empirical
matter
in
which
the
discovery
of
a
new
form
a
new
worm
or
other
vermin
is
held
to
be
a
point
of
great
importance
our
learned
professors
are
in
so
far
much
less
responsible
than
the
sophists
however
philosophy
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
lack
of
responsibility
but
as
regards
the
relation
of
the
sophists
to
what
is
ordinarily
believed
they
are
by
the
healthy
human
understanding
as
much
decried
as
by
morality
by
the
former
this
is
on
account
of
their
theoretic
teaching
since
it
is
senseless
to
say
that
nothing
is
and
in
respect
of
practice
because
they
subvert
all
principles
and
laws
for
the
first
mentioned
things
certainly
cannot
be
left
in
this
confusion
of
movement
and
in
their
negative
aspect
merely
yet
the
rest
into
which
they
pass
is
not
the
restoration
of
what
is
moved
into
its
former
condition
of
security
as
if
in
the
end
the
result
were
the
same
and
the
action
were
a
superfluous
one
now
the
sophistry
of
common
opinion
which
is
without
the
culture
of
thought
and
without
scientific
knowledge
is
found
in
the
fact
that
to
it
its
determinations
are
as
such
held
to
be
existent
in
and
for
themselves
and
a
number
of
rules
of
life
maxims
principles
c
are
considered
as
absolutely
fixed
truths
mind
itself
is
however
the
unity
of
these
in
many
ways
limited
truths
which
in
it
are
all
recognized
as
being
present
as
sublated
only
as
merely
relative
truths
ie
with
their
restrictions
in
their
limitation
and
not
as
existent
in
themselves
hence
these
truths
to
the
ordinary
understanding
are
in
fact
no
more
for
on
another
occasion
it
allows
and
even
asserts
the
opposite
to
have
a
value
also
for
consciousness
or
it
does
not
know
that
it
says
directly
the
opposite
to
what
it
means
its
expression
being
thus
only
an
expression
of
contradiction
in
its
actions
generally
and
not
in
its
bad
actions
ordinary
understanding
breaks
these
its
maxims
and
its
principles
itself
and
if
it
leads
a
rational
life
it
is
properly
speaking
only
a
standing
inconsistency
the
making
good
of
one
narrow
maxim
of
conduct
through
breaking
off
from
others
for
example
a
statesman
of
experience
and
culture
is
one
who
knows
how
to
steer
a
middle
course
and
has
practical
understanding
ie
deals
with
the
whole
extent
of
the
case
before
him
and
not
with
one
side
of
it
which
expresses
itself
in
one
maxim
only
on
the
other
hand
he
whoever
he
is
who
acts
on
one
maxim
is
a
pedant
and
spoils
things
for
himself
and
others
most
commonly
it
is
thus
for
example
we
hear
it
said
it
is
certain
that
the
things
that
i
see
are
i
believe
in
their
reality
anyone
can
say
this
quite
easily
but
in
fact
it
is
not
true
that
he
believes
in
their
reality
really
he
assumes
the
contrary
for
he
eats
and
drinks
them
ie
he
is
convinced
that
these
things
are
not
in
themselves
and
their
being
has
no
security
no
subsistence
thus
common
understanding
is
in
its
actions
better
than
it
thinks
for
in
action
it
is
mind
as
a
whole
but
it
is
not
here
known
to
itself
as
mind
for
what
comes
within
its
consciousness
are
definite
laws
rules
general
propositions
such
as
by
its
understanding
are
esteemed
to
be
the
absolute
truth
whose
limitation
it
however
sets
aside
in
action
now
when
the
notion
turns
to
the
riches
which
consciousness
thinks
to
possess
and
when
the
latter
is
sensible
of
the
danger
to
its
truth
without
which
it
would
not
be
when
its
fixed
realities
are
destroyed
it
is
enraged
and
the
notion
which
in
this
its
realization
applies
itself
to
the
common
verities
draws
hatred
and
disdain
upon
itself
this
is
the
ground
of
the
universal
denunciation
of
the
sophists
a
denunciation
of
healthy
human
understanding
which
does
not
know
how
else
to
help
itself
sophistry
is
certainly
a
word
of
illrepute
and
indeed
it
is
particularly
through
the
opposition
to
socrates
and
plato
that
the
sophists
have
come
into
such
disrepute
that
the
word
usually
now
signifies
that
by
false
reasoning
some
truth
is
either
refuted
and
made
dubious
or
something
false
is
proved
and
made
plausible
we
have
to
put
this
evil
significance
on
one
side
and
to
forget
it
on
the
other
hand
we
now
wish
to
consider
further
from
the
positive
and
properly
speaking
scientific
side
what
was
the
position
of
the
sophists
in
greece
it
was
the
sophists
who
now
applied
the
simple
notion
as
thought
which
with
zeno
in
the
eleatic
school
had
commenced
to
turn
towards
its
pure
counterpart
motion
to
worldly
objects
generally
and
with
it
penetrated
all
human
relations
for
it
is
conscious
of
itself
as
the
absolute
and
single
reality
and
jealous
of
all
else
exercises
its
power
and
rule
in
this
reality
as
regards
all
else
since
this
desires
to
be
considered
as
the
determinate
which
is
not
thought
the
thought
identical
with
itself
thus
directs
its
negative
powers
towards
the
manifold
determination
of
the
theoretical
and
the
practical
the
truths
of
natural
consciousness
and
the
immediately
recognized
laws
and
principles
and
what
to
the
ordinary
conception
is
established
dissolves
itself
in
it
and
in
so
doing
leaves
it
to
particular
subjectivity
to
make
itself
first
and
fixed
to
relate
everything
to
itself
now
that
this
notion
has
appeared
it
has
become
a
more
universal
philosophy
and
not
so
much
simple
philosophy
as
the
universal
culture
of
which
every
man
who
did
not
belong
to
those
devoid
of
thought
partook
and
necessarily
partook
for
we
call
culture
just
the
notion
as
applied
in
actuality
in
so
far
as
it
makes
its
appearance
not
purely
in
its
abstraction
but
in
unity
with
the
manifold
content
of
all
ordinary
conceptions
but
in
culture
the
notion
is
the
predominant
as
also
the
actuating
because
in
both
the
determinate
is
recognized
in
its
limits
in
its
transition
into
something
else
this
culture
became
the
general
aim
of
education
and
there
were
hence
a
number
of
teachers
of
sophistry
indeed
the
sophists
are
the
teachers
of
greece
through
whom
culture
first
came
into
existence
in
greece
and
thus
they
took
the
place
of
poets
and
of
rhapsodists
who
before
this
were
the
ordinary
instructors
for
religion
was
no
instructress
since
no
teaching
was
in
it
imparted
and
though
priests
certainly
offered
sacrifices
prophesied
and
interpreted
the
sayings
of
the
oracle
instruction
is
something
quite
different
from
this
but
the
sophists
educated
men
in
wisdom
in
the
sciences
music
mathematics
c
and
this
was
their
foremost
aim
before
pericles
appeared
in
greece
the
desire
for
culture
through
thought
and
through
reflection
was
awakened
men
wished
to
be
cultured
in
their
ideas
and
in
their
various
relations
to
guide
themselves
by
thought
and
no
longer
merely
through
oracles
or
through
custom
passion
the
feelings
of
the
moment
for
the
end
of
the
state
is
the
universal
under
which
the
particular
is
comprehended
because
the
sophists
kept
in
view
and
enlarged
upon
this
culture
they
prosecuted
teaching
as
a
special
calling
business
or
profession
as
an
office
taking
the
place
of
schools
they
travelled
round
the
towns
of
greece
the
youth
of
which
was
by
them
instructed
now
culture
is
certainly
an
indefinite
expression
it
has
however
this
meaning
that
what
free
thought
is
to
attain
must
come
out
of
itself
and
be
personal
conviction
it
is
then
no
longer
believed
but
investigatedin
short
it
is
the
socalled
enlightenment
of
modern
times
thought
seeks
general
principles
by
which
it
criticizes
everything
which
is
by
us
esteemed
and
nothing
has
value
to
us
which
is
not
in
conformity
with
these
principles
thus
thought
undertakes
to
compare
the
positive
content
with
itself
to
dissolve
the
former
concrete
of
belief
on
one
side
to
split
the
content
up
and
on
the
other
to
isolate
these
individualities
these
particular
points
of
view
and
aspects
and
to
secure
them
on
their
own
account
these
aspects
which
are
properly
not
independent
but
only
moments
of
a
whole
when
detached
from
it
relate
themselves
to
themselves
and
in
this
way
assume
the
form
of
universality
any
one
of
them
can
thus
be
elevated
to
a
reason
ie
to
a
universal
determination
which
is
again
applied
to
particular
aspects
thus
in
culture
it
is
requisite
that
men
should
be
acquainted
with
the
universal
points
of
view
which
belong
to
a
transaction
event
c
that
this
point
of
view
and
thereby
the
thing
should
be
grasped
in
a
universal
way
in
order
to
afford
a
present
knowledge
of
what
is
in
question
a
judge
knows
the
various
laws
ie
the
various
legal
points
of
view
under
which
a
thing
is
to
be
considered
these
are
already
for
him
universal
aspects
through
which
he
has
a
universal
consciousness
and
considers
the
matter
in
a
universal
way
a
man
of
culture
thus
knows
how
to
say
something
of
everything
to
find
points
of
view
in
all
greece
has
to
thank
the
sophists
for
this
culture
because
they
taught
men
to
exercise
thought
as
to
what
should
have
authority
for
them
and
thus
their
culture
was
culture
in
philosophy
as
much
as
in
eloquence
in
order
to
reach
this
double
end
the
sophists
were
one
in
their
desire
to
be
wise
to
know
what
constitutes
power
amongst
men
and
in
the
state
and
what
i
have
to
recognize
as
such
is
counted
as
wisdom
and
because
i
know
the
power
i
also
know
how
to
direct
others
in
conformity
with
my
end
hence
the
admiration
that
pericles
and
other
statesmen
excited
just
because
they
knew
their
own
standpoint
and
had
the
power
of
putting
others
in
their
proper
place
that
man
is
powerful
who
can
deduce
the
actions
of
men
from
the
absolute
ends
which
move
them
the
object
of
the
sophists
has
thus
been
to
teach
what
is
the
mainspring
of
the
world
and
since
philosophy
alone
knows
that
this
is
the
universal
thought
which
resolves
all
that
is
particular
the
sophists
were
also
speculative
philosophers
learned
in
the
proper
sense
they
hence
were
not
because
there
were
as
yet
no
positive
sciences
without
philosophy
such
as
in
their
aridity
did
not
concern
all
mankind
and
mans
essential
aspects
they
further
had
the
most
ordinary
practical
end
to
give
a
consciousness
of
that
which
is
involved
in
the
moral
world
and
which
satisfies
man
religion
taught
that
the
gods
are
the
powers
which
rule
over
men
immediate
morality
recognized
the
rule
of
laws
man
was
to
find
satisfaction
in
conforming
to
laws
and
was
to
assume
that
others
also
find
satisfaction
because
they
follow
these
laws
but
from
the
reflection
which
here
breaks
in
it
no
longer
satisfies
man
to
obey
law
as
an
authority
and
external
necessity
for
he
desires
to
satisfy
himself
in
himself
to
convince
himself
through
his
reflection
of
what
is
binding
upon
him
what
is
his
end
and
what
he
has
to
do
for
this
end
thus
the
impulses
and
desires
that
man
has
become
his
power
and
only
inasmuch
as
he
affords
them
satisfaction
does
he
become
satisfied
now
the
sophists
taught
how
these
powers
could
be
moved
in
empirical
man
for
the
good
as
ordinarily
recognized
no
longer
determined
them
rhetoric
however
teaches
how
circumstances
may
be
made
subject
to
such
forces
it
even
makes
use
of
the
wrath
and
passions
of
the
hearer
in
order
to
bring
about
a
conclusion
thus
the
sophists
were
more
especially
the
teachers
of
oratory
and
that
is
the
aspect
in
which
the
individual
could
make
himself
esteemed
amongst
the
people
as
well
as
carry
out
what
was
best
for
the
people
this
certainly
characterizes
a
democratic
constitution
in
which
the
citizens
have
the
ultimate
decision
because
in
this
way
oratory
was
one
of
the
first
requirements
for
the
rule
of
a
people
or
for
making
something
clear
to
them
through
their
ordinary
ideas
the
sophists
trained
men
for
common
greek
life
for
citizenship
and
for
statesmen
without
appearing
to
prepare
state
officials
for
an
examination
in
specific
subjects
for
the
particular
characteristic
of
eloquence
is
to
show
the
manifold
points
of
view
existing
in
a
thing
and
to
give
force
to
those
which
harmonize
with
what
appears
to
me
to
be
most
useful
it
thus
is
the
art
of
putting
forward
various
points
of
view
in
the
concrete
case
and
placing
others
rather
in
the
shade
aristotles
topica
comes
to
mind
in
the
connection
inasmuch
as
it
gives
the
categories
or
thoughtdeterminations

according
to
which
we
have
to
regard
things
in
order
to
learn
to
speak
but
the
sophists
were
the
first
to
apply
themselves
to
a
knowledge
of
these
this
is
the
position
taken
up
by
the
sophists
but
we
find
a
perfectly
definite
picture
of
their
further
progress
and
procedure
in
platos
protagoras
plato
here
makes
protagoras
express
himself
more
precisely
respecting
the
art
of
the
sophists
that
is
to
say
plato
in
this
dialogue
represents
that
socrates
accompanies
a
young
man
named
hippocrates
who
desires
to
place
himself
under
protagoras
then
newly
arrived
in
athens
for
instruction
in
the
science
of
the
sophists
on
the
way
socrates
now
asks
hippocrates
what
is
this
wisdom
of
the
sophists
which
he
wishes
to
learn
hippocrates
at
first
replies
rhetoric
for
the
sophist
is
one
who
knows
how
to
make
men
clever

in
speech
in
fact
what
is
most
striking
in
a
man
or
people
of
culture
is
the
art
of
speaking
well
or
of
turning
subjects
round
and
considering
them
in
many
aspects
the
uncultivated
man
finds
it
unpleasant
to
associate
with
people
who
know
how
to
grasp
and
express
every
point
of
view
with
ease
the
french
are
good
speakers
in
this
sense
and
the
germans
call
their
talking
prattle
but
it
is
not
mere
talk
that
brings
about
this
result
for
culture
is
also
wanted
we
may
have
mastered
a
speech
quite
completely
but
if
we
have
not
culture
it
is
not
good
speaking
men
thus
learn
french
not
only
to
be
able
to
speak
french
well
but
to
acquire
french
culture
what
is
to
be
obtained
from
the
sophists
is
thus
the
power
of
keeping
the
manifold
points
of
view
present
to
the
mind
so
that
the
wealth
of
categories
by
which
an
object
may
be
considered
immediately
occurs
to
it
socrates
indeed
remarks
that
the
principle
of
the
sophists
is
not
hereby
determined
in
a
sufficiently
comprehensive
way
and
thus
it
is
not
sufficiently
known
what
a
sophist
is
yet
he
says
we
have
a
desire
to
go
on86
for
likewise
if
anyone
wishes
to
study
philosophy
he
does
not
as
yet
know
what
philosophy
is
else
he
would
not
need
to
study
it
having
reached
protagoras
with
hippocrates
socrates
finds
him
in
an
assemblage
of
the
foremost
sophists
and
surrounded
by
listeners
walking
about
and
like
an
orpheus
entrancing
all
men
by
his
words
hippias
sitting
meanwhile
on
a
chair
with
not
so
many
round
him
and
prodicus
lying
amongst
a
great
number
of
admirers
after
socrates
brought
before
protagoras
the
request
to
have
hippocrates
placed
under
his
instruction
in
order
that
he
might
by
him
be
taught
how
to
become
eminent
in
the
state
he
also
asks
whether
they
might
speak
with
him
in
public
or
alone
protagoras
praises
his
discretion
and
replies
that
they
act
wisely
to
make
use
of
this
precaution
for
because
the
sophists
wandered
about
the
towns
and
thus
youths
deserting
fathers
and
friends
followed
them
in
view
of
improving
themselves
through
their
intercourse
with
them
they
drew
upon
themselves
much
envy
and
illwillfor
everything
new
is
hated
on
this
point
protagoras
speaks
at
length
i
assert
that
the
art
of
the
sophists
is
old
but
that
those
of
the
ancients
who
practised
it
in
fear
of
giving
offence
for
the
uncultured
world
is
antagonistic
to
the
cultured
veiled
and
concealed
it
one
section
like
homer
and
hesiod
taught
it
in
their
poetry
others
like
orpheus
and
musus
through
mysteries
and
oracles
some
i
believe
like
iccus
of
tarentum
and
the
sophist
now
living
and
unsurpassedherodicus
of
selymbriain
gymnastics
but
many
more
through
music
we
see
that
protagoras
usually
describes
the
end
of
mental
culture
as
being
to
bring
about
morality
presence
of
mind
sense
of
order
and
general
capacity
he
adds
all
those
who
feared
envy
arising
against
the
sciences
required
such
veils
and
screens
but
i
think
that
they
do
not
attain
their
end
for
men
of
penetration
in
the
state
see
the
end
appearing
through
while
the
people
notice
nothing
and
only
quote
the
others
if
people
behave
so
they
make
themselves
more
hated
and
appear
to
be
impostors
i
have
therefore
taken
the
opposite
way
and
openly
acknowledge

and
do
not
deny
that
i
am
a
sophist
protagoras
first
used
the
name
of
sophist
and
that
my
business
is
to
give
men
culture
87
further
on
where
the
arts
which
hippocrates
was
to
acquire
under
protagoras
instruction
were
discussed
protagoras
answered
socrates
what
you
ask
is
sensible
and
i
like
to
answer
a
sensible
question
hippocrates
will
not
have
the
same
experience
that
he
would
have
with
other
teachers

these
latter
are
at
variance
with

their
pupils
for
they
take
them
against
their
wills
straight
back
to
the
arts
and
sciences
which
they
just
wished
to
escape
inasmuch
as
they
teach
them
arithmetic
geometry
and
music
but
he
who
comes
to
me
will
be
instructed
in
nothing
else
than
that
in
which
he
comes
to
be
instructed
thus
the
youths
came
freely
with
the
wish
to
be
made
men
of
culture
through
his
instruction
and
in
the
hope
that
he
as
teacher
knew
the
way
to
succeed
in
so
doing
as
to
his
general
aim
protagoras
says
the
instruction
consists
in
bringing
about
a
right
perception
and
understanding

of
the
best
way
of
regulating
ones
own
family
affairs
and
similarly
as
regards
citizenship
in
qualifying
men
both
to
speak
on
the
affairs
of
the
state
and
to
do
the
best
for
the
state
thus
two
interests
are
here
apparent
that
of
the
individual
and
that
of
the
state
now
socrates
expresses
dissent
and
surprise
at
protagoras
assertion
as
to
imparting
instruction
in
political
aptitude
i
thought
that
the
political
virtues
could
not
be
learned
for
it
is
socrates
main
tenet
that
virtue
cannot
be
taught
and
socrates
now
brings
forward
the
following
argument
after
the
manner
of
the
sophists
appealing
to
experience
those
who
are
masters
of
the
art
of
politics
cannot
impart
that
art
to
others
pericles
the
father
of
these
youths
gave
them
instruction
in
all
that
instructors
could
teach
but
not
in
the
science
for
which
he
is
celebrated
here
he
left
them
free
to
wander
in
the
chance
of
their
lighting
upon
wisdom
similarly
other
great
statesmen
did
not
teach
it
to
others
whether
friends
or
strangers88
protagoras
now
replied
that
it
could
be
taught
and
shows
the
reason
why
great
statesmen
did
not
give
this
instruction
while
he
asks
whether
he
is
to
speak
as
an
elder
to
younger
men
in
a
myth
or
whether
he
should
give
his
reasons
the
company
left
the
matter
to
him
and
he
began
with
the
following
myth
of
everlasting
interest
the
gods
commanded
prometheus
and
epimetheus
to
adorn
the
world
and
confer
on
it
its
qualities
and
powers
epimetheus
imparted
strength
power
of
flight
arms
clothing
herbs
and
fruits
but
in
some
incomprehensible
way
he
gave
all
to
the
beasts
so
that
nothing
remained
to
men
prometheus
saw
them
unclothed
unarmed
helpless
when
the
moment
came
in
which
the
form
of
man
had
to
go
forth
into
the
light
then
he
stole
fire
from
heaven
the
arts
of
vulcan
and
minerva
to
equip
man
for
his
needs
but
political
wisdom
was
wanting
and
living
without
any
common
bond
they
were
in
a
constant
state
of
strife
and
misery
then
zeus
gave
the
command
to
hermes
to
grant
reverence
natural
obedience
honour
docility
respect
of
children
for
parents
and
of
men
for
higher
and
better
natures
and
justice
hermes
asks
how
shall
i
impart
them
to
individuals
as
particular
arts
are
distributed
just
as
some
have
a
knowledge
of
medicine
sufficient
for
assisting
others
but
zeus
answers
that
it
must
be
to
all
for
no
body
of
men

can
exist
if
only
a
few
partake
of
those
qualities
and
it
shall
be
the
law
that
whoever
cannot
acknowledge
authority
and
justice
must
be
exterminated
as
a
plague
to
the
state
hence
the
athenians
when
they
wish
to
build
call
builders
into
counsel
and
when
they
contemplate
any
other
business
those
who
have
experience
in
it
but
when
they
wish
to
come
to
a
decision
or
make
a
regulation
in
state
affairs
they
admit
all
for
all
must
partake
of
this
virtue
or
no
state
could
exist
thus
if
anyone
is
inexperienced
in
the
art
of
fluteplaying
and
yet
professes
to
be
a
master
in
it
he
is
justly
thought
to
be
mad
but
in
justice
it
is
otherwise
if
anyone
is
not
just
and
confesses
it
he
is
thought
to
be
mad
he
must
profess
to
be
so
for
everybody
must
either
share
in
it
or
be
shut
out
from
social
life89
for
the
fact
that
this
political
science
is
also
so
constituted
that
everyone
by
education
and
diligence


may
acquire
it
protagoras
gives
additional
reasons
in
the
following
argument
no
one
blames
or
punishes
on
account
of
a
defect
or
evil
that
has
come
to
anyone
by
nature
or
by
chance
but
defects
and
faults
which
can
be
removed
through
diligence
exercise
and
teaching
are
considered
to
be
blameworthy
and
punishable
impiety
and
injustice
are
of
this
description
and
generally
speaking
all
that
opposes
public
virtue
men
guilty
of
these
sins
are
thus
reproached
they
are
punished
in
the
idea
that
they
had
the
power
to
remove
the
wrong
and
still
more
to
acquire
political
virtue
through
diligence
and
teaching
thus
men
do
not
punish
on
account
of
what
is
pastexcepting
as
we
strike
a
vicious
beast
on
the
headbut
on
account
of
what
is
to
come
so
that
neither
the
one
who
committed
the
crime
nor
any
other
misled
by
his
example
should
do
the
same
again
thus
it
is
in
this
implied
that
virtue
can
be
acquired
through
education
and
exercise90
this
is
a
good
argument
for
the
teachability
of
virtue
as
to
the
statement
of
socrates
that
men
such
as
pericles
who
were
famed
for
their
political
virtues
did
not
impart
these
to
their
children
and
friends
protagoras
in
the
first
place
says
that
it
may
on
the
other
hand
be
replied
that
in
these
virtues
all
men
are
instructed
by
all
men
political
virtue
is
so
constituted
that
it
is
the
common
province
of
all
this
one
essential
for
all
men
is
justice
temperance
and
holinessin
one
word
whatever
comprises
manly
virtue
in
it
no
particular
education
from
men
of
eminence
is
thus
required
the
children
are
from
their
earliest
infancy
exhorted
and
admonished
to
do
what
is
good
and
are
accustomed
to
that
which
is
right
instruction
in
music
and
gymnastics
contributes
to
temper
the
indulgence
of
selfwill
and
pleasure
and
to
accustom
men
to
conform
to
a
law
or
rule
and
the
reading
of
the
poets
who
enforce
this
does
the
same
when
man
steps
outside
this
circle
of
education
he
enters
into
that
of
the
constitution
of
a
state
which
likewise
contributes
to
keep
everyone
within
the
bounds
of
law
and
order
so
that
political
virtue
is
a
result
of
the
education
of
youth
but
the
objection
that
distinguished
men
did
not
impart
their
distinction
to
their
children
and
friends
protagoras
answered
secondly
and
very
well
as
follows
let
us
say
that
in
a
state
all
the
citizens
had
to
become
fluteplayers
all
would
be
instructed
in
the
art
some
would
be
distinguished
many
good
some
mediocre
a
few
perhaps
bad
and
yet
all
would
have
a
certain
amount
of
skill
but
it
might
very
well
be
the
case
that
the
son
of
an
artist
should
be
a
bad
player
for
the
distinction
depends
on
particular
talents
and
a
particularly
good
natural
capacity
from
very
skilful
players
very
unskilful
might
descend
and
conversely
but
all
would
have
a
certain
knowledge
of
the
flute
and
all
would
certainly
be
infinitely
better
than
those
who
were
quite
ignorant
of
the
art
similarly
all
even
the
worst
citizens
of
a
rational
state
are
better
and
juster
than
citizens
of
a
state
where
there
is
no
culture
nor
justice
nor
law
in
a
word
where
there
is
no
necessity
to
bring
them
up
to
be
just
for
this
superiority
they
have
to
thank
the
education
given
in
their
state91
all
these
are
quite
good
examples
and
striking
arguments
which
are
not
at
all
worse
than
ciceros
reasoninga
natura
insitum
the
arguments
of
socrates
and
the
development
of
these
arguments
are
on
the
contrary
examples
based
upon
experience
and
are
often
not
better
than
what
is
here
placed
in
the
mouth
of
a
sophist
what
now
confronts
us
is
the
question
of
how
far
this
may
be
inadequate
and
particularly
how
far
socrates
and
plato
came
into
collision
with
the
sophists
and
constituted
the
antagonism
to
them
for
the
claim
made
by
the
sophists
in
greece
was
that
they
had
given
a
higher
culture
to
their
people
for
this
indeed
great
credit
was
ascribed
to
them
in
greece
but
they
were
met
by
the
reproach
that
was
encountered
by
all
culture
that
is
to
say
because
the
sophists
were
masters
of
argument
and
reasoning
and
were
within
the
stage
of
reflective
thought
they
wished
passing
from
the
particular
to
the
universal
to
awaken
attention
through
examples
and
illustrations
to
what
in
his
experience
and
to
his
mind
appears
to
man
to
be
right
this
the
necessary
course
of
free
thinking
reflection
which
with
us
has
also
been
adopted
by
culture
must
however
necessarily
lead
beyond
implicit
trust
and
unrestricted
faith
in
the
current
morality
and
religion
the
statement
that
the
sophists
thereby
fell
into
onesided
principles
rests
upon
the
fact
that
in
greek
culture
the
time
had
not
yet
come
when
out
of
thinking
consciousness
itself
the
ultimate
principles
had
become
manifested
and
thus
there
was
something
firm
to
rest
upon
as
is
the
case
with
us
in
modern
times
because
on
the
one
hand
the
need
of
subjective
freedom
existed
merely
to
give
effect
to
that
which
man
himself
perceives
and
finds
present
in
his
reason
thus
laws
religious
ideas
only
in
so
far
as
i
recognize
them
through
my
thought
on
the
other
hand
no
fixed
principle
had
so
far
been
found
in
thought
thought
was
rather
reasoning
and
what
remained
indeterminate
could
thus
only
be
fulfilled
through
selfwill
it
is
otherwise
in
our
european
world
where
culture
is
so
to
speak
introduced
under
the
protection
and
in
presupposition
of
a
spiritual
religion
ie
not
of
a
religion
of
the
imagination
but
by
presupposing
a
knowledge
of
the
eternal
nature
of
spirit
and
of
the
absolute
end
of
the
end
of
man
to
be
in
a
spiritual
way
actual
and
to
posit
himself
in
unity
with
the
absolute
spirit
thus
here
there
is
a
groundwork
of
a
fixed
spiritual
principle
which
thus
satisfies
the
needs
of
the
subjective
mind
and
from
this
absolute
principle
all
further
relationships
duties
laws
c
are
established
consequently
culture
cannot
receive
the
variety
of
directionand
hence
the
aimlessnessof
the
greeks
and
of
those
who
extended
culture
over
greece
the
sophists
as
regards
the
religion
of
the
imagination
as
regards
the
undeveloped
principle
of
the
greek
state
culture
was
able
to
divide
itself
into
many
points
of
view
or
it
was
easy
to
it
to
represent
particular
subordinate
points
of
view
as
highest
principles
where
on
the
contrary
as
is
the
case
with
us
a
universal
aim
so
high
indeed
the
highest
possible
floats
before
the
imagination
a
particular
principle
cannot
so
easily
reach
this
rank
even
if
the
reflection
of
reason
attains
to
the
position
of
determining
and
recognizing
from
itself
what
is
highest
for
the
subordination
of
special
principles
is
already
determined
although
in
form
our
enlightenment
may
have
the
same
standpoint
as
that
of
the
sophists
as
regards
content
the
standpoint
of
the
sophists
differed
from
that
of
socrates
and
plato
in
that
the
mission
of
socrates
was
to
express
the
beautiful
good
true
and
right
as
the
end
and
aim
of
the
individual
while
with
the
sophists
the
content
was
not
present
as
an
ultimate
end
so
that
all
this
was
left
to
the
individual
will
hence
came
the
evil
reputation
obtained
by
the
sophists
through
the
antagonism
of
plato
and
this
is
certainly
their
defect
as
to
their
outward
lives
we
know
that
the
sophists
accumulated
great
riches92
they
became
very
proud
and
some
of
them
lived
very
luxuriously
but
in
respect
of
the
inward
life
reasoning
thought
has
in
distinction
to
plato
this
prevailing
characteristic
that
it
makes
duty
that
which
has
to
be
done
not
come
from
the
notion
of
the
thing
as
determined
in
and
for
itself
for
it
brings
forward
external
reasons
through
which
right
and
wrong
utility
and
harmfulness
are
distinguished
to
plato
and
socrates
on
the
other
hand
the
main
point
is
that
the
nature
of
the
conditions
should
be
considered
and
that
the
notion
of
the
thing
in
and
for
itself
should
become
evolved
socrates
and
plato
wished
to
bring
forward
this
notion
as
opposed
to
the
consideration
of
things
from
points
of
view
and
reasonings
which
are
always
merely
particular
and
individual
and
thus
opposed
to
the
notion
itself
the
distinction
in
the
two
points
of
view
is
thus
that
cultured
reasoning
only
belongs
in
a
general
way
to
the
sophists
while
socrates
and
plato
determined
thought
through
a
universal
determination
the
platonic
idea
or
something
fixed
which
mind
finds
eternally
in
itself
if
sophistry
is
bad
in
the
sense
that
it
signifies
a
quality
of
which
only
bad
men
are
guilty
it
is
at
the
same
time
much
more
common
than
this
would
imply
for
all
argumentative
reasoning
adducing
of
arguments
and
counterarguments
bringing
into
prominence
particular
points
of
view
is
sophistry
and
just
as
utterances
of
the
sophists
are
adduced
against
which
nothing
can
be
said
as
they
are
by
plato
men
of
our
day
are
urged
to
all
that
is
good
for
the
very
reasons
that
are
reasons
to
the
sophists
thus
it
is
said
do
not
cheat
else
you
lose
your
credit
hence
your
wealth
or
be
temperate
or
you
will
spoil
your
appetite
and
have
to
suffer
or
for
punishment
men
give
the
external
reasons
of
improvement
c
or
else
an
action
is
defended
on
external
grounds
taken
from
the
result
if
on
the
other
hand
firmly
rooted
principles
lie
at
the
foundationas
in
the
christian
religion
although
men
now
remember
this
no
longerit
is
said
the
grace
of
god
in
respect
of
holiness
c
thus
directs
the
life
of
men
and
these
external
grounds
fall
away
sophistry
thus
does
not
lie
so
far
from
us
as
we
think
when
educated
men
discuss
matters
nowadays
it
may
seem
all
very
good
but
it
is
in
no
way
different
from
what
socrates
and
plato
called
sophistryalthough
they
themselves
have
adopted
this
standpoint
as
truly
as
did
the
sophists
educated
men
fall
into
it
when
they
judge
of
concrete
cases
in
which
a
particular
point
of
view
determines
the
result
and
we
must
in
ordinary
life
do
the
same
if
we
wish
to
make
up
our
minds
in
action
if
duties
and
virtues
are
advocated
as
in
sermons
this
is
so
in
most
sermons
we
must
hear
such
reasons
given
other
speakers
such
as
those
in
parliament
likewise
make
use
of
arguments
and
counterarguments
similar
to
these
through
which
they
try
to
persuade
and
convince
on
the
one
hand
something
definite
is
in
question
such
as
the
constitution
or
a
war
and
from
the
fixed
direction
thus
given
certain
provisions
have
to
be
deduced
consistently
but
this
consistency
on
the
other
soon
disappears
just
because
the
matter
can
be
arranged
either
this
way
or
that
and
thus
particular
points
of
view
always
are
decisive
men
likewise
make
use
of
good
arguments
after
the
manner
of
the
sophists
against
philosophy
there
are
they
say
various
philosophies
various
opinions
and
this
is
contrary
to
the
one
truth
the
weakness
of
human
reason
allows
of
no
knowledge
what
is
philosophy
to
the
feelings
mind
and
heart
abstract
thinking
about
such
matters
produces
abstruse
results
which
are
of
no
use
in
the
practical
life
of
man
we
no
longer
apply
the
word
sophistry
thus
but
it
is
the
way
of
the
sophists
not
to
take
things
as
they
are
but
to
bring
about
their
proofs
by
arguments
derived
from
feelings
as
ultimate
ends
we
shall
see
this
characteristic
of
the
sophists
more
clearly
still
in
socrates
and
plato
with
such
reasoning
men
can
easily
get
so
far
as
to
know
where
they
do
not
it
is
owing
to
the
want
of
educationbut
the
sophists
were
very
well
educated
that
if
arguments
are
relied
upon
everything
can
be
proved
by
argument
and
arguments
for
and
against
can
be
found
for
everything
as
particular
however
they
throw
no
light
upon
the
universal
the
notion
thus
what
has
been
considered
the
sin
of
the
sophists
is
that
they
taught
men
to
deduce
any
conclusion
required
by
others
or
by
themselves
but
that
is
not
due
to
any
special
quality
in
the
sophists
but
to
reflective
reasoning
in
the
worst
action
there
exists
a
point
of
view
which
is
essentially
real
if
this
is
brought
to
the
front
men
excuse
and
vindicate
the
action
in
the
crime
of
desertion
in
time
of
war
there
is
for
example
the
duty
of
selfpreservation
similarly
in
more
modern
times
the
greatest
crimes
assassination
treachery
c
have
been
justified
because
in
the
purpose
there
lay
a
determination
which
was
actually
essential
such
as
that
men
must
resist
the
evil
and
promote
the
good
the
educated
man
knows
how
to
regard
everything
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
good
to
maintain
in
everything
a
real
point
of
view
a
man
does
not
require
to
make
great
progress
in
his
education
to
have
good
reasons
ready
for
the
worst
action
all
that
has
happened
in
the
world
since
the
time
of
adam
has
been
justified
by
some
good
reason
it
appears
that
the
sophists
were
conscious
of
this
reasoning
and
knew
as
educated
men
that
everything
could
be
proved
hence
in
platos
gorgias
it
is
said
that
the
art
of
the
sophists
is
a
greater
gift
than
any
other
they
could
convince
the
people
the
senate
the
judges
of
what
they
liked93
the
advocate
has
similarly
to
inquire
what
arguments
there
are
in
favour
of
the
party
which
claims
his
help
even
if
it
be
the
opposite
one
to
that
which
he
wished
to
support
that
knowledge
is
no
defect
but
is
part
of
the
higher
culture
of
the
sophists
and
if
uneducated
men
naturally
form
conclusions
from
external
grounds
which
are
those
alone
coming
to
their
knowledge
they
may
perhaps
be
mainly
determined
by
something
besides
what
they
know
by
their
integrity
for
instance
the
sophists
thus
knew
that
on
this
basis
nothing
was
secure
because
the
power
of
thought
treated
everything
dialectically
that
is
the
formal
culture
which
they
had
and
imparted
for
their
acquaintanceship
with
so
many
points
of
view
shook
what
was
morality
in
greece
the
religion
duties
and
laws
unconsciously
exercised
since
through
its
limited
content
that
came
into
collision
with
what
was
different
once
it
was
highest
and
ultimate
then
it
was
deposed
ordinary
knowledge
thus
becomes
confused
as
we
shall
see
very
clearly
in
socrates
for
something
is
held
to
be
certain
to
consciousness
and
then
other
points
of
view
which
are
also
present
and
recognized
have
similarly
to
be
allowed
hence
the
first
has
no
further
value
or
at
least
loses
its
supremacy
we
saw
in
the
same
way
how
bravery
which
lies
in
the
hazarding
of
ones
life
is
made
dubious
by
the
duty
of
preserving
life
if
put
forward
unconditionally
plato
quotes
several
examples
of
this
unsettling
tendency
as
when
he
makes
dionysodorus
maintain
whoever
gives
culture
to
one
who
does
not
possess
knowledge
desires
that
he
should
no
longer
remain
what
he
is
he
desires
to
direct
him
to
reason
and
this
is
to
make
him
not
the
same
as
he
is
and
euthydemus
when
the
others
say
that
he
lies
answers
who
lies
says
what
is
not
men
cannot
say
what
is
not
and
thus
no
one
can
lie94
and
again
dionysodorus
says
you
have
a
dog
this
dog
has
young
and
is
a
father
thus
a
dog
is
your
father
and
you
are
brother
to
its
young95
sequences
put
together
thus
are
constantly
found
in
critical
treatises
with
this
comes
the
question
which
the
nature
of
thought
brings
along
with
it
if
the
field
of
argument
that
which
consciousness
holds
to
be
firmly
established
is
shaken
by
reflection
what
is
man
now
to
take
as
his
ultimate
basis
for
something
fixed
there
must
be
this
is
either
the
good
the
universal
or
the
individuality
the
arbitrary
will
of
the
subject
and
both
may
be
united
as
is
shown
later
on
in
socrates
to
the
sophists
the
satisfaction
of
the
individual
himself
was
now
made
ultimate
and
since
they
made
everything
uncertain
the
fixed
point
was
in
the
assertion
it
is
my
desire
my
pride
glory
and
honour
particular
subjectivity
which
i
make
my
end
thus
the
sophists
are
reproached
for
countenancing
personal
affections
private
interests
c
this
proceeds
directly
from
the
nature
of
their
culture
which
because
it
places
ready
various
points
of
view
makes
it
depend
on
the
pleasure
of
the
subject
alone
which
shall
prevail
that
is
if
fixed
principles
do
not
determine
here
the
danger
lies
this
takes
place
also
in
the
present
day
where
the
right
and
the
true
in
our
actions
is
made
to
depend
on
good
intention
and
on
my
own
conviction
the
real
end
of
the
state
the
best
administration
and
constitution
is
likewise
to
demagogues
very
vague
on
account
of
their
formal
culture
the
sophists
have
a
place
in
philosophy
on
account
of
their
reflection
they
have
not
they
are
associated
with
philosophy
in
that
they
do
not
remain
at
concrete
reasoning
but
go
on
at
least
in
part
to
ultimate
determinations
a
chief
part
of
their
culture
was
the
generalization
of
the
eleatic
mode
of
thought
and
its
extension
to
the
whole
content
of
knowledge
and
of
action
the
positive
thus
comes
in
as
and
has
become
utility
to
go
into
particulars
respecting
the
sophists
would
lead
us
too
far
individual
sophists
have
their
place
in
the
general
history
of
culture
the
celebrated
sophists
are
very
numerous
the
most
celebrated
amongst
them
are
protagoras
gorgias
and
also
prodicus
the
teacher
of
socrates
to
whom
socrates
ascribes
the
wellknown
myth
of
the
choice
of
hercules96an
allegory
beautiful
in
its
own
way
which
has
been
repeated
hundreds
and
thousands
of
times
i
will
deal
only
with
protagoras
and
gorgias
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
culture
but
in
respect
of
proving
further
how
the
general
knowledge
which
they
extended
to
everything
has
with
one
of
them
the
universal
form
which
makes
it
pure
science
plato
is
the
chief
source
of
our
acquaintanceship
with
the
sophists
for
he
occupied
himself
largely
with
them
then
we
have
aristotles
own
little
treatise
on
gorgias
and
sextus
empiricus
who
preserved
for
us
much
of
the
philosophy
of
protagoras
1
protagoras
protagoras
born
at
abdera97
was
somewhat
older
than
socrates
little
more
is
known
of
him
nor
indeed
could
there
be
much
known
for
he
led
a
uniform
life
since
he
spent
it
in
the
study
of
the
sciences
he
appeared
in
greece
proper
as
the
first
public
teacher
he
read
his
writings98
like
the
rhapsodists
and
poets
the
former
of
whom
sang
the
verses
of
others
and
the
latter
their
own
there
were
then
no
places
of
learning
no
books
from
which
men
could
be
taught
for
to
the
ancients
as
plato
says99
the
chief
part
of
culture

consisted
in
being
skilled

in
poetry
just
as
with
us
fifty
years
ago
the
principal
instruction
of
the
people
consisted
of
bible
history
and
biblical
precepts
the
sophists
now
gave
in
place
of
a
knowledge
of
the
poets
an
acquaintanceship
with
thought
protagoras
also
came
to
athens
and
there
lived
for
long
principally
with
the
great
pericles
who
also
entered
into
this
culture
indeed
the
two
once
argued
for
a
whole
day
as
to
whether
the
dart
or
the
thrower
or
he
who
arranged
the
contest
was
guilty
of
the
death
of
a
man
who
thus
met
his
death100
the
dispute
is
over
the
great
and
important
question
of
the
possibility
of
imputation
guilt
is
a
general
expression
the
analysis
of
which
may
undoubtedly
become
a
difficult
and
extensive
undertaking
in
his
intercourse
with
such
men
pericles
developed
his
genius
for
eloquence
for
whatever
kind
of
mental
occupation
may
be
in
question
a
cultivated
mind
can
alone
excel
in

science
pericles
was
a
powerful
orator
and
we
see
from
thucydides
how
deep
a
knowledge
he
had
of
the
state
and
of
his
people
protagoras
had
the
same
fate
as
anaxagoras
in
being
afterwards
banished
from
athens
the
cause
of
this
sentence
was
a
work
written
by
him
beginning
as
to
the
gods
i
am
not
able
to
say
whether
they
are
or
are
not
for
there
is
much
which
prevents
this
knowledge
both
in
the
obscurity
of
the
matter
and
in
the
life
of
man
which
is
so
short
this
book
was
also
publicly
burned
in
athens
by
command
of
the
state
and
so
far
as
we
know
it
was
the
first
to
be
treated
so
at
the
age
of
seventy
or
ninety
years
protagoras
was
drowned
while
on
a
voyage
to
sicily101
protagoras
was
not
like
other
sophists
merely
a
teacher
of
culture
but
likewise
a
deep
and
solid
thinker
a
philosopher
who
reflected
on
fundamental
determinations
of
an
altogether
universal
kind
the
main
point
in
his
system
of
knowledge
he
expressed
thus
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
of
that
which
is
that
it
is
of
that
which
is
not
that
it
is
not102
on
the
one
hand
therefore
what
had
to
be
done
was
to
grasp
thought
as
determined
and
as
having
content
but
on
the
other
to
find
the
determining
and
contentgiving
this
universal
determination
then
becomes
the
standard
by
which
everything
is
judged
now
protagoras
assertion
is
in
its
real
meaning
a
great
truth
but
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
certain
ambiguity
in
that
as
man
is
the
undetermined
and
manysided
either
he
may
in
his
individual
particularity
as
this
contingent
man
be
the
measure
or
else
selfconscious
reason
in
man
man
in
his
rational
nature
and
his
universal
substantiality
is
the
absolute
measure
if
the
statement
is
taken
in
the
former
sense
all
is
selfseeking
all
selfinterest
the
subject
with
his
interests
forms
the
central
point
and
if
man
has
a
rational
side
reason
is
still
something
subjective
it
is
he
but
this
is
just
the
wrong
and
perverted
way
of
looking
at
things
which
necessarily
forms
the
main
reproach
made
against
the
sophiststhat
they
put
forward
man
in
his
contingent
aims
as
determining
thus
with
them
the
interest
of
the
subject
in
its
particularity
and
the
interest
of
the
same
in
its
substantial
reason
are
not
distinguished
the
same
statement
is
brought
forward
in
socrates
and
plato
but
with
the
further
modification
that
here
man
in
that
he
is
thinking
and
gives
himself
a
universal
content
is
the
measure
thus
here
the
great
proposition
is
enunciated
on
which
from
this
time
forward
everything
turns
since
the
further
progress
of
philosophy
only
explains
it
further
it
signifies
that
reason
is
the
end
of
all
things
this
proposition
further
expresses
a
very
remarkable
change
of
position
in
asserting
that
all
content
everything
objective
is
only
in
relation
to
consciousness
thought
is
thus
in
all
truth
expressed
as
the
essential
moment
and
thereby
the
absolute
takes
the
form
of
the
thinking
subjectivity
which
comes
before
us
principally
in
socrates
since
man
as
subject
is
the
measure
of
everything
the
existent
is
not
alone
but
is
for
my
knowledge
consciousness
is
really
the
producer
of
the
content
in
what
is
objective
and
subjective
thinking
is
thus
really
active
and
this
view
extends
even
to
the
most
modern
philosophy
as
when
for
instance
kant
says
that
we
only
know
phenomena
ie
that
what
seems
to
us
to
be
objective
reality
is
only
to
be
considered
in
its
relation
to
consciousness
and
does
not
exist
without
this
relation
the
fact
that
the
subject
as
active
and
determining
brings
forth
the
content
is
the
important
matter
but
now
the
question
comes
as
to
how
the
content
is
further
determinedwhether
it
is
limited
to
the
particularity
of
consciousness
or
is
determined
as
the
universal
the
existent
in
and
for
itself
god
the
platonic
good
is
certainly
at
first
a
product
of
thought
but
in
the
second
place
he
is
just
as
really
in
and
for
himself
since
i
as
existent
fixed
and
eternal
only
recognize
what
is
in
its
content
universal
this
posited
as
it
is
by
me
is
likewise
the
implicitly
objective
not
posited
by
me
protagoras
himself
shows
us
much
more
of
what
is
implied
in
his
theory
for
he
says
truth
is
a
manifestation
for
consciousness
nothing
is
in
and
for
itself
one
but
everything
has
a
relative
truth
only
ie
it
is
what
it
is
but
for
another
which
is
man
this
relativity
is
by
protagoras
expressed
in
a
way
which
seems
to
us
in
some
measure
trivial
and
belongs
to
the
first
beginnings
of
reflective
thought
the
insignificant
examples
which
he
adduces
like
plato
and
socrates
when
they
follow
out
in
them
the
point
of
view
of
reflection
by
way
of
explanation
show
that
in
protagoras
understanding
what
is
determined
is
not
grasped
as
the
universal
and
identical
with
self
hence
the
exemplifications
are
taken
mostly
from
sensuous
manifestation
in
a
wind
it
may
be
that
one
person
is
cold
and
another
is
not
hence
of
this
wind
we
cannot
tell
whether
in
itself
it
is
cold
or
hot103
frost
and
heat
are
thus
not
anything
which
exist
but
only
are
in
their
relation
to
a
subject
were
the
wind
cold
in
itself
it
would
always
be
so
to
the
subject
or
again
if
we
have
here
six
dice
and
place
by
them
four
others
we
should
say
of
the
former
that
there
are
more
of
them
but
again
if
we
put
twelve
by
them
we
say
that
these
first
six
are
the
fewer104
because
we
say
of
the
same
number
that
it
is
more
and
fewer
the
more
and
the
less
is
merely
a
relative
determination
thus
what
is
the
object
is
so
in
the
idea
present
to
consciousness
only
plato
on
the
contrary
considered
one
and
many
not
like
the
sophists
in
their
distinction
but
as
being
one
and
the
same
plato
says
further
on
this
point
that
the
white
warm
c
or
everything
that
we
say
of
things
does
not
exist
for
itself
but
that
the
eye
sensation
is
necessary
to
make
it
for
us
this
reciprocal
movement
is
what
first
creates
the
white
and
in
it
the
white
is
not
a
thing
in
itself
but
what
we
have
present
is
a
seeing
eye
or
to
speak
generally
sight
and
particularly
the
seeing
of
white
the
feeling
of
warmth
c
undoubtedly
warmth
colour
c
really
are
only
in
relation
to
another
but
the
conceiving
mind
divides
itself
into
itself
and
into
a
world
in
which
each
also
has
its
relation
this
objective
relativity
is
expressed
better
in
the
following
way
if
the
white
were
in
itself
it
would
be
that
which
brought
forth
the
sensation
of
it
it
would
be
the
action
or
the
cause
and
we
on
the
contrary
the
passive
and
receptive
but
the
object
which
thus
requires
to
be
active
is
not
active
until
it
enters
into

relation
with
the
passive
similarly
the
passive
is
only
in
relation
to
the
active
thus
what
is
said
in
defining
anything
never
concerns
the
thing
as
in
itself
but
clearly
only
as
being
related
to
something
else
nothing
is
thus
constituted
in
and
for
itself
as
it
appears
but
the
truth
is
just
this
phenomenon
to
which
our
activity
contributes
as
things
appear
to
the
healthy
man
they
are
thus
not
in
themselves
but
for
him
as
they
appear
to
the
sick
or
deranged
man
they
are
to
him
without
our
being
able
to
say
that
as
they
appear
to
him
they
are
not
true105
we
feel
the
awkwardness
of
calling
any
such
thing
true
for
after
all
the
existent
if
related
to
consciousness
is
yet
not
related
to
it
as
fixed
but
to
sensuous
knowledge
and
then
this
consciousness
itself
is
a
condition
ie
something
which
passes
away
protagoras
rightly
recognized
this
double
relativity
when
he
says
matter
is
a
pure
flux
it
is
not
anything
fixed
and
determined
in
itself
for
it
can
be
everything
and
it
is
different
to
different
ages
and
to
the
various
conditions
of
waking
and
sleep
c106
kant
separates
himself
from
this
standpoint
only
in
that
he
places
the
relativity
in
the
i
and
not
in
objective
existence
the
phenomenon
is
according
to
him
nothing
but
the
fact
of
there
being
outside
an
impulse
an
unknown
x
which
first
receives
these
determinations
through
our
feeling
even
if
there
were
an
objective
ground
for
our
calling
one
thing
cold
and
another
warm
we
could
indeed
say
that
they
must
have
diversity
in
themselves
but
warmth
and
cold
first
become
what
they
are
in
our
feeling
similarly
it
can
only
be
in
our
conception
that
things
are
outside
of
us
etc
but
if
the
experience
is
quite
correctly
called
a
phenomenon
ie
something
relative
because
it
does
not
come
to
pass
without
the
determinations
of
the
activity
of
our
senses
nor
without
categories
of
thought
yet
that
one
allpervading
universal
which
permeates
all
experience
which
to
heraclitus
was
necessity
has
to
be
brought
into
consciousness
we
see
that
protagoras
possesses
great
powers
of
reflective
thought
and
indeed
reflection
on
consciousness
came
to
consciousness
with
protagoras
but
this
is
the
form
of
manifestation
which
was
again
taken
by
the
later
sceptics
the
phenomenal
is
not
sensuous
being
for
because
i
posit
this
as
phenomenal
i
assert
its
nullity
but
the
statements
what
is
is
only
for
consciousness
or
the
truth
of
all
things
is
the
manifestation
of
them
in
and
for
consciousness
seem
quite
to
contradict
themselves
for
it
appears
as
though
a
contradiction
were
assertedfirst
that
nothing
is
in
itself
as
it
appears
and
then
that
it
is
true
as
it
appears
but
objective
significance
must
not
be
given
to
the
positive
to
what
is
true
as
if
for
example
this
were
white
in
itself
because
it
appears
so
for
it
is
only
this
manifestation
of
the
white
that
is
true
the
manifestation
being
just
this
movement
of
the
selfabrogating
sensuous
being
which
taken
in
the
universal
stands
above
consciousness
as
truly
as
above
being
the
world
is
consequently
not
only
phenomenal
in
that
it
is
for
consciousness
and
thus
that
its
being
is
only
one
relative
to
consciousness
for
it
is
likewise
in
itself
phenomenal
the
element
of
consciousness
which
protagoras
has
demonstrated
and
owing
to
which
the
developed
universal
has
in
it
the
moment
of
the
negative
beingforanother
has
thus
indeed
to
be
asserted
as
a
necessary
moment
but
taken
for
itself
alone
and
isolated
it
is
onesided
since
the
moment
of
implicit
being
is
likewise
essential

could
say
of
every
philosopher
that
he
went
further
than
healthy
human
understanding
for
what
men
call
healthy
understanding
is
not
philosophy
and
is
often
far
from
healthy
healthy
human
understanding
possesses
the
modes
of
thought
maxims
and
judgments
of
its
time
the
thoughtdeterminations
of
which
dominate
it
without
its
being
conscious
thereof
in
this
way
gorgias
undoubtedly
went
further
than
healthy
understanding
before
copernicus
it
would
have
been
contrary
to
all
healthy
human
understanding
if
anyone
had
said
that
the
earth
went
round
the
sun
or
before
the
discovery
of
america
if
it
were
said
that
there
was
a
continent
there
in
india
or
in
china
a
republic
would
even
now
be
contrary
to
all
healthy
understanding
the
dialectic
of
gorgias
moves
more
purely
in
notion
than
that
found
in
protagoras
since
protagoras
asserted
the
relativity
or
the
nonimplicit
nature
of
all
that
is
this
only
exists
in
relation
to
another
which
really
is
essential
to
it
and
this
last
indeed
is
consciousness
gorgias
demonstration
of
the
nonimplicitness
of
being
is
purer
because
he
takes
in
itself
what
passes
for
real
existence
without
presupposing
that
other
and
thus
shows
its
own
essential
nullity
and
separates
therefrom
the
subjective
side
and
being
as
it
is
for
the
latter
gorgias
treatise
on
nature
in
which
he
composes
his
dialectic
falls
according
to
sextus
empiricus
adv
math
vii
65
into
three
parts
in
the
first
he
proves
that
objectively
nothing
exists
in
the
second
subjectively
that
assuming
that
being
is
it
cannot
be
known
and
in
the
third
place
both
subjectively
and
objectively
that
were
it
to
exist
and
be
knowable
no
communication
of
what
is
known
would
be
possible
gorgias
was
a
congenial
subject
to
sextus
but
the
former
still
proved
and
this
is
what
the
sceptics
ceased
to
do
here
very
abstract
thoughtdeterminations
regarding
the
most
speculative
moments
of
being
and
nonbeing
of
knowledge
and
of
bringing
into
existence
of
communicating
knowledge
are
involved
and
this
is
no
idle
talk
as
was
formerly
supposed
for
gorgias
dialectic
is
of
a
quite
objective
kind
and
is
most
interesting
in
content
a
if
anything
is
this
anything
is
however
a
makeshift
that
we
are
in
the
habit
of
using
in
our
conversation
and
which
is
properly
speaking
inappropriate
for
it
implies
an
opposition
of
subject
and
predicate
while
at
present
the
is
alone
is
in
questionthen
if
it
is
and
now
it
becomes
for
the
first
time
defined
as
subject
it
is
either
the
existent
or
the
nonexistent
or
else
existence
and
nonexistence
it
is
now
evident
of
these
three
that
they
are
not108

that
which
is
not
is
not
for
if
being
belonged
to
it
there
would
at
the
same
time
be
existence
and
nonexistence
that
is
in
so
far
as
it
is
thought
of
as
nonexistent
it
is
not
but
in
so
far
as
it
is
the
nonexistent
it
must
exist
but
it
cannot
at
the
same
time
be
and
not
be
again
if
the
nonexistent
is
the
existent
is
not
for
the
two
are
opposed
thus
if
being
pertained
to
nonbeing
nonbeing
would
belong
to
being
but
if
being
does
not
exist
no
more
does
nonbeing109
this
is
with
gorgias
a
characteristic
mode
of
reasoning110

but
in
proving
aristotle
adds
to
the
passages
just
quoted
that
the
existent
is
not
he
follows
melissus
and
zeno
this
is
the
dialectic
already
brought
forward
by
them
if
being
is
it
is
contradictory
to
predicate
a
quality
to
it
and
if
we
do
this
we
express
something
merely
negative
about
it

for
gorgias
says
what
is
either
is
in
itself

being
without
beginning
or
it
has
originated
and
he
now
shows
that
it
could
neither
be
the
one
nor
the
other
for
each
leads
to
contradiction
it
cannot
be
the
former
for
what
is
in
itself
has
no
beginning
and
is
the
infinite
and
hence
likewise
undetermined
and
indeterminable
the
infinite
is
nowhere
for
if
it
is
anywhere
that
in
which
it
is
is
different
from
it
where
it
is
it
is
in
another
but
that
is
not
infinite
which
is
different
from
another
and
contained
in
another
just
as
little
is
it
contained
in
itself
for
then
that
in
which
it
is
and
that
which
is
therein
would
be
the
same
what
it
is
in
is
the
place
that
which
is
in
this
is
the
body
but
that
both
should
be
the
same
is
absurd
the
infinite
does
not
thus
exist111
this
dialectic
of
gorgias
regarding
the
infinite
is
on
the
one
hand
limited
because
immediate
existence
has
certainly
no
beginning
and
no
limit
but
asserts
a
progression
into
infinitude
the
selfexistent
thought
the
universal
notion
as
absolute
negativity
has
however
limits
in
itself
on
the
other
hand
gorgias
is
quite
right
for
the
bad
sensuous
infinite
is
nowhere
present
and
thus
does
not
exist
but
is
a
beyond
of
being
only
we
may
take
what
gorgias
takes
as
a
diversity
of
place
as
being
diversity
generally
thus
instead
of
placing
the
infinite
like
gorgias
sometimes
in
another
sometimes
within
itself
ie
sometimes
maintaining
it
to
be
different
sometimes
abrogating
the
diversity
we
may
say
better
and
more
universally
that
this
sensuous
infinite
is
a
diversity
which
is
always
posited
as
different
from
the
existent
for
it
is
just
the
being
different
from
itself
in
the
same
way
being
has
not
originated
because
it
must
then
have
come
either
from
the
existent
or
from
the
nonexistent
from
the
existent
it
did
not
arise
for
then
it
would
be
already
just
as
little
from
the
nonexistent
because
this
cannot
beget
anything112
the
sceptics
followed
this
up
further
the
object
to
be
contemplated
hence
ever
becomes
posited
under
determinations
with
either
or
which
then
contradict
one
another
but
that
is
not
the
true
dialectic
because
the
object
resolves
itself
into
those
determinations
only
when
nothing
follows
respecting
the
nature
of
the
object
itself
then
as
is
already
proved
the
object
must
be
necessarily
in
one
determination
and
not
in
and
for
itself

in
a
similar
way
gorgias
shows
of
what
exists
that
it
must
either
be
one
or
many
but
neither
is
possible
for
as
one
it
would
have
a
certain
magnitude
or
continuity
or
number
or
body
but
all
this
is
not
one
but
different
divisible
every
sensuous
one
is
in
fact
necessarily
another
a
manifold
if
it
is
not
one
it
cannot
be
many
for
the
many
is
many
ones113

similarly
both
being
and
nonbeing
cannot
exist
at
the
same
time
if
one
exists
as
much
as
the
other
they
are
the
same
and
therefore
neither
of
them
is
for
the
nonbeing
does
not
exist
and
hence
neither
does
the
being
since
it
is
identical
with
it
nor
can
they
on
the
other
hand
both
exist
for
if
they
are
identical
i
cannot
express
them
both114
and
thus
both
do
not
exist
for
if
i
express
both
i
differentiate
this
dialectic
which
aristotle
de
xenoph
c
c
5
likewise
designates
as
peculiar
to
gorgias
has
its
truth
in
speaking
of
being
and
nonbeing
we
always
say
the
opposite
to
what
we
wish
being
and
nonbeing
are
the
same
just
as
they
are
not
the
same
if
they
are
the
same
i
speak
of
the
two
as
different
if
different
i
express
the
same
predicate
of
them
diversity
this
dialectic
is
not
to
be
despised
by
us
as
if
it
dealt
with
empty
abstractions
for
these
categories
are
on
the
one
hand
in
their
purity
the
most
universal
and
if
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
the
ultimate
yet
it
is
always
being
or
nonbeing
that
are
in
question
they
are
not
however
definitely
fixed
and
divided
off
but
are
selfabrogating
gorgias
is
conscious
that
they
are
vanishing
moments
while
the
ordinary
unconscious
conception
also
has
present
to
it
this
truth
but
knows
nothing
about
it
b
the
relation
of
the
conceiver
to
conception
the
difference
between
conception
and
being
is
a
subject
which
is
in
our
mouths
today
but
if
there
is
an
is
it
is
unknowable
and
unthinkable
for
what
is
presented
is
not
the
existent
but
only
a
presentation
if
what
is
presented
is
white
it
is
the
case
that
white
is
presented
if
what
is
presented
is
not
the
really
existent
it
is
the
case
that
what
is
is
not
presented
for
if
what
is
presented
is
the
real
existent
everything
that
is
presented
also
exists
but
no
one
says
that
if
a
flying
man
or
waggon
riding
on
the
sea
were
presented
to
us
it
would
exist
further
if
what
is
presented
is
the
existent
the
nonexistent
is
not
presented
for
opposites
are
in
opposition
but
this
nonexistent
is
everywhere
presented
as
it
is
in
scylla
and
the
chimra115
gorgias
on
the
one
hand
pronounces
a
just
polemic
against
absolute
realism
which
because
it
represents
thinks
to
possess
the
very
thing
itself
when
it
only
has
a
relative
but
he
falls
on
the
other
hand
into
the
false
idealism
of
modern
times
according
to
which
thought
is
always
subjective
only
and
thus
not
the
existent
since
through
thought
an
existent
is
transformed
into
what
is
thought
c
we
finally
have
the
basis
of
the
dialectic
of
gorgias
in
respect
of
the
third
point
that
knowledge
cannot
be
imparted
in
this
if
the
existent
were
presented
it
could
still
not
be
expressed
and
imparted
things
are
visible
audible
c
or
are
experienced
the
visible
is
grasped
through
sight
the
audible
through
hearing
and
not
the
contrary
way
thus
the
one
cannot
be
indicated
by
the
other
speech
by
which
the
existent
has
to
be
expressed
is
not
the
existent
what
is
imparted
is
thus
not
the
existent
but
only
words116
in
this
manner
gorgias
dialectic
is
the
laying
hold
of
this
difference
exactly
as
again
occurred
in
kant
if
i
maintain
this
difference
certainly
that
which
is
cannot
be
known
this
dialectic
is
undoubtedly
impregnable
to
those
who
maintain
sensuous
being
to
be
real
but
its
truth
is
only
this
movement
to
posit
itself
negatively
as
existent
and
the
unity
is
the
reflection
that
the
existent
comprehended
also
as
nonexistent
becomes
in
this
comprehension
of
it
universal
that
this
existent
cannot
be
imparted
must
likewise
be
held
most
strongly
for
this
individual
cannot
be
expressed
philosophic
truth
is
thus
not
only
expressed
as
if
there
were
another
truth
in
sensuous
consciousness
but
being
is
present
in
that
philosophic
truth
expresses
it
the
sophists
thus
also
made
dialectic
universal
philosophy
their
object
and
they
were
profound
thinkers
bsocrates
consciousness
had
reached
this
point
in
greece
when
in
athens
the
great
form
of
socrates
in
whom
the
subjectivity
of
thought
was
brought
to
consciousness
in
a
more
definite
and
more
thorough
manner
now
appeared
but
socrates
did
not
grow
like
a
mushroom
out
of
the
earth
for
he
stands
in
continuity
with
his
time
and
thus
is
not
only
a
most
important
figure
in
the
history
of
philosophyperhaps
the
most
interesting
in
the
philosophy
of
antiquitybut
is
also
a
worldfamed
personage
for
a
mental
turningpoint
exhibited
itself
in
him
in
the
form
of
philosophic
thought
if
we
shortly
recall
the
periods
already
passed
over
we
find
that
the
ancient
ionic
philosophers
certainly
thought
but
without
reflecting
on
the
thought
or
defining
its
product
as
thought
the
atomists
made
objective
existence
into
thoughts
but
these
were
to
them
only
abstractions
pure
entities
anaxagoras
on
the
other
hand
raised
thought
as
such
into
a
principle
which
thereby
presented
itself
as
the
allpowerful
notion
as
the
negative
power
over
all
that
is
definite
and
existent
protagoras
finally
expresses
thought
as
real
existence
but
it
is
in
this
its
movement
which
is
the
allresolving
consciousness
the
unrest
of
the
notion
this
unrest
is
in
itself
at
the
same
time
something
restful
or
secure
but
the
fixed
point
of
motion
as
such
is
the
i
for
it
has
the
moments
of
movement
outside
of
it
as
the
selfretaining
which
only
abrogates
what
is
different
the
i
is
negative
unity
but
just
in
that
very
way
individual
and
not
yet
the
universal
reflected
within
itself
now
we
here
find
the
ambiguity
of
dialectic
and
sophistry
which
rests
in
the
fact
that
if
the
objective
disappears
the
signification
of
the
fixed
subjective
is
either
that
of
the
individual
opposed
to
the
objective
and
thereby
the
contingent
and
lawless
will
or
that
of
the
objective
and
universal
in
itself
socrates
expresses
real
existence
as
the
universal
i
as
the
consciousness
which
rests
in
itself
but
that
is
the
good
as
such
which
is
free
from
existent
reality
free
from
individual
sensuous
consciousness
of
feeling
and
desire
free
finally
from
the
theoretically
speculative
thought
about
nature
which
if
indeed
thought
has
still
the
form
of
being
and
in
which
i
am
not
certain
of
my
existence
socrates
herein
adopted
firstly
the
doctrine
of
anaxagoras
that
thought
the
understanding
is
the
ruling
and
selfdetermining
universal
though
this
principle
did
not
as
with
the
sophists
attain
the
form
of
formal
culture
or
of
abstract
philosophizing
thus
if
with
socrates
as
with
protagoras
the
selfconscious
thought
that
abrogates
all
that
is
determined
was
real
existence
with
socrates
this
was
the
case
in
such
a
way
that
he
at
the
same
time
grasped
in
thought
rest
and
security
this
substance
existing
in
and
for
itself
the
selfretaining
has
become
determined
as
end
and
further
as
the
true
and
the
good
to
this
determination
of
the
universal
we
have
in
the
second
place
to
add
that
this
good
which
has
by
me
to
be
esteemed
as
substantial
end
must
be
known
by
me
with
this
the
infinite
subjectivity
the
freedom
of
selfconsciousness
in
socrates
breaks
out
this
freedom
which
is
contained
therein
the
fact
that
consciousness
is
clearly
present
in
all
that
it
thinks
and
must
necessarily
be
at
home
with
itself
is
in
our
time
constantly
and
plainly
demanded
the
substantial
although
eternal
and
in
and
for
itself
must
as
truly
be
produced
through
me
but
this
my
part
in
it
is
only
the
formal
activity
thus
socrates
principle
is
that
man
has
to
find
from
himself
both
the
end
of
his
actions
and
the
end
of
the
world
and
must
attain
to
truth
through
himself
true
thought
thinks
in
such
a
way
that
its
import
is
as
truly
objective
as
subjective
but
objectivity
has
been
the
significance
of
substantial
universality
and
not
of
external
objectivity
thus
truth
is
now
posited
as
a
product
mediated
through
thought
while
untrained
morality
as
sophocles
makes
antigone
say
vers
454457
is
the
eternal
law
of
the
gods
and
no
one
knew
from
whence
it
came
but
though
in
modern
times
we
hear
much
said
of
immediate
knowledge
and
belief
it
is
a
misconception
to
maintain
that
their
content
god
the
good
just
c
although
the
content
of
feeling
and
conception
is
not
as
spiritual
content
also
posited
through
thought
the
animal
has
no
religion
because
it
only
feels
but
what
is
spiritual
rests
on
the
mediation
of
thought
and
pertains
to
man
since
socrates
thus
introduces
the
infinitely
important
element
of
leading
back
the
truth
of
the
objective
to
the
thought
of
the
subject
just
as
protagoras
says
that
the
objective
first
is
through
relation
to
us
the
battle
of
socrates
and
plato
with
the
sophists
cannot
rest
on
the
ground
that
these
as
belonging
to
the
old
faith
maintained
against
the
others
the
religion
and
customs
of
greece
for
the
violation
of
which
anaxagoras
was
condemned
quite
the
contrary
reflection
and
the
reference
of
any
judgment
to
consciousness
is
held
by
socrates
in
common
with
the
sophists
but
the
opposition
into
which
socrates
and
plato
were
in
their
philosophy
necessarily
brought
in
regard
to
the
sophists
as
the
universal
philosophic
culture
of
the
times
was
as
followsthe
objective
produced
through
thought
is
at
the
same
time
in
and
for
itself
thus
being
raised
above
all
particularity
of
interests
and
desires
and
being
the
power
over
them
hence
because
on
the
one
hand
to
socrates
and
plato
the
moment
of
subjective
freedom
is
the
directing
of
consciousness
into
itself
on
the
other
this
return
is
also
determined
as
a
coming
out
from
particular
subjectivity
it
is
hereby
implied
that
contingency
of
events
is
abolished
and
man
has
this
outside
within
him
as
the
spiritual
universal
this
is
the
true
the
unity
of
subjective
and
objective
in
modern
terminology
while
the
kantian
ideal
is
only
phenomenal
and
not
objective
in
itself
in
the
third
place
socrates
accepted
the
good
at
first
only
in
the
particular
significance
of
the
practical
which
nevertheless
is
only
one
mode
of
the
substantial
idea
the
universal
is
not
only
for
me
but
also
as
end
existent
in
and
for
itself
the
principle
of
the
philosophy
of
nature
and
in
this
higher
sense
it
was
taken
by
plato
and
aristotle
of
socrates
it
is
hence
said
in
the
older
histories
of
philosophy
that
his
main
distinction
was
having
added
ethics
as
a
new
conception
to
philosophy
which
formerly
only
took
nature
into
consideration
diogenes
laertius
in
like
manner
says
iii
56
that
the
ionics
founded
natural
philosophy
socrates
ethics
and
plato
added
to
them
dialectic
now
ethics
is
partly
objective
and
partly
subjective
and
reflected
morality
sittlichkeit
und
moralitt117
and
the
teaching
of
socrates
is
properly
subjectively
moral
because
in
it
the
subjective
side
my
perception
and
meaning
is
the
prevailing
moment
although
this
determination
of
selfpositing
is
likewise
sublated
and
the
good
and
eternal
is
what
is
in
and
for
itself
objective
morality
is
on
the
contrary
natural
since
it
signifies
the
knowledge
and
doing
of
what
is
in
and
for
itself
good
the
athenians
before
socrates
were
objectively
and
not
subjectively
moral
for
they
acted
rationally
in
their
relations
without
knowing
that
they
were
particularly
excellent
reflective
morality
adds
to
natural
morality
the
reflection
that
this
is
the
good
and
not
that
the
kantian
philosophy
which
is
reflectively
moral
again
showed
the
difference
because
socrates
in
this
way
gave
rise
to
moral
philosophy
all
succeeding
babblers
about
morality
and
popular
philosophy
constituted
him
their
patron
and
object
of
adoration
and
made
him
into
a
cloak
which
should
cover
all
false
philosophy
as
he
treated
it
it
was
undoubtedly
popular
and
what
contributed
to
make
it
such
was
that
his
death
gave
him
the
neverfailing
interest
derived
from
innocent
suffering
cicero

whose
manner
of
thought
was
on
the
one
hand
of
the
present
and
who
on
the
other
hand
had
the
belief
that
philosophy
should
yield
itself
up
and
hence
succeeded
in
attaining
to
no
content
in
it
boasted
of
socrates
what
has
often
enough
been
said
since
that
his
most
eminent
characteristic
was
to
have
brought
philosophy
from
heaven
to
earth
to
the
homes
and
everyday
life
of
men
or
as
diogenes
laertius
expresses
it
ii
21
into
the
market
place
there
we
have
what
has
just
been
said
this
would
seem
as
if
the
best
and
truest
philosophy
were
only
a
domestic
or
fireside
philosophy
which
conforms
to
all
the
ordinary
ideas
of
men
and
in
which
we
see
friends
and
faithful
ones
talk
together
of
righteousness
and
of
what
can
be
known
on
the
earth
without
having
penetrated
the
depths
of
the
heavens
or
rather
the
depths
of
consciousness
but
this
last
is
exactly
what
socrates
as
these
men
themselves
indicate
first
ventured
to
do
and
it
was
not
incumbent
on
him
to
reflect
upon
all
the
speculations
of
past
philosophy
in
order
to
be
able
to
come
down
in
practical
philosophy
to
inward
thought
this
gives
a
general
idea
of
his
principle
we
must
examine
more
closely
this
noteworthy
phenomenon
and
begin
with
the
history
of
socrates
life
this
is
however
closely
intertwined
with
his
interest
in
philosophy
and
the
events
of
his
life
are
bound
up
with
his
principles
we
have
first
of
all
to
consider
the
beginning
of
his
life
only
socrates
whose
birth
occurs
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
77th
olympiad
469
bc
was
the
son
of
sophroniscus
a
sculptor
and
of
phnarete
a
midwife
his
father
brought
him
up
to
sculpture
and
it
is
said
that
socrates
acquired
skill
in
the
art
and
long
after
statues
of
draped
graces
found
in
the
acropolis
were
ascribed
to
him
but
his
art
did
not
satisfy
him
a
great
desire
for
philosophy
and
love
of
scientific
research
got
possession
of
him
he
pursued
his
art
merely
to
get
money
for
a
necessary
subsistence
and
to
be
able
to
apply
himself
to
the
study
of
the
sciences
and
it
is
told
of
crito
an
athenian
that
he
defrayed
the
cost
of
socrates
instruction
by
masters
in
all
the
arts
during
the
exercise
of
his
art
and
specially
after
he
gave
it
up
altogether
he
read
the
works
of
ancient
philosophers
in
so
far
as
he
could
get
possession
of
them
at
the
same
time
he
attended
anaxagoras
instructions
and
after
his
expulsion
from
athens
at
which
time
socrates
was
thirtyseven
years
old
those
of
archelaus
who
was
regarded
as
anaxagoras
successor
besides
those
of
sophists
celebrated
in
other
sciences
amongst
these
he
heard
prodicus
a
celebrated
teacher
of
oratory
whom
according
to
xenophon
memorab
ii
c
1

21
34
he
mentions
with
affection
and
other
teachers
of
music
poetry
etc
he
was
esteemed
as
on
all
sides
a
man
of
culture
who
was
instructed
in
everything
then
requisite
thereto118
another
feature
in
his
life
was
that
he
fulfilled
the
duty
of
protecting
his
country
which
rested
on
him
as
an
athenian
citizen
hence
he
made
three
campaigns
in
the
peloponnesian
war
which
occurred
during
his
life
the
peloponnesian
war
led
to
the
dissolution
of
greek
life
inasmuch
as
it
was
preparatory
to
it
and
what
took
place
politically
was
by
socrates
carried
out
in
thinking
consciousness
in
these
campaigns
he
not
only
acquired
the
fame
of
a
brave
warrior
but
what
was
best
of
all
the
merit
of
having
saved
the
lives
of
other
citizens
in
the
first
he
was
present
at
the
tedious
siege
of
potida
in
thrace
here
alcibiades
had
already
attached
himself
to
him
and
according
to
plato
he
recited
in
the
banquet
p
219222
steph
p
461466
bekk
a
eulogy
on
socrates
for
being
able
to
endure
all
toil
hunger
and
thirst
heat
and
cold
with
mind
at
rest
and
health
of
body
in
an
engagement
in
this
campaign
he
saw
alcibiades
wounded
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
lifted
him
up
forced
his
way
through
and
saved
both
him
and
his
arms
the
generals
rewarded
him
with
a
wreath
which
was
the
prize
of
the
bravest
socrates
did
not
however
take
it
maintaining
that
it
was
given
to
alcibiades
in
this
campaign
it
is
said
that
once
sunk
in
deep
meditation
he
stood
immovable
on
one
spot
the
whole
day
and
night
until
the
morning
sun
awoke
him
from
his
trancea
condition
in
which
he
is
said
often
to
have
been
this
was
a
cataleptic
state
which
may
bear
some
relation
to
magnetic
somnambulism
in
which
socrates
became
quite
dead
to
sensuous
consciousness
from
this
physical
setting
free
of
the
inward
abstract
self
from
the
concrete
bodily
existence
of
the
individual
we
have
in
the
outward
manifestation
a
proof
of
how
the
depths
of
his
mind
worked
within
him
in
him
we
see
preeminently
the
inwardness
of
consciousness
that
in
an
anthropological
way
existed
in
the
first
instance
in
him
and
became
later
on
a
usual
thing
he
made
his
other
campaign
in
botia
at
delium
a
small
fortification
which
the
athenians
possessed
not
far
from
the
sea
and
where
they
had
an
unfortunate
though
not
an
important
engagement
here
socrates
saved
another
of
his
favourites
xenophon
he
saw
him
in
the
flight
for
xenophon
having
lost
his
horse
lay
wounded
on
the
ground
socrates
took
him
over
his
shoulders
carried
him
off
defending
himself
at
the
same
time
with
the
greatest
tranquillity
and
presence
of
mind
from
the
pursuing
enemy
finally
he
made
his
last
campaign
at
amphipolis
in
edonis
on
the
strymonian

besides
this
he
occupied
various
civil
offices
at
the
time
when
the
democratic
constitution
of
athens
hitherto
existing
was
taken
away
by
the
lacedemonians

now
introduced
everywhere
an
aristocratic
and
indeed
tyrannical
rule

they
in

put
themselves
at

he
was
chosen
for
the
council
which
as
a
representative
body
took
the
place
of
the

here
he
distinguished
himself
by
his
immovable
firmness
in
what
he
held
to
be
right
as
against
the
wills
of
the
thirty
tyrants
as
formerly
against
the
will
of
the
people
for
he
sat
in
the
tribunal
which
condemned
the
ten
generals
to
death
because
as
admirals
at
the
battle
of
arginus
though
they
certainly
had
conquered
yet
being
kept
back
through
storm
they
had
not
dragged
out
the
bodies
nor
buried
them
on
the
shore
and
because
they
neglected
to
erect
trophies
ie
really
because
they
did
not
stand
their
ground
and
thus
appeared
to
have
been
beaten
socrates
alone
did
not
agree
with
this
decision
declaring
himself
more
emphatically
against
the

than
against
the

today
he
fares

who
says
anything
against

the

have
excellent
intelligence
understand
everything
and
have
only
the
most
excellent
intentions
as
to
rulers

ministers
it
is
selfevident
that
they
understand
nothing
and
only
desire
and
bring
forth
what
is
bad
along
with
these
to
him
more
accidental
relationships
to
the
state
in
which
he
acted
only
from
the
ordinary
sense
of
citizenship
without
spontaneously
making
the
affairs
of
the
state
his
real
business
or
pressing
on
to
the
head
of
public
affairs
the
real
business
of
his
life
was
to
discuss
moral
philosophy
with
any
who
came
in
his
way
his
philosophy
which
asserts
that
real
existence
is
in
consciousness
as
a
universal
is
still
not
a
properly
speculative
philosophy
but
remained
individual
yet
the
aim
of
his
philosophy
was
that
it
should
have
a
universal
significance
hence
we
have
to
speak
of
his
own
individual
being
of
his
thoroughly
noble
character
which
usually
is
depicted
as
a
complete
catalogue
of
the
virtues
adorning
the
life
of
a
private
citizen
and
these
virtues
of
socrates
are
certainly
to
be
looked
at
as
his
own
and
as
made
habitual
to
him
by
his
own
will
it
has
to
be
noted
that
with
the
ancients
these
qualities
have
generally
more
of
the
character
of
virtue
because
with
the
ancients
in
ordinary
morality
individuality
as
the
form
of
the
universal
was
given
free
scope
so
that
virtues
were
regarded
more
as
the
actions
of
the
individual
will
and
thus
as
personal
qualities
while
with
us
they
seem
to
be
less
what
is
meritorious
to
the
individual
or
what
comes
from
himself
as
this
unit
we
are
accustomed
to
think
of
them
much
more
as
what
exists
as
duty
because
we
have
a
fuller
consciousness
of
the
universal
and
consider
the
pure
individual
the
personal
inward
consciousness
as
real
existence
and
duty
with
us
virtues
are
hence
actually
either
elements
in
our
dispositions
and
nature
or
they
have
the
form
of
the
universal
and
of
what
is
necessary
but
with
socrates
they
have
the
form
not
of
ordinary
morality
or
of
a
natural
or
necessary
thing
but
of
an
independent
determination
it
is
well
known
that
his
appearance
indicated
naturally
low
and
hateful
qualities
which
as
indeed
he
says
he
himself
subdued
he
lived
amongst
his
fellowcitizens
and
stands
before
us
as
one
of
those
great
plastic
natures
consistent
through
and
through
such
as
we
often
see
in
those
timesresembling
a
perfect
classical
work
of
art
which
has
brought
itself
to
this
height
of
perfection
such
individuals
are
not
made
but
have
formed
themselves
into
what
they
are
they
have
become
that
which
they
wished
to
be
and
are
true
to
this
in
a
real
work
of
art
the
distinguishing
point
is
that
some
idea
is
brought
forth
a
character
is
presented
in
which
every
trait
is
determined
by
the
idea
and
because
this
is
so
the
work
of
art
is
on
the
one
hand
living
and
on
the
other
beautiful
for
the
highest
beauty
is
just
the
most
perfect
carrying
out
of
all
sides
of
the
individuality
in
accordance
with
the
one
inward
principle
such
works
of
art
are
also
seen
in
the
great
men
of
every
time
the
most
plastic
individual
as
a
statesman

existence

owninto
a
character
which
regulated

whole

which
was

running
throughout

of

says
of
him
that
from
the
time
that
he
devoted
himself
to
the
business
of
the
state
he
laughed
no
more
and
never
again
went
to
a
feast
thus
too
socrates
formed
himself
through
his
art
and
through
the
power
of
selfconscious
will
into
this
particular
character
and
acquired
this
capacity
for
the
business
of
his
life
through
his
principle
he
attained
that
farreaching
influence
which
has
lasted
to
the
present
day
in
relation
to
religion
science
and
justice
for
since
his
time
the
genius
of
inward
conviction
has
been
the
basis
which
must
be
fundamental
and
since
this
principle
proceeded
from
the
plasticity
of
his
character
it

very
inappropriate

that
though
we
know
what
he
was
we
do
not
know
how
he
became

socrates

a
peaceful
pious
example
of
the
moral
virtuesof
wisdom
discretion
temperance
moderation
justice
courage

firm
sense
of
rectitude
in
relation
to
tyrants
and
people
he
was
equally
removed
from
cupidity
and
despotism
his
indifference
to
money
was
due
to
his
own
determination
for
according
to
the
custom
of
the
times
he
could
acquire
it
through
the
education
of
youth
like
other
teachers
on
the
other
side
this
acquisition
was
purely
matter
of
choice
and
not
as
with
us
something
which
is
accepted
so
that
to
take
nothing
would
be
to
break
through
a
custom
thus
to
present
the
appearance
of
wishing
to
become
conspicuous
and
to
be
more
blamed
than
praised
for
this
was
not
yet
a
state
affair
it
was
under
the
roman
emperors
that
there
first
were
schools
with
payment
this
moderation
of
his
life
was
likewise
a
power
proceeding
from
conscious
knowledge
but
this
is
not
a
principle
found
to
hand
but
the
regulation
of
self
in
accordance
with
circumstances
in
company
he
was
however
a
good
fellow
his
sobriety
in
respect
to
wine
is
best
depicted
in
platos
symposium
in
a
very
characteristic
scene
in
which
we
see
what
socrates
called
virtue
alcibiades
there
appears
no
longer
sober
at
a
feast
given
by
agathon
on
the
occasion
of
a
success
which
his
tragedy
had
obtained
on
the
previous
day
at
the
games
since
the
company
had
drunk
much
on
the
first
day
of
the
feast
the
assembled
guests
amongst
whom
was
socrates
this
evening
took
a
resolution
in
opposition
to
the
greek
custom
at
meals
to
drink
little
alcibiades
finding
that
he
was
coming
in
amongst
abstemious
men
and
that
there
was
no
one
else
in
his
own
frame
of
mind
made
himself
king
of
the
feast
and
offered
the
goblet
to
the
others
in
order
to
bring
them
into
the
condition
reached
by
himself
but
with
socrates
he
said
that
he
could
do
nothing
because
he
remained
as
he
was
however
much
he
drank
plato
then
makes
the
individual
who
tells
what
happened
at
the
banquet
also
tell
that
he
with
the
others
at
last
fell
asleep
on
the
couch
and
as
he
awoke
in
the
morning
socrates
cup
in
hand
still
talked
with
aristophanes
and
agathon
about
comedy
and
tragedy
and
whether
one
man
could
write
both
comedies
and
tragedies
and
then
went
at
the
usual
time
into
the
public
places
to
the
lyceum
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
walked
about
the
whole
day
as
usual121
this
is
not
a
moderation
which
exists
in
the
least
possible
enjoyment
no
aimless
abstemiousness
and
selfmortification
but
a
power
belonging
to
consciousness
which
keeps
its
selfpossession
in
bodily
excess
we
see
from
this
that
we
have
not
to
think
of
socrates
throughout
after
the
fashion
of
the
litany
of
moral
virtues
his
behaviour
to
others
was
not
only
just
true
open
without
rudeness
and
honourable
but
we
also
see
in
him
an
example
of
the
most
perfect
attic
urbanity
ie
he
moves
in
the
freest
possible
relations
has
a
readiness
for
conversation
which
is
always
judicious
and
because
it
has
an
inward
universality
at
the
same
time
always
has
the
right
living
relationship
to
the
individual
and
bears
upon
the
case
on
which
it
operates
the
intercourse
is
that
of
a
most
highly
cultured
man
who
in
his
relation
to
others
never
places
anything
personal
in
all
his
wit
and
sets
aside
all
that
is
unpleasant
thus
xenophons
but
particularly
platos
socratic
dialogues
belong
to
the
highest
type
of
this
fine
social
culture
because
the
philosophy
of
socrates
is
no
withdrawal
from
existence
now
and
here
into
the
free
pure
regions
of
thought
but
is
in
a
piece
with
his
life
it
does
not
proceed
to
a
system
and
the
manner
of
his
philosophizing
which
appears
to
imply
a
withdrawal
from
actual
affairs
as
it
did
to
plato
yet
in
that
very
way
gives
itself
this
inward
connection
with
ordinary
life
for
his
more
special
business
was
his
philosophic
teaching
or
rather
his
philosophic
social
intercourse
for
it
was
not
properly
speaking
teaching
with
all
and
this
outwardly
resembled
ordinary
athenian
life
in
which
the
greater
part
of
the
day
was
passed
without
any
particular
business
in
loitering
about
the
marketplace
or
frequenting
the
public
lyceum
and
there
partly
partaking
of
bodily
exercises
and
partly
and
principally
talking
with
one
another
this
kind
of
intercourse
was
only
possible
in
the
athenian
mode
of
life
where
most
of
the
work
which
is
now
done
by
a
free
citizenby
a
free
republican
and
free
imperial
citizen
alikewas
performed
by
slaves
seeing
that
it
was
deemed
unworthy
of
free
men
a
free
citizen
could
in
athens
certainly
be
a
handicraftsman
but
he
had
slaves
who
did
the
work
just
as
a
master
now
has
workmen
at
the
present
day
such
a
life
of
movement
would
not
be
suitable
to
our
customs
now
socrates
also
lounged
about
after
this
manner
and
lived
in
this
constant
discussion
of
ethical
questions122
thus
what
he
did
was
what
came
naturally
to
him
and
what
can
in
general
be
called
moralizing
but
its
nature
and
method
was
not
that
of
preaching
exhortation
or
teaching
it
was
not
a
dry
morality
for
amongst
the
athenians
and
in
attic
urbanity
this
had
no
place
since
it
is
not
a
reciprocal
free
and
rational
relationship
but
with
all
men
however
different
their
characters
he
entered
on
one
kind
of
dialogue
with
all
that
attic
urbanity
which
without
presumption
on
his
part
without
instructing
others
or
wishing
to
command
them
while
maintaining
their
perfect
right
to
freedom
and
honouring
it
yet
causes
all
that
is
rude
to
be
suppressed
1
the
socratic
method
in
this
conversation
socrates
philosophy
is
found
as
also
what
is
known
as
the
socratic
method
which
must
in
its
nature
be
dialectic
and
of
which
we
must
speak
before
dealing
with
the
content
socrates
manner
is
not
artificial
the
dialogues
of
the
moderns
on
the
contrary
just
because
no
internal
reason
justifies
their
form
are
necessarily
tedious
and
heavy
but
the
principle
of
his
philosophy
falls
in
with
the
method
itself
which
thus
far
cannot
be
called
method
since
it
is
a
mode
which
quite
coincides
with
the
moralizing
peculiar
to
socrates
for
the
chief
content
is
to
know
the
good
as
the
absolute
and
that
particularly
in
relation
to
actions
socrates
gives
this
point
of
view
so
high
a
place
that
he
both
puts
aside
the
sciences
which
involve
the
contemplation
of
the
universal
in
nature
mind
c
himself
and
calls
upon
others
to
do
the
same123
thus
it
can
be
said
that
in
content
his
philosophy
had
an
altogether
practical
aspect
and
similarly
the
socratic
method
which
is
essential
to
it
was
distinguished
by
the
system
of
first
bringing
a
person
to
reflection
upon
his
duty
by
any
occasion
that
might
either
happen
to
be
offered
spontaneously
or
that
was
brought
about
by
socrates
by
going
to
the
workplaces
of
tailors
and
shoemakers
and
entering
into
discourse
with
them
as
also
with
youths
and
old
men
sophists
statesmen
and
citizens
of
all
kinds
he
in
the
first
place
took
their
interests
as
his
topicwhether
these
were
household
interests
the
education
of
children
or
the
interests
of
knowledge
or
of
truth
then
he
led
them
on
from
a
definite
case
to
think
of
the
universal
and
of
truths
and
beauties
which
had
absolute
value
since
in
every
case
from
the
individuals
own
thoughts
he
derived
the
conviction
and
consciousness
of
that
which
is
the
definite
right
this
method
has
two
prominent
aspects
the
one
the
development
of
the
universal
from
the
concrete
case
and
the
exhibition
of
the
notion
which
implicitly
exists
in
every
consciousness124
and
the
other
is
the
resolution
of
the
firmly
established
and
when
taken
immediately
in
consciousness
universal
determinations
of
the
sensuous
conception
or
of
thought
and
the
causing
of
confusion
between
these
and
what
is
concrete
a
if
we
proceed
from
the
general
account
of
socrates
method
to
a
nearer
view
in
the
first
place
its
effect
is
to
inspire
men
with
distrust
towards
their
presuppositions
after
faith
had
become
wavering
and
they
were
driven
to
seek
that
which
is
in
themselves
now
whether
it
was
that
he
wished
to
bring
the
manner
of
the
sophists
into
disrepute
or
that
he
was
desirous
to
awaken
the
desire
for
knowledge
and
independent
thought
in
the
youths
whom
he
attracted
to
himself
he
certainly
began
by
adopting
the
ordinary
conceptions
which
they
considered
to
be
true
but
in
order
to
bring
others
to
express
these
he
represents
himself
as
in
ignorance
of
them
and
with
a
seeming
ingenuousness
puts
questions
to
his
audience
as
if
they
were
to
instruct
him
while
he
really
wished
to
draw
them
out
this
is
the
celebrated
socratic
irony
which
in
his
case
is
a
particular
mode
of
carrying
on
intercourse
between
one
person
and
another
and
is
thus
only
a
subjective
form
of
dialectic
for
real
dialectic
deals
with
the
reasons
for
things
what
he
wished
to
effect
was
that
when
other
people
brought
forward
their
principles
he
from
each
definite
proposition
should
deduce
as
its
consequence
the
direct
opposite
of
what
the
proposition
stated
or
else
allow
the
opposite
to
be
deduced
from
their
own
inner
consciousness
without
maintaining
it
directly
against
their
statements
sometimes
he
also
derived
the
opposite
from
a
concrete
case
but
as
this
opposite
was
a
principle
held
by
men
as
firmly
as
the
other
he
then
went
on
to
show
that
they
contradicted
themselves
thus
socrates
taught
those
with
whom
he
associated
to
know
that
they
knew
nothing
indeed
what
is
more
he
himself
said
that
he
knew
nothing
and
therefore
taught
nothing
it
may
actually
be
said
that
socrates
knew
nothing
for
he
did
not
reach
the
systematic
construction
of
a
philosophy
he
was
conscious
of
this
and
it
was
also
not
at
all
his
aim
to
establish
a
science
on
the
one
view
this
irony
seems
to
be
something
untrue
but
when
we
deal
with
objects
which
have
a
universal
interest
and
speak
about
them
to
one
and
to
another
it
is
always
the
case
that
one
does
not
understand
anothers
conception
of
the
object
for
every
individual
has
certain
ultimate
words
as
to
which
he
presupposes
a
common
knowledge
but
if
we
really
are
to
come
to
an
understanding
we
find
it
is
these
presuppositions
which
have
to
be
investigated
for
instance
if
in
more
recent
times
belief
and
reason
are
discussed
as
the
subjects
of
present
intellectual
interest
everyone
pretends
that
he
knows
quite
well
what
reason
c
is
and
it
is
considered
illbred
to
ask
for
an
explanation
of
this
seeing
that
all
are
supposed
to
know
about
it
a
very
celebrated
divine
ten
years
ago125
published
ninety
theses
on
reason
which
contained
very
interesting
questions
but
resulted
in
nothing
although
they
were
much
discussed
because
one
persons
assertions
issued
from
the
point
of
view
of
faith
and
the
others
from
that
of
reason
and
each
remained
in
this
state
of
opposition
without
the
ones
knowing
what
the
other
meant
thus
what
would
make
an
understanding
possible
is
just
the
explanation
of
what
we
think
is
understood
without
really
being
so
if
faith
and
knowledge
certainly
differ
from
one
another
at
the
first
yet
through
this
declaration
of
their
notional
determinations
the
common
element
will
at
once
appear
in
that
way
questions
like
these
and
the
trouble
taken
with
them
may
for
the
first
time
become
fruitful
otherwise
men
may
chatter
this
way
and
that
for
years
without
making
any
advance
for
if
i
say
i
know
what
reason
what
belief
is
these
are
only
quite
abstract
ideas
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
become
concrete
that
they
should
be
explained
and
that
it
should
be
understood
that
what
they
really
are
is
unknown
the
irony
of
socrates
has
this
great
quality
of
showing
how
to
make
abstract
ideas
concrete
and
effect
their
development
for
on
that
alone
depends
the
bringing
of
the
notion
into
consciousness
in
recent
times
much
has
been
said
about
the
socratic
irony
which
like
all
dialectic
gives
force
to
what
is
taken
immediately
but
only
in
order
to
allow
the
dissolution
inherent
in
it
to
come
to
pass
and
we
may
call
this
the
universal
irony
of
the
world
yet
men
have
tried
to
make
this
irony
of
socrates
into
something
quite
different
for
they
extended
it
into
a
universal
principle
it
is
said
to
be
the
highest
attitude
of
the
mind
and
has
been
represented
as
the
most
divine
it
was
friedrich
von
schlegel
who
first
brought
forward
this
idea
and
ast
repeated
it
saying
the
most
ardent
love
of
all
beauty
in
the
idea
as
in
life
inspires
socrates
words
with
inward
unfathomable
life
this
life
is
now
said
to
be
irony
but
this
irony
issues
from
the
fichtian
philosophy
and
is
an
essential
point
in
the
comprehension
of
the
conceptions
of
most
recent
times
it
is
when
subjective
consciousness
maintains
its
independence
of
everything
that
it
says
it
is
i
who
through
my
educated
thoughts
can
annul
all
determinations
of
right
morality
good
c
because
i
am
clearly
master
of
them
and
i
know
that
if
anything
seems
good
to
me
i
can
easily
subvert
it
because
things
are
only
true
to
me
in
so
far
as
they
please
me
now
this
irony
is
thus
only
a
trifling
with
everything
and
it
can
transform
all
things
into
show
to
this
subjectivity
nothing
is
any
longer
serious
for
any
seriousness
which
it
has
immediately
becomes
dissipated
again
in
jokes
and
all
noble
or
divine
truth
vanishes
away
or
becomes
mere
triviality
but
the
greek
gaiety
as
it
breathes
in
homers
poems
is
ironical
for
eros
mocks
the
power
of
zeus
and
of
mars
vulcan
limping
along
serves
the
gods
with
wine
and
brings
upon
himself
the
uncontrollable
laughter
of
the
immortal
gods
juno
boxes
dianas
ears
thus
too
there
is
irony
in
the
sacrifices
of
the
ancients
who
themselves
consumed
the
best
in
the
pain
that
laughs
in
the
keenest
joy
which
is
moved
to
tears
in
the
scornful
laughter
of
mephistopheles
and
in
every
transition
from
one
extreme
to
anotherfrom
what
is
best
to
what
is
worst
sunday
morning
may
be
passed
in
deep
humility
profoundest
contrition
and
selfabasement
in
striking
the
breast
in
penitence
and
the
evening
in
eating
and
drinking
to
the
full
going
the
round
of
pleasures
thus
allowing
self
to
reassert
its
independence
of
any
such
subjection
hypocrisy
which
is
of
the
same
nature
is
the
truest
irony
socrates
and
plato
were
falsely
stated
to
be
the
originators
of
this
irony
of
which
it
is
said
that
it
is
the
inmost
and
deepest
life
although
they
possessed
the
element
of
subjectivity
in
our
time
it
was
not
permitted
to
us
to
give
effect
to
this
irony
asts
inmost
deepest
life
is
just
the
subjective
and
arbitrary
will
the
inward
divinity
which
knows
itself
to
be
exalted
above
all
the
divine
is
said
to
be
the
purely
negative
attitude
the
perception
of
the
vanity
of
everything
in
which
my
vanity
alone
remains
making
the
consciousness
of
the
nullity
of
everything
ultimate
might
indeed
indicate
depth
of
life
but
it
only
is
the
depth
of
emptiness
as
may
be
seen
from
the
ancient
comedies
of
aristophanes
from
this
irony
of
our
times
the
irony
of
socrates
is
far
removed
as
is
also
the
case
with
plato
it
has
a
significance
which
is
limited
socrates
premeditated
irony
may
be
called
a
manner
of
speech
a
pleasant
rallying
there
is
in
it
no
satirical
laughter
or
pretence
as
though
the
idea
were
nothing
but
a
joke
but
his
tragic
irony
is
his
opposition
of
subjective
reflection
to
morality
as
it
exists
not
a
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
he
stands
above
it
but
the
natural
aim
of
leading
men
through
thought
to
the
true
good
and
to
the
universal
idea
b
now
the
second
element
is
what
socrates
has
called
the
art
of
midwiferyan
art
which
came
to
him
from
his
mother126
it
is
the
assisting
into
the
world
of
the
thought
which
is
already
contained
in
the
consciousness
of
the
individualthe
showing
from
the
concrete
unreflected
consciousness
the
universality
of
the
concrete
or
from
the
universally
posited
the
opposite
which
already
is
within
it
socrates
hence
adopts
a
questioning
attitude
and
this
kind
of
questioning
and
answering
has
thus
been
called
the
socratic
method
but
in
this
method
there
is
more
than
can
be
given
in
questions
and
replies
for
the
answer
seems
occasionally
to
be
quite
different
from
what
was
intended
by
the
question
while
in
printed
dialogue
answers
are
altogether
under
the
authors
control
but
to
say
that
in
actual
life
people
are
found
to
answer
as
they
are
here
made
to
do
is
quite
another
thing
to
socrates
those
who
reply
may
be
called
pliable
youths
because
they
reply
directly
to
the
questions
which
are
so
formed
that
they
make
the
answer
very
easy
and
exclude
any
originality
in
reply
to
this
plastic
manner
which
we
see
in
the
method
of
socrates
as
represented
by
plato
and
xenophon
it
is
objected
that
we
do
not
answer
in
the
same
relation
in
which
the
questioner
asks
while
with
socrates
the
relation
which
the
questioner
adopts
is
respected
in
the
reply
the
other
way
which
is
to
bring
forward
another
point
of
view
is
undoubtedly
the
spirit
of
an
animated
conversation
but
such
emulation
is
excluded
from
this
socratic
method
in
which
the
principal
matter
is
to
keep
to
the
point
the
spirit
of
dogmatism
selfassertion
stopping
short
when
we
seem
to
get
into
difficulties
and
escaping
from
them
by
a
jest
or
by
setting
them
asideall
these
attitudes
and
methods
are
here
excluded
they
do
not
constitute
good
manners
nor
do
they
have
a
place
in
socrates
dialogues
in
these
dialogues
it
is
hence
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
those
questioned
answered
so
precisely
to
the
point
while
in
the
best
modern
dialogues
there
is
always
an
arbitrary
element
this
difference
concerns
only
what
is
external
and
formal
but
the
principal
point
and
the
reason
why
socrates
set
to
work
with
questions
in
bringing
the
good
and
right
into
consciousness
in
universal
form
was
that
he
did
not
proceed
from
what
is
present
in
our
consciousness
in
a
simple
form
through
setting
forth
the
conception
allied
to
it
in
pure
necessity
which
would
be
a
deduction
a
proof
or
speaking
generally
a
consequence
following
from
the
conception
but
this
concrete
as
it
is
in
natural
consciousness
without
thinking
of
it
or
universality
immersed
in
matter
he
analyzed
so
that
through
the
separation
of
the
concrete
he
brought
the
universal
contained
therein
to
consciousness
as
universal
we
see
this
method
also
carried
on
to
a
large
extent
in
platos
dialogues
where
there
is
in
this
regard
particular
skill
displayed
it
is
the
same
method
which
forms
in
every
man
his
knowledge
of
the
universal
an
education
in
selfconsciousness
which
is
the
development
of
reason
the
child
the
uncultured
man
lives
in
concrete
individual
ideas
but
to
the
man
who
grows
and
educates
himself
because
he
thereby
goes
back
into
himself
as
thinking
reflection
becomes
reflection
on
the
universal
and
the
permanent
establishment
of
the
same
and
a
freedomformerly
that
of
moving
in
concrete
ideasis
now
that
of
so
doing
in
abstractions
and
in
thoughts
we
see
such
a
development
of
universal
from
particular
where
a
number
of
examples
are
given
treated
in
a
very
tedious
way
for
us
who
are
trained
in
presenting
to
ourselves
what
is
abstract
who
are
taught
from
youth
up
in
universal
principles
the
socratic
method
of
socalled
deference
with
its
eloquence
has
often
something
tiresome
and
tedious
about
it
the
universal
of
the
concrete
case
is
already
present
to
us
as
universal
because
our
reflection
is
already
accustomed
to
the
universal
and
we
do
not
require
first
of
all
to
take
the
trouble
of
making
a
separation
and
thus
if
socrates
were
now
to
bring
what
is
abstract
before
consciousness
we
should
not
require
in
order
to
establish
it
as
universal
that
all
these
examples
should
be
adduced
so
that
through
repetition
the
subjective
certainty
of
abstraction
might
arise
c
the
next
result
of
this
method
of
procedure
may
be
that
consciousness
is
surprised
that
what
it
never
looked
for
should
be
found
in
consciousness
if
we
reflect
for
example
on
the
universally
known
idea
of
becoming
we
find
that
what
becomes
is
not
and
yet
it
is
it
is
the
identity
of
being
and
nonbeing
and
it
may
surprise
us
that
in
this
simple
conception
so
great
a
distinction
should
exist
the
result
attained
was
partly
the
altogether
formal
and
negative
one
of
bringing
home
to
those
who
conversed
with
socrates
the
conviction
that
however
well
acquainted
with
the
subject
they
had
thought
themselves
they
now
came
to
the
conclusion
that
what
we
knew
has
refuted
itself
socrates
thus
put
questions
in
the
intent
that
the
speaker
should
be
drawn
on
to
make
admissions
implying
a
point
of
view
opposed
to
that
from
which
he
started
that
these
contradictions
arise
because
they
bring
their
ideas
together
is
the
drift
of
the
greater
part
of
socrates
dialogues
their
main
tendency
consequently
was
to
show
the
bewilderment
and
confusion
which
exist
in
knowledge
by
this
means
he
tries
to
awaken
shame
and
the
perception
that
what
we
consider
as
true
is
not
the
truth
from
which
the
necessity
for
earnest
effort
after
knowledge
must
result
plato
amongst
others

socrates

to

meno
proceeds
to
make
various
distinctions
mans
virtue
is
to
be
skilful
in
managing
state
affairs
and
thereby

other
virtues
are
those
of
boys

young

of

men
c
socrates
interrupts
him
by
saying
that
it
is
not
that
about
which
he
inquires
but
virtue
in
general
which
comprehends
every
thing
in
itself
meno
says
it
is
to
govern
and
rule
over
others
socrates
brings
forward
the
fact
that
the
virtue
of
boys
and
slaves
does
not
consist
in
governing
meno
says
that
he
cannot
tell
what
is
common
in
all

socrates
replies
that
it
is
the
same
as
figure
which
is
what
is
common
in
roundness
squareness
c
there
a
digression
occurs
meno
says
virtue
is
the
power
of
securing
the
good
desired
socrates
interposes
that
it
is
superfluous
to
say
the
good
for
from
the
time
that
men
know
that
something
is
an
evil
they
do
not
desire
it
and
also
the
good
must
be
acquired
in
a
right
way
socrates
thus
confounds
meno
and
he
sees
that
these
ideas
are
false
the
latter
says
i
used
to
hear
of
you
before
i
knew
you
that
you
were
yourself
in
doubt

and
also
brought
others
into
doubt
and
now
you
cast
a
spell
on
me
too
so
that
i
am
at
my
wits
end

you
seem
if
i
may
venture
to
jest
to
be
like

torpedo

for
it
is
said
of
it
that
it
makes
torpid

those
who
come
near
it
and
touch
it
you
have
done
this
to
me
for
i
am
become
torpid
in
body
and
soul
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
you
although
i
have
talked
thousands
of
times
about
virtue
with
many
persons
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
talked
very
well
but
now
i
do
not
know
at
all
what
to
say
hence
you
do
well
not
to
travel
amongst
strangers
for
you
might
be
put
to
death
as
a
magician
socrates
again
wishes
to
inquire
now
meno
says
how
can
you
inquire
about
what
you
say
you
do
not
know
can
you
have
a
desire
for
what
you
do
not
know
and
if
you
find
it
out
by
chance
how
can
you
know
that
it
is
what
you
looked
for
since
you
acknowledge
that
you
do
not
know
it
a
number
of
dialogues
end
in
the
same
manner
both
in
xenophon
and
plato
leaving
us
quite
unsatisfied
as
to
the
result
it
is
so
in
the
lysis
where
plato
asks
the
question
of
what
love
and
friendship
secures
to
men
and
similarly
the
republic
commences
by
inquiring
what
justice
is
philosophy
must
generally
speaking
begin
with
a
puzzle
in
order
to
bring
about
reflection
everything
must
be
doubted
all
presuppositions
given
up
to
reach
the
truth
as
created
through
the
notion
2
the
principle
of
the
good
this
in
short
is
socrates
method
the
affirmative
what
socrates
develops
in
the
consciousness
is
nothing
but
the
good
in
as
far
as
it
is
brought
forth
from
consciousness
through
knowledgeit
is
the
eternal
in
and
for
itself
universal
what
is
called
the
idea
the
true
which
just
in
so
far
as
it
is
end
is
the
good
in
this
regard
socrates
is
opposed
to
the
sophists
for
the
proposition
that
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
to
them
still
comprehends
particular
ends
while
to
socrates
the
universal
brought
forth
through
free
thought
is
thereby
expressed
in
objective
fashion
nevertheless
we
must
not
blame
the
sophists
because
in
the
aimlessness
of
their
time
they
did
not
discover
the
principle
of
the
good
for
every
discovery
has
its
time
and
that
of
the
good
which
as
end
in
itself
is
now
always
made
the
starting
point
had
not
yet
been
made
by
socrates
it
now
seems
as
if
we
had
not
yet
shown
forth
much
of
the
socratic
philosophy
for
we
have
merely
kept
to
the
principle
but
the
main
point
with
socrates
is
that
his
knowledge
for
the
first
time
reached
this
abstraction
the
good
is
nevertheless
no
longer
as
abstract
as
the

of
anaxagoras
but
is
the
universal
which
determines
itself
in
itself
realizes
itself
and
has
to
be
realized
as
the
end
of
the
world
and
of
the
individual
it
is
a
principle
concrete
within
itself
which
however
is
not
yet
manifested
in
its
development
and
in
this
abstract
attitude
we
find
what
is
wanting
in
the
socratic
standpoint
of
which
nothing
that
is
affirmative
can
beyond
this
be
adduced
a
as
regards
the
socratic
principle
the
first
determination
is
the
great
determination
which
is
however
still
merely
formal
that
consciousness
creates
and
has
to
create
out
of
itself
what
is
the
true
this
principle
of
subjective
freedom
was
present
to
the
consciousness
of
socrates
himself
so
vividly
that
he
despised
the
other
sciences
as
being
empty
learning
and
useless
to
mankind
he
has
to
concern
himself
with
his
moral
nature
only
in
order
to
do
what
is
besta
onesidedness
which
is
very
characteristic
of
socrates
this
religion
of
the
good
is
to
socrates
not
only
the
essential
point
to
which
men
have
to
direct
their
thoughts
but
it
is
that
exclusively
we
see
him
showing
how
from
every
individual
this
universal
this
absolute
in
consciousness
may
be
found
as
his
reality
here
we
see
law
the
true
and
good
what
was
formerly
present
as
an
existent
return
into
consciousness
but
it
is
not
a
single
chance
manifestation
in
this
individual
socrates
for
we
have
to
comprehend
socrates
and
his
manifestation
in
the
universal
consciousness
in
the
spirit
of
the
people
to
which
he
belongs
we
see
natural
turn
into
reflective
morality
and
he
stands
above
as
the
consciousness
of
this
change
the
spirit
of
the
world
here
begins
to
change
a
change
which
was
later
on
carried
to
its
completion
from
this
higher
standpoint
socrates
as
well
as
the
athenian
people
and
socrates
in
them
have
to
be
considered
the
reflection
of
consciousness
into
itself
begins
here
the
knowledge
of
the
consciousness
of
self
as
such
that
it
is
real
existenceor
that
god
is
a
spirit
or
again
in
a
cruder
and
more
sensuous
form
that
god
takes
human
form
this
epoch
begins
where
essence
is
given
up
as
beingeven
though
it
be
as
hitherto
abstract
being
being
as
thought
but
this
epoch
in
a
naturally
moral
people
in
the
highest
state
of
development
makes
its
appearance
as
the
destruction
threatening
them
or
breaking
in
upon
them
unprevented
for
its
morality
as
was
usually
so
with
the
ancients
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
good
was
present
as
a
universal
without
its
having
had
the
form
of
the
conviction
of
the
individual
in
his
individual
consciousness
but
simply
that
of
the
immediate
absolute
it
is
the
authoritative
present
law
without
testing
investigation
but
yet
an
ultimate
ground
on
which
this
moral
consciousness
rests
it
is
the
law
of
the
state
it
has
authority
as
the
law
of
the
gods
and
thus
it
is
universal
destiny
which
has
the
form
of
an
existent
and
is
recognized
as
such
by
all
but
moral
consciousness
asks
if
this
is
actually
law
in
itself
this
consciousness
turned
back
within
itself
from
everything
that
has
the
form
of
the
existent
requires
to
understand
to
know
that
the
above
law
is
posited
in
truth
ie
it
demands
that
it
should
find
itself
therein
as
consciousness
in
thus
returning
into
themselves
the
athenian
people
are
revealed
to
us
uncertainty
as
to
existent
laws
as
existent
has
arisen
and
a
doubt
about
what
was
held
to
be
right
the
greatest
freedom
respecting
all
that
is
and
was
respected
this
return
into
itself
represents
the
highest
point
reached
by
the
mind
of
greece
in
so
far
as
it
becomes
no
longer
the
mere
existence
of
these
moralities
but
the
living
consciousness
of
the
same
which
has
a
content
which
is
similar
but
which
as
spirit
moves
freely
in
it
this
is
a
culture
which
we
never
find
the
lacedmonians
reach
this
deepest
life
of
morality
is
so
to
speak
a
free
personal
consciousness
of
morality
or
of
god
and
a
happy
enjoyment
of
them
consciousness
and
being
have
here
exactly
the
same
value
and
rank
what
is
is
consciousness
neither
is
powerful
above
another
the
authority
of
law
is
no
oppressive
bond
to
consciousness
and
all
reality
is
likewise
no
obstacle
to
it
for
it
is
secure
in
itself
but
this
return
is
just
on
the
point
of
abandoning
the
content
and
indeed
of
positing
itself
as
abstract
consciousness
without
the
content
and
as
existent
opposed
to
it
from
this
equilibrium
of
consciousness
and
being
consciousness
takes
up
its
position
as
independent
this
aspect
of
separation
is
an
independent
conception
because
consciousness
in
the
perception
of
its
independence
no
longer
immediately
acknowledges
what
is
put
before
it
but
requires
that
this
should
first
justify
itself
to
it
ie
it
must
comprehend
itself
therein
thus
this
return
is
the
isolation
of
the
individual
from
the
universal
care
for
self
at
the
cost
of
the
state
to
us
for
instance
it
is
the
question
as
to
whether
i
shall
be
in
eternal
bliss
or
condemnation
whereas
philosophic
eternity
is
present
now
in
time
and
is
nothing
other
than
the
substantial
man
himself
the
state
has
lost
its
power
which
consisted
in
the
unbroken
continuity
of
the
universal
spirit
as
formed
of
single
individuals
so
that
the
individual
consciousness
knew
no
other
content
and
reality
than
law
morals
have
become
shaken
because
we
have
the
idea
present
that
man
creates
his
maxims
for
himself
the
fact
that
the
individual
comes
to
care
for
his
own
morality
means
that
he
becomes
reflectively
moral
when
public
morality
disappears
reflective
morality
is
seen
to
have
arisen
we
now
see
socrates
bringing
forward
the
opinion
that
in
these
times
every
one
has
to
look
after
his
own
morality
and
thus
he
looked
after
his
through
consciousness
and
reflection
regarding
himself
for
he
sought
the
universal
spirit
which
had
disappeared
from
reality
in
his
own
consciousness
he
also
helped
others
to
care
for
their
morality
for
he
awakened
in
them
this
consciousness
of
having
in
their
thoughts
the
good
and
true
ie
having
the
potentiality
of
action
and
of
knowledge
this
is
no
longer
there
immediately
but
must
be
provided
just
as
a
ship
must
make
provision
of
water
when
it
goes
to
places
where
none
is
to
be
found
the
immediate
has
no
further
authority
but
must
justify
itself
to
thought
thus
we
comprehend
the
special
qualities
of
socrates
and
his
method
in
philosophy
from
the
whole
and
we
also
understand
his
fate
from
the
same
this
direction
of
consciousness
back
into
itself
takes
the
formvery
markedly
in
platoof
asserting
that
man
can
learn
nothing
virtue
included
and
that
not
because
the
latter
has
no
relation
to
science
for
the
good
does
not
come
from
without
socrates
shows
it
cannot
be
taught
but
is
implied
in
the
nature
of
mind
that
is
to
say
man
cannot
passively
receive
anything
that
is
given
from
without
like
the
wax
that
is
moulded
to
a
form
for
everything
is
latent
in
the
mind
of
man
and
he
only
seems
to
learn
it
certainly
everything
begins
from
without
but
this
is
only
the
beginning
the
truth
is
that
this
is
only
an
impulse
towards
the
development
of
spirit
all
that
has
value
to
men
the
eternal
the
selfexistent
is
contained
in
man
himself
and
has
to
develop
from
himself
to
learn
here
only
means
to
receive
knowledge
of
what
is
externally
determined
this
external
comes
indeed
through
experience
but
the
universal
therein
belongs
to
thought
not
to
the
subjective
and
bad
but
to
the
objective
and
true
the
universal
in
the
opposition
of
subjective
and
objective
is
that
which
is
as
subjective
as
it
is
objective
the
subjective
is
only
a
particular
the
objective
is
similarly
only
a
particular
as
regards
the
subjective
but
the
universal
is
the
unity
of
both
according
to
the
socratic
principle
nothing
has
any
value
to
men
to
which
the
spirit
does
not
testify
man
in
it
is
free
is
at
home
with
himself
and
that
is
the
subjectivity
of
spirit
as
it
is
said
in
the
bible
flesh
of
my
flesh
and
bone
of
my
bone
that
which
is
held
by
me
as
truth
and
right
is
spirit
of
my
spirit
but
what
spirit
derives
from
itself
must
come
from
it
as
from
the
spirit
which
acts
in
a
universal
manner
and
not
from
its
passions
likings
and
arbitrary
desires
these
too
certainly
come
from
something
inward
which
is
implanted
in
us
by
nature
but
which
is
only
in
a
natural
way
our
own
for
it
belongs
to
the
particular
high
above
it
is
true
thought
the
notion
the
rational
socrates
opposed
to
the
contingent
and
particular
inward
that
universal
true
inward
of
thought
and
socrates
awakened
this
real
conscience
for
he
not
only
said
that
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
but
man
as
thinking
is
the
measure
of
all
things
with
plato
we
shall
later
on
find
it
formulated
that
what
man
seems
to
receive
he
only
remembers
as
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
good
socrates
recognized
its
determination
as
being
not
only
a
determination
in
particularity
to
the
exclusion
of
the
natural
side
as
determination
is
understood
in
empirical
science
but
even
in
relation
to
the
actions
of
men
he
holds
the
good
to
be
still
undetermined
and
the
ultimate
determinateness
or
the
determining
is
what
we
may
call
subjectivity
generally
that
the
good
should
be
determined
primarily
signifies
that
while
at
first
in
opposition
to
the
being
of
reality
it
was
a
general
maxim
only
that
to
which
the
activity
of
individuality
was
still
wanting
in
the
second
place
it
was
not
permitted
to
be
inert
to
be
mere
thought
but
had
to
be
present
as
the
determining
and
actual
and
thus
as
the
effectual
it
is
such
only
through
subjectivity
through
the
activity
of
man
that
the
good
is
a
determinate
thus
further
means
that
individuals
know
what
the
good
is
and
we
call
this
standpoint
reflective
morality
while
natural
morality
does
right
unconsciously
thus
to
socrates
virtue
is
perception
for
to
the
proposition
of
the
platonic
protagoras
that
all
other
virtues
have
a
relationship
to
one
another
but
that
it
is
not
so
with
valour
since
many
brave
men
are
to
be
found
who
are
the
most
irreligious
unjust
intemperate
and
uncultured
of
people
such
as
a
band
of
robbers
plato
makes
socrates
answer
that
valour
like
all
virtues
also
is
a
science
that
is
it
is
the
knowledge
and
the
right
estimation
of
what
is
to
be
feared127
by
this
the
distinctive
qualities
of
valour
are
certainly
not
unfolded
the
naturally
moral
and
upright
man
is
such
without
his
having
considered
the
matter
at
all
it
is
his
character
and
what
is
good
is
securely
rooted
within
him
when
on
the
other
hand
consciousness
is
concerned
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
i
directly
desire
the
good
or
not
hence
this
consciousness
of
morality
easily
becomes
dangerous
and
causes
the
individual
to
be
puffed
up
by
a
good
opinion
of
himself
which
proceeds
from
the
consciousness
of
his
own
power
to
decide
for
the
good
the
i
is
then
the
master
he
who
chooses
the
good
and
in
that
there
is
the
conceit
of
my
knowing
that
i
am
an
excellent
man
with
socrates
this
opposition
of
the
good
and
the
subject
as
choosing
is
not
reached
for
what
is
dealt
with
is
only
the
determination
of
the
good
and
the
connection
therewith
of
subjectivity
this
last
as
an
individual
person
who
can
choose
decides
upon
the
inward
universal
we
have
here
on
the
one
side
the
knowledge
of
the
good
but
on
the
other
it
is
implied
that
the
subject
is
good
since
this
is
his
ordinary
character
and
the
fact
that
the
subject
is
such
was
by
the
ancients
called
virtue
we
understand
from
this
the
following
criticism
which
aristotle
makes
magna
mor
i
1
on
the
quality
of
virtue
as
expounded
by
socrates
he
says
socrates
spoke
better
of
virtue
than
did
pythagoras
but
not
quite
justly
for
he
made
virtues
into
a
science

but
this
is
impossible
since
though
all
knowledge
has
some
basis

this
basis
only
exists
in
thought
consequently
he
places
all
the
virtues
in
the
thinking

side
of
the
soul
hence
it
comes
to
pass
that
he
does
away
with
the
feeling

part
of
the
soul
that
is
the
inclination

and
the
habits

which
however
also
pertain
to
virtue
but
plato
rightly
distinguished
the
thinking
and
the
feeling
sides
of
the
soul
this
is
a
good
criticism
we
see
that
what
aristotle
misses
in
the
determination
of
virtue
in
socrates
is
the
side
of
subjective
actuality
which
we
now
call
the
heart
certainly
virtue
is
determination
in
accordance
with
universal
and
not
with
particular
ends
but
perception
is
not
the
only
element
in
virtue
for
in
order
that
the
good
perceived
should
be
virtue
it
must
come
to
pass
that
the
whole
man
the
heart
and
mind
should
be
identical
with
it
and
this
aspect
of
being
or
of
realization
generally
is
what
aristotle
calls


if
we
understand
the
reality
of
the
good
as
universal
morality
substantiality
is
wanting
to
the
perception
but
matter
when
we
regard
the
inclination
of
the
individual
subjective
will
as
this
reality
this
double
want
may
also
be
considered
as
a
want
of
content
and
of
activity
in
so
far
as
to
the
universal
development
is
wanting
and
in
the
latter
case
determining
activity
comes
before
us
as
negative
only
in
reference
to
the
universal
socrates
thus
omits
in
characterizing
virtue
just
what
we
saw
had
also
disappeared
in
actuality
that
is
first
the
real
spirit
of
a
people
and
then
reality
as
the
sympathies
of
the
individual
for
it
is
just
when
consciousness
is
not
yet
turned
back
into
itself
that
the
universal
good
appears
to
the
individual
as
the
object
of
his
sympathy
to
us
on
the
other
hand
because
we
are
accustomed
to
put
on
one
side
the
good
or
virtue
as
practical
reason
the
other
side
which
is
opposed
to
a
reflective
morality
is
an
equally
abstract
sensuousness
inclination
passion
and
hence
the
bad
but
in
order
that
the
universal
should
be
reality
it
must
be
worked
out
through
consciousness
as
individual
and
the
carrying
into
effect
pertains
to
this
individuality
a
passion
as
for
example
love
ambition
is
the
universal
itself
as
it
is
selfrealizing
not
in
perception
but
in
activity
and
if
we
did
not
fear
being
misunderstood
we
should
say
that
for
the
individual
the
universal
is
his
own
interests
yet
this
is
not
the
place
in
which
to
unravel
all
the
false
ideas
and
contradictions
present
in
our
culture

supplementing
the
onesidedness
of
socrates
further
says
of
him
socrates
in
one
respect
worked
on
right
lines
but
not
in
the
other
for
to
call
virtue
scientific
knowledge
is
untrue
but
to
say
that
it
is
not
without
scientific
basis
is
right
socrates
made
virtues
into
perceptions

but
we
say
that
virtue
exists
with
perception
this
is
a
very
true
distinction
the
one
side
in
virtue
is
that
the
universal
of
end
belongs
to
thought
but
in
virtue
as
character
the
other
side
active
individuality
real
soul
must
necessarily
come
forth
and
indeed
with
socrates
the
latter
appears
in
a
characteristic
form
of
which
we
shall
speak
below
p
421
et
seq
b
if
we
consider
the
universal
first
it
has
within
it
a
positive
and
a
negative
side
which
we
find
both
united
in
xenophons
memorabilia
a
work
which
aims
at
justifying
socrates
and
if
we
inquire
whether
he
or
plato
depicts
socrates
to
us
most
faithfully
in
his
personality
and
doctrine
there
is
no
question
that
in
regard
to
the
personality
and
method
the
externals
of
his
teaching
we
may
certainly
receive
from
plato
a
satisfactory
and
perhaps
a
more
complete
representation
of
what
socrates
was
but
in
regard
to
the
content
of
his
teaching
and
the
point
reached
by
him
in
the
development
of
thought
we
have
in
the
main
to
look
to
xenophon
the
fact
that
the
reality
of
morality
had
become
shaken
in
the
mind
of
the
people
came
to
consciousness
in
socrates
he
stands
so
high
because
he
gave
expression
to
what
was
present
in
the
times
in
this
consciousness
he
elevated
morality
into
perception
but
this
action
is
just
the
bringing
to
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
it
is
the
power
of
the
notion
which
sublates
the
determinate
existence
and
the
immediate
value
of
moral
laws
and
the
sacredness
of
their
implicitude
when
perception
likewise
positively
acknowledges
as
law
that
which
was
held
to
be
law
for
the
positive
subsists
through
having
recourse
to
laws
this
acknowledgment
of
them
always
passes
through
the
negative
mode
and
no
longer
has
the
form
of
absolute
beinginitself
it
is
however
just
as
far
from
being
a
platonic
republic
to
the
notion
too
because
to
it
the
determinateness
of
laws
in
the
form
in
which
they
have
value
to
unperceiving
consciousness
has
dissolved
only
the
purely
implicit
universal
good
is
the
true
but
since
this
is
empty
and
without
reality
we
demand
if
we
are
not
satisfied
with
a
dull
monotonous
round
that
again
a
movement
should
be
made
towards
the
extension
of
the
determination
of
the
universal
now
because
socrates
remains
at
the
indeterminateness
of
the
good
its
determination
means
for
him
simply
the
expression
of
the
particular
good
then
it
comes
to
pass
that
the
universal
results
only
from
the
negation
of
the
particular
good
and
since
this
last
is
just
the
existing
laws
of
greek
morality
we
have
here
the
doubtlessly
right
but
dangerous
element
in
perception
the
showing
in
all
that
is
particular
only
its
deficiencies
the
inconsistency
of
making
what
is
limited
into
an
absolute
certainly
becomes
unconsciously
corrected
in
the
moral
man
this
improvement
rests
partly
on
the
morality
of
the
subject
and
partly
on
the
whole
of
the
social
life
and
unfortunate
extremes
resulting
in
conflict
are
unusual
and
unfrequent
but
since
the
dialectic
sublates
the
particular
the
abstract
universal
also
becomes
shaken

now
as
regards
the
positive
side
xenophon
tells
us
in
the
fourth
book
of
the
memorabilia
c
2

40
how
socrates
once
having
made
the
need
for
perception
sensible
to
the
youths
then
actually
instructed
them
and
no
longer
wandered
through
mere
subtleties
in
his
talk
but
taught
them
the
good
in
the
clearest
and
most
open
way
that
is
he
showed
them
the
good
and
true
in
what
is
determined
going
back
into
it
because
he
did
not
wish
to
remain
in
mere
abstraction
xenophon
gives
an
example
of
this
memorab
iv
c
4

1216
25
in
a
dialogue
with
the
sophist
hippias
socrates
there
asserts
that
the
just
man
is
he
who
obeys
the
law
and
that
these
laws
are
divine
xenophon
makes
hippias
reply
by
asking
how
socrates
could
declare
it
to
be
an
absolute
duty
to
obey
the
laws
for
the
people
and
the
governors
themselves
often
condemn
them
by
changing
them
which
is
allowing
that
they
are
not
absolute
but
socrates
answers
by
demanding
if
those
who
conduct
war
do
not
again
make
peace
which
is
not
any
more
than
in
the
other
case
to
condemn
war
for
each
was
just
in
its
turn
socrates
thus
says
in
a
word
that
the
best
and
happiest
state
is
that
in
which
the
citizens
are
of
one
mind
and
obedient
to
law
now
this
is
the
one
side
in
which
socrates
looks
away
from
the
contradiction
and
makes
laws
and
justice
as
they
are
accepted
by
each
individually
to
be
the
affirmative
content
but
if
we
here
ask
what
these
laws
are
they
are
we
find
just
those
which
have
a
value
at
some
one
time
as
they
happen
to
be
present
in
the
state
and
in
the
idea
at
another
time
they
abrogate
themselves
as
determined
and
are
not
held
to
be
absolute

we
hence
see
this
other
negative
side
in
the
same
connection
when
socrates
brings
euthydemus
into
the
conversation
for
he
asks
him
whether
he
did
not
strive
after
the
virtue
without
which
neither
the
private
man
nor
the
citizen
could
be
useful
to
himself
or
to
his
people
or
the
state
euthydemus
declares
that
this
undoubtedly
is
so
but
without
justice
replies
socrates
this
is
not
possible
and
he
further
asks
whether
euthydemus
had
thus
attained
to
justice
in
himself
euthydemus
answers
affirmatively
for
he
says
that
he
thinks
he
is
no
less
just
than
any
other
man
socrates
now
replies
just
as
workmen
can
show
their
work
the
just
will
be
able
to
say
what
their
works
are
this
he
also
agrees
to
and
replies
that
he
could
easily
do
so
socrates
now
proposes
if
this
is
so
to
write
on
the
one
hand
under

the
actions
of
the
just
and
on
the
other
under

those
of
the
unjust
with
the
approbation
of
euthydemus
lies
deceit
robbery
making
a
slave
of
a
free
man
thus
fall
on
the
side
of
the
unjust
now
socrates
asks
but
if
a
general
subdues
the
enemys
state
would
this
not
be
justice
euthydemus
says
yes
socrates
replies
likewise
if
he
deceives
and
robs
the
enemy
and
makes
slaves
euthydemus
has
to
admit
the
justice
of
this
it
is
thus
shown
that
the
same
qualities
come
under
the
determination
both
of
justice
and
of
injustice
here
it
strikes
euthydemus
to
add
the
qualification
that
he
intended
that
socrates
should
understand
the
action
to
be
only
in
reference
to
friends
as
regards
them
it
is
wrong
socrates
accepts
this
but
proceeds
if
a
general
at
the
decisive
moment
of
the
battle
saw
his
own
army
in
fear
and
he
deceived
them
by
falsely
saying
that
help
was
coming
in
order
to
lead
them
on
to
victory
could
it
be
deemed
right
euthydemus
acknowledges
that
it
could
socrates
says
if
a
father
gives
a
sick
child
a
medicine
which
it
does
not
wish
to
take
in
its
food
and
makes
it
well
through
deceit
is
this
right
euthydemusyes
socratesor
is
anyone
wrong
who
takes
arms
from
his
friend
secretly
or
by
force
when
he
sees
him
in
despair
and
in
the
act
of
taking
his
own
life
euthydemus
has
to
admit
that
this
is
not
wrong128
thus
it
is
again
shown
here
that
as
regards
friends
also
the
same
determinations
have
to
hold
good
on
both
sides
as
justice
as
well
as
injustice
here
we
see
that
abstention
from
lying
deceit
and
robbery
that
which
we
naturally
hold
to
be
established
contradicts
itself
by
being
put
into
connection
with
something
different
and
something
which
holds
equally
good
this
example
further
explains
how
through
thought
which
would
lay
hold
of
the
universal
in
the
form
of
the
universal
only
the
particular
becomes
uncertain

the
positive
which
socrates
sets
in
the
place
of
what
was
fixed
and
has
now
become
vacillating
in
order
to
give
a
content
to
the
universal
is
on
the
one
hand
and
in
opposition
to
this
last
obedience
to
law
p
416
that
is
the
mode
of
thought
and
idea
which
is
inconsistent
and
on
the
other
hand
since
such
determinations
do
not
hold
good
for
the
notion
it
is
perception
in
which
the
immediately
posited
has
now
in
the
mediating
negation
to
justify
itself
as
a
determination
proceeding
out
of
the
constitution
of
the
whole
but
it
is
both
true
that
we
do
not
find
this
perception
present
in
socrates
for
it
remains
in
its
content
undetermined
and
that
in
reality
it
is
a
contingent
which
is
seen
in
the
fact
that
the
universal
commands
such
as
thou
shalt
not
kill
are
connected
with
a
particular
content
which
is
conditioned
now
whether
the
universal
maxim
in
this
particular
case
has
value
or
not
depends
first
on
the
circumstances
and
it
is
the
perception
which
discovers
the
conditions
and
circumstances
whereby
exceptions
to
this
law
of
unconditioned
validity
arise
however
because
through
this
contingency
in
the
instances
the
fixed
nature
of
the
universal
principle
disappears
since
it
too
appears
as
a
particular
only
the
consciousness
of
socrates
arrives
at
pure
freedom
in
each
particular
content
this
freedom
which
does
not
leave
the
content
as
it
is
in
its
dissipated
determination
to
the
natural
consciousness
but
makes
it
to
be
penetrated
by
the
universal
is
the
real
mind
which
as
unity
of
the
universal
content
and
of
freedom
is
the
veritable
truth
thus
if
we
here
consider
further
what
is
the
true
in
this
consciousness
we
pass
on
to
the
mode
in
which
the
realization
of
the
universal
appeared
to
socrates
himself
even
the
uneducated
mind
does
not
follow
the
content
of
its
consciousness
as
this
content
appears
in
it
but
as
mind
it
corrects
that
which
is
wrong
in
its
consciousness
and
is
thus
implicitly
if
not
explicitly
as
consciousness
free
that
is
though
this
consciousness
expresses
the
universal
law
thou
shalt
not
kill
as
a
duty
that
consciousnessif
no
cowardly
spirit
dwells
within
itwill
still
bravely
attack
and
slay
the
enemy
in
war
here
if
it
is
asked
whether
there
is
a
command
to
kill
ones
enemies
the
reply
would
be
affirmative
as
likewise
when
a
hangman
puts
to
death
a
criminal
but
when
in
private
life
we
become
involved
with
adversaries
this
command
to
kill
ones
enemies
will
not
occur
to
us
we
may
thus
call
this
the
mind
which
thinks
at
the
right
time
first
of
the
one
and
then
of
the
other
it
is
spirit
but
an
unspiritual
consciousness
the
first
step
towards
reaching
a
spiritual
consciousness
is
the
negative
one
of
acquiring
freedom
for
ones
consciousness
for
since
perception
attempts
to
prove
individual
laws
it
proceeds
from
a
determination
to
which
as
a
universal
basis
particular
duty
is
submitted
but
this
basis
is
itself
not
absolute
and
falls
under
the
same
dialectic
for
example
were
moderation
commanded
as
a
duty
on
the
ground
that
intemperance
undermined
the
health
health
is
the
ultimate
which
is
here
considered
as
absolute
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
not
absolute
for
there
are
other
duties
which
ordain
that
health
and
even
life
itself
should
be
risked
and
sacrificed
the
socalled
conflict
of
duties
is
nothing
but
duty
which
is
expressed
as
absolute
showing
itself
as
not
absolute
in
the
constant
contradiction
morals
become
unsettled
for
a
consciousness
which
has
become
consistent
law
because
it
has
then
been
brought
into
contact
with
its
opposite
has
been
sublated
for
the
positive
truth
has
not
yet
become
known
in
its
determination
but
to
know
the
universal
in
its
determination
ie
the
limitation
of
the
universal
which
comes
to
us
as
fixed
and
not
contingent
is
only
possible
in
connection
with
the
whole
system
of
actuality
thus
if
with
socrates
the
content
has
become
spiritualized
yet
manifold
independent
grounds
have
merely
taken
the
place
of
manifold
laws
for
the
perception
is
not
yet
expressed
as
the
real
perception
of
these
grounds
over
which
it
rules
but
the
truth
of
consciousness
simply
is
this
very
movement
of
pure
perception
the
true
ground
is
however
spirit
and
the
spirit
of
the
peoplea
perception
of
the
constitution
of
a
people
and
the
connection
of
the
individual
with
this
real
universal
spirit
laws
morals
the
actual
social
life
thus
have
in
themselves
their
own
corrective
against
the
inconsistent
which
consists
of
the
expression
of
a
definite
content
as
absolute
in
ordinary
life
we
merely
forget
this
limitation
of
universal
principles
and
these
still
hold
their
place
with
us
but
the
other
point
of
view
is
thus
when
the
limitation
comes
before
our
consciousness
when
we
have
the
perfect
consciousness
that
in
actual
life
fixed
duties
and
actions
do
not
exist
for
each
concrete
case
is
really
a
conflict
of
many
duties
which
separate
themselves
in
the
moral
understanding
but
which
mind
treats
as
not
absolute
comprehending
them
in
the
unity
of
its
judgment
we
call
this
pure
deciding
individuality
the
knowledge
of
what
is
right
or
conscience
just
as
we
call
the
pure
universal
of
consciousness
not
a
particular
but
an
allcomprehensive
one
duty
now
both
sides
here
present
the
universal
law
and
the
deciding
spirit
which
is
in
its
abstraction
the
active
individual
are
also
necessary
to
the
consciousness
of
socrates
as
the
content
and
the
power
over
this
content
that
is
because
with
socrates
the
particular
law
has
become
vacillating
there
now
comes
in
the
place
of
the
universal
single
mind
which
with
the
greeks
was
unconscious
determination
through
unreflective
morality
individual
mind
as
individuality
deciding
for
itself
thus
with
socrates
the
deciding
spirit
is
transformed
into
the
subjective
consciousness
of
man
since
the
power
of
deciding
originates
with
himself
and
the
first
question
now
is
how
this
subjectivity
appears
in
socrates
himself
because
the
person
the
individual
now
gives
the
decision
we
come
back
to
socrates
as
person
as
subject
and
what
follows
is
a
development
of
his
personal
relations
but
since
the
moral
element
is
generally
placed
in
the
personality
of
socrates
we
see
the
contingent
nature
of
the
instruction
and
of
the
culture
which
was
obtained
through
socrates
character
for
it
was
the
actual
basis
on
which
men
fortified
themselves
in
associating
with
socrates
by
actual
communication
with
him
and
by
their
manner
of
life
thus
it
was
true
that
the
intercourse
with
his
friends
was
on
the
whole
beneficial
and
instructive
to
them
but
in
many
cases
they
became
unfaithful
to
socrates129
because
not
everyone
attains
to
perception
and
he
who
possesses
it
may
remain
at
the
negative
the
education
of
the
citizens
life
in
the
people
is
quite
a
fresh
force
in
the
individual
and
does
not
mean
that
he
educates
himself
through
arguments
hence
however
truly
educative
the
intercourse
with
socrates
was
this
contingency
still
entered
into
it
we
thus
see
as
an
unhappy
symptom
of
disorder
how
socrates
greatest
favourites
and
those
endowed
with
the
most
genial
natures
such
as
alcibiades
that
genius
of
levity
who
played
with
the
athenian
people
and
critias
the
most
active
of
the
thirty
afterwards
experienced
the
fate
of
being
judged
in
their
own
country
one
as
an
enemy
and
traitor
to
his
fellows
and
the
other
as
an
oppressor
and
tyrant
of
the
state
they
lived
according
to
the
principle
of
subjective
perception
and
thus
cast
a
bad
light
on
socrates
for
it
is
shown
in
this
how
the
socratic
principle
in
another
form
brought
about
the
ruin
of
greek
life130
c
the
characteristic
form
in
which
this
subjectivitythis
implicit
and
deciding
certaintyappears
in
socrates
has
still
to
be
mentioned
that
is
since
everyone
here
has
this
personal
mind
which
appears
to
him
to
be
his
mind
we
see
how
in
connection
with
this
we
have
what
is
known
under
the
name
of
the
genius

of
socrates
for
it
implies
that
now
man
decides
in
accordance
with
his
perception
and
by
himself
but
in
this
genius
of
socratesnotorious
as
a
much
discussed
bizarrerie
of
his
imaginationwe
are
neither
to
imagine
the
existence
of
protective
spirit
angel
and
suchlike
nor
even
of
conscience
for
conscience
is
the
idea
of
universal
individuality
of
the
mind
certain
of
itself
which
is
at
the
same
time
universal
truth
but
the
genius
of
socrates
is
rather
all
the
other
and
necessary
sides
of
his
universality
that
is
the
individuality
of
mind
which
came
to
consciousness
in
him
equally
with
the
former
his
pure
consciousness
stands
over
both
sides
the
deficiency
in
the
universal
which
lies
in
its
indeterminateness
is
unsatisfactorily
supplied
in
an
individual
way
because
socrates
judgment
as
coming
from
himself
was
characterized
by
the
form
of
an
unconscious
impulse
the
genius
of
socrates
is
not
socrates
himself
not
his
opinions
and
conviction
but
an
oracle
which
however
is
not
external
but
is
subjective
his
oracle
it
bore
the
form
of
a
knowledge
which
was
directly
associated
with
a
condition
of
unconsciousness
it
was
a
knowledge
which
may
also
appear
under
other
conditions
as
a
magnetic
state
it
may
happen
that
at
death
in
illness
and
catalepsy
men
know
about
circumstances
future
or
present
which
in
the
understood
relations
of
things
are
altogether
unknown
these
are
facts
which
are
usually
rudely
denied
that
in
socrates
we
should
discover
what
comes
to
pass
through
reflection
in
the
form
of
the
unconscious
makes
it
appear
to
be
an
exceptional
matter
revealed
to
the
individual
only
and
not
as
being
what
it
is
in
truth
thereby
it
certainly
receives
the
stamp
of
imagination
but
there
is
nothing
more
of
what
is
visionary
or
superstitious
to
be
seen
in
it
for
it
is
a
necessary
manifestation
though
socrates
did
not
recognize
the
necessity
this
element
being
only
generally
before
his
imagination
in
connection
with
what
follows
we
must
yet
further
consider
the
relationship
of
the
genius
to
the
earlier
existent
form
of
decision
and
that
into
which
it
led
socrates
regarding
both
xenophon
expresses
himself
in
his
history
most
distinctly
because
the
standpoint
of
the
greek
mind
was
natural
morality
in
which
man
did
not
yet
determine
himself
and
still
less
was
what
we
call
conscience
present
since
laws
were
in
their
fundamental
principles
regarded
as
traditional
these
last
now
presented
an
appearance
of
being
sanctioned
by
the
gods
we
know
that
the
greeks
undoubtedly
had
laws
on
which
to
form
their
judgments
but
on
the
other
hand
both
in
private
and
public
life
immediate
decisions
had
to
be
made
but
in
them
the
greeks
with
all
their
freedom
did
not
decide
from
the
subjective
will
the
general
or
the
people
did
not
take
upon
themselves
to
decide
as
to
what
was
best
in
the
state
nor
did
the
individual
do
so
in
the
family
for
in
making
these
decisions
the
greeks
took
refuge
in
oracles
sacrificial
animals
soothsayers
or
like
the
romans
asked
counsel
of
birds
in
flight
the
general
who
had
to
fight
a
battle
was
guided
in
his
decision
by
the
entrails
of
animals
as
we
often
find
in
xenophons
anabasis
pausanias
tormented
himself
thus
a
whole
day
long
before
he
gave
the
command
to
fight131
this
element
the
fact
that
the
people
had
not
the
power
of
decision
but
were
determined
from
without
was
a
real
factor
in
greek
consciousness
and
oracles
were
everywhere
essential
where
man
did
not
yet
know
himself
inwardly
as
being
sufficiently
free
and
independent
to
take
upon
himself
to
decide
as
we
do
this
subjective
freedom
which
was
not
yet
present
with
the
greeks
is
what
we
mean
in
the
present
day
when
we
speak
of
freedom
in
the
platonic
republic
we
shall
see
more
of
it
our
responsibility
for
what
we
do
is
a
characteristic
of
modern
times
we
wish
to
decide
according
to
grounds
of
common
sense
and
consider
this
as
ultimate
the
greeks
did
not
possess
the
knowledge
of
this
infinitude

the
first

on
the
occasion
of
the
defence
by
socrates
of
his

socrates
says
at
the
very
beginning
the
gods
have
reserved
to
themselves
what
is
most
important
in
knowledge
architecture
agriculture
forging
are
human
arts
as
also
government
the
science
of
law
management
of
the
household
and
generalship
in
all
this
man
can
attain
to
skill
but
for
the
other
divination
is
necessary
he
who
cultivates
a
field
does
not
know
who
will
enjoy
the
fruit
nor
does
he
who
builds
a
house
know
who
will
inhabit
it
the
general
does
not
know
whether
the
army
should
be
brought
into
the
field
he
who
rules
a
state
whether
it
is
good
for
him
the
individual
or
bad
nor
does
he
who
marries
a
wife
know
whether
he
will
experience
happiness
or
whether
grief
and
sorrow
will
not
come
through
this
to
him
neither
can
he
who
has
powerful
relations
in
the
state
know
whether
on
account
of
these
he
may
not
be
banished
from
the
state
because
of
this
uncertainty
men
have
to
take
refuge
in
divination
regarding
it
xenophon
expresses
himself

to
the
effect
that
it
manifests
itself
in
different
ways
through
oracles
sacrifices
flight
of
birds
c
but
to
socrates
this
oracle
is
his
genius
to
hold
the
future
or
what
is
foreseen
by
the
somnambulist
or
at
death
to
be
a
higher
kind
of
insight
is
a
perversion
which
easily
arises
even
in
our
ideas
but
looked
at
more
closely
we
find
in
this
the
particular
interests
of
individuals
merely
and
the
knowledge
of
what
is
right
and
moral
is
something
much
higher
if
anyone
wishes
to
marry
or
to
build
a
house
c
the
result
is
important
to
the
individual
only
the
truly
divine
and
universal
is
the
institution
of
agriculture
the
state
marriage
c
compared
to
this
it
is
a
trivial
matter
to
know
whether
when
i
go
to
sea
i
shall
perish
or
not
the
genius
of
socrates
moreover
reveals
itself
in
him
through
nothing
other
than
the
counsel
given
respecting
these
particular
issues
such
as
when
and
whether
his
friends
ought
to
travel
to
anything
true
existing
in
and
for
itself
in
art
and
science
he
made
no
reference
for
this
pertains
to
the
universal
mind
and
these
dmonic
revelations
are
thus
much
more
unimportant
than
those
of
his
thinking
mind
there
is
certainly
something
universal
in
them
since
a
wise
man
can
often
foresee
whether
anything
is
advisable
or
not
but
what
is
truly
divine
pertains
to
all
and
though
talents
and
genius
are
also
personal
characteristics
they
find
their
first
truth
in
their
works
which
are
universal
now
because
with
socrates
judgment
from
within
first
begins
to
break
free
from
the
external
oracle
it
was
requisite
that
this
return
into
itself
should
in
its
first
commencement
still
appear
in
physiological
guise

the
genius
of
socrates
stands
midway
between
the
externality
of
the
oracle
and
the
pure
inwardness
of
the
mind
it
is
inward
but
it
is
also
presented
as
a
personal
genius
separate
from
human
will
and
not
yet
as
the
wisdom
and
free
will
of
socrates
himself
the
further
investigation
of
this
genius
consequently
presents
to
us
a
form
which
passes
into
somnambulism
into
this
double
of
consciousness
and
in
socrates
there
clearly
appears
to
be
something
of
the
kind
or
something
which
is
magnetic
for
as
we
already
mentioned
p
390
he
is
said
often
to
have
fallen
into
trances
and
catalepsy
in
modern
times
we
have
seen
this
in
the
form
of
a
rigid
eye
an
inward
knowledge
perception
of
this
thing
and
that
of
what
is
gone
of
what
is
best
to
do
c
but
magnetism
carries
science
no
further
than
this
the
genius
of
socrates
is
thus
to
be
taken
as
an
actual
state
and
is
remarkable
because
it
is
not
morbid
but
was
necessarily
called
up
through
a
special
condition
of
his
consciousness
for
the
turning
point
in
the
whole
worldfamed
change
of
views
constituting
the
principle
of
socrates
is
that
in
place
of
the
oracle
the
testimony
of
the
mind
of
the
individual
has
been
brought
forward
and
that
the
subject
has
taken
upon
itself
to
decide
3
the
fate
of
socrates
with
this
genius
of
socrates
as
one
of
the
chief
points
of
his
indictment
we
now
enter
upon
the
subject
of
his
fate
which
ends
with
his
condemnation
we
may
find
this
fate
out
of
harmony
with
his
professed
business
of
instructing
his
fellowcitizens
in
what
is
good
but
taken
in
connection
with
what
socrates
and
his
people
were
we
shall
recognize
the
necessity
of
it
the
contemporaries
of
socrates
who
came
forward
as
his
accusers
before
the
athenian
people
laid
hold
on
him
as
the
man
who
made
known
that
what
was
held
as
absolute
was
not
absolute
socrates
with
this
new
principle
and
as
one
who
was
an
athenian
citizen
whose
express
business
was
this
form
of
instruction
came
through
this
his
personality
into
relationship
with
the
whole
athenian
people
and
this
relationship
was
not
merely
with
a
certain
number
or
with
a
commanding
number
but
it
was
a
living
relationship
with
the
spirit
of
the
athenian
people
the
spirit
of
this
people
in
itself
its
constitution
its
whole
life
rested
however
on
a
moral
ground
on
religion
and
could
not
exist
without
this
absolutely
secure
basis
thus
because
socrates
makes
the
truth
rest
on
the
judgment
of
inward
consciousness
he
enters
upon
a
struggle
with
the
athenian
people
as
to
what
is
right
and
true
his
accusation
was
therefore
just
and
we
have
to
consider
this
accusation
as
also
the
end
of
his
career
the
attacks
which
socrates
experienced
are
well
known
and
were
from
two
sources
aristophanes
attacked
him
in
the
clouds
and
then
he
was
formally
accused
before
the
people
aristophanes
regarded
the
socratic
philosophy
from
the
negative
side
maintaining
that
through
the
cultivation
of
reflecting
consciousness
the
idea
of
law
had
been
shaken
and
we
cannot
question
the
justice
of
this
conception
aristophanes
consciousness
of
the
onesidedness
of
socrates
may
be
regarded
as
a
prelude
to
his
death
the
athenian
people
likewise
certainly
recognized
his
negative
methods
in
condemning
him
it
is
known
that
aristophanes
brought
upon
the
stage
along
with
socrates
not
only
such
men
as
aeschylus
and
more
specially
euripides
but
also
the
athenians
generally
and
their
generalsthe
personified
athenian
people
and
the
gods
themselvesa
freedom
which
we
would
not
dream
of
were
it
not
historically
authenticated
we
have
not
here
to
consider
the
real
nature
of
the
comedy
of
aristophanes
nor
the
wanton
way
in
which
he
was
said
to
have
treated
socrates
as
to
the
first
it
should
not
startle
us
nor
do
we
require
to
justify
aristophanes
or
to
excuse
him
the
comedy
of
aristophanes
is
in
itself
as
real
a
part
of
the
athenian
people
and
aristophanes
is
as
essential
a
figure
as
were
the
sublime
pericles
the
happy
alcibiades
the
divine
sophocles
and
the
moral
socrates
for
he
belongs
as
much
as
any
other
to
this
circle
of
luminaries
vol
i
p
322
thus
much
can
alone
be
said
that
it
certainly
goes
against
our
german
seriousness
to
see
how
aristophanes
brings
on
the
boards
men
living
in
the
state
by
name
in
order
to
make
a
jest
of
them
and
we
feel
this
specially
in
regard
to
so
upright
a
man
as
socrates
by
chronological
considerations
some
have
tried
hard
to
refute
the
fact
that
aristophanes
representations
had
no
influence
on
the
condemnation
of
socrates
it
is
seen
that
on
the
one
hand
socrates
was
treated
quite
unjustly
but
then
we
must
recognize
the
merit
of
aristophanes
who
in
his
clouds
was
perfectly
right
this
poet
who
exposed
socrates
to
scorn
in
the
most
laughable
and
bitter
way
was
thus
no
ordinary
joker
and
shallow
wag
who
mocked
what
is
highest
and
best
and
sacrificed
all
to
wit
with
a
view
to
making
the
athenians
laugh
for
everything
has
to
him
a
much
deeper
basis
and
in
all
his
jokes
there
lies
a
depth
of
seriousness
he
did
not
wish
merely
to
mock
and
moreover
to
mock
what
was
worthy
of
honour
would
be
perfectly
bald
and
flat
it
is
a
pitiful
wit
which
has
no
substance
and
does
not
rest
on
contradictions
lying
in
the
matter
itself
but
aristophanes
was
no
bad
jester
it
is
generally
speaking
not
possible
to
joke
in
an
external
way
about
what
does
not
contain
matter
for
joking
or
irony
in
itself
for
what
really
is
comic
is
to
show
a
man
or
a
thing
as
they
disclose
themselves
in
their
extent
and
if
the
thing
is
not
itself
its
contradiction
the
comic
element
is
superficial
and
groundless
hence
when
aristophanes
makes
merry
over
the
democracy
there
is
a
deep
political
earnestness
at
heart
and
from
all
his
works
it
appears
what
a
noble
excellent
true
athenian
citizen
he
was
we
thus
have
a
real
patriot
before
us
who
though
it
involved
the
punishment
of
death
did
not
fear
in
one
of
his
works
to
counsel
peace
in
him
as
one
who
had
a
patriotism
of
the
most
enlightened
kind
we
find
the
blissful
selfsatisfied
enjoyment
of
a
people
giving
free
rein
to
itself
there
is
in
what
is
humorous
a
selfsecurity
which
though
with
all
seriousness
it
strives
after
some
particular
thing
while
the
opposite
of
what
it
aims
at
always
comes
to
pass
never
has
for
that
reason
any
doubts
nor
any
reflection
about
itself
since
it
remains
perfectly
certain
of
itself
and
of
what
concerns
it
we
enjoy
in
aristophanes
this
side
of
the
free
athenian
spirit
this
perfect
enjoyment
of
itself
in
loss
this
untroubled
certainty
of
itself
in
all
miscarriage
of
the
result
in
real
life
and
this
is
the
height
of
humour
in
the
clouds
we
do
not
indeed
see
this
natural
humour
but
a
contradiction
with
definite
intention
aristophanes
indeed
depicts
socrates
humorously
too
for
he
brings
forth
in
his
moral
works
the
opposite
of
that
from
which
he
starts
and
his
scholars
derive
delight
from
the
farextending
discoveries
reached
through
him
which
they
think
are
made
by
their
own
good
luck
but
which
afterwards
turn
hateful
to
them
and
become
the
very
opposite
of
what
they
intended
the
wonderful
perception
which
the
followers
of
socrates
are
here
represented
as
having
attained
is
just
a
perception
of
the
nullity
of
the
laws
of
the
determinate
good
as
it
is
to
the
natural
consciousness
aristophanes
made
fun
of
the
fact
that
socrates
occupied
himself
with
elementary
researches
as
to
how
far
fleas
spring
and
of
his
putting
wax
on
their
feet
in
order
to
discover
this
this
is
not
historic
but
it
is
well
known
that
socrates
had
in
his
philosophy
the
side
which
aristophanes
showed
up
with
such
acrimony
shortly
the
fable
of
the
clouds
is
this
strepsiades
an
honourable
athenian
citizen
of
the
old
school
had
great
trouble
with
his
newfashioned
extravagant
son
who
spoiled
by
mother
and
uncle
kept
horses
and
led
a
life
out
of
keeping
with
his
position
the
father
thus
got
into
trouble
with
his
creditors
and
went
in
distress
to
socrates
and
became
his
disciple
there
the
old
man
learned
that
not
this
or
that
but
another
is
the
right
or
rather
he
learned
the
stronger

and
weaker
reasons


he
learned
the
dialectic
of
laws
and
how
by
reasoning
the
payment
of
debts
can
be
disregarded
and
he
then
required
that
his
son
should
go
to
the
school
of
socrates
and
the
latter
likewise
profited
from
his
wisdom
but
we
find
the
result
ensuing
from
the
universal
which
has
now
through
the
socratic
dialectic
become
empty
in
the
private
interest
or
the
wrong
spirit
of
strepsiades
and
his
son
which
spirit
is
merely
the
negative
consciousness
of
the
content
of
laws
equipped
with
this
new
wisdom
of
reasons
and
the
discovery
of
reasons
strepsiades
is
armed
against
the
chief
evil
that
presses
on
him
as
regards
his
threatening
creditors
these
now
come
one
after
another
to
obtain
payment
but
strepsiades
knows
how
to
put
them
off
with
excellent
reasons
and
to
argue
them
away
for
he
pacifies
them
by
all
sorts
of
titulos
and
shows
them
that
he
does
not
need
to
pay
them
indeed
he
even
mocks
them
and
is
very
glad
that
he
learned
all
this
from
socrates
but
soon
the
scene
changes
and
the
whole
affair
alters
the
son
comes
behaves
in
a
very
unseemly
way
to
his
father
and
finally
beats
him
the
father
cries
to
the
supreme
power
as
if
this
were
the
last
indignity
but
the
son
shows
him
with
equally
good
reasons
obtained
by
the
method
derived
by
him
from
socrates
that
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
strike
him
strepsiades
ends
the
comedy
with
execrations
on
the
socratic
dialectic
with
a
return
to
his
old
ways
and
with
the
burning
of
socrates
house
the
exaggeration
which
may
be
ascribed
to
aristophanes
is
that
he
drove
this
dialectic
to
its
bitter
end
but
it
cannot
be
said
that
injustice
is
done
to
socrates
by
this
representation
indeed
we
must
admire
the
depth
of
aristophanes
in
having
recognized
the
dialectic
side
in
socrates
as
being
a
negative
andthough
after
his
own
wayin
having
presented
it
so
forcibly
for
the
power
of
judging
in
socrates
method
is
always
placed
in
the
subject
in
conscience
but
where
this
is
bad
the
story
of
strepsiades
must
repeat
itself
with
regard
to
the
formal
public
accusation
of
socrates
we
must
not
like
tennemann
vol
ii
p
39
seq
say
of
socrates
treatment
that
it
is
revolting
to
humanity
that
this
excellent
man
had
to
drink
the
cup
of
poison
as
a
sacrifice
to
cabalsso
numerous
in
democracies
a
man
like
socrates
who
had
made
right
right
is
not
being
discussed
but
we
may
ask
what
right
the
right
of
moral
freedom
the
sole
standard
of
his
action
and
did
not
stray
from
the
straight
path
must
necessarily
make
many
enemies
why
this
is
foolish
it
is
a
moral
hypocrisy
to
pretend
to
be
better
than
others
who
are
then
called
enemies
who
are
accustomed
to
act
from
quite
different
motives
when
we
think
of
the
corruption
and
of
the
rule
of
the
thirty
tyrants
we
must
simply
wonder
that
he
could
have
worked
on
to
his
sixtieth
year
unmolested
but
since
the
thirty
did
not
venture
to
lay
hands
on
him
themselves
it
is
the
more
to
be
wondered
at
that
in
the
reconstituted
and
just
rule
and
freedom
which
followed
the
overthrow
of
despotismin
that
very
way
the
danger
in
which
their
principle
was
came
to
be
knowna
man
like
socrates
could
be
made
a
sacrifice
to
cabals
this
phenomenon
is
probably
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
enemies
of
socrates
had
first
of
all
to
gain
time
in
order
to
obtain
a
following
and
that
under
the
rule
of
the
thirty
they
played
too
insignificant
a
part
and
so
on
now
as
regards
the
trial
of
socrates
we
have
to
distinguish
two
points
the
one
the
matter
of
the
accusation
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
the
other
the
relation
of
socrates
to
the
sovereign
people
in
the
course
of
justice
there
are
thus
these
two
partsthe
relation
of
the
accused
to
the
matter
on
account
of
which
he
is
accused
and
his
relation
to
the
competency
of
the
people
or
the
recognition
of
their
majesty
socrates
was
found
guilty
by
the
judges
in
respect
of
the
content
of
his
accusation
but
was
condemned
to
death
because
he
refused
to
recognize
the
competency
and
majesty
of
the
people
as
regards
the
accused
a
the
accusation
consisted
of
two
points
that
socrates
did
not
consider
as
gods
those
who
were
held
to
be
such
by
the
athenian
people
but
introduced
new
ones
and
that
he
also
led
young
men
astray132
the
leading
away
of
youth
was
his
casting
doubt
on
what
was
held
to
be
immediate
truth
the
first
accusation
has
in
part
the
same
foundation
for
he
made
it
evident
that
what
was
usually
so
considered
was
not
acceptable
to
the
gods
and
in
part
it
is
to
be
taken
in
connection
with
his
dmon
not
that
he
called
this
his
god
but
with
the
greeks
this
was
the
direction
which
the
individuality
of
judgment
took
they
took
it
to
be
a
contingency
of
the
individual
and
hence
as
contingency
of
circumstances
is
an
external
they
also
made
the
contingency
of
judgment
into
something
external
ie
they
consulted
their
oraclesconscious
that
the
individual
will
is
itself
a
contingent
but
socrates
who
placed
the
contingency
of
judgment
in
himself
since
he
had
his
dmon
in
his
own
consciousness
thereby
abolished
the
external
universal
dmon
from
which
the
greeks
obtained
their
judgments
this
accusation
as
also
socrates
defence
we
wish
now
to
examine
further
xenophon
represents
both
to
us
and
plato
has
also
supplied
us
with
an
apology
meanwhile
we
may
not
rest
content
with
saying
that
socrates
was
an
excellent
man
who
suffered
innocently
c
p
430
for
in
this
accusation
it
was
the
popular
mind
of
athens
that
rose
against
the
principle
which
became
fatal
to
him

as
regards
the
first
point
of
the
accusation
that
socrates
did
not
honour
the
national
gods
but
introduced
new
ones
xenophon133
makes
him
answer
that
he
always
brought
the
same
sacrifices
as
others
to
the
public
altars
as
all
his
fellowcitizens
could
seehis
accusers
likewise
but
as
to
the
charge
that
he
introduced
new
dmons
in
that
he
heard
the
voice
of
god
showing
him
what
he
should
do
he
appealed
to
them
whether
by
soothsayers
the
cry
and
flight
of
birds
the
utterances
of
men
like
the
voice
of
pythia
the
position
of
the
entrails
of
sacrificial
animals
and
even
thunder
and
lightning
were
not
accepted
as
divine
revelations
that
god
knows
the
future
beforehand
and
if
he
wishes
reveals
it
in
these
ways
all
believe
with
him
but
god
can
also
reveal
the
future
otherwise
he
could
show
that
he
did
not
lie
in
maintaining
that
he
heard
the
voice
of
god
from
the
testimony
of
his
friends
to
whom
he
often
announced
what
was
said
and
in
its
results
this
was
always
found
to
be
true

ever

out
the
nature
of
the
universe
like
most
of
the
others
when
they
sought
to
understand
how
what
the
sophists
called
the
world
began
that
is
from
them
came
the
earlier
atheists
who
like
anaxagoras
held
that
the
sun
was
a
stone134
the
effect
which
the
defence
against
this
part
of
the
accusation
made
on
the
judges
is
expressed
thus
by
xenophon135
one
section
of
them
was
displeased
because
they
did
not
believe
what
socrates
said
and
the
other
part
because
they
were
envious
that
he
was
more
highly
honoured
of
the
gods
than
they
this
effect
is
very
natural
in
our
times
this
also
happens
in
two
ways
either
the
individual
is
not
believed
when
he
boasts
of
special
manifestations
and
particularly
of
manifestations
which
have
to
do
with
individual
action
and
life
it
is
neither
believed
that
such
manifestations
took
place
at
all
or
that
they
happened
to
this
subject
or
if
anyone
does
have
dealings
with
such
divinations
rightly
enough
his
proceedings
are
put
an
end
to
and
he
is
shut
up
by
this
it
is
not
denied
in
a
general
way
that
god
foreknows
everything
or
that
he
can
make
revelations
to
individuals
this
may
be
admitted
in
abstracto
but
not
in
actuality
and
it
is
believed
in
no
individual
cases
men
do
not
believe
that
to
him
to
this
individual
there
has
been
a
revelation
for
why
to
him
more
than
to
others
and
why
just
this
trifle
some
quite
personal
circumstancesas
to
whether
someone
should
have
a
successful
journey
or
whether
he
should
converse
with
another
person
or
whether
or
not
he
should
in
a
speech
properly
defend
himself
and
why
not
others
amongst
the
infinitely
many
things
which
may
occur
to
the
individual
why
not
much
more
important
things
things
concerning
the
welfare
of
whole
states
hence
it
is
not
believed
of
an
individual
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
if
it
is
possible
it
must
be
to
the
individual
that
it
happens
this
unbelief
which
thus
does
not
deny
the
general
fact
and
general
possibility
but
believes
it
in
no
particular
case
really
does
not
believe
in
the
actuality
and
truth
of
the
thing
it
does
not
believe
it
because
the
absolute
consciousnessand
it
must
be
suchcertainly
knows
nothing
of
a
positive
kind
of
trivialities
such
as
form
the
subject
of
these
divinations
and
also
those
of
socrates
in
spirit
such
things
immediately
vanish
away
the
absolute
consciousness
does
not
know
about
the
future
as
such
any
more
than
about
the
past
it
knows
only
about
the
present
but
because
in
its
present
in
its
thought
the
opposition
of
future
and
past
to
present
becomes
apparent
it
likewise
knows
about
future
and
past
but
of
the
past
as
something
which
has
taken
shape
for
the
past
is
the
preservation
of
the
present
as
reality
but
the
future
is
the
opposite
of
this
the
becoming
of
the
present
as
possibility
and
thus
the
formless
from
out
of
this
formlessness
the
universal
first
comes
into
form
in
the
present
and
hence
in
the
future
no
form
can
be
perceived
men
have
the
dim
feeling
that
when
god
acts
it
is
not
in
a
particular
way
nor
for
particular
objects
such
things
are
held
to
be
too
paltry
to
be
revealed
by
god
in
a
particular
case
it
is
acknowledged
that
god
determines
the
individual
but
by
this
the
totality
of
individuality
or
all
individualities
is
understood
hence
it
is
said
that
gods
way
of
working
is
found
in
universal
nature
now
while
with
the
greeks
judgment
had
the
form
of
a
contingency
externally
posited
through
the
flight
and
cries
of
birds
in
our
culture
we
decide
by
an
inward
contingency
because
i
myself
desire
to
be
this
contingency
and
the
knowledge
of
individuality
is
likewise
a
consciousness
of
this
contingency
but
if
the
greeks
for
whom
the
category
of
the
contingency
of
consciousness
was
an
existent
a
knowledge
of
it
as
an
oracle
had
this
individuality
as
a
universal
knowledge
of
which
everyone
could
ask
counsel
in
socratesin
whom
what
was
here
externally
established
had
become
inward
consciousness
as
with
us
though
not
yet
fully
being
still
represented
as
an
actual
voice
and
conceived
of
as
something
which
he
separated
from
his
individualitythe
decision
of
the
single
individual
had
the
form
of
personality
as
a
particular
and
it
was
not
a
universal
individuality
this
his
judges
could
not
in
justice
tolerate
whether
they
believed
it
or
not
with
the
greeks
such
revelations
had
to
have
a
certain
nature
and
method
there
were
so
to
speak
official
oracles
not
subjective
such
as
pythia
a
tree
etc
hence
when
this
appeared
in
any
particular
person
like
a
common
citizen
it
was
considered
incredible
and
wrong
the
dmon
of
socrates
was
a
medium
of
a
different
kind
to
any
formerly
respected
in
the
greek
religion
it
is
so
much
the
more
noteworthy
that
nevertheless
the
oracle
of
the
delphian
apollo
pythia
declared
socrates
to
be
the
wisest
greek136
socrates
it
was
who
carried
out
the
command
of
the
god
of
knowledge
know
thyself
and
made
it
the
motto
of
the
greeks
calling
it
the
law
of
the
mind
and
not
interpreting
it
as
meaning
a
mere
acquaintanceship
with
the
particular
nature
of
man
thus
socrates
is
the
hero
who
established
in
the
place
of
the
delphic
oracle
the
principle
that
man
must
look
within
himself
to
know
what
is
truth
now
seeing
that
pythia
herself
pronounced
that
utterance
we
find
in
it
a
complete
revolution
in
the
greek
mind
and
the
fact
that
in
place
of
the
oracle
the
personal
selfconsciousness
of
every
thinking
man
has
come
into
play
this
inward
certainty
however
is
undoubtedly
another
new
god
and
not
the
god
of
the
athenians
existing
hitherto
and
thus
the
accusation
of
socrates
was
quite
just

if
we
now
consider
the
second
point
of
the
accusation
that
socrates
led
youth
astray
we
find
that
he
first
sets
against
it
the
fact
that
the
oracle
of
delphi
declared
that
none
could
be
nobler
juster
or
wiser
than
he137
and
then
he
sets
against
this
accusation
his
whole
manner
of
life
and
asks
whether
by
the
example
that
he
gave
particularly
to
those
with
whom
he
went
about
he
ever
led
any
into
evil138
the
general
accusation
had
to
be
further
defined
and
witnesses
came
forward
melitus
said
that
he
knew
some
whom
he
advised
to
obey
him
rather
than
their
parents139
this
point
of
the
accusation
principally
related
to
anytus
and
since
he
made
it
good
by
sufficient
testimony
the
point
was
undoubtedly
proved
in
accordance
with
law
socrates
explained
himself
further
on
this
point
when
he
left
the
court
for
xenophon
tells
us
apol
socr

27
2931
that
anytus
was
inimical
to
socrates
because
he
said
to
anytus
a
respected
citizen
that
he
should
not
bring
up
his
son
to
the
trade
of
a
tanner
but
in
manner
befitting
a
free
man
anytus
was
himself
a
tanner
and
although
his
business
was
mostly
conducted
by
slaves
it
was
in
itself
not
ignominious
and
socrates
expression
was
hence
wrong
although
as
we
have
seen
p
366
quite
in
the
spirit
of
greek
thought
socrates
added
that
he
had
made
acquaintance
with
this
son
of
anytus
and
discovered
no
evil
in
him
but
he
prophesied
that
he
would
not
remain
at
this
servile
work
to
which
his
father
kept
him
nevertheless
because
he
had
no
rational
person
near
to
look
after
him
he
would
come
to
have
evil
desires
and
be
brought
into
dissolute
ways
xenophon
added
that
socrates
prophecy
had
come
to
pass
literally
and
that
the
young
man
gave
himself
up
to
drink
and
drank
day
and
night
becoming
totally
depraved
this
can
be
easily
understood
for
a
man
who
feels
himself
to
be
fit
for
something
better
whether
truly
so
or
not
and
through
this
discord
in
his
mind
is
discontented
with
the
circumstances
in
which
he
lives
yet
capable
of
attaining
to
no
other
is
led
out
of
this
disgust
into
listlessness
and
is
thus
on
the
way
to
the
evil
courses
which
so
often
ruin
men
the
prediction
of
socrates
is
thus
quite
natural
supra
p
424
to
this
definite
accusation
that
he
led
sons
into
disobedience
to
their
parents
socrates
replied
by
asking
the
question
whether
in
selecting
men
for
public
offices
such
as
that
of
general
parents
or
those
experienced
in
war
were
selected
similarly
in
all
cases
those
most
skilful
in
an
art
or
science
are
picked
out
he
demanded
whether
it
was
not
matter
of
astonishment
that
he
should
be
brought
before
a
judge
because
he
was
preferred
to
parents
by
the
sons
in
their
aspirations
after
the
highest
human
good
which
is
to
be
made
a
noble
man140
this
reply
of
socrates
is
on
the
one
hand
quite
just
but
we
see
at
the
same
time
that
we
cannot
call
it
exhaustive
for
the
real
point
of
the
accusation
is
not
touched
what
his
judges
found
unjust
was
the
intrusion
morally
of
a
third
into
the
absolute
relation
between
parents
and
children
on
the
whole
not
much
can
be
said
on
this
point
for
all
depends
on
the
mode
of
intervention
and
if
it
is
necessary
in
certain
cases
it
need
not
take
place
generally
and
least
of
all
when
some
private
individual
takes
that
liberty
children
must
have
the
feeling
of
unity
with
their
parents
this
is
the
first
immediately
moral
relationship
every
teacher
must
respect
it
keep
it
pure
and
cultivate
the
sense
of
being
thus
connected
hence
when
a
third
person
is
called
into
this
relation
between
parents
and
children
what
happens
through
the
new
element
introduced
is
that
the
children
are
for
their
own
good
prevented
from
confiding
in
their
parents
and
made
to
think
that
their
parents
are
bad
people
who
harm
them
by
their
intercourse
and
training
and
hence
we
find
this
revolting
the
worst
thing
which
can
happen
to
children
in
regard
to
their
morality
and
their
mind
is
that
the
bond
which
must
ever
be
held
in
reverence
should
become
loosened
or
even
severed
thereby
causing
hatred
disdain
and
illwill
whoever
does
this
does
injury
to
morality
in
its
truest
form
this
unity
this
confidence
is
the
mothers
milk
of
morality
on
which
man
is
nurtured
the
early
loss
of
parents
is
therefore
a
great
misfortune
the
son
like
the
daughter
must
indeed
come
out
of
his
natural
unity
with
the
family
and
become
independent
but
the
separation
must
be
one
which
is
natural
or
unforced
and
not
defiant
and
disdainful
when
a
pain
like
this
has
found
a
place
in
the
heart
great
strength
of
mind
is
required
to
overcome
it
and
to
heal
the
wound
if
we
now
speak
of
the
example
given
us
by
socrates
he
seems
through
his
intervention
to
have
made
the
young
man
dissatisfied
with
his
position
anytus
son
might
indeed
have
found
his
work
generally
speaking
uncongenial
but
it
is
another
thing
when
such
dislike
is
brought
into
consciousness
and
established
by
the
authority
of
a
man
such
as
socrates
we
may
very
well
conjecture
that
if
socrates
had
to
do
with
him
he
strengthened
and
developed
in
him
the
germ
of
the
feeling
of
incongruity
socrates
remarked
on
the
subject
of
his
capacities
saying
that
he
was
fit
for
something
better
and
thus
established
a
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
in
the
young
man
and
strengthened
his
dislike
to
his
father
which
thus
became
the
reason
of
his
ruin
hence
this
accusation
of
having
destroyed
the
relationship
of
parents
and
children
may
be
regarded
as
not
unfounded
but
as
perfectly
well
established
it
was
also
thought
very
bad
in
socrates
case
particularly
and
made
a
matter
of
reproach
that
he
had
such
followers
as
critias
and
alcibiades
who
brought
athens
almost
to
the
brink
of
ruin
supra
p
421
for
when
he
mixed
himself
in
the
education
which
others
gave
their
children
men
were
justified
in
the
demand
that
the
result
should
not
belie
what
he
professed
to
do
for
the
education
of
youth
the
only
question
now
is
how
the
people
came
to
take
notice
of
this
and
in
how
far
such
matters
can
be
objects
of
legislation
and
be
brought
into
court
in
our
law
as
regards
the
first
part
of
the
accusation
divination
such
as
cagliostros
is
illegal
and
it
would
be
forbidden
as
it
formerly
was
by
the
inquisition
respecting
the
second
point
such
a
moral
interference
is
no
doubt
more
recognized
with
us
where
there
is
a
particular
office
having
this
duty
laid
upon
it
but
this
interference
must
keep
itself
general
and
dare
not
go
so
far
as
to
call
forth
disobedience
to
parents
which
is
the
first
immoral
principle
but
should
such
questions
come
before
the
court
this
first
of
all
brings
up
the
question
of
what
is
the
right
of
the
state
and
here
great
laxity
is
now
allowed
nevertheless
when
some
professor
or
preacher
attacks
a
particular
religion
the
legislature
would
certainly
take
notice
of
it
and
it
would
have
a
complete
right
to
do
so
although
there
would
be
an
outcry
when
it
did
it
there
is
undoubtedly
a
limit
which
in
liberty
of
thought
and
speech
is
difficult
to
define
and
rests
on
tacit
agreement
but
there
is
a
point
beyond
which
we
find
what
is
not
allowed
such
as
direct
incitement
to
insurrection
it
is
indeed
said
that
bad
principles
destroy
themselves
by
themselves
and
find
no
entrance
but
that
is
only
true
in
part
for
with
the
populace
the
eloquence
of
sophistry
stirs
up
their
passions
it
is
also
said
this
is
only
theoretic
no
action
follows
but
the
state
really
rests
on
thought
and
its
existence
depends
on
the
sentiments
of
men
for
it
is
a
spiritual
and
not
a
physical
kingdom
hence
it
has
in
so
far
maxims
and
principles
which
constitute
its
support
and
if
these
are
attacked
the
government
must
intervene
added
to
this
it
was
the
case
that
in
athens
quite
a
different
state
of
things
was
present
than
with
us
in
order
to
be
able
to
judge
rightly
of
socrates
case
we
must
first
consider
the
athenian
state
and
its
customs
according
to
athenian
laws
ie
according
to
the
spirit
of
the
absolute
state
both
these
things
done
by
socrates
were
destructive
of
this
spirit
while
in
our
constitution
the
universal
of
the
states
is
a
stronger
universal
which
last
undoubtedly
permits
of
individuals
having
freer
play
since
they
cannot
be
so
dangerous
to
this
universal
hence
it
would
undoubtedly
in
the
first
place
mean
the
subversion
of
the
athenian
state
if
this
public
religion
on
which
everything
was
built
and
without
which
the
state
could
not
subsist
went
to
pieces
with
us
the
state
may
be
called
an
absolute
and
independent
power
the
dmon
is
now
in
fact
a
deity
differing
from
any
known
and
because
it
stood
in
contradiction
to
the
public
religion
it
gave
to
it
a
subjective
arbitrariness
but
since
established
religion
was
identified
with
public
life
so
closely
that
it
constituted
a
part
of
public
law
the
introduction
of
a
new
god
who
formed
selfconsciousness
into
a
principle
and
occasioned
disobedience
was
necessarily
a
crime
we
may
dispute
with
the
athenians
about
this
but
we
must
allow
that
they
are
consistent
in
the
second
place
the
moral
connection
between
parents
and
children
is
stronger
and
much
more
the
moral
foundation
of
life
with
the
athenians
than
with
us
where
subjective
freedom
reigns
for
family
piety
is
the
substantial
keynote
of
the
athenian
state
socrates
thus
attacked
and
destroyed
athenian
life
in
two
fundamental
points
the
athenians
felt
and
became
conscious
of
it
is
it
then
to
be
wondered
at
that
socrates
was
found
guilty
we
might
say
that
it
had
to
be
so
tennemann
vol
ii
p
41
says
though
these
charges
contained
the
most
palpable
untruths
socrates
was
condemned
to
death
because
his
mind
was
too
lofty
for
him
to
descend
to
the
common
unworthy
means
by
which
the
judgment
of
the
court
was
usually
perverted
but
all
this
is
false
he
was
found
guilty
of
these
deeds
but
not
for
that
reason
condemned
to
death
b
we
here
come
to
the
second
occurrence
in
his
history
in
accordance
with
athenian
laws
the
accused
had
after
the
heliasts
resembling
the
english
jury
pronounced
him
guilty
the
liberty
of
suggesting

a
penalty
different
from
the
punishment
which
the
accuser
proposed
this
implied
a
mitigation
of
the
punishment
without
a
formal
appealan
excellent
provision
in
athenian
law
testifying
to
its
humanity
in
this
penalty
the
punishment
in
itself
is
not
brought
into
question
but
only
the
kind
of
punishment
the
judges
had
decided
that
socrates
deserved
punishment
but
when
it
was
left
to
the
accused
to
determine
what
his
punishment
should
be
it
might
not
be
arbitrary
but
must
be
in
conformity
with
the
crime
a
money
or
bodily
punishment





141
but
it
was
implied
in
the
guilty
persons
constituting
himself
his
own
judge
that
he
submitted
himself
to
the
decision
of
the
court
and
acknowledged
himself
to
be
guilty
now
socrates
declined
to
assign
a
punishment
for
himself
consisting
either
of
fine
or
banishment
and
he
had
the
choice
between
these
and
death
which
his
accusers
proposed
he
declined
to
choose
the
former
punishment
because
he
according
to
xenophons
account
apol
socr

23
in
the
formality
of
the
exchangepenalty


as
he
said
would
acknowledge
guilt
but
there
was
no
longer
any
question
as
to
the
guilt
but
only
as
to
the
kind
of
punishment
this
silence
may
indeed
be
considered
as
moral
greatness
but
on
the
other
hand
it
contradicts
in
some
measure
what
socrates
says
later
on
in
prison
that
he
did
not
wish
to
flee
but
remained
there
because
it
seemed
better
to
the
athenians
and
better
to
him
to
submit
to
the
laws
vol
i
p
342
but
the
first
submission
would
have
meant
that
as
the
athenians
had
found
him
guilty
he
respected
this
decision
and
acknowledged
himself
as
guilty
consistently
he
would
thus
have
held
it
better
to
impose
his
punishment
since
thereby
he
would
not
only
have
submitted
himself
to
the
laws
but
also
to
the
judgment
we
see
in
sophocles
antig
verses
925
926
the
heavenly
antigone
that
noblest
of
figures
that
ever
appeared
on
earth
going
to
her
death
her
last
words
merely
stating
if
this
seems
good
unto
the
gods
suffering
we
may
be
made
to
know
our
error
pericles
also
submitted
himself
to
the
judgment
of
the
people
as
sovereign
we
saw
him
vol
i
p
328
going
round
the
citizens
entreating
for
aspasia
and
anaxagoras
in
the
roman
republic
we
likewise
find
the
noblest
men
begging
of
the
citizens
there
is
nothing
dishonouring
to
the
individual
in
this
for
he
must
bend
before
the
general
power
and
the
real
and
noblest
power
is
the
people
this
acknowledgment
the
people
must
have
direct
from
those
who
raise
themselves
amongst
them
here
on
the
contrary
socrates
disclaims
the
submission
to
and
humiliation
before
the
power
of
the
people
for
he
did
not
wish
to
ask
for
the
remission
of
his
punishment
we
admire
in
him
a
moral
independence
which
conscious
of
its
own
right
insists
upon
it
and
does
not
bend
either
to
act
otherwise
or
to
recognize
as
wrong
what
it
itself
regards
as
right
socrates
hence
exposed
himself
to
death
which
could
not
be
regarded
as
the
punishment
for
the
fault
of
which
he
was
found
guilty
for
the
fact
that
he
would
not
himself
determine
the
punishment
and
thus
disdained
the
juridical
power
of
the
people
was
foremost
in
leading
to
his
condemnation
in
a
general
way
he
certainly
recognized
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
but
not
in
this
individual
case
it
has
however
to
be
recognized
not
only
in
general
but
in
each
separate
case
with
us
the
competency
of
the
court
is
presupposed
and
the
criminal
judged
without
further
ado
today
the
whole
matter
is
also
open
to
the
light
of
day
and
accepted
as
an
acknowledged
fact
but
with
the
athenians
we
find
the
characteristic
request
that
the
prisoner
should
through
the
act
of
imposing
on
himself
a
penalty
sanction
the
judges
sentence
of
guilt
in
england
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
but
there
still
remains
a
like
form
of
asking
the
accused
by
what
law
he
wishes
to
be
judged
he
then
answers
by
the
law
of
the
land
and
by
the
judges
of
his
country
here
we
have
the
recognition
of
legal
operations
socrates
thus
set
his
conscience
in
opposition
to
the
judges
sentence
and
acquitted
himself
before
its
tribunal
but
no
people
and
least
of
all
a
free
people
like
the
athenians
has
by
this
freedom
to
recognize
a
tribunal
of
conscience
which
knows
no
consciousness
of
having
fulfilled
its
duty
excepting
its
own
consciousness
to
this
government
and
law
the
universal
spirit
of
the
people
may
reply
if
you
have
the
consciousness
of
having
done
your
duty
we
must
also
have
the
consciousness
that
you
have
so
done
for
the
first
principle
of
a
state
is
that
there
is
no
reason
or
conscience
or
righteousness
or
anything
else
higher
than
what
the
state
recognizes
as
such
quakers
anabaptists
c
who
resist
any
demands
made
on
them
by
the
state
such
as
to
defend
the
fatherland
cannot
be
tolerated
in
a
true
state
this
miserable
freedom
of
thinking
and
believing
what
men
will
is
not
permitted
nor
any
such
retreat
behind
personal
consciousness
of
duty
if
this
consciousness
is
no
mere
hypocrisy
in
order
that
what
the
individual
does
should
be
recognized
as
duty
it
must
be
recognized
as
such
by
all
if
the
people
can
make
mistakes
the
individual
may
do
so
much
more
easily
and
he
must
be
conscious
that
he
can
do
this
much
more
easily
than
the
people
now
law
also
has
a
conscience
and
has
to
speak
through
it
the
lawcourt
is
the
privileged
conscience
now
if
the
miscarriage
of
justice
in
a
trial
is
shown
by
every
conscience
clamouring
for
something
different
the
conscience
of
the
court
alone
possesses
any
value
as
being
the
universal
legalized
conscience
which
does
not
require
to
recognize
the
particular
conscience
of
the
accused
men
are
too
easily
convinced
of
having
fulfilled
their
duty
but
the
judge
finds
out
whether
duty
is
in
fact
fulfilled
even
if
men
have
the
consciousness
of
its
being
so
we
should
expect
nothing
else
of
socrates
than
that
he
should
go
to
meet
his
death
in
the
most
calm
and
manly
fashion
platos
account
of
the
wonderful
scene
his
last
hours
presented
although
containing
nothing
very
special
forms
an
elevating
picture
and
will
be
to
us
a
permanent
representation
of
a
noble
deed
the
last
dialogue
of
plato
is
popular
philosophy
for
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
here
first
brought
forward
yet
it
brings
no
consolation
for
as
homer
makes
achilles
say
in
the
nether
world
he
would
prefer
to
be
a
ploughboy
on
the
earth
but
though
the
people
of
athens
asserted
through
the
execution
of
this
judgment
the
rights
of
their
law
as
against
the
attacks
of
socrates
and
had
punished
the
injury
caused
to
their
moral
life
by
socrates
socrates
was
still
the
hero
who
possessed
for
himself
the
absolute
right
of
the
mind
certain
of
itself
and
of
the
inwardly
deciding
consciousness
and
thus
expressed
the
higher
principle
of
mind
with
consciousness
now
because
as
has
been
said
this
new
principle
by
effecting
an
entrance
into
the
greek
world
has
come
into
collision
with
the
substantial
spirit
and
the
existing
sentiments
of
the
athenian
people
a
reaction
had
to
take
place
for
the
principle
of
the
greek
world
could
not
yet
bear
the
principle
of
subjective
reflection
the
athenian
people
were
thus
not
only
justified
but
also
bound
to
react
against
it
according
to
their
law
for
they
regarded
this
principle
as
a
crime
in
general
history
we
find
that
this
is
the
position
of
the
heroes
through
whom
a
new
world
commences
and
whose
principle
stands
in
contradiction
to
what
has
gone
before
and
disintegrates
it
they
appear
to
be
violently
destroying
the
laws
hence
individually
they
are
vanquished
but
it
is
only
the
individual
and
not
the
principle
which
is
negated
in
punishment
and
the
spirit
of
the
athenian
people
did
not
in
the
removal
of
the
individual
recover
its
old
position
the
false
form
of
individuality
is
taken
away
and
that
indeed
in
a
violent
way
by
punishment
but
the
principle
itself
will
penetrate
later
if
in
another
form
and
elevate
itself
into
a
form
of
the
worldspirit
this
universal
mode
in
which
the
principle
comes
forth
and
permeates
the
present
is
the
true
one
what
was
wrong
was
the
fact
that
the
principle
came
forth
only
as
the
peculiar
possession
of
one
individual
his
own
world
could
not
comprehend
socrates
but
posterity
can
in
as
far
as
it
stands
above
both
it
may
be
conceived
that
the
life
of
socrates
had
no
need
to
have
such
an
end
for
socrates
might
have
lived
and
died
a
private
philosopher
and
his
teaching
might
have
been
quietly
accepted
by
his
disciples
and
have
spread
further
still
without
receiving
any
notice
from
state
or
people
the
accusation
thus
would
seem
to
have
been
contingent
but
it
must
be
said
that
it
was
through
the
manner
of
that
event
that
this
principle
became
so
highly
honoured
the
principle
is
not
merely
something
new
and
peculiar
to
itself
but
it
is
an
absolutely
essential
moment
in
the
selfdeveloping
consciousness
of
self
which
is
designed
to
bring
to
pass
as
a
totality
a
new
and
higher
actuality
the
athenians
perceived
correctly
that
this
principle
not
only
meant
opinion
and
doctrine
for
its
true
attitude
was
that
of
a
direct
and
even
hostile
and
destructive
relation
to
the
actuality
of
the
greek
mind
and
they
proceeded
in
accordance
with
this
perception
hence
what
follows
in
socrates
life
is
not
contingent
but
necessarily
follows
upon
his
principle
or
the
honour
of
having
recognized
that
relation
and
indeed
of
having
felt
that
they
themselves
were
tinged
with
this
principle
is
due
to
the
athenians
c
the
athenians
likewise
repented
of
their
condemnation
of
socrates
and
punished
some
of
his
accusers
with
death
itself
and
others
with
banishment
for
according
to
athenian
laws
the
man
who
made
an
accusation
and
whose
accusation
was
found
to
be
false
usually
underwent
the
same
punishment
that
otherwise
the
criminal
would
have
borne
this
is
the
last
act
in
this
drama
on
the
one
hand
the
athenians
recognized
through
their
repentance
the
individual
greatness
of
the
man
but
on
the
other
and
this
we
find
by
looking
closer
they
also
recognized
that
this
principle
in
socrates
signifying
the
introduction
of
new
gods
and
disrespect
to
parents
haswhile
destructive
and
hostile
to
itbeen
introduced
even
into
their
own
spirit
and
that
they
themselves
are
in
the
dilemma
of
having
in
socrates
only
condemned
their
own
principle
in
that
they
regretted
the
just
judgment
of
socrates
it
seems
to
be
implied
that
they
wished
that
it
had
not
occurred
but
from
the
regret
it
does
not
follow
that
in
itself
it
should
not
have
occurred
but
only
that
it
should
not
have
happened
for
their
consciousness
both
together
constitute
the
innocence
which
is
guilty
and
atones
for
its
guilt
it
would
only
be
senseless
and
despicable
if
there
were
no
guilt
an
innocent
person
who
comes
off
badly
is
a
simpleton
hence
it
is
a
very
flat
and
uninteresting
matter
when
tyrants
and
innocent
persons
are
represented
in
tragedies
just
because
this
is
an
empty
contingency
a
great
man
would
be
guilty
and
overcome
the
great
crisis
that
ensues
christ
thus
gave
up
his
individuality
but
what
was
brought
forth
by
him
remained
the
fate
of
socrates
is
hence
really
tragic
not
in
the
superficial
sense
of
the
word
and
as
every
misfortune
is
called
tragic
the
death
of
an
estimable
individual
must
in
such
a
sense
be
specially
tragic
and
thus
it
is
said
of
socrates
that
because
he
was
innocent
and
condemned
to
death
his
fate
was
tragic
but
such
innocent
suffering
would
only
be
sad
and
not
tragic
for
it
would
not
be
a
rational
misfortune
misfortune
is
only
rational
when
it
is
brought
about
by
the
will
of
the
subject
who
must
be
absolutely
justified
and
moral
in
what
he
does
like
the
power
against
which
he
warswhich
must
therefore
not
be
a
merely
natural
power
or
the
power
of
a
tyrannic
will
for
it
is
only
in
such
a
case
that
man
himself
has
any
part
in
his
misfortune
while
natural
death
is
only
an
absolute
right
which
nature
exercises
over
men
hence
in
what
is
truly
tragic
there
must
be
valid
moral
powers
on
both
the
sides
which
come
into
collision
this
was
so
with
socrates
his
is
likewise
not
merely
a
personal
individually
romantic
lot
for
we
have
in
it
the
universally
moral
and
tragic
fate
the
tragedy
of
athens
the
tragedy
of
greece
two
opposed
rights
come
into
collision
and
the
one
destroys
the
other
thus
both
suffer
loss
and
yet
both
are
mutually
justified
it
is
not
as
though
the
one
alone
were
right
and
the
other
wrong
the
one
power
is
the
divine
right
the
natural
morality
whose
laws
are
identical
with
the
will
which
dwells
therein
as
in
its
own
essence
freely
and
nobly
we
may
call
it
abstractly
objective
freedom
the
other
principle
on
the
contrary
is
the
right
as
really
divine
of
consciousness
or
of
subjective
freedom
this
is
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
ie
of
selfcreative
reason
and
it
is
the
universal
principle
of
philosophy
for
all
successive
times
it
is
these
two
principles
which
we
see
coming
into
opposition
in
the
life
and
the
philosophy
of
socrates
the
athenian
people
had
come
into
a
period
of
culture
in
which
this
individual
consciousness
made
itself
independent
of
the
universal
spirit
and
became
for
itself
this
was
perceived
by
them
in
socrates
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
felt
that
it
meant
ruin
and
thus
they
punished
an
element
which
was
their
own
the
principle
of
socrates
is
hence
not
the
transgression
of
one
individual
for
all
were
implicated
the
crime
was
one
that
the
spirit
of
the
people
committed
against
itself
through
this
perception
the
condemnation
of
socrates
was
retracted
socrates
appeared
to
have
committed
no
crime
for
the
spirit
of
the
people
has
now
generally
reached
the
consciousness
which
turns
back
from
the
universal
into
itself
this
meant
the
disintegration
of
this
people
whose
mind
and
spirit
consequently
soon
disappeared
from
the
world
but
yet
out
of
its
ashes
a
higher
took
its
rise
for
the
worldspirit
had
raised
itself
into
a
higher
consciousness
the
athenian
state
indeed
endured
for
long
but
the
bloom
of
its
character
soon
faded
it
is
characteristic
of
socrates
that
he
grasped
the
principle
of
the
inwardness
of
knowledge
not
practically
merely
as
did
critias
and
alcibiades
supra
pp
421
438
but
in
thought
making
it
valid
to
thought
and
this
is
the
higher
method
knowledge
brought
about
the
fall
but
it
also
contains
the
principle
of
redemption
thus
what
to
others
was
only
ruin
to
socrates
because
it
was
the
principle
of
knowledge
was
also
a
principle
of
healing
the
development
of
this
principle
which
constitutes
the
content
of
all
successive
history
is
explicitly
the
reason
that
the
later
philosophers
withdrew
from
the
affairs
of
the
state
restricted
themselves
to
cultivating
an
inner
world
separated
from
themselves
the
universal
aim
of
the
moral
culture
of
the
people
and
took
up
a
position
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
athens
and
the
athenians
from
this
it
came
to
pass
that
particularity
of
ends
and
interests
now
became
powerful
in
athens
this
has
in
common
with
the
socratic
principle
the
fact
that
what
seems
right
and
duty
good
and
useful
to
the
subject
in
relation
to
himself
as
well
as
to
the
state
depends
on
his
inward
determination
and
choice
and
not
on
the
constitution
and
the
universal
this
principle
of
selfdetermination
for
the
individual
has
however
become
the
ruin
of
the
athenian
people
because
it
was
not
yet
identified
with
the
constitution
of
the
people
and
thus
the
higher
principle
must
in
every
case
appear
to
bring
ruin
with
it
where
it
is
not
yet
identified
with
the
substantial
of
the
people
the
athenian
life
became
weak
and
the
state
outwardly
powerless
because
its
spirit
was
divided
within
itself
hence
it
was
dependent
on
lacedmon
and
we
finally
see
the
external
subordination
of
these
states
to
the
macedonians
we
are
done
with
socrates
i
have
been
more
detailed
here
because
all
the
features
of
the
case
have
been
so
completely
in
harmony
and
he
constitutes
a
great
historic
turning
point

before

of
alexander
he
saw
athens

and
the

of

he
experienced
the
height
of
its
bloom
and
the
beginning
of
its
misfortunes
c
the
socratics
the
result
of
the
death
of
socrates
was
that
the
little
company
of
his
friends
went
off
from
athens
to
megara
where
plato
also
came
euclides
had
settled
there
and
received
them

when
socrates
condemnation
was
retracted
and
his
accusers
punished
certain
of
the
socratics
returned
and
all
was
again
brought
into
equilibrium
the
work
of
socrates
was
farreaching
and
effectual
in
the
kingdom
of
thought
and
the
stimulation
of
a
great
amount
of
interest
is
always
the
principal
service
of
a
teacher
subjectively
socrates
had
the
formal
effect
of
bringing
about
a
discord
in
the
individual
the
content
was
subsequently
left
to
the
freewill
and
liking
of
each
person
because
the
principle
was
subjective
consciousness
and
not
objective
thought
socrates
himself
only
came
so
far
as
to
express
for
consciousness
generally
the
simple
existence
of
ones
own
thought
as
the
good
but
as
to
whether
the
particular
conceptions
of
the
good
really
properly
defined
that
of
which
they
were
intended
to
express
the
essence
he
did
not
inquire
but
because
socrates
made
the
good
the
end
of
the
living
man
he
made
the
whole
world
of
idea
or
objective
existence
in
general
rest
by
itself
without
seeking
to
find
a
passage
from
the
good
the
real
essence
of
what
is
known
as
such
to
the
thing
and
recognizing
real
essence
as
the
essence
of
things
for
when
all
present
speculative
philosophy
expresses
the
universal
as
essence
this
as
it
first
appears
has
the
semblance
of
being
a
single
determination
beside
which
there
are
a
number
of
others
it
is
the
complete
movement
of
knowledge
that
first
removes
this
semblance
and
the
system
of
the
universe
then
shows
forth
its
essence
as
notion
as
a
connected
whole
the
most
varied
schools
and
principles
proceeded
from
this
doctrine
of
socrates
and
this
was
made
a
reproach
against
him
but
it
was
really
due
to
the
indefiniteness
and
abstraction
of
his
principle
and
in
this
way
it
is
only
particular
forms
of
this
principle
which
can
at
first
be
recognized
in
philosophic
systems
which
we
call
socratic
under
the
name
of
socratic
i
understand
however
those
schools
and
methods
which
remained
closer
to
socrates
and
in
which
we
find
nothing
but
the
onesided
understanding
of
socratic
culture
one
part
of
these
kept
quite
faithfully
to
the
direct
methods
of
socrates
without
going
any
further
a
number
of
his
friends
are
mentioned
as
being
of
this
description
and
these
inasmuch
as
they
were
authors
contented
themselves
with
correctly
transcribing
dialogues
after
his
manner
which
were
partly
those
he
actually
had
held
with
them
and
partly
those
they
had
heard
from
others
or
else
with
working
out
similar
dialogues
in
his
method
but
for
the
rest
they
abstained
from
speculative
research
and
by
directing
their
attention
to
what
was
practical
adhered
firmly
and
faithfully
to
the
fulfilment
of
the
duties
of
their
position
and
circumstances
thereby
maintaining
calm
and
satisfaction
xenophon
is
the
most

of

they
have
however
only
a
literary
interest
and
hence
i
will
pass
them
by
but
another
section
of
the
socratics
went
further
than
socrates
inasmuch
as
they
starting
from
him
laid
hold
of
and
matured
one
of
the
particular
aspects
of
his
philosophy
and
of
the
standpoint
to
which
philosophic
knowledge
was
brought
through
him
this
standpoint
maintained
the
absolute
character
of
selfconsciousness
within
itself
and
the
relation
of
its
selfexistent
universality
to
the
individual
in
socrates
and
from
him
onward
we
thus
see
knowledge
commencing
the
world
raising
itself
into
the
region
of
conscious
thought
and
this
becoming
the
object
we
no
longer
hear
question
and
answer
as
to
what
nature
is
but
as
to
what
truth
is
or
real
essence
has
determined
itself
not
to
be
the
implicit
but
to
be
what
it
is
in
knowledge
we
hence
have
the
question
of
the
relationship
of
selfconscious
thought
to
real
essence
coming
to
the
front
as
what
concerns
us
most
the
true
and
essence
are
not
the
same
the
true
is
essence
as
thought
but
essence
is
the
simply
implicit
this
simple
is
indeed
thought
and
is
in
thought
but
when
it
is
said
that
essence
is
pure
being
or
becoming
as
the
beingforself
of
the
atomists
and
then
that
the
notion
is
thought
generally
the

of
anaxagoras
or
finally
measure
this
is
asserted
directly
and
in
an
objective
manner
or
it
is
the
simple
unity
of
the
objective
and
of
thought
it
is
not
purely
objectivefor
being
cannot
be
seen
heard
c
nor
is
it
pure
thought
in
opposition
to
the
existentfor
this
is
the
explicitly
existent
selfconsciousness
which
separates
itself
from
essence
it
is
finally
not
the
unity
going
back
into
itself
from
the
difference
in
the
two
sides
which
is
understanding
and
knowledge
in
these
selfconsciousness
on
the
one
hand
presents
itself
as
beingforself
and
on
the
other
as
being
it
is
conscious
of
this
difference
and
from
this
difference
turns
back
into
the
unity
of
both
this
unity
the
result
is
the
known
the
true
one
element
in
the
true
is
the
certainty
of
itself
this
moment
has
attained
to
realityin
consciousness
and
for
consciousness
it
is
through
this
movement
and
the
investigation
of
the
subject
that
the
succeeding
period
of
philosophy
is
distinguished
because
it
does
not
contemplate
essence
as
left
to
itself
and
as
purely
objective
but
as
in
unity
with
the
certainty
of
itself
it
is
not
to
be
understood
by
this
that
such
knowledge
had
itself
been
made
into
essence
so
that
it
is
held
to
be
the
content
and
definition
of
absolute
essence
or
that
essence
had
been
determined
for
the
consciousness
of
these
philosophers
as
the
unity
of
being
and
thought
ie
as
if
they
had
thought
of
it
thus
but
they
could
merely
no
longer
speak
of
essence
and
actuality
without
this
element
of
selfcertainty
and
this
period
is
hence
so
to
speak
the
middle
period
which
is
really
the
movement
of
knowledge
and
considers
knowledge
as
the
science
of
essence
which
first
brings
about
that
unity
from
what
has
been
said
it
can
now
be
seen
what
philosophic
systems
can
come
before
us
that
is
to
say
because
in
this
period
the
relation
of
thought
to
being
or
of
the
universal
to
the
individual
is
made
explicit
we
see
on
the
one
hand
as
the
object
of
philosophy
the
contradiction
of
consciousness
coming
to
consciousnessa
contradiction
as
to
which
the
ordinary
modes
of
thought
have
no
knowledge
for
they
are
in
a
state
of
confusion
seeing
that
they
go
on
unthinkingly
on
the
other
hand
we
have
philosophy
as
perceiving
knowledge
itself
which
however
does
not
get
beyond
its
notion
and
which
because
it
is
the
unfolding
of
a
more
extensive
knowledge
of
a
content
cannot
give
itself
this
content
but
can
only
think
it
ie
determine
it
in
a
simple
manner
of
those
socratics
who
hold
a
place
of
their
own
there
are
according
to
this
three
schools
worthy
of
consideration
first
the
megaric
school
at
whose
head
stands
euclid
of
megara
and
then
the
cyrenaic
and
cynic
schools
and
from
the
fact
that
they
all
three
differ
very
much
from
one
another
it
is
clearly
shown
that
socrates
himself
was
devoid
of
any
positive
system
with
these
socratics
the
determination
of
the
subject
for
which
the
absolute
principle
of
the
true
and
good
likewise
appears
as
end
came
into
prominence
this
end
demands
reflection
and
general
mental
cultivation
and
also
requires
that
men
should
be
able
to
tell
what
the
good
and
true
really
are
but
though
these
socratic
schools
as
a
whole
rest
at
saying
that
the
subject
itself
is
end
and
reaches
its
subjective
end
through
the
cultivation
of
its
knowledge
the
form
of
determination
in
them
is
still
the
universal
and
it
is
also
so
that
it
does
not
remain
abstract
for
the
development
of
the
determinations
of
the
universal
gives
real
knowledge
the
megarics
were
most
abstract
because
they
held
to
the
determination
of
the
good
which
as
simple
was
to
them
the
principle
the
unmoved
and
selfrelated
simplicity
of
thought
becomes
the
principle
of
consciousness
as
individual
as
it
is
of
conscious
knowledge
the
megaric
school
associated
with
the
assertion
of
the
simplicity
of
the
good
the
dialectic
that
all
that
was
defined
and
limited
is
not
true
but
because
with
the
megarics
the
principal
point
was
to
know
the
universal
and
this
universal
was
to
them
the
absolute
which
had
to
be
retained
in
this
form
of
the
universal
this
thought
as
notion
which
holds
a
negative
position
in
relation
to
all
determinateness
and
thus
to
that
of
notion
also
was
equally
turned
against
knowledge
and
perception
the
cyrenaics
take
knowledge
in
its
subjective
signification
and
as
signifying
individuality
as
certainty
of
self
or
feeling
to
this
as
to
that
which
is
essential
they
restrict
the
exercise
of
consciousness
and
generally
speaking
make
existence
for
consciousness
consist
therein
now
because
they
thereby
sought
to
define
the
good
more
closely
they
called
it
simply
pleasure
or
enjoyment
by
which
however
anything
can
be
understood
this
principle
of
the
cyrenaic
school
would
seem
to
have
been
far
removed
from
that
of
socrates
since
we
at
once
think
of
the
transient
existence
of
feeling
as
directly
in
opposition
to
the
good
this
however
is
not
the
case
the
cyrenaics
likewise
upheld
the
universal
for
if
it
is
asked
what
the
good
is
we
find
they
certainly
made
pleasurable
feeling
which
presents
the
appearance
of
a
determinate
to
be
its
content
but
seeing
that
a
cultured
mind
is
also
requisite
enjoyment
as
it
is
obtained
through
thought
is
here
indicated
the
cynics
also
further
defined
the
principle
of
the
good
but
in
another
way
from
the
cyrenaics
its
content
they
said
lay
in
mans
keeping
to
what
is
in
conformity
with
nature
and
to
the
simple
needs
of
nature
they
similarly
call
all
that
is
particular
and
limited
in
the
aims
of
men
that
which
is
not
to
be
desired
to
the
cynics
too
mental
culture
through
the
knowledge
of
the
universal
is
the
principle
but
through
this
knowledge
of
the
universal
the
individual
end
must
be
attained
and
this
is
that
the
individual
should
keep
himself
in
abstract
universality
in
freedom
and
independence
and
be
indifferent
to
all
he
formerly
esteemed
thus
we
see
pure
thought
recognized
in
its
movement
with
the
individual
and
the
manifold
transformations
of
the
universal
coming
to
consciousness
these
three
schools
are
not
to
be
treated
at
length
the
principle
of
the
cyrenaics
became
later
on
more
scientifically
worked
out
in
epicureanism
as
that
of
the
cynics
did
in
stoicism
1
the
megarics
because
euclides
who
is
regarded
as
the
founder
of
the
megaric
way
of
thinking
and
his
school
held
to
the
forms
of
universality
and
above
all
sought
and
with
success
to
show
forth
the
contradictions
contained
in
all
particular
conceptions
they
were
reproached
with
having
a
rage
for
disputation
and
hence
the
name
of
eristics
was
given
them
the
instrument
for
bringing
all
that
is
particular
into
confusion
and
annulling
this
particular
was
supplied
by
dialectic
which
indeed
was
brought
by
them
to
very
great
perfection
but
as
was
privately
stated
they
did
it
in
a
kind
of
anger
so
that
others
said
that
they
should
not
be
called
a
school

but
a
gall
143
with
a
dialectic
thus
constituted
we
find
them
taking
the
place
of
the
eleatic
school
and
of
the
sophists
and
it
seems
as
though
the
eleatic
school
had
merely
been
reproduced144
since
they
were
essentially
identical
with
it
but
this
was
only
partly
truein
that
the
eleatic
dialecticians
maintained
being
as
the
one
existence
in
relation
to
which
nothing
particular
is
a
truth
and
the
megarics
considered
being
as
the
good
the
sophists
on
the
other
hand
did
not
seek
their
impulse
in
simple
universality
as
fixed
and
as
enduring
and
similarly
we
shall
find
in
the
sceptics
dialecticians
who
maintain
that
the
subjective
mind
rests
within
itself
besides
euclides
diodorus
and
menedemus
are
mentioned
as
distinguished
eristics
but
particularly
eubulides
and
later
on
stilpo
whose
dialectic
likewise
related
to
contradictions
which
appeared
in
external
conception
and
in
speech
so
that
it
in
great
measure
passed
into
a
mere
play
upon
words
a
euclides
euclides
who
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
mathematician
is
he
of
whom
it
is
said
that
during
the
enmity
between
athens
and
his
birthplace
megara
and
in
the
period
of
most
violent
animosity
he
often
secretly
went
to
athens
dressed
as
a
woman
not
fearing
even
the
punishment
of
death
in
order
to
be
able
to
hear
socrates
and
be
in
his
company145
euclides
is
said
in
spite
of
his
stubborn
manner
of
disputing
to
have
been
even
in
his
disputation
a
most
peaceful
man
it
is
told
that
once
in
a
quarrel
his
opponent
was
so
irritated
that
he
exclaimed
i
will
die
if
i
do
not
revenge
myself
upon
you
euclides
replied
and
i
will
die
if
i
do
not
soften
your
wrath
so
much
by
the
mildness
of
my
speech
that
you
will
love
me
as
before146
it
was
euclides
who
said
that
the
good
is
one
and
it
alone
is
though
passing
under
many
names
sometimes
it
is
called
understanding
sometimes
god
at
another
time
thought

and
so
on
but
what
is
opposed
to
the
good
does
not
exist147
this
doctrine
cicero
ibid
calls
noble
and
says
that
it
differs
but
little
from
the
platonic
since
the
megarics
make
the
good
as
the
simple
identity
of
the
true
into
a
principle
it
is
clearly
seen
that
they
expressed
the
good
as
the
absolute
existence
in
a
universal
sense
as
did
socrates
but
they
no
longer
like
him
recognized
all
the
approximate
conceptions
or
merely
opposed
them
as
being
indifferent
to
the
interests
of
man
for
they
asserted
definitely
that
they
were
nothing
at
all
thus
they
come
into
the
category
of
the
eleatics
since
they
like
them
showed
that
only
being
is
and
that
all
else
as
negative
does
not
exist
while
the
dialectic
of
socrates
was
thus
incidental
in
that
he
merely
shook
some
current
moral
ideas
or
the
very
first
conceptions
of
knowledge
the
megarics
on
the
contrary
raised
their
philosophic
dialectic
into
something
more
universal
and
real
for
they
applied
themselves
more
to
what
is
formal
in
idea
and
speech
though
not
yet
like
the
later
sceptics
to
the
determinations
of
pure
notions
for
knowledge
thought
was
not
yet
present
in
abstract
conceptions
of
their
own
dialectic
not
much
is
told
but
more
is
said
of
the
embarrassment
into
which
they
brought
ordinary
consciousness
for
they
were
in
all
kinds
of
ways
alert
in
involving
others
in
contradictions
thus
they
applied
dialectic
after
the
manner
of
an
ordinary
conversation
just
as
socrates
applied
his
mind
to
every
side
of
ordinary
subjects
and
as
we
also
in
our
conversation
try
to
make
an
assertion
interesting
and
important
a
number
of
anecdotes
are
told
of
their
disputations
from
which
we
see
that
what
we
call
joking
was
their
express
business
others
of
their
puzzles
certainly
deal
with
a
positive
category
of
thought
they
take
these
and
show
how
if
they
are
held
to
be
true
they
bring
about
a
contradiction
b
eubulides
of
the
innumerable
multitude
of
ways
in
which
they
tried
to
confuse
our
knowledge
in
the
categories
many
are
preserved
with
their
names
and
the
principal
of
these
are
the
sophisms
whose
discovery
is
ascribed
to
eubulides
of
miletus
a
pupil
of
euclides148
the
first
thing
which
strikes
us
when
we
hear
them
is
that
they
are
common
sophisms
which
are
not
worth
contradiction
and
scarcely
of
being
heard
least
of
all
have
they
a
real
scientific
value
hence
we
call
them
stupid
and
look
at
them
as
dreary
jokes
but
it
is
in
fact
easier
to
set
them
aside
than
to
refute
them
we
let
ordinary
speech
pass
and
are
content
with
it
so
long
as
everyone
knows
what
the
other
means
when
this
is
not
sowe
trust
that
god
understands
us
but
these
sophisms
seem
in
a
way
to
mislead
common
speech
for
they
show
the
contradictory
and
unsatisfactory
nature
of
it
when
taken
strictly
as
it
is
spoken
to
confuse
ordinary
language
so
that
we
do
not
know
how
to
reply
seems
foolish
as
leading
to
formal
contradictions
and
if
it
is
done
we
are
blamed
for
taking
mere
empty
words
and
playing
upon
them
our
german
seriousness
therefore
dismisses
this
play
on
words
as
shallow
wit
but
the
greeks
honoured
the
word
in
itself
and
the
mere
treatment
of
a
proposition
as
well
as
the
matter
and
if
word
and
thing
are
in
opposition
the
word
is
the
higher
for
the
unexpressed
thing
is
really
irrational
since
the
rational
exists
as
speech
alone
it
is
in
aristotle
and
in
his
sophistical
elenchi
that
we
first
find
numerous
examples
of
these
contradictions
coming
from
the
old
sophists
equally
with
the
eristics
and
also
their
solutions
eubulides
therefore
likewise
wrote
against
aristotle149
but
none
of
this
has
come
down
to
us
in
plato
we
also
find
as
we
saw
before
p
370
similar
jokes
and
ambiguities
mentioned
to
make
the
sophists
ridiculous
and
to
show
with
what
insignificant
matters
they
took
up
their
time
the
eristics
went
yet
further
for
they
like
diodorus
became
jesters
to
courts
such
as
to
that
of
the
ptolemies150
from
historic
facts
we
see
that
this
dialectic
operation
of
confusing
others
and
showing
how
to
extricate
them
again
was
a
general
amusement
of
the
greek
philosophers
both
in
public
places
and
at
the
tables
of
kings
just
as
the
queen
of
the
east
came
to
solomon
to
put
riddles
to
him
we
find
at
the
tables
of
kings
witty
conversation
and
assemblages
of
philosophers
joking
and
making
merry
over
one
another
the
greeks
were
quite
enamoured
of
discovering
contradictions
met
with
in
speech
and
in
ordinary
ideas
the
contradiction
does
not
make
its
appearance
as
a
pure
contradiction
in
the
conception
but
only
as
interwoven
with
concrete
ideas
such
propositions
neither
apply
to
the
concrete
content
nor
to
the
pure
notion
subject
and
predicate
of
which
every
proposition
consists
are
different
but
in
the
ordinary
idea
we
signify
their
unity
this
simple
unity
which
does
not
contradict
itself
is
to
ordinary
ideas
the
truth
but
in
fact
the
simple
selfidentical
proposition
is
an
unmeaning
tautology
for
in
any
affirmation
differences
are
present
and
because
their
diversity
comes
to
consciousness
there
is
contradiction
but
the
ordinary
consciousness
is
then
at
an
end
for
only
where
there
is
a
contradiction
is
there
the
solution
selfabrogation
ordinary
consciousness
has
not
the
conception
that
only
the
unity
of
opposites
is
the
truththat
in
every
statement
there
is
truth
and
falsehood
if
truth
is
to
be
taken
in
the
sense
of
the
simple
and
falsehood
in
the
sense
of
the
opposed
and
contradictory
in
it
the
positive
the
first
unity
and
the
negative
this
last
opposition
fall
asunder
in
eubulides
propositions
the
main
point
was
that
because
the
truth
is
simple
a
simple
answer
is
required
that
thus
the
answer
should
not
as
happened
in
aristotle
de
sophist
elench
c
24
have
regard
to
certain
special
considerations
and
after
all
this
is
really
the
demand
of
the
understanding
thus
the
mistake
is
to
desire
an
answer
of
yes
or
no
for
since
no
one
ventures
on
either
perplexity
ensues
because
it
is
a
fools
part
not
to
know
what
to
reply
the
simplicity
of
the
truth
is
thus
grasped
as
the
principle
with
us
this
appears
in
the
form
of
making
such
statements
as
that
one
of
opposites
is
true
the
other
false
that
a
statement
is
either
true
or
not
true
that
an
object
cannot
have
two
opposite
predicates
that
is
the
first
principle
of
the
understanding
the
principium
exclusi
tertii
which
is
of
great
importance
in
all
the
sciences
this
stands
in
close
connection
with
the
principle
of
socrates
and
plato
supra
pp
455
456
the
true
is
the
universal
which
is
abstractly
the
identity
of
understanding
according
to
which
what
is
said
to
be
true
cannot
contradict
itself
this
comes
more
clearly
to
light
in
stilpo
p
464
the
megarics
thus
kept
to
this
principle
of
our
logic
of
the
understanding
in
demanding
the
form
of
identity
for
the
truth
now
in
the
cases
that
they
put
they
did
not
keep
to
the
universal
but
sought
examples
in
ordinary
conception
by
means
of
which
they
perplexed
people
and
this
they
formed
into
a
kind
of
system
we
shall
bring
forward
some
examples
that
are
preserved
to
us
some
are
more
important
but
others
are
insignificant

one
elench
was
called
the
liar

in
it
the
question
is
put
if
a
man
acknowledges
that
he
lies
does
he
lie
or
speak
the
truth151
a
simple
answer
is
demanded
for
the
simple
whereby
the
other
is
excluded
is
held
to
be
the
true
if
it
is
said
that
he
tells
the
truth
this
contradicts
the
content
of
his
utterance
for
he
confesses
that
he
lies
but
if
it
is
asserted
that
he
lies
it
may
be
objected
that
his
confession
is
the
truth
he
thus
both
lies
and
does
not
lie
but
a
simple
answer
cannot
be
given
to
the
question
raised
for
here
we
have
a
union
of
two
opposites
lying
and
truth
and
their
immediate
contradiction
in
different
forms
this
has
at
all
times
come
to
pass
and
has
ever
occupied
the
attention
of
men
chrysippus
a
celebrated
stoic
wrote
six
books
on
the
subject152
and
another
philetas
of
cos
died
in
the
decline
which
he
contracted
through
overstudy
of
these
paradoxes153
we
have
the
same
thing
over
again
when
in
modern
times
we
see
men
worn
out
by
absorbing
themselves
in
the
squaring
of
the
circlea
proposition
which
has
well
nigh
become
immortal
they
seek
a
simple
relation
from
something
incommensurable
ie
they
fall
into
the
error
of
demanding
a
simple
reply
where
the
content
is
contradictory
that
little
history
has
perpetuated
and
reproduced
itself
later
on
in
don
quixote
the
very
same
thing
appears
sancho
governor
of
the
island
of
barataria
was
tested
by
many
insidious
cases
as
he
sat
in
judgment
and
amongst
others
with
the
following
in
his
domain
there
was
a
bridge
which
a
rich
man
had
erected
for
the
good
of
passengersbut
with
a
gallows
close
by
the
crossing
of
the
bridge
was
restricted
by
the
condition
that
everyone
must
say
truly
where
he
was
going
and
if
he
lied
he
would
be
hung
upon
the
gallows
now
one
man
came
to
the
bridge
and
to
the
question
whither
he
went
answered
that
he
had
come
here
to
be
hung
on
the
gallows
the
bridgekeepers
were
much
puzzled
by
this
for
if
they
hanged
him
he
would
have
spoken
the
truth
and
ought
to
have
passed
but
if
he
crossed
he
would
have
spoken
an
untruth
in
this
difficulty
they
applied
to
the
wisdom
of
the
governor
who
uttered
the
wise
saying
that
in
such
dubious
cases
the
mildest
measures
should
be
adopted
and
thus
the
man
should
be
allowed
to
pass
sancho
did
not
break
his
head
over
the
matter
the
result
which
the
statement
was
to
have
is
made
its
content
with
the
condition
that
the
opposite
of
the
content
should
be
the
consequence
hanging
understanding
it
to
be
truly
expressed
should
not
have
hanging
as
result
nonhanging
as
an
event
should
on
the
other
hand
have
hanging
as
result
thus
death
is
made
the
consequence
of
suicide
but
by
suicide
death
itself
is
made
into
the
content
of
the
crime
and
cannot
thus
be
the
punishment
i
will
give
another
similar
example
along
with
the
answer
menedemus
was
asked
whether
he
had
ceased
to
beat
his
father
this
was
an
attempt
to
place
him
in
a
difficulty
since
to
answer
either
yes
or
no
would
be
equally
risky
for
if
he
said
yes
then
he
once
beat
him
and
if
no
then
he
still
beats
him
menedemus
hence
replied
that
he
neither
ceased
to
beat
him
nor
had
beaten
him
and
with
this
his
opponents
were
not
satisfied154
through
this
answer
which
is
twosided
the
one
alternative
as
well
as
the
other
being
set
aside
the
question
is
in
fact
answered
and
this
is
also
so
in
the
former
question
as
to
whether
the
man
spoke
truly
who
said
he
lied
when
the
reply
is
made
he
speaks
the
truth
and
lies
at
the
same
time
and
the
truth
is
this
contradiction
but
a
contradiction
is
not
the
true
and
cannot
enter
into
our
ordinary
conceptions
hence
sancho
panza
likewise
set
it
aside
in
his
judgment
if
the
consciousness
of
opposition
is
present
our
ordinary
ideas
keep
the
contradictory
sides
apart
but
in
fact
the
contradiction
appears
in
sensuous
things
such
as
space
time
c
and
has
in
them
only
to
be
demonstrated
these
sophisms
thus
not
only
appear
to
be
contradictory
but
are
so
in
truth
this
choice
between
two
opposites
which
is
set
before
us
in
the
example
is
itself
a
contradiction

the
concealed
one

and
the
electra155
proceed
from
the
contradiction
of
knowing
and
not
knowing
someone
at
the
same
time
i
ask
someone
do
you
know
your
father
he
replies
yes
i
then
ask
now
if
i
show
you
someone
hidden
behind
a
screen
will
you
know
him
no
but
it
is
your
father
and
thus
you
do
not
know
your
father
it
is
the
same
in
the
electra
can
it
be
said
that
she
knows
her
brother
orestes
who
stands
before
her
or
not
these
twists
and
turns
seem
superficial
but
it
is
interesting
to
consider
them
further

to
know
means
on
the
one
hand
to
have
someone
as
this
one
and
not
vaguely
and
in
general
the
son
thus
knows
his
father
when
he
sees
him
ie
when
he
is
a
this
for
him
but
hidden
he
is
not
a
this
for
him
but
a
this
abrogated
the
hidden
one
as
a
this
in
ordinary
conception
becomes
a
general
and
loses
his
sensuous
being
thereby
is
in
fact
not
a
true
this
the
contradiction
that
the
son
both
knows
and
does
not
know
his
father
thus
becomes
dissolved
through
the
further
qualification
that
the
son
knows
the
father
as
a
sensuous
this
and
not
as
a
this
of
idea

on
the
other
hand
electra
knows
orestes
not
as
a
sensuous
this
but
in
her
own
idea
the
this
of
idea
and
the
this
here
are
not
the
same
to
her
in
this
way
there
enters
into
these
histories
the
higher
opposition
of
the
universal
and
of
the
this
in
as
far
as
to
have
in
the
ordinary
idea
means
in
the
element
of
the
universal
the
abrogated
this
is
not
only
an
idea
but
has
its
truth
in
the
universal
the
universal
is
thus
found
in
the
unity
of
opposites
and
thus
it
is
in
this
development
of
philosophy
the
true
existence
in
which
the
sensuous
being
of
the
this
is
negated
it
is
the
consciousness
of
this
in
particular
which
as
we
shall
soon
see
p
465
is
indicated
by
stilpo

other
quibbles
of
the
same
kind
have
more
meaning
like
the
arguments
which
are
called
the
sorites

and
the
bald
156
both
are
related
to
the
false
infinite
and
the
quantitative
progression
which
can
reach
no
qualitative
opposite
and
yet
at
the
end
finds
itself
at
a
qualitative
absolute
opposite
the
bald
head
is
the
reverse
of
the
problem
of
the
sorites
it
is
asked
does
one
grain
of
corn
make
a
heap
or
does
one
hair
less
make
a
bald
head
the
reply
is
no
nor
one
again
no
it
does
not
this
question
is
now
always
repeated
while
a
grain
is
always
added
or
a
hair
taken
away
when
at
last
it
is
said
that
there
is
a
heap
or
a
bald
head
it
is
found
that
the
last
added
grain
or
last
abstracted
hair
has
made
the
heap
or
the
baldness
and
this
was
at
first
denied
but
how
can
a
grain
form
a
heap
which
already
consists
of
so
many
grains
the
assertion
is
that
one
grain
does
not
make
a
heap
the
contradiction
that
one
thus
added
or
taken
away
brings
about
the
change
into
the
oppositethe
many
for
to
repeat
one
is
just
to
obtain
many
the
repetition
causes
certain
many
grains
to
come
together
the
one
thus
becomes
its
oppositea
heap
and
the
taking
of
one
away
brings
about
baldness
one
and
a
heap
are
opposed
to
one
another
but
yet
one
or
the
quantitative
progression
seems
not
to
change
but
merely
to
increase
or
diminish
yet
at
last
it
has
passed
into
its
opposite
we
always
separate
quality
and
quantity
from
one
another
and
only
accept
in
the
many
a
quantitative
difference
but
this
indifferent
distinction
of
number
or
size
here
turns
finally
into
qualitative
distinction
just
as
an
infinitely
small
or
infinitely
great
greatness
is
no
longer
greatness
at
all
this
characteristic
of
veering
round
is
of
the
greatest
importance
although
it
does
not
come
directly
before
our
consciousness
to
give
one
penny
or
one
shilling
is
said
to
be
nothing
but
with
all
its
insignificance
the
purse
becomes
emptied
which
is
a
very
qualitative
difference
or
if
water
is
always
more
and
more
heated
it
suddenly
at
80
reamur
turns
into
steam
the
dialectic
of
this
passing
into
one
another
of
quantity
and
quality
is
what
our
understanding
does
not
recognize
it
is
certain
that
qualitative
is
not
quantitative
and
quantitative
not
qualitative
in
those
examples
which
seem
like
jokes
there
is
in
this
way
genuine
reflection
on
the
thoughtdeterminations
which
are
in
question
the
examples
which
aristotle
brings
forward
in
his
elenchi
all
show
a
very
formal
contradiction
appearing
in
speech
since
even
in
it
the
individual
is
taken
into
the
universal
who
is
that
it
is
coriscus
is
coriscus
not
masculine
yes
that
is
neuter
sex
and
thus
coriscus
is
said
to
be
neuter157

thou

a

that
is
what
plato
as
we
already
mentioned

made
a

say
it
is
the
wit
of
a
journeyman
such
as
we
find
in
eulenspiegel
aristotle
is
really
at
great
pains
to
remove
the
confusion
for
he
says
the
thy
and
the
father
are
only
accidentally



and
not
in
substance

to
one
another
in
the
invention
of
such
witticisms
the
greeks
of
that
and
of
later
times
were
quite
indefatigable
with
the
sceptics
we
shall
later
on
see
the
dialectic
side
further
developed

brought
to
a
higher
standpoint

and
when
anyone
said
that
they
admired
him
like

he
replied
no
but
like
a
true
man158
with
stilpo
it
was
preeminently
true
that
the
universal
was
taken
in
the
sense
of
the
formal
abstract
identity
of
the
understanding
the
main
point
in
his
examples
is
however
always
the
fact
of
his
having
given
prominence
to
the
form
of
universality
as
opposed
to
the
particular

diogenes
ii

first
quotes
from
him
in
relation
to
the
opposition
of
the
this
and
the
universal
whoever
speaks
of
any
man


speaks
of
no
one
for
he
neither
speaks
of
this
one
nor
that
for
why
should
it
rather
be
of
this
one
than
that
hence
it
is
not
of
this
one
that
man
is
the
universal
and
that
no
one
is
specially
indicated
everyone
readily
acknowledges
but
some
one
still
remains
present
to
us
in
our
conception
but
stilpo
says
that
the
this
does
not
exist
at
all
and
cannot
be
expressedthat
the
universal
only
exists
diogenes
lartius
certainly
understands
this
as
though
stilpo
abolished
distinction
of
genera




and
tennemann
vol
ii
p
158
supports
him
but
from
what
is
quoted
from
him
the
opposite
may
clearly
be
deducedthat
he
upheld
the
universal
and
did
away
with
the
individual
and
the
fact
that
the
form
of
universality
is
maintained
is
further
expressed
in
a
number
of
anecdotes
which
are
taken
by
stilpo
from
common
life
thus
he
says
the
cabbage
is
not
what
is
here
shown






for
the
cabbage
has
existed
for
many
thousand
years
and
hence
this
what
is
seen
is
not
cabbage
ie
the
universal
only
is
and
this
cabbage
is
not
if
i
say
this
cabbage
i
say
quite
another
thing
from
what
i
mean
for
i
say
all
other
cabbages
an
anecdote
is
told
in
the
same
reference
he
was
conversing
with
crates
a
cynic
and
broke
off
to
buy
some
fish
crates
said
what
you
would
avoid
the
question
for
even
in
ordinary
life
anyone
is
laughed
at
or
thought
stupid
who
is
unable
to
reply
and
here
where
the
subject
was
so
important
and
where
it
would
seem
better
to
reply
anything
than
nothing
at
all
no
answer
was
forthcoming
stilpo
replied
by
no
means
for
i
have
the
conversation
but
i
leave
you
since
the
conversation
remains
but
the
fish
will
be
sold
what
is
indicated
in
these
simple
examples
seems
trivial
because
the
matter
is
trivial
but
in
other
forms
it
seems
important
enough
to
be
the
subject
of
further
inquiry
that
the
universal
should
in
philosophy
be
given
a
place
of
such
importance
that
only
the
universal
can
be
expressed
and
the
this
which
is
meant
cannot
indicates
a
state
of
consciousness
and
thought
which
the
philosophic
culture
of
our
time
has
not
yet
reached
as
regards
the
ordinary
human
understanding
or
the
scepticism
of
our
times
or
in
general
the
philosophy
which
asserts
that
sensuous
certainty
that
which
we
see
hear
c
is
the
truth
or
else
that
it
is
true
that
there
are
sensuous
things
outside
of
usas
to
these
nothing
so
far
as
the
reasons
for
disbelieving
them
are
concerned
need
be
said
for
because
the
direct
assertion
that
the
immediate
is
the
true
is
made
such
statements
only
require
to
be
taken
with
respect
to
what
they
say
and
they
will
always
be
found
to
say
something
different
from
what
they
mean
what
strikes
us
most
is
that
they
cannot
say
what
they
mean
for
if
they
say
the
sensuous
this
is
a
universal
it
is
all
that
is
sensuous
a
negative
of
the
this
or
this
is
all
these
thought
contains
only
the
universal
the
this
is
only
in
thought
if
i
say
this
it
is
the
most
universal
of
all
for
example
here
is
that
which
i
show
now
i
speak
but
here
and
now
is
all
here
and
now
similarly
when
i
say
i
i
mean
myself
this
individual
separated
from
all
others
but
i
am
even
thus
that
which
is
thought
of
and
cannot
express
the
self
which
i
mean
at
all
i
is
an
absolute
expression
which
excludes
every
other
i
but
everyone
says
i
of
himself
for
everyone
is
an
i
if
we
ask
who
is
there
the
answer
i
indicates
every
i
the
individual
also
is
thus
the
universal
only
for
in
the
word
as
an
existence
born
of
the
mind
the
individual
if
it
is
meant
cannot
find
a
place
since
actually
only
the
universal
is
expressed
if
i
would
distinguish
myself
and
establish
my
individuality
by
my
age
my
place
of
birth
through
what
i
have
done
and
where
i
have
been
or
am
at
a
particular
time
it
is
the
same
thing
i
am
now
so
many
years
old
but
this
very
now
which
i
say
is
all
now
if
i
count
from
a
particular
period
such
as
the
birth
of
christ
this
epoch
is
again
only
fixed
by
the
now
which
is
ever
displaced
i
am
now
thirtyfive
years
old
and
now
is
1805
ad
each
period
is
fixed
only
through
the
other
but
the
whole
is
undetermined
that
now
1805
years
have
passed
since
christs
birth
is
a
truth
which
soon
will
become
empty
sound
and
the
determinateness
of
the
now
has
a
before
and
after
of
determinations
without
beginning
or
end
similarly
everyone
is
at
a
herethis
here
for
everyone
is
in
a
here
this
is
the
nature
of
universality
which
makes
itself
evident
in
speech
we
hence
help
ourselves
through
names
with
which
we
define
perfectly
anything
individual
but
we
allow
that
we
have
not
expressed
the
thing
in
itself
the
name
as
name
is
no
expression
which
contains
what
i
am
it
is
a
symbol
and
indeed
a
contingent
symbol
of
the
lively
recollection

inasmuch
as
stilpo
expressed
the
universal
as
the
independent
he
disintegrated
everything
simplicius
says
in
phys
arist
p
26
since
the
socalled
megarics
took
it
as
ascertained
that
what
has
different
determinations
is
different






and
that
the
diverse
are
separated
one
from
the
other




they
seemed
to
prove
that
each
thing
is
separated
from
itself




hence
since
the
musical
socrates
is
another
determination

from
the
wise
socrates
socrates
was
separated
from
himself
that
means
that
because
the
qualities
of
things
are
determinations
for
themselves
each
of
these
is
fixed
independently
but
yet
the
thing
is
an
aggregate
of
many
independent
universalities
stilpo
asserted
this
now
because
according
to
him
universal
determinations
are
in
their
separation
only
the
true
reality
and
the
individual
is
the
unseparated
unity
of
different
ideas
to
him
nothing
individual
has
any
truth

it
is
very
remarkable
that
this
form
of
identity
came
to
be
known
in
stilpo
and
he
in
this
way
only
wished
to
know
propositions
identically
expressed
plutarch
quotes
from
him
a
different
predicate
may
in
no
case
be
attributed
to
any
object




thus
we
could
not
say
that
the
man
is
good
or
the
man
is
a
general
but
simply
that
man
is
only
man
good
is
only
good
the
general
is
only
the
general
nor
could
we
say
ten
thousand
knights
but
knights
are
only
knights
ten
thousand
are
only
ten
thousand
c
when

horse

are
distinct
when
we
are
asked
for
a
definition
of
either

do
not
give
the

for

the
cyrenaic
school
the
cyrenaics
took
their
name
from
aristippus
of
cyrene
in
africa
the
originator
and
head
of
the
school
just
as
socrates
wished
to
develop
himself
as
an
individual
his
disciples
or
those
of
the
cyrenaic
and
cynic
schools
made
individual
life
and
practical
philosophy
their
main
object
now
if
the
cyrenaics
did
not
rest
content
with
the
determination
of
good
in
general
seeing
that
they
inclined
to
place
it
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
individual
the
cynics
appear
to
be
opposed
to
the
whole
doctrine
for
they
expressed
the
particular
content
of
satisfaction
as
natural
desires
in
a
determination
of
negativity
with
regard
to
what
is
done
by
others
but
as
the
cyrenaics
thereby
satisfied
their
particular
subjectivity
so
also
did
the
cynics
and
both
schools
have
hence
on
the
whole
the
same
endthe
freedom
and
independence
of
the
individual
because
we
are
accustomed
to
consider
happiness
which
the
cyrenaics
made
the
highest
end
of
man
to
be
contentless
because
we
obtain
it
in
a
thousand
ways
and
it
may
be
the
result
of
most
various
causes
this
principle
appears
at
first
to
us
as
trivial
and
indeed
generally
speaking
it
is
so
we
are
likewise
accustomed
to
believe
that
there
is
something
higher
than
pleasure
the
philosophic
development
of
this
principle
which
for
the
rest
has
not
much
in
it
is
mainly
ascribed
to
aristippus
follower
aristippus
the
younger
but
theodorus
hegesias
and
anniceris
of
the
later
cyrenaics
are
specially
mentioned
as
having
scientifically
worked
out
the
aristippian
principle
until
it
degenerated
and
merged
into
epicureanism
but
the
consideration
of
the
further
progress
of
the
cyrenaic
principle
is
specially
interesting
because
this
progression
in
the
essential
nature
of
things
is
carried
quite
beyond
the
principle
and
has
really
abrogated
it
feeling
is
the
indeterminate
individual
but
if
thought
reflection
mental
culture
are
given
a
place
in
this
principle
through
the
principle
of
the
universality
of
thought
that
principle
of
contingency
individuality
mere
subjectivity
disappears
and
the
only
really
remarkable
thing
in
this
school
is
that
this
greater
consistency
in
the
universal
is
therefore
an
inconsistency
as
regards
the
principle
a
aristippus
aristippus
went
about
with
socrates
for
a
long
time
and
educated
himself
under
him
although
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
strong
and
highly
cultivated
man
before
he
sought
out
socrates
at
all
he
heard
of
him
either
in
cyrene
or
at
the
olympian
games
which
as
greeks
the
cyrenians
likewise
visited
his
father
was
a
merchant
and
he
himself
came
to
athens
on
a
journey
which
had
commerce
as
its
object
he
was
first
amongst
the
socratics
to
ask
money
of
those
whom
he
instructed
he
also
sent
money
to
socrates
who
however
returned
it160
he
did
not
content
himself
with
the
general
expressions
good
and
beautiful
to
which
socrates
adhered
but
took
existence
reflected
in
consciousness
in
its
extreme
determinateness
as
individuality
and
because
universal
existence
as
thought
was
to
him
from
the
side
of
reality
individual
consciousness
he
fixed
on
enjoyment
as
the
only
thing
respecting
which
man
had
rationally
to
concern
himself
the
character
and
personality
of
aristippus
is
what
is
most
important
and
what
is
preserved
to
us
in
his
regard
is
his
manner
and
life
rather
than
his
philosophic
doctrines
he
sought
after
enjoyment
as
a
man
of
culture
who
in
that
very
way
had
raised
himself
into
perfect
indifference
to
all
that
is
particular
all
passions
and
bonds
of
every
kind
when
pleasure
is
made
the
principle
we
immediately
have
the
idea
before
us
that
in
its
enjoyment
we
are
dependent
and
that
enjoyment
is
thus
opposed
to
the
principle
of
freedom
but
neither
of
the
cyrenaic
teaching
nor
the
epicurean
whose
principle
is
on
the
whole
the
same
can
this
be
stated
for
by
itself
the
end
of
enjoyment
may
well
be
said
to
be
a
principle
in
opposition
to
philosophy
but
when
it
is
considered
in
such
a
way
that
the
cultivation
of
thought
is
made
the
only
condition
under
which
enjoyment
can
be
attained
perfect
freedom
of
spirit
is
retained
since
it
is
inseparable
from
culture
aristippus
certainly
esteemed
culture
at
its
highest
and
proceeded
from
this
positionthat
pleasure
is
only
a
principle
for
men
of
philosophic
culture
his
main
principle
thus
was
that
what
is
found
to
be
pleasant
is
not
known
immediately
but
only
by
reflection
aristippus
lived
in
accordance
with
these
principles
and
what
in
him
interests
us
most
is
the
number
of
anecdotes
told
about
him
because
they
contain
traces
of
a
mentally
rich
and
free
disposition
since
in
his
life
he
went
about
to
seek
enjoyment
not
without
understanding
and
thereby
he
was
in
his
way
a
philosopher
he
sought
it
partly
with
the
discretion
which
does
not
yield
itself
to
a
momentary
happiness
because
a
greater
evil
springs
therefrom
and
partly
as
if
philosophy
were
merely
preservation
from
anxiety
without
that
anxiety
which
on
every
side
fears
possible
evil
and
bad
results
but
above
all
without
any
dependence
on
things
and
without
resting
on
anything
which
is
itself
of
a
changeable
nature
he
enjoyed
says
diogenes
the
pleasures
of
the
moment
without
troubling
himself
with
those
which
were
not
present
he
suited
himself
to
every
condition
being
at
home
in
all
he
remained
the
same
whether
he
were
in
regal
courts
or
in
the
most
miserable
conditions
plato
is
said
to
have
told
him
that
it
was
given
to
him
alone
to
wear
the
purple
and
the
rags
he
was
specially
attached
to
dionysius
being
very
popular
with
him
he
certainly
clung
to
him
but
always
retained
complete
independence
diogenes
the
cynic
for
this
reason
called
him
the
royal
dog
when
he
demanded
fifty
drachms
from
someone
who
wished
to
hand
over
to
him
his
son
and
the
man
found
the
sum
too
high
saying
that
he
could
buy
a
slave
for
it
aristippus
answered
do
so
and
you
will
have
two
when
socrates
asked
him
how
do
you
have
so
much
money
he
replied
how
do
you
have
so
little
when
a
courtesan
said
to
him
that
she
had
a
child
by
him
he
replied
you
know
as
little
whether
it
is
mine
as
were
you
walking
through
briars
would
you
know
which
thorn
pricked
you
a
proof
of
his
perfect
indifference
is
given
in
the
following
when
dionysius
once
spat
at
him
he
bore
it
patiently
and
when
blamed
said
the
fishermen
let
themselves
be
wet
by
the
sea
to
catch
the
little
fish
and
i
should
i
not
bear
this
to
catch
such
a
good
one
when
dionysius
asked
him
to
choose
one
of
three
courtesans
he
took
them
all
with
him
observing
that
it
had
been
a
dangerous
thing
even
to
paris
to
choose
out
one
but
after
leading
them
to
the
vestibule
of
the
house
he
let
all
three
go
he
made
nothing
of
the
possession
of
money
as
contrasted
with
the
results
which
appear
to
follow
from
pursuing
pleasure
and
hence
he
wasted
it
on
dainties
he
once
bought
a
partridge
at
fifty
drachms
about
twenty
florins
when
someone
rebuked
him
he
asked
would
you
not
buy
it
for
a
farthing
and
when
this
was
acknowleged
he
answered
now
fifty
drachms
are
no
more
than
that
to
me
similarly
in
journeying
in
africa
the
slave
thought
it
hard
to
be
troubled
with
a
sum
of
money
when
aristippus
knew
this
he
said
throw
away
what
is
too
much
and
carry
what
you
can
as
regards
the
value
of
culture
he
replied
to
the
question
as
to
how
an
educated
man
differs
from
an
uneducated
that
a
stone
would
not
fit
in
with
the
other
ie
the
difference
is
as
great
as
that
of
a
man
from
the
stone
this
is
not
quite
wrong
for
man
is
what
he
ought
to
be
as
man
through
culture
it
is
his
second
nature
through
which
he
first
enters
into
possession
of
that
which
he
has
by
nature
and
thus
for
the
first
time
he
is
mind
we
may
not
however
think
in
this
way
of
our
uncultured
men
for
with
us
such
men
through
the
whole
of
their
conditions
through
customs
and
religion
partake
of
a
source
of
culture
which
places
them
far
above
those
who
do
not
live
in
such
conditions
those
who
carry
on
other
sciences
and
neglect
philosophy
aristippus
compares
to
the
wooers
of
penelope
in
the
odyssey
who
might
easily
have
melantho
and
the
other
maidens
but
who
could
not
obtain
the
queen161
the
teaching
of
aristippus
and
his
followers
is
very
simple
for
he
took
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
existence
in
its
most
superficial
and
its
earliest
form
and
expressed
existence
as
being
as
it
is
immediately
for
consciousness
ie
as
feeling
simply
a
distinction
is
now
made
between
the
true
the
valid
what
exists
in
and
for
itself
and
the
practical
and
good
and
what
ought
to
be
our
end
but
in
regard
to
both
the
theoretic
and
practical
truth
the
cyrenaics
make
sensation
what
determines
hence
their
principle
is
more
accurately
not
the
objective
itself
but
the
relation
of
consciousness
to
the
objective
the
truth
is
not
what
is
in
sensation
the
content
but
is
itself
sensation
it
is
not
objective
but
the
objective
subsists
only
in
it
thus
the
cyrenaics
say
sensations
form
the
real
criterion
they
alone
can
be
known
and
are
infallible
but
what
produces
feeling
is
neither
knowable
nor
infallible
thus
when
we
perceive
a
white
and
sweet
we
may
assert
this
condition
as
ours
with
truth
and
certainty
but
that
the
causes
of
these
feelings
are
themselves
a
white
and
sweet
object
we
cannot
with
certainty
affirm
what
these
men
say
about
ends
is
also
in
harmony
with
this
for
sensations
also
extend
to
ends
the
sensations
are
either
pleasant
or
unpleasant
or
neither
of
the
two
now
they
call
the
unpleasant
feelings
the
bad
the
end
of
which
is
pain
the
pleasant
is
the
good
whose
invariable
end
is
happiness
thus
feelings
are
the
criteria
of
knowledge
and
the
ends
for
action
we
live
because
we
follow
them
from
testimony

received
and
satisfaction

experienced
the
former
in
accordance
with
theoretic
intuitions




and
the
latter
with
what
gives
us
pleasure162
that
is
to
say
as
end
feeling
is
no
longer
a
promiscuous
variety
of
sensuous
affections



but
the
setting
up
of
the
notion
as
the
positive
or
negative
relation
to
the
object
of
action
which
is
just
the
pleasant
or
the
unpleasant
here
we
enter
on
a
new
sphere
where
two
kinds
of
determinations
constitute
the
chief
points
of
interest
these
are
everywhere
treated
of
in
the
many
socratic
schools
which
were
being
formed
and
though
not
by
plato
and
aristotle
they
were
specially
so
by
the
stoics
the
new
academy
c
that
is
to
say
the
one
point
is
determination
itself
in
general
the
criterion
and
the
second
is
what
determination
for
the
subject
is
and
thus
the
idea
of
the
wise
man
resultswhat
the
wise
do
who
the
wise
are
c
the
reason
that
these
two
expressions
are
now
so
prominent
is
one
which
rests
on
what
has
gone
before
on
the
one
hand
the
main
interest
is
to
find
a
content
for
the
good
for
else
men
may
talk
about
it
for
years
this
further
definition
of
the
good
is
just
the
criterion
on
the
other
hand
the
interest
of
the
subject
appears
and
that
is
the
result
of
the
revolution
in
the
greek
mind
made
by
socrates
when
the
religion
constitution
laws
of
a
people
are
held
in
esteem
and
when
the
individual
members
of
a
people
are
one
with
them
the
question
of
what
the
individual
has
to
do
on
his
own
account
will
not
be
put
in
a
moralized
religious
condition
of
things
we
are
likely
to
find
the
end
of
man
in
what
is
present
and
these
morals
religion
and
laws
are
also
present
in
him
when
on
the
contrary
the
individual
exists
no
longer
in
the
morality
of
his
people
no
longer
has
his
substantial
being
in
the
religion
laws
c
of
his
land
he
no
longer
finds
what
he
desires
and
no
longer
satisfies
himself
in
his
present
but
if
this
discord
has
arisen
the
individual
must
immerse
himself
in
himself
and
there
seek
his
end
now
this
is
really
the
cause
that
the
question
of
what
is
the
essential
for
the
individual
arises
after
what
end
must
he
form
himself
and
after
what
strive
thus
an
ideal
for
the
individual
is
set
up
and
this
is
the
wise
man
what
was
called
the
ideal
of
the
wise
man
is
the
individuality
of
selfconsciousness
which
is
conceived
of
as
universal
essence
the
point
of
view
is
the
same
when
we
now
ask
what
can
i
know
what
should
i
believe
what
ought
i
to
hope
what
is
the
highest
interest
of
the
subject
it
is
not
what
is
truth
right
the
universal
end
of
the
world
for
instead
of
asking
about
the
science
of
the
implicitly
and
explicitly
objective
the
question
is
what
is
true
and
right
in
as
far
as
it
is
the
insight
and
conviction
of
the
individual
his
end
and
a
mode
of
his
existence
this
talk
about
wise
men
is
universal
amongst
the
stoics
epicureans
c
but
is
devoid
of
meaning
for
the
wise
man
is
not
in
question
but
the
wisdom
of
the
universe
real
reason
a
third
definition
is
that
the
universal
is
the
good
the
real
side
of
things
is
enjoyment
and
happiness
as
a
simple
existence
and
immediate
actuality
how
then
do
the
two
agree
the
philosophic
schools
which
now
arise
and
their
successors
have
set
forth
the
harmony
of
both
determinations
which
are
the
higher
being
and
thought
b
theodorus
of
the
later
cyrenaics
theodorus
must
be
mentioned
first
he
is
famous
for
having
denied
the
existence
of
the
gods
and
being
for
this
reason
banished
from
athens
such
a
fact
can
however
have
no
further
interest
or
speculative
significance
for
the
positive
gods
which
theodorus
denied
are
themselves
not
any
object
of
speculative
reason
he
made
himself
remarkable
besides
for
introducing
the
universal
more
into
the
idea
of
that
which
was
existence
for
consciousness
for
he
made
joy
and
sorrow
the
end
but
in
such
a
way
that
the
former
pertained
to
the
understanding
and
the
latter
to
want
of
understanding
he
defined
the
good
as
understanding
and
justice
and
the
bad
as
the
opposite
enjoyment
and
pain
however
were
indifferent163
when
we
reach
the
consciousness
that
the
individual
sensuous
feeling
as
it
is
immediately
is
not
to
be
considered
as
real
existence
it
is
then
said
that
it
must
be
accepted
with
understanding
ie
feeling
just
as
it
is
is
not
reality
for
the
sensuous
generally
as
sensation
theoretic
or
practical
is
something
quite
indeterminate
this
or
that
unit
a
criticism
of
this
unit
is
hence
required
ie
it
must
be
considered
in
the
form
of
universality
and
hence
this
last
necessarily
reappears
but
this
advance
on
individuality
is
culture
which
through
the
limitation
of
individual
feelings
and
enjoyments
tries
to
make
these
harmonious
even
though
it
first
of
all
only
calculates
as
to
that
by
which
the
greater
pleasure
is
to
be
found
now
to
the
question
as
to
which
of
the
many
enjoyments
which
i
as
a
manysided
man
can
enjoy
is
the
one
which
is
in
completest
harmony
with
me
and
in
which
i
thus
find
the
greatest
satisfaction
it
must
be
replied
that
the
completest
harmony
with
me
is
only
found
in
the
accordance
of
my
particular
existence
and
consciousness
with
my
actual
substantial
being
theodorus
comprehended
this
as
understanding
and
justice
in
which
we
know
where
to
seek
enjoyment
but
when
it
is
said
that
felicity
must
be
sought
by
reflection
we
know
that
these
are
empty
words
and
thoughtless
utterances
for
the
feeling
in
which
felicity
is
contained
is
in
its
conception
the
individual
selfchanging
without
universality
and
subsistence
thus
the
universal
understanding
as
an
empty
form
adheres
to
a
content
quite
incongruous
with
it
and
thus
theodorus
distinguished
the
good
in
its
form
from
the
end
as
the
good
in
its
nature
and
content
c
hegesias
it
is
remarkable
that
another
cyrenaic
hegesias
recognized
this
incongruity
between
sensation
and
universality
which
last
is
opposed
to
the
individual
having
what
is
agreeable
as
well
as
disagreeable
within
itself
because
on
the
whole
he
took
a
firmer
grasp
of
the
universal
and
gave
it
a
larger
place
there
passed
from
him
all
determination
of
individuality
and
with
it
really
the
cyrenaic
principle
it
came
to
his
knowledge
that
individual
sensation
is
in
itself
nothing
and
as
he
nevertheless
made
enjoyment
his
end
it
became
to
him
the
universal
but
if
enjoyment
is
the
end
we
must
ask
about
the
content
if
this
content
is
investigated
we
find
every
content
a
particular
which
is
not
in
conformity
with
the
universal
and
thus
falls
into
dialectic
hegesias
followed
the
cyrenaic
principle
as
far
as
to
this
consequence
of
thought
that
universal
is
contained
in
an
expression
of
his
which
we
often
enough
hear
echoed
there
is
no
perfect
happiness
the
body
is
troubled
with
manifold
pains
and
the
soul
suffers
along
with
it
it
is
hence
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
we
choose
life
or
death
in
itself
nothing
is
pleasant
or
unpleasant
that
is
to
say
the
criterion
of
being
pleasant
or
unpleasant
because
its
universality
is
removed
is
thus
itself
made
quite
indeterminate
and
because
it
has
no
objective
determinateness
in
itself
it
has
become
unmeaning
before
the
universal
which
is
thus
held
secure
the
sum
of
all
determinations
the
individuality
of
consciousness
as
such
disappears
but
with
it
even
life
itself
as
being
unreal
the
rarity
novelty
or
excess
of
enjoyment
begets
in
some
cases
enjoyment
and
in
others
discontent
poverty
and
riches
have
no
meaning
for
what
is
pleasant
since
we
see
that
the
rich
do
not
enjoy
pleasures
more
than
the
poor
similarly
slavery
and
liberty
noble
and
ignoble
birth
fame
and
lack
of
fame
are
equivalent
as
regards
pleasure
only
to
a
fool
can
living
be
a
matter
of
moment
to
the
wise
man
it
is
indifferent
and
he
is
consequently
independent
the
wise
man
acts
only
after
his
own
will
and
he
considers
none
other
equally
worthy
for
even
if
he
attain
from
others
the
greatest
benefits
this
does
not
equal
what
he
gives
himself
hegesias
and
his
friends
also
take
away
sensation
because
it
gives
no
sufficient
knowledge
which
really
amounts
to
scepticism
they
say
further
that
we
ought
to
do
what
we
have
reason
to
believe
is
best
the
sinner
should
be
forgiven
for
no
one
willingly
sins
but
is
conquered
by
a
passion
the
wise
man
does
not
hate
but
instructs
his
endeavours
go
not
so
much
to
the
attainment
of
good
as
to
the
avoidance
of
evil
for
his
aim
is
to
live
without
trouble
and
sorrow164
this
universality
which
proceeds
from
the
principle
of
the
freedom
of
the
individual
selfconsciousness
hegesias
expressed
as
the
condition
of
the
perfect
indifference
of
the
wise
menan
indifference
to
everything
into
which
we
shall
see
all
philosophic
systems
of
the
kind
going
forth
and
which
is
a
surrendering
of
all
reality
the
complete
withdrawal
of
life
into
itself
it
is
told
that
hegesias
who
lived
in
alexandria
was
not
allowed
to
teach
the
ptolemies
of
the
time
because
he
inspired
many
of
his
hearers
with
such
indifference
to
life
that
they
took
their
own165
d
anniceris
we
also
hear
of
anniceris
and
his
followers
who
properly
speaking
departed
from
the
distinctive
character
of
the
principle
of
the
cyrenaic
school
and
thereby
gave
philosophic
culture
quite
another
direction
it
is
said
of
them
that
they
acknowledged
friendship
in
common
life
along
with
gratitude
honour
to
parents
and
service
for
ones
country
and
although
the
wise
man
has
by
so
doing
to
undergo
hardship
and
work
he
can
still
be
happy
even
if
he
therein
obtains
few
pleasures
friendships
are
not
to
be
formed
on
utilitarian
grounds
alone
but
because
of
the
good
will
that
develops
and
out
of
love
to
friends
even
burdens
and
difficulties
are
to
be
undertaken166
the
universal
the
theoretically
speculative
element
in
the
school
is
thus
lost
it
sinks
more
into
what
is
popular
this
is
then
the
second
direction
which
the
cyrenaic
school
has
taken
the
first
was
the
overstepping
of
the
principle
itself
a
method
of
philosophizing
in
morals
arises
which
later
on
prevailed
with
cicero
and
the
peripatetics
of
his
time
but
the
interest
has
disappeared
so
far
as
any
consistent
system
of
thought
is
concerned
3
the
cynic
school
there
is
nothing
particular
to
say
of
the
cynics
for
they
possess
but
little
philosophy
and
they
did
not
bring
what
they
had
into
a
scientific
system
it
was
only
later
that
their
tenets
were
raised
by
the
stoics
into
a
philosophic
discipline
with
the
cynics
as
with
the
cyrenaics
the
point
was
to
determine
what
should
be
the
principle
for
consciousness
both
as
regards
its
knowledge
and
its
actions
the
cynics
also
set
up
the
good
as
a
universal
end
and
asked
in
what
for
individual
men
it
is
to
be
sought
but
if
the
cyrenaic
in
accordance
with
his
determinate
principle
made
the
consciousness
of
himself
as
an
individual
or
feeling
into
real
existence
for
consciousness
the
cynic
took
this
individuality
in
as
far
as
it
has
the
form
of
universality
directly
for
me
ie
in
as
far
as
i
am
a
free
consciousness
indifferent
to
all
individuality
thus
they
are
opposed
to
the
cyrenaics
for
while
to
these
feeling
which
because
it
has
to
be
determined
through
thought
is
undoubtedly
extended
into
universality
and
perfect
freedom
is
made
the
principle
the
former
begin
with
perfect
freedom
and
independence
as
the
property
of
man
but
since
this
is
the
same
indifference
of
selfconsciousness
which
hegesias
expressed
as
real
existence
the
extremes
in
the
cynic
and
cyrenaic
modes
of
thought
destroy
themselves
by
their
own
consequences
and
pass
into
one
another
with
the
cyrenaics
there
is
the
impulse
to
turn
things
back
into
consciousness
according
to
which
nothing
is
real
existence
for
me
the
cynics
had
also
only
to
do
with
themselves
and
the
individual
selfconsciousness
was
likewise
principle
but
the
cynic
at
least
in
the
beginning
set
up
for
the
guidance
of
men
the
principle
of
freedom
and
indifference
both
in
regard
to
thought
and
actual
life
as
against
all
external
individuality
particular
ends
needs
and
enjoyments
so
that
culture
not
only
sought
after
indifference
to
these
and
independence
within
itself
as
with
the
cyrenaics
but
for
express
privation
and
for
the
limitation
of
needs
to
what
is
necessary
and
what
nature
demands
the
cynics
thus
maintained
as
the
content
of
the
good
the
greatest
independence
of
nature
ie
the
slightest
possible
necessities
this
meant
a
rebound
from
enjoyment
and
from
the
pleasures
of
feeling
the
negative
is
here
the
determining
later
on
this
opposition
of
cynics
and
cyrenaics
likewise
appeared
between
stoics
and
epicureans
but
the
same
negation
which
the
cynics
made
their
principle
had
already
shown
itself
in
the
further
development
which
the
cyrenaic
philosophy
had
taken
the
school
of
the
cynics
had
no
scientific
weight
it
only
constitutes
an
element
which
must
necessarily
appear
in
the
knowledge
of
the
universal
and
which
is
that
consciousness
must
know
itself
in
its
individuality
as
free
from
all
dependence
on
things
and
on
enjoyment
to
him
who
relies
upon
riches
or
enjoyment
such
dependence
is
in
fact
real
consciousness
or
his
individuality
is
real
existence
but
the
cynics
so
enforced
that
negative
moment
that
they
placed
freedom
in
actual
renunciation
of
socalled
superfluities
they
only
recognized
this
abstract
unmoving
independence
which
did
not
concern
itself
with
enjoyment
or
the
interests
of
an
ordinary
life
but
true
freedom
does
not
consist
in
flying
from
enjoyment
and
the
occupations
which
have
as
their
concern
other
men
and
other
ends
in
life
but
in
the
fact
that
consciousness
though
involved
in
all
reality
stands
above
it
and
is
free
from
it

antisthenes
an
athenian
and
friend
of
socrates
was
the
first
who
professed
to
be
a
cynic
he
lived
at
athens
and
taught
in
a
gymnasium
called
cynosarges
and
he
was
called
the
simple
dog

his
mother
was
thracian
which
was
often
made
a
reproach
to
hima
reproach
which
to
us
would
be
unmeaning
he
replied
that
the
mother
of
the
gods
was
a
phrygian
and
that
the
athenians
who
make
so
much
of
their
being
native
born
are
in
no
way
nobler
than
the
native
fish
and
grasshoppers
he
educated
himself
under
gorgias
and
socrates
and
went
daily
from
the
pirus
to
the
city
to
hear
socrates
he
wrote
several
works
the
titles
of
which
diogenes
mentions
and
according
to
all
accounts
was
esteemed
a
highly
cultivated
and
upright
man167
antisthenes
principles
are
simple
because
the
content
of
his
teaching
remains
general
it
is
hence
superfluous
to
say
anything
further
about
it
he
gives
general
rules
which
consist
of
such
excellent
maxims
as
that
virtue
is
selfsufficing
and
requires
nothing
more
than
a
socratic
strength
of
character
the
good
is
excellent
the
bad
discreditable
virtue
consists
of
works
and
does
not
require
many
reasons
or
theories
the
end
of
man
is
a
virtuous
life
the
wise
man
is
contented
with
himself
for
he
possesses
everything
that
others
seem
to
possess
his
own
virtue
satisfies
him
he
is
at
home
all
over
the
world
if
he
lacks
fame
this
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
an
evil
but
as
a
good
c168
we
here
once
more
have
the
tedious
talk
about
the
wise
man
which
by
the
stoics
as
also
by
the
epicureans
was
even
more
spun
out
and
made
more
tedious
in
this
ideal
where
the
determination
of
the
subject
is
in
question
its
satisfaction
is
placed
in
simplifying
its
needs
but
when
antisthenes
says
that
virtue
does
not
require
reasons
and
theories
he
forgets
that
he
himself
acquired
through
the
cultivation
of
mind
its
independence
and
the
power
of
renouncing
all
that
men
desire
we
see
directly
that
virtue
has
now
obtained
another
signification
it
no
longer
is
unconscious
virtue
like
the
simple
virtue
of
a
citizen
of
a
free
people
who
fulfils
his
duties
to
fatherland
place
and
family
as
these
relationships
immediately
require
the
consciousness
which
has
gone
beyond
itself
must
in
order
to
become
mind
now
lay
hold
of
and
comprehend
all
reality
ie
be
conscious
of
it
as
its
own
but
conditions
such
as
are
called
by
names
like
innocence
or
beauty
of
soul
are
childish
conditions
which
are
certainly
to
be
praised
in
their
own
place
but
from
which
man
because
he
is
rational
must
come
forth
in
order
to
recreate
himself
from
the
sublated
immediacy
the
freedom
and
independence
of
the
cynics
however
which
consists
only
in
lessening
to
the
utmost
the
burden
imposed
by
wants
is
abstract
because
it
as
negative
in
character
has
really
to
be
a
mere
renunciation
concrete
freedom
consists
in
maintaining
an
indifferent
attitude
towards
necessities
not
avoiding
them
but
in
their
satisfaction
remaining
free
and
abiding
in
morality
and
in
participation
in
the
moral
life
of
man
abstract
freedom
on
the
contrary
surrenders
its
morality
because
the
individual
withdraws
into
his
subjectivity
and
is
consequently
an
element
of
immorality
yet
antisthenes
bears
a
high
place
in
this
cynical
philosophy
but
the
attitude
he
adopted
comes
very
near
to
that
of
rudeness
vulgarity
of
conduct
and
shamelessness
and
later
on
cynicism
passed
into
such
hence
comes
the
continual
mockery
of
and
the
constant
jokes
against
the
cynics
and
it
is
only
their
individual
manners
and
individual
strength
of
character
which
makes
them
interesting
it
is
even
told
of
antisthenes
that
he
began
to
attribute
value
to
external
poverty
of
life
cynicism
adopted
a
simple
wardrobea
thick
stick
of
wild
olive
a
ragged
double
mantle
without
any
under
garment
which
served
as
bed
by
night
a
beggars
sack
for
the
food
that
was
required
and
a
cup
with
which
to
draw
water169
this
was
the
costume
with
which
these
cynics
used
to
distinguish
themselves
that
on
which
they
placed
highest
value
was
the
simplification
of
their
needs
it
seems
very
plausible
to
say
that
this
produces
freedom
for
needs
are
certainly
dependence
upon
nature
and
this
is
antagonistic
to
freedom
of
spirit
the
reduction
of
that
dependence
to
a
minimum
is
thus
an
idea
which
commends
itself
but
at
the
same
time
this
minimum
is
itself
undetermined
and
if
such
stress
is
laid
on
thus
merely
following
nature
it
follows
that
too
great
a
value
is
set
on
the
needs
of
nature
and
on
the
renunciation
of
others
this
is
what
is
also
evident
in
the
monastic
principle
the
negative
likewise
contains
an
affirmative
bias
towards
what
is
renounced
and
the
renunciation
and
the
importance
of
what
is
renounced
is
thus
made
too
marked
socrates
hence
declares
the
clothing
of
the
cynics
to
be
vanity
for
when
antisthenes
turned
outside
a
hole
in
his
cloak
socrates
said
to
him
i
see
thy
vanity
through
the
hole
in
thy
cloak170
clothing
is
not
a
thing
of
rational
import
but
is
regulated
through
needs
that
arise
of
themselves
in
the
north
the
clothing
must
be
different
from
that
in
central
africa
and
in
winter
we
do
not
wear
cotton
garments
anything
further
is
meaningless
and
is
left
to
chance
and
to
opinion
in
modern
times
for
instance
oldfashioned
clothing
had
a
meaning
in
relation
to
patriotism
the
cut
of
my
coat
is
decided
by
fashion
and
the
tailor
sees
to
this
it
is
not
my
business
to
invent
it
for
mercifully
others
have
done
so
for
me
this
dependence
on
custom
and
opinion
is
certainly
better
than
were
it
to
be
on
nature
but
it
is
not
essential
that
men
should
direct
their
understanding
to
this
indifference
is
the
point
of
view
which
must
reign
since
the
thing
itself
is
undoubtedly
perfectly
indifferent
men
are
proud
that
they
can
distinguish
themselves
in
this
and
try
to
make
a
fuss
about
it
but
it
is
folly
to
set
oneself
against
the
fashion
in
this
matter
i
must
hence
not
decide
myself
nor
may
i
draw
it
within
the
radius
of
my
interests
but
simply
do
what
is
expected
of
me
b
diogenes
diogenes
of
sinope
the
best
known
cynic
distinguished
himself
even
more
than
antisthenes
by
the
life
he
led
as
also
by
his
biting
and
often
clever
hits
and
bitter
and
sarcastic
retorts
but
he
likewise
received
replies
which
were
often
aimed
as
well
he
is
called
the
dog
just
as
aristippus
was
called
by
him
the
royal
dog
for
diogenes
bore
the
same
relation
to
idle
boys
as
aristippus
did
to
kings
diogenes
is
only
famed
for
his
manner
of
life
with
him
as
with
the
moderns
cynicism
came
to
signify
more
a
mode
of
living
than
a
philosophy
he
confined
himself
to
the
barest
necessities
and
tried
to
make
fun
of
others
who
did
not
think
as
he
and
who
laughed
at
his
ways
that
he
threw
away
his
cup
when
he
saw
a
boy
drinking
out
of
his
hands
is
well
known
to
have
no
wants
said
diogenes
is
divine
to
have
as
few
as
possible
is
to
come
nearest
to
the
divine
he
lived
in
all
sorts
of
places
in
the
streets
of
athens
in
the
market
in
tubs
and
he
usually
resided
and
slept
in
jupiters
stoa
in
athens
he
hence
remarked
that
the
athenians
had
built
him
a
splendid
place
of
residence171
thus
the
cynics
thought
not
only
of
dress
but
also
of
other
wants
but
a
mode
of
life
such
as
that
followed
by
the
cynics
which
professed
to
be
a
result
of
culture
is
really
conditioned
by
the
culture
of
the
mind
the
cynics
were
not
anchorites
their
consciousness
was
still
essentially
related
to
other
consciousness
antisthenes
and
diogenes
lived
in
athens
and
could
only
exist
there
but
in
culture
the
mind
is
also
directed
to
the
most
manifold
needs
and
to
the
methods
of
satisfying
these
in
more
recent
times
the
needs
have
much
increased
and
hence
a
division
of
the
general
wants
into
many
particular
wants
and
modes
of
satisfaction
has
arisen
this
is
the
function
of
the
activity
of
the
understanding
and
in
its
application
luxury
has
a
place
we
may
declaim
against
the
morality
of
this
but
in
a
state
all
talents
natural
inclinations
and
customs
must
have
free
scope
and
be
brought
into
exercise
and
every
individual
may
take
what
part
he
will
only
he
must
in
the
main
make
for
the
universal
thus
the
chief
point
is
to
place
no
greater
value
on
such
matters
than
what
is
demanded
or
generally
to
place
no
importance

on

dispensing
with
them
of
diogenes
we
have
only
anecdotes
to
relate
in
a
voyage
to
gina
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
searobbers
and
was
to
be
sold
as
a
slave
in
crete
being
asked
what
he
understood
he
replied
to
command
men
and
told
the
herald
to
call
out
who
will
buy
a
ruler
a
certain
xeniades
of
corinth
bought
him
and
he
instructed
his
sons
there
are
very
many
stories
told
of
his
residence
in
athens
there
he
presented
a
contrast
in
his
rudeness
and
disdainfulness
to
aristippus
fawning
philosophy
aristippus
set
no
value
on
his
enjoyments
any
more
than
on
his
wants
but
diogenes
did
so
on
his
poverty
diogenes
was
once
washing
his
greens
when
aristippus
passed
by
and
he
called
out
if
you
knew
how
to
wash
your
greens
yourself
you
would
not
run
after
kings
aristippus
replied
very
aptly
if
you
knew
how
to
associate
with
men
you
would
not
wash
greens
in
platos
house
he
once
walked
on
the
beautiful
carpets
with
muddy
feet
saying
i
tread
on
the
pride
of
plato
yes
but
with
another
pride
replied
plato
as
pointedly
when
diogenes
stood
wet
through
with
rain
and
the
bystanders
pitied
him
plato
said
if
you
wish
to
compassionate
him
just
go
away
his
vanity
is
in
showing
himself
off
and
exciting
surprise
it
is
what
made
him
act
in
this
way
and
the
reason
would
not
exist
if
he
were
left
alone
once
when
he
got
a
thrashing
as
anecdotes
often
tell
he
laid
a
large
plaster
on
his
wounds
and
wrote
on
it
the
names
of
those
who
had
struck
him
in
order
that
they
might
be
blamed
of
all
when
youths
standing
by
him
said
we
are
afraid
that
you
will
bite
us
he
replied
dont
mind
a
dog
never
eats
turnips
at
a
feast
a
guest
threw
bones
to
him
like
a
dog
and
he
went
up
to
him
and
behaved
to
him
like
a
dog
he
gave
a
good
answer
to
a
tyrant
who
asked
him
from
what
metal

should
be
cast
from
the
metal
from
which
the
statues
of
harmodius
and
aristogiton
were
cast
he
tried
to
eat
raw
meat
which
did
not
however
agree
with
him
he
could
not
digest
it

died
at
a
very
great
age

he
livedin
the
streets172
c
later

antisthenes

already
mentioned
were
men

the
succeeding

are
not
any
the
less
conspicuous
by
their
exceeding

shown

certainly
used
in
his
lectures
to
follow
the
usual
order
and
treat
empedocles
before
the
atomists
but
since
in
the
course
of
his
treatment
of
them
he
always
connected
the
atomists
with
the
eleatics
and
heraclitus
and
took
empedocles
in
so
far
as
he
anticipated
design
as
the
forerunner
of
anaxagoras
the
present
transposition
is
sufficiently
justified
if
we
further
consider
that
empedocles
swayed
to
and
fro
between
the
one
of
heraclitus
and
the
many
of
leucippus
without
like
them
adhering
to
either
of
these
onesided
determinations
it
is
clear
that
both
moments
are
assumptions
through
whose
variations
he
opened
a
way
for
the
anaxagorean
conception
of
end
which
by
comprehending
them
is
the
essential
unity
from
which
proceeds
the
manifold
of
phenomena
as
from
their
immanent

the
distinction
between
these
two
words
is
a
very
important
one
schwegler
in
explaining
hegels
position
in
his
history
of
philosophy
states
that
hegel
asserts
that
socrates
set
moralitt
the
subjective
morality
of
individual
conscience
in
the
place
of
sittlichkeit
the
spontaneous
natural
halfunconscious
almost
instinctive
virtue
that
rests
in
obedience
to
established
custom
use
and
wont
natural
objective
law
that
is
at
bottom
according
to
hegel
rational
though
not
yet
subjectively
cleared
perhaps
into
its
rational
principles
as
dr
stirling
says
in
his
annotations
to
the
same
work
p
394
there
is
a
period
in
the
history
of
the
state
when
people
live
in
tradition
that
is
a
period
of
unreflected
sittlichkeit
or
natural
observance
then
there
comes
a
time
when
the
observances
are
questioned
and
when
the
right
or
truth
they
involve
is
reflected
into
the
subject
this
is
a
period
of
aufklrung
and
for
sittlichkeit
there
is
substituted
moralitt
subjective
morality
the
subject
will
approve
nought
but
what
he
finds
inwardly
true
to
himself
to
his
consciencetranslators
