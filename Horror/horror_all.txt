_3 May. Bistritz._--Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
rule.

We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a
national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
don't know how I should be able to get on without it.

Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
travels with Mina.

In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I
must ask the Count all about them.)

I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
which they said was "mamaliga," and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
very excellent dish, which they call "impletata." (_Mem._, get recipe
for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?

All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
self-assertion.

It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
proper being assisted by famine and disease.

Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
a letter:--

     "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.

"Your friend,

"DRACULA."


_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
comforting.

Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
very hysterical way:

"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
she asked again:

"Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
She shook her head as she said again:

"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
my saying that I did not understand, she went on:

"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
coach!

       *       *       *       *       *

_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.

When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him
talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every
now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning
"word-bearer"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not
cheering to me, for amongst them were "Ordog"--Satan, "pokol"--hell,
"stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both of which mean the same
thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these
superstitions)

When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
the whole front of the box-seat--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big
whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
our journey.

I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather
languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,
plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under
the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road,
losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then
what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime
excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.

Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as
we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
be right before us:--

"Look! Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently.

As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there
we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,
and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there
was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even
turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its
long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could
only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
but the driver would not hear of it. "No, no," he said; "you must not
walk here; the dogs are too fierce"; and then he added, with what he
evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the
approving smile of the rest--"and you may have enough of such matters
before you go to sleep." The only stop he would make was a moment's
pause to light his lamps.

When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance
which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the
glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light
was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy
road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when
the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
thought it was "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said
in German worse than my own:--

"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
the next day." Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our
lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--

"You are early to-night, my friend." The man stammered in reply:--

"The English Herr was in a hurry," to which the stranger replied:--

"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot
deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift." As he
spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my
companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore":--

    "Denn die Todten reiten schnell"--
    ("For the dead travel fast.")

The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time
putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. "Give me the Herr's
luggage," said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the
coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a
hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been
prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam
from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then
the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a
strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown
over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in
excellent German:--

"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all
care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
country) underneath the seat, if you should require it." I did not take
any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a
little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been
any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It
seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was
so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any
protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to
delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was
passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I
suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.

Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a
long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by
another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed
to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to
strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from
sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which
affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to
jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again
took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This
time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a
narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.

Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning
rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we
could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The
keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer
and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I
grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,
however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to
left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.

Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The
driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,
jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know
what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took
his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep
and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where
the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,
formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical
effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but
as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me
straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue
flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.

At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause
for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more
terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man
feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
their true import.

All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and
looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;
but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for
it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the
calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know
not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and
looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his
long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across
the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.

When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the
wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a
dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time
seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on
ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the
driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,
and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
sky.




CHAPTER II

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_


_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.

When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
of the dark openings.

I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to
explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's
clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving
London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
wait the coming of the morning.

Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
of long disuse, and the great door swung back.

Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--

"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!" He made no
motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--

"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the
happiness you bring!" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to
that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that
for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was
speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--

"Count Dracula?" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--

"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest." As he was
speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
protested but he insisted:--

"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
available. Let me see to your comfort myself." He insisted on carrying
my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
flamed and flared.

The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit
by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing
through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a
welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were
fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself
left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the
door:--

"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared."

The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have
dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,
I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty
toilet, I went into the other room.

I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
his hand to the table, and said:--

"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse
me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup."

I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed
it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of
pleasure.

"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in
whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy
and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is
discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall
be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
your instructions in all matters."

The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
experienced.

By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn
up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
physiognomy.

His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the
thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His
eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I
could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.

Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp
point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could
not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes
gleamed, and he said:--

"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!"
Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
added:--

"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
hunter." Then he rose and said:--

"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
so sleep well and dream well!" With a courteous bow, he opened for me
himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....

I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
sake of those dear to me!

       *       *       *       *       *

_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which
was written:--

"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D." I set to and
enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,
but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of
the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my
table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant
anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it
breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had
it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about
the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was
absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of
library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.

In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life
and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
London Directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the
Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the
Law List.

Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
night's rest. Then he went on:--

"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
will interest you. These companions"--and he laid his hand on some of
the books--"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to
know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak."

"But, Count," I said, "you know and speak English thoroughly!" He bowed
gravely.

"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I
fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know
the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them."

"Indeed," I said, "you speak excellently."

"Not so," he answered. "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not
enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,
and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men
know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am
like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long
master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should
be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be
away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many
important affairs in hand."

Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might
come into that room when I chose. He answered: "Yes, certainly," and
added:--

"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that
all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand." I said I was sure of
this, and then he went on:--

"We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are
not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from
what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of
what strange things there may be."

This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to
talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding
things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.
Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most
frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked
him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue
flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a
certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place
where treasure has been concealed. "That treasure has been hidden," he
went on, "in the region through which you came last night, there can be
but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil
in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the
Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited
their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader
was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
sheltered in the friendly soil."

"But how," said I, "can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?"
The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--

"Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only
appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he
can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he
would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who
marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to
find these places again?"

"There you are right," I said. "I know no more than the dead where even
to look for them." Then we drifted into other matters.

"Come," he said at last, "tell me of London and of the house which you
have procured for me." With an apology for my remissness, I went into my
own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in
order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I
passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit
in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,
reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw's Guide. When I
came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I
went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in
everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its
surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the
subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much
more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--

"Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there
I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I
fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend
Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be
in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!"

We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the
necessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to
Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a
place. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I
inscribe here:--

"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to
be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place
was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,
built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of
years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
rust.

"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre
Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which
make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or
small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all
periods back, I should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone
immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with
iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or
church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading
to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from
various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling
way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
be very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very
large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic
asylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds."

When I had finished, he said:--

"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to
live in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a
day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice
also that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love
not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not
gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
sparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;
and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
attuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would
be alone with my thoughts when I may." Somehow his words and his look
did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
smile look malignant and saturnine.

Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers
together. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of
the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at
England, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in
certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed
that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new
estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the
Yorkshire coast.

It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. "Aha!" he
said; "still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I
am informed that your supper is ready." He took my arm, and we went into
the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The
Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from
home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.
After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with
me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not
say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in
every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up
with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count
Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--

"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so
long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by
us," and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.

I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the
warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have
written of this day.

       *       *       *       *       *

_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too
diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for
there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had
never come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I
could bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,
and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let
me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and
imagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say
at once how I stand--or seem to.

I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could
not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,
and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,
and heard the Count's voice saying to me, "Good-morning." I started, for
it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,
but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's
salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.
This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I
could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in
the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no
sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on
the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at
the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was
trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half
round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his
eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at
my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.

"Take care," he said, "take care how you cut yourself. It is more
dangerous than you think in this country." Then seizing the shaving
glass, he went on: "And this is the wretched thing that has done the
mischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!" and
opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones
of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very
annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or
the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.

When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could
not find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that
as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very
peculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I
went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The
view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity
of seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A
stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree
tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and
there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
the forests.

But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I
explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
an available exit.

The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!




CHAPTER III

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_


When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.
I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my
helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a
few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much
as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me
that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done
anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I
am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of
one thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to
the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it
himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive
me if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only
plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,
or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and
shall need, all my brains to get through.

I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below
shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into
the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making
the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along
thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him
through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these
menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it
must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that
brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it
mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his
hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the
coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the
crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless
that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing
which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there
is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,
a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some
time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my
mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count
Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of
himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,
however, not to awake his suspicion.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few
questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject
wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he
afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house
and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said "we,"
and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put
down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most
fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He
grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as
though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I
shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of
his race:--

"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,
in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from
Iceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their
Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,
and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the
were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found
the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the
desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as
Attila, whose blood is in these veins?" He held up his arms. "Is it a
wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when
Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us
here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed
there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were
claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries
was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more
than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,
'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we
throughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its
warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was
redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the
flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who
was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat
the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that
his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the
Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,
indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and
again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,
when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had
to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They
said that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants
without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to
conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the
Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and
their swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the
Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.
Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told."

It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this
diary seems horribly like the beginning of the "Arabian Nights," for
everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet's
father.)

       *       *       *       *       *

_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not
confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from
his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the
doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over
books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
matters I had been examining at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain
method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in
sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.

First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I
told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be
wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate
against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking
solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any
chance mislead him, so he said:--

"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under
the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from
London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now
here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have
sought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one
resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be
served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,
have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to
seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose
I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or
Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more
ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?" I answered that
certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of
agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
him without further trouble.

"But," said he, "I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?"

"Of course," I replied; and "such is often done by men of business, who
do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person."

"Good!" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a
wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or
foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not
evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had
spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
available, he suddenly stood up and said:--

"Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter
Hawkins, or to any other?" It was with some bitterness in my heart that
I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of
sending letters to anybody.

"Then write now, my young friend," he said, laying a heavy hand on my
shoulder: "write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now."

"Do you wish me to stay so long?" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the
thought.

"I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,
employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not
stinted. Is it not so?"

What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not
mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count
Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I
could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his
mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but
in his own smooth, resistless way:--

"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your
friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
home to them. Is it not so?" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of
note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign
post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood
as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for
he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes
now, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for
to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he
did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a
book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to
some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his
own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
had closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which
were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for
under the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way
I could.

One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The
Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to
Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,
bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just
about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my
seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his
hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped
them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--

"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this
evening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish." At the door he
turned, and after a moment's pause said:--

"Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all
seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has
many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be
warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
safe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then"--He finished his
speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were
washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
and mystery which seemed closing around me.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
doubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is
not. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that
my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.

When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any
sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out
towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in
prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of
the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful
expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed
to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I
leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey
below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of
the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The
window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though
weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since
the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked
carefully out.

What I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not
see the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had
so many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and
somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest
and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to
repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At
first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the
moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could
be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.

What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am
encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....

       *       *       *       *       *

_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.
He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good
deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head
had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without
avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I
knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and
taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had
expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the
stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could
pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's
room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and
escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs
and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two
small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,
however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,
and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have
again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right
than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could
see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter
side, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle
was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was
quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the
west was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
crannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle
occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the
yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My
lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was
glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place
which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better
than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the
presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I
found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak
table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my
diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is
nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my
senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
which mere "modernity" cannot kill.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I
am reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not
go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it
is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I
can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his
purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way
lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which
have puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant
when he made Hamlet say:--

    "My tablets! quick, my tablets!
    'Tis meet that I put it down," etc.,

for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
had come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.
The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.

The Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens
me more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon
me. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!

When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into my mind,
but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,
and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft
moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom
which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the
gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great
couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look
at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen
asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
morning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.

I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I
came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of
dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by
their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming
when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some
time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline
noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was
fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the
moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something
about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would
kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some
day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
They whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a
silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,
tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.
The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
on. One said:--

"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
begin." The other added:--

"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all." I lay quiet,
looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement
of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter
underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.

I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she
paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the
skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that
is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,
shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,
and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating
heart.

But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as
lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his
being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I
saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to
the demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light
in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His
face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar
of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman
from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating
them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the
wolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to
cut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--

"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when
I had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware
how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me." The fair girl,
with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--

"You yourself never loved; you never love!" On this the other women
joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
and said in a soft whisper:--

"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it
not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall
kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work
to be done."

"Are we to have nothing to-night?" said one of them, with a low laugh,
as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which
moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he
nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my
ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a
half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with
horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me
without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the
dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.

Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.




CHAPTER IV

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_


I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must
have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were
certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
in a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am
rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
many such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been
evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
another, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one
thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed
me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I
am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not
have brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this
room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of
sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.

       *       *       *       *       *

_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
I _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the
stairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the
jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt
of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in
the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
was nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,
another that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the
letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at
Bistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I
am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
suspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and
that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
prolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a
chance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained
to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much
impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would
be held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
suspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
him what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and
then said:--

"The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June
29."

I know now the span of my life. God help me!

       *       *       *       *       *

_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
send word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are
encamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of
them in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though
allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands
of them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
They attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and
call themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,
save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany
tongue.

I shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
posted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin
acquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many
signs, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could
their spoken language....

       *       *       *       *       *

I have written the letters. Mina's is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.
Hawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,
but without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and
frighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the
letters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the
extent of my knowledge....

       *       *       *       *       *

I have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window
with a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The
man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
in his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to
read. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....

       *       *       *       *       *

The Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
voice as he opened two letters:--

"The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they
come, I shall, of course, take care. See!"--he must have looked at
it--"one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other"--here
he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and
the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--"the
other is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is
not signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us." And he calmly held letter
and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he
went on:--

"The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is
yours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that
unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?" He held
out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean
envelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When
he went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later
I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.

When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his
coming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very
courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been
sleeping, he said:--

"So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I
may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours
to me; but you will sleep, I pray." I passed to my room and went to bed,
and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.

       *       *       *       *       *

_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself
with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a
surprise, again a shock!

Every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
might be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered
awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my
portmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.

The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
rug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new
scheme of villainy....

       *       *       *       *       *

_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed
cudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding
and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
each pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
sheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I
ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a
shock: my door was fastened on the outside.

Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me
stupidly and pointed, but just then the "hetman" of the Szgany came out,
and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
laughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised
entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks
handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When
they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the
yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on
it for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I
heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.

       *       *       *       *       *

_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and
locked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the
winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I
thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.
The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound
as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
ruthless villainy.

I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw
something coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched
carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to
find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst
travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I
had seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,
and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will
allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave
evidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local
people be attributed to me.

It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up
here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
is even a criminal's right and consolation.

I thought I would watch for the Count's return, and for a long time sat
doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some
quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were
like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of
soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the
embrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more
fully the aërial gambolling.

Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to
ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
the sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to
awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I
was becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my
senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were
becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat
safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp
was burning brightly.

When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the
Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a
beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and
could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.

As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a
woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning
against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she
threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--

"Monster, give me my child!"

She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her
breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see
her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.

Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the
Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be
answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes
had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,
through the wide entrance into the courtyard.

There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
short. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.

I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and
she was better dead.

What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful
thing of night and gloom and fear?

       *       *       *       *       *

_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night
how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the
sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as
if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must
take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last
night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
earth.

Let me not think of it. Action!

It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or
threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the
Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that
he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!
But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.

Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone
why may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his
window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The
chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk
it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man's death is not a
calf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me
in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!

       *       *       *       *       *

_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have
come safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I
went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
around the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,
and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I
took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down
once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty
well the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it
as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did
not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed
ridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and
trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when
I bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked
around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.
The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which
seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked
for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it
anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and
Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as
though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was
less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,
some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.

At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I
could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or
all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone
passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,
minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,
tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the
odour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell
grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood
ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
been used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were
steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
brought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for
any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of
the ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the
vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to
my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments
of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a
discovery.

There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I
could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of
movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,
and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain
there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.
By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw
the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,
though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and
leaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle
wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
to think....

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has
taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the
castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might
destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would
have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared
to see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there
till I fell asleep.

I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can
look as he said:--

"To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful
England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never
meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be
here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the
Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to
Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle
Dracula." I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--

"Why may I not go to-night?"

"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission."

"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once." He smiled,
such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick
behind his smoothness. He said:--

"And your baggage?"

"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time."

The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my
eyes, it seemed so real:--

"You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
that which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting
guest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait
in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that
you so suddenly desire it. Come!" With a stately gravity, he, with the
lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he
stopped.

"Hark!"

Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the
sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great
orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. After a pause
of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
open.

To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I
looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.

As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed
feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that
to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such
allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door
continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.
Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my
doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There
was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and
as a last chance I cried out:--

"Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!" and covered my face with my
hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his
powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.

In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went
to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand
to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that
Judas in hell might be proud of.

When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a
whispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears
deceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--

"Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have
patience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!" There was a low,
sweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw
without the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they
all joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.

I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near
the end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am
dear!

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this
diary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself
on my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me
ready.

At last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
had come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.
With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen
that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands
that trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the
massive bolts.

But the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at
the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the
Count.

Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I
determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's
room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
down the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that
was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold
remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding
stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well
enough where to find the monster I sought.

The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so
I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw
something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,
but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,
and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than
ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,
burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
underneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were
simply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his
repletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in
me revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The
coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those
horrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the
key. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile
on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I
was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the
helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me
to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,
but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to
paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my
hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade
caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,
blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its
own in the nethermost hell.

I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I
waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had
spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which
contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's
room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must
have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of
the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to
run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;
but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the
door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from
the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was
hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
round me more closely.

As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet
and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the
box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again
along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.

The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key
in the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
shuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.

Hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
the crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the
distance.

I am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,
and there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!

I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall
farther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with
me, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.

And then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
children still walk with earthly feet!

At least God's mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
precipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.
Good-bye, all! Mina!




CHAPTER V

_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._


"_9 May._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed
with work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
freely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard
lately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I have
been practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall
be able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I
can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for
him on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He
and I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a
stenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I
shall keep a diary in the same way. I don't mean one of those
two-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
sort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not
suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
intended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it
anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try
to do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
descriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with
a little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
said during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little
plans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan
from Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I
am longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange
countries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them
together. There is the ten o'clock bell ringing. Good-bye.

"Your loving

"MINA.

"Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for
a long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,
curly-haired man???"


_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.

"_17, Chatham Street_,

"_Wednesday_.

"My dearest Mina,--

"I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I
wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your
_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing
to interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal
to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the
tall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the
last Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.
Holmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well
together; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some
time ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already
engaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well
off, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He
is only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under
his own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to
see us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men
I ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I
can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has
a curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
read one's thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter
myself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do
you ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not
a bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
have never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological
study, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient
interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a
bore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.
There, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and
laughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like
to speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn't you guess? I love him. I am blushing
as I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in
words. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that
does me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
undressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.
I do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,
or I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I _do_ so
want to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all
that you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your
prayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.

"LUCY.

"P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.

"L."

_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.

"_24 May_.

"My dearest Mina,--

"Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so
nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.

"My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.
Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a
proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.
Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry,
really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so
happy that I don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals!
But, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would be
getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
least. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and
are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
despise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep
it a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You
will tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell
Arthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don't you think
so, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to
be quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always
quite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just
before lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum
man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool
outwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling
himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do
when they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept
playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to
me, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,
though he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to
help and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I
did not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute
and would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if
I could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,
and then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one
else. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my
confidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was
free a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to
tell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he
stood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my
hands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever
wanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't
help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being
proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at
all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know
loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to
know that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing
quite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so
miserable, though I am so happy.

"_Evening._

"Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left
off, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two
came after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and
he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
has been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise
with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her
ear, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that
we think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now
what I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I
don't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never
told any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.
Morris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl
alone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I
helping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you
beforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang--that is to say,
he never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well
educated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me
to hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there
was no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my
dear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
has to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall
ever speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never
heard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked
as happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was
very nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--

"'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your
little shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you
will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't
you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road
together, driving in double harness?'

"Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem
half so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as
lightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I
wasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in
a light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so
on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He
really did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help
feeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid
flirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was
number two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he
began pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
heart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall
never again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,
because he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face
which checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of
manly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--

"'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here
speaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right
through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow
to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is
I'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will
let me, a very faithful friend.'

"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
gentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think
this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very
badly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want
her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say
it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into
Mr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--

"'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he
even loves me.' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I
think I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--

"'That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for a chance of
winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't
cry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it
standing up. If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd
better look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,
your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a
lover; it's more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I'm going to have a pretty
lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won't you give me one kiss?
It'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you
know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,
my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn't spoken
yet.' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and
noble, too, to a rival--wasn't it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and
kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down
into my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--

"'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these
things don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet
honesty to me, and good-bye.' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
went straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a
quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like
that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
worship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only
I don't want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I
cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I
don't wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.

"Ever your loving

"LUCY.

"P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn't tell you of number Three, need
I? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his
coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was
kissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to
deserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not
ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a
lover, such a husband, and such a friend.

"Good-bye."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

(Kept in phonograph)

_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so
diary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty
feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has
afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am
determined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get
nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.

I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making
myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing
it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep
him to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients
as I would the mouth of hell.

(_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)
_Omnia Romæ venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there be
anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards
_accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--

R. M. Renfield, ætat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I
cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly
dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution
is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of
on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed
point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of
accidents can balance it.

CHAPTER VI

MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


_24 July. Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and
lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in
which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the
Esk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is
beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
see down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all
red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby
Abbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of
"Marmion," where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble
ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and
the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in
Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the
harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness
stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that
part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside
them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and
sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my
book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
sitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
talk.

The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
stretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in
the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside
of it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
and its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a
narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.

It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
nothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between
banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this
side there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of
which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of
it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
mournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is
lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he
is coming this way....

He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all
gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is
nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing
fleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical
person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
at the abbey he said very brusquely:--

"I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.
Mind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in
my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,
but not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and
Leeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's an' drinkin' tea an' lookin'
out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel' who'd be
bothered tellin' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of
fool-talk." I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting
things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about
the whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin
when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--

"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn't like
to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to
crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em; an', miss, I lack
belly-timber sairly by the clock."

He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down
the steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from
the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how
many--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
a horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally
have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went
out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did
not go. They will be home by this.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most
interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think
must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit
anything, and downfaces everybody. If he can't out-argue them he bullies
them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy
was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did
not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her
on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,
and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it
and put it down:--

"It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that's what it be, an'
nowt else. These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts an' barguests an' bogles
an' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an' dizzy women
a-belderin'. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an' all grims an' signs
an' warnin's, be all invented by parsons an' illsome beuk-bodies an'
railway touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to do
somethin' that they don't other incline to. It makes me ireful to think
o' them. Why, it's them that, not content with printin' lies on paper
an' preachin' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin' them on the
tombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
steans, holdin' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
is acant--simply tumblin' down with the weight o' the lies wrote on
them, 'Here lies the body' or 'Sacred to the memory' wrote on all of
them, an' yet in nigh half of them there bean't no bodies at all; an'
the memories of them bean't cared a pinch of snuff about, much less
sacred. Lies all of them, nothin' but lies of one kind or another! My
gog, but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they
come tumblin' up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an' tryin' to
drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
trimmlin' and ditherin', with their hands that dozzened an' slippy from
lyin' in the sea that they can't even keep their grup o' them."

I could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air and the way in
which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was
"showing off," so I put in a word to keep him going:--

"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious. Surely these tombstones are not
all wrong?"

"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin' where they make
out the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be
like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now
look you here; you come here a stranger, an' you see this kirk-garth." I
nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite
understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.
He went on: "And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
happed here, snod an' snog?" I assented again. "Then that be just where
the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as
old Dun's 'bacca-box on Friday night." He nudged one of his companions,
and they all laughed. "And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at
that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!" I went over and
read:--

"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30." When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--

"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast
of Andres! an' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a
dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above"--he pointed
northwards--"or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the
steans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in
the _Lively_ off Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the
same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year
later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
in the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do ye think that all these men will have
to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums
aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they'd be jommlin' an'
jostlin' one another that way that it 'ud be like a fight up on the ice
in the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark, an'
tryin' to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis." This was
evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
cronies joined in with gusto.

"But," I said, "surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
take their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think
that will be really necessary?"

"Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!"

"To please their relatives, I suppose."

"To please their relatives, you suppose!" This he said with intense
scorn. "How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?" He
pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on
which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. "Read the
lies on that thruff-stean," he said. The letters were upside down to me
from where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
and read:--

"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a
glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
beloved son. 'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'
Really, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything very funny in that!" She spoke
her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.

"Ye don't see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that's because ye don't gawm the
sorrowin' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was
acrewk'd--a regular lamiter he was--an' he hated her so that he
committed suicide in order that she mightn't get an insurance she put on
his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
they had for scarin' the crows with. 'Twarn't for crows then, for it
brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That's the way he fell off the
rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I've often heard him
say masel' that he hoped he'd go to hell, for his mother was so pious
that she'd be sure to go to heaven, an' he didn't want to addle where
she was. Now isn't that stean at any rate"--he hammered it with his
stick as he spoke--"a pack of lies? and won't it make Gabriel keckle
when Geordie comes pantin' up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!"

I did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she
said, rising up:--

"Oh, why did you tell us of this? It is my favourite seat, and I cannot
leave it; and now I find I must go on sitting over the grave of a
suicide."

"That won't harm ye, my pretty; an' it may make poor Geordie gladsome to
have so trim a lass sittin' on his lap. That won't hurt ye. Why, I've
sat here off an' on for nigh twenty years past, an' it hasn't done me
no harm. Don't ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn' lie
there either! It'll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as a stubble-field.
There's the clock, an' I must gang. My service to ye, ladies!" And off
he hobbled.

Lucy and I sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
took hands as we sat; and she told me all over again about Arthur and
their coming marriage. That made me just a little heart-sick, for I
haven't heard from Jonathan for a whole month.

       *       *       *       *       *

_The same day._ I came up here alone, for I am very sad. There was no
letter for me. I hope there cannot be anything the matter with Jonathan.
The clock has just struck nine. I see the lights scattered all over the
town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
they run right up the Esk and die away in the curve of the valley. To my
left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next
the abbey. The sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
me, and there is a clatter of a donkey's hoofs up the paved road below.
The band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time, and further
along the quay there is a Salvation Army meeting in a back street.
Neither of the bands hears the other, but up here I hear and see them
both. I wonder where Jonathan is and if he is thinking of me! I wish he
were here.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_5 June._--The case of Renfield grows more interesting the more I get to
understand the man. He has certain qualities very largely developed;
selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the
object of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
but what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of
animals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I
sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd
sorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a
quantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he
did not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in
simple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: "May I have
three days? I shall clear them away." Of course, I said that would do. I
must watch him.

       *       *       *       *       *

_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
very big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and
the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
room.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his
flies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked
very sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all
events. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time
as before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a
horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
he caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger
and thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his
mouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it
was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
gave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must
watch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem
in his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always
jotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of
figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
totals added in batches again, as though he were "focussing" some
account, as the auditors put it.

       *       *       *       *       *

_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
my mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,
unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
conscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I
might notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except
that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has
managed to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means
of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that
do remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by
tempting them with his food.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of
sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came
in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,
very great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked
him what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and
bearing:--

"A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,
and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!" I was not unprepared for this
request, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
vivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
I said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a
cat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--

"Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should
refuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?" I shook
my head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but
that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of
danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him
with his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know
more.

       *       *       *       *       *

_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner
brooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and
implored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
I was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon
he went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
where I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.

       *       *       *       *       *

_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his
rounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,
which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I
looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
There were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of
blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if
there were anything odd about him during the day.

       *       *       *       *       *

_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has
been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. "My belief is,
doctor," he said, "that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took
and ate them raw!"

       *       *       *       *       *

_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make
even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought
that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to
invent a new classification for him, and call him a zoöphagous
(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he
can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He
gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later
steps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It
might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at
vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science
in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had
I even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of
even one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch
compared with which Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's
brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good
cause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an
exceptional brain, congenitally?

How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I
wonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has
closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How
many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?

To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
and that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great
Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to
profit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be
angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on
hopeless and work. Work! work!

If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a
good, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.


_Mina Murray's Journal._

_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it
is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time. And
there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I
had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from
him. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed
had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;
I do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,
although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided
that I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has
got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is
naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy's
father, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress
himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the
autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
to be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan
and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to
make both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only
son of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can
leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat
on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it
is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
arrives.

       *       *       *       *       *

_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,
though why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if
it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I
am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so
hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and
wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been
suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
her looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely
rose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will
all last.

       *       *       *       *       *

_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to
Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He
surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but
somehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is
his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in
her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
me. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
searching for the key.

_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting
dreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should
feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last
letter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable
than ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and
the fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and
learn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is
hidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except
the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea
is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,
muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey
mist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
there is a "brool" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.
Dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
the mist, and seem "men like trees walking." The fishing-boats are
racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
the harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is
making straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that
he wants to talk....

I have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat
down beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--

"I want to say something to you, miss." I could see he was not at ease,
so I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
fully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--

"I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked
things I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
but I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone. We
aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't
altogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it;
an' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my
own heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a
bit; only I don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at
hand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to
expect; and I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his
scythe. Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at
once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of
Death will sound his trumpet for me. But don't ye dooal an' greet, my
deary!"--for he saw that I was crying--"if he should come this very
night I'd not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a
waitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that
we can rightly depend on. But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my
deary, and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be lookin' and
wonderin'. Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with
it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!" he
cried suddenly. "There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the
air; I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call
comes!" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth
moved as though he were praying. After a few minutes' silence, he got
up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled
off. It all touched me, and upset me very much.

I was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
arm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time
kept looking at a strange ship.

"I can't make her out," he said; "she's a Russian, by the look of her;
but she's knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn't know her mind
a bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to
run up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is
steered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel;
changes about with every puff of wind. We'll hear more of her before
this time to-morrow."

CUTTING FROM "THE DAILYGRAPH," 8 AUGUST


(_Pasted in Mina Murray's Journal._)

From a Correspondent.

_Whitby_.

One of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
experienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had
been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
August. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,
Robin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in
the neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made
trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
"tripping" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the
afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff
churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
sea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of
"mares'-tails" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then
blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
language is ranked "No. 2: light breeze." The coastguard on duty at once
made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has
kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic
manner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very
beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
churchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black
mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,
purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The
experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
sketches of the "Prelude to the Great Storm" will grace the R. A. and R.
I. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and
there that his "cobble" or his "mule," as they term the different
classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
was a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
the approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There
were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
which usually "hug" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
few fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign
schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The
foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for
comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
her to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she
was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
swell of the sea,

    "As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."

Shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite
oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep
inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the
great harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a
strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
carry a strange, faint, hollow booming.

Then without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the
time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in
growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes
the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.
White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary
to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to
the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came
drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were
touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist
cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
of the footsteps of the storm.

Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with
a rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East
Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
tried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
Once or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,
with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
piers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of
joy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed
to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.

Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner
with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
earlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,
and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
realized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the
port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
harbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
speed that, in the words of one old salt, "she must fetch up somewhere,
if it was only in hell." Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
like a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
than before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between
the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
gained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a
shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
motion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great
awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had
found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,
all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The
schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East
Cliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.

There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
"top-hammer" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant
the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
on the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat
tombstones--"thruff-steans" or "through-stones," as they call them in
the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff
has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.

It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as
all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
first to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring
the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
light on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and
when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
once as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general
curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way
round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your
correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
When I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,
whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the
courtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted
to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman
whilst actually lashed to the wheel.

It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened
by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between
the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it
was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the
state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot
Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making
examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his
pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of
paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said
the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some
complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot
claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
delegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say
that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
he held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as
noble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to
await inquest.

Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further
details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
harbour in the storm.

_Whitby_

_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It
turns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the
_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of
7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
possession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,
acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
paid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except
the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been
most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
existing regulations. As the matter is to be a "nine days' wonder," they
are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after
complaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the
S. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the
animal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it
was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
hiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a
possibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it
is evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred
mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found
dead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting,
and manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been
permitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order
up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
except as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is
with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
at the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them
unfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for
concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
supercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that
this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my
statement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the
dictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for
me, time being short.

On 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
At noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates,
cook, and myself (captain).

       *       *       *       *       *

On 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs
officers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of
guarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but
quick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something.
Seemed scared, but would not speak out.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who
sailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only
told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper
with one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but
all was quiet.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was
missing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last
night; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more
downcast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but
would not say more than there was _something_ aboard. Mate getting very
impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.

       *       *       *       *       *

On 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man
aboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering
behind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,
thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
and go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,
but when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.
He was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may
spread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from
stem to stern.

       *       *       *       *       *

Later in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
stem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep
them out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the
rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
no corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there
were no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when
search over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but
said nothing.

       *       *       *       *       *

_22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
sails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.
Mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad
weather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.

       *       *       *       *       *

_24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,
and entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
night another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his
watch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round
robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate
angry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do
some violence.

       *       *       *       *       *

_28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,
and the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly
know how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate
volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours' sleep.
Wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is
steadier.

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 July_.--Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too
tired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one
except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,
but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate
and I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 July_.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,
all sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling
me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and
two hands left to work ship.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 August_.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in
the English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,
as could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible
doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature
seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,
working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are
Russian, he Roumanian.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes' sleep by hearing a cry,
seemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and
ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits
of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as
he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and
only God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God
seems to have deserted us.

       *       *       *       *       *

_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
when I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran
before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He
looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given
way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: "_It_ is here; I know
it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,
and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind
It, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the
air." And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into
space. Then he went on: "But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the
hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and
see. You work the helm." And, with a warning look and his finger on his
lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could
not leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest
and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,
raving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those
big boxes: they are invoiced as "clay," and to pull them about is as
harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and
write these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.
Then, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut
down sails and lie by, and signal for help....

       *       *       *       *       *

It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate
would come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the
hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,
startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
came as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
his face convulsed with fear. "Save me! save me!" he cried, and then
looked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in
a steady voice he said: "You had better come too, captain, before it is
too late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me
from Him, and it is all that is left!" Before I could say a word, or
move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was
this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has
followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these
horrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?

       *       *       *       *       *

_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is
sunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go
below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in
the dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was
right to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a
sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not
leave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie
my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
them I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good
wind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am
growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the
face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap
this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,
... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God
and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying
to do his duty....

       *       *       *       *       *

Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;
and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
simply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is
arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk
for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey
steps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners
of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as
wishing to follow him to the grave.

No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I
believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so
will end this one more "mystery of the sea."


_Mina Murray's Journal._

_8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not
sleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be
like a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up
twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and
managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It
is a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is
thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
life.

Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
if anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,
and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
of the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I
felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,
oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully
anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!

       *       *       *       *       *

_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
touching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the
churchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
the cortège of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down
again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
The poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that
her dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:
she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
there be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional
cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our
seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,
fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of
fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor
dear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so
sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did
not much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men
who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
The dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw
the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would
not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few
yards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then
harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
bristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally
the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the
stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did
not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,
to comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly
fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world
without trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The
whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead
man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the
touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all
afford material for her dreams.

I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I
shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and
back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.




CHAPTER VIII

MINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL


_Same day, 11 o'clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I
had made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely
walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,
and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything
except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
and give us a fresh start. We had a capital "severe tea" at Robin Hood's
Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow-window right over
the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have
shocked the "New Woman" with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless
them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was
really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay
for supper. Lucy and I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I
know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I think that
some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new
class of curates, who don't take supper, no matter how they may be
pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and
breathing softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now.
Some of the "New Women" writers will some day start an idea that men and
women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won't condescend in future to
accept; she will do the proposing herself. And a nice job she will make
of it, too! There's some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night,
because dear Lucy seems better. I really believe she has turned the
corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should be
quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.

_11 August, 3 a. m._--Diary again. No sleep now, so I may as well write.
I am too agitated to sleep. We have had such an adventure, such an
agonising experience. I fell asleep as soon as I had closed my diary....
Suddenly I became broad awake, and sat up, with a horrible sense of fear
upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. The room was dark,
so I could not see Lucy's bed; I stole across and felt for her. The bed
was empty. I lit a match and found that she was not in the room. The
door was shut, but not locked, as I had left it. I feared to wake her
mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
clothes and got ready to look for her. As I was leaving the room it
struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her
dreaming intention. Dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
Dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. "Thank God," I said
to myself, "she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress." I ran
downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in
all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It
was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people
of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that
Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what
might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a
big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the
Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North
Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At
the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to
the East Cliff, in the hope or fear--I don't know which--of seeing Lucy
in our favourite seat. There was a bright full moon, with heavy black,
driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of
light and shade as they sailed across. For a moment or two I could see
nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church and all
around it. Then as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the abbey
coming into view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as
a sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
visible. Whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too
quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind
the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was,
whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another
glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East
Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for not a soul did I see; I rejoiced
that it was so, for I wanted no witness of poor Lucy's condition. The
time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
came laboured as I toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. I must have
gone fast, and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with
lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. When I got almost
to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now
close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. There
was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
half-reclining white figure. I called in fright, "Lucy! Lucy!" and
something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face
and red, gleaming eyes. Lucy did not answer, and I ran on to the
entrance of the churchyard. As I entered, the church was between me and
the seat, and for a minute or so I lost sight of her. When I came in
view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
that I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
of the seat. She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living
thing about.

When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep. Her lips
were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in
long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
breath. As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
collar of her nightdress close around her throat. Whilst she did so
there came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. I
flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
for I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
unclad as she was. I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
have my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her
throat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety
and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. When I
had her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet and then began
very gently to wake her. At first she did not respond; but gradually she
became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
occasionally. At last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
reasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,
till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. She did not seem surprised
to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body must
have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. She
trembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with
me home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child. As we
passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince. She
stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.
However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
was a puddle of water, remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with
mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.

Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul. Once we saw
a man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of
us; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as
there are here, steep little closes, or "wynds," as they call them in
Scotland. My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought I
should faint. I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her
health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
in case the story should get wind. When we got in, and had washed our
feet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into
bed. Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a
word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. I
hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,
and thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,
infallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do
so. I hope I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to
my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping
soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Same day, noon._--All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed
not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not
seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to
notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. Indeed, it might
have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have
pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about it, she
laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it
cannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the
sun bright, and there was a cool breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave
Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for
I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had
Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening
we strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr
and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful than she
has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door
and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any
trouble to-night.

       *       *       *       *       *

_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I
was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to
be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too, and, I was glad to see,
was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of
manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about
Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded
somewhat, for, though sympathy can't alter facts, it can help to make
them more bearable.

       *       *       *       *       *

_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
before. Again I awoke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,
still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling
aside the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
effect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,
silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the moonlight
flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or
twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me,
and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back
from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
She did not stir again all night.

       *       *       *       *       *

_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems
to have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to
get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for
dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and
stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low
down in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was
thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and
suddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--

"His red eyes again! They are just the same." It was such an odd
expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. I
slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare
at her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on
her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but
followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
whereon was a dark figure seated alone. I was a little startled myself,
for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
burning flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red
sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary's Church behind our
seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. I
called Lucy's attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
with a start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never refer to it; so I
said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went
early to bed. I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself;
I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home--it was then
bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance
up at our window, and saw Lucy's head leaning out. I thought that
perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and
waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then,
the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against
the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and
by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a
good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs,
but as I came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
as though to protect it from cold.

I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the
door is locked and the window securely fastened.

She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I
fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it
is.

       *       *       *       *       *

_15 August._--Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and
slept on after we had been called. We had a happy surprise at breakfast.
Arthur's father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy
is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on
in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her
very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got
her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;
her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for
her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be
almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
the dreadful night of Lucy's sleep-walking.

       *       *       *       *       *

_17 August._--No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to
write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
mother's hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy's
fading away as she is doing. She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping
as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
window. Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I
tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to
restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how she came to be at the
window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may
not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat
just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with
red centres. Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the
doctor seeing about them.

_Mina Murray's Journal._

_18 August._--I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
churchyard. Lucy is ever so much better. Last night she slept well all
night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already
to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she
were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she is not. She is in
gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence
seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if I
needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this
very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with
the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--

"My poor little feet didn't make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr.
Swales would have told me that it was because I didn't want to wake up
Geordie." As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she
had dreamed at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered
look came into her forehead, which Arthur--I call him Arthur from her
habit--says he loves; and, indeed, I don't wonder that he does. Then she
went on in a half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
herself:--

"I didn't quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be
here in this spot--I don't know why, for I was afraid of something--I
don't know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and
I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a lot of dogs howling--the
whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as
I went up the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and
dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking
into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have
heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me,
and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as if I were in an
earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do
it before I felt you."

Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I
listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite like it, and thought it
better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
subjects, and Lucy was like her old self again. When we got home the
fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very
happy evening together.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 August._--Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of
Jonathan. The dear fellow has been ill; that is why he did not write. I
am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent
me on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the
morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,
and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if
we were to be married out there. I have cried over the good Sister's
letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is of
Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is _in_ my heart. My journey
is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. I am only taking one change of
dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for
it, for it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say
to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen and touched must
comfort me till we meet.

"Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,

"SISTER AGATHA.

"P. S.--My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something
more. He has told me all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock--so says
our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and I fear to say of
what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
of this kind for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
his do not lightly die away. We should have written long ago, but we
knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
could understand. He came in the train from Klausenburg, and the guard
was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station
shouting for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that
he was English, they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the
way thither that the train reached.

"Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his
sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no
doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for
safety's sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many,
many, happy years for you both."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_19 August._--Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About
eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when
setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the
attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was
quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he
would say was:--

     "I don't want to talk to you: you don't count now; the Master is at
     hand."

The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
seized him. If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with
homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The
combination is a dreadful one. At nine o'clock I visited him myself. His
attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that
he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves
away! The real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created
from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow. Oh,
if men only knew!

For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and
greater degree. I did not pretend to be watching him, but I kept strict
observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his
eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it
the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I
would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite
his attention. At first he made no reply, but at length said testily:--

"Bother them all! I don't care a pin about them."

"What?" I said. "You don't mean to tell me you don't care about
spiders?" (Spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling
up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:--

"The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
that are filled."

He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
all the time I remained with him.

I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and
how different things might have been. If I don't sleep at once, chloral,
the modern Morpheus--C_{2}HCl_{3}O. H_{2}O! I must be careful not to let
it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of
Lucy, and I shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be,
to-night shall be sleepless....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had
lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
too dangerous a person to be roaming about. Those ideas of his might
work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was waiting for me.
He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
bed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door. His
attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
sent up for me. He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should
go than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out
of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and couldn't get through
the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost,
and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The
attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt
of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our
grounds from those of the deserted house.

I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
immediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our friend
might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
dropped down on the other side. I could see Renfield's figure just
disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On the
far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old
ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was talking, apparently to some
one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest
I might frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of
bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not
take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
in. I heard him say:--

"I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will
reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have worshipped You long and afar
off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass
me by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?"

He _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes
even when he believes he is in a Real Presence. His manias make a
startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.
He is immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I
never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I
shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and
his danger in good time. With strength and determination like his, he
might have done wild work before he was caged. He is safe now at any
rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn't get free from the strait-waistcoat
that keeps him restrained, and he's chained to the wall in the padded
room. His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.

Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--

"I shall be patient, Master. It is coming--coming--coming!"

So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this
diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall get some sleep to-night.




CHAPTER IX


_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._

"_Buda-Pesth, 24 August._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well, my dear, I got to Hull
all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I
feel that I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I
knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some
nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one,
oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution has gone out
of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his
face has vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not
remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past. At
least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some
terrible shock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try
to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I
wanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,
and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
secrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear
them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul, and the
next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
about, added: 'I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
have no cause to be concerned. He has not forgotten you or what he owes
to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can
treat of.' I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my
poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of
_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I
felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a
cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his
face while he sleeps. He is waking!...

"When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something
from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.
I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his
trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent
me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.
Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the
note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--

"'Wilhelmina'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has
never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know,
dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to
think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it
was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain
fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to
know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, my
dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
complete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is
the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to
the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fell
back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I
have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this
afternoon, and am waiting her reply....

       *       *       *       *       *

"She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission
church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon
after as Jonathan awakes....

       *       *       *       *       *

"Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very
happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his 'I will' firmly
and strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were so kind. Please God, I
shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
I have taken upon me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the
chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband--oh, Lucy, it
is the first time I have written the words 'my husband'--left me alone
with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon
which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,
and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it
to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and then it would
be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,
Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that it
was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go
through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to
have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I
shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the
year.

"Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the
happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him
except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,
and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn
pledge between us....

"Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because
it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,
and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,
please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of
sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must
not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be
_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at
once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for Jonathan
is waking--I must attend to my husband!

"MINA HARKER."


_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Harker._

"_Whitby, 30 August._

"My dearest Mina,--

"Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own
home with your husband. I wish you could be coming home soon enough to
stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has
quite restored me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of
life, and sleep well. You will be glad to know that I have quite given
up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a
week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting
fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that Arthur is here. We have such
walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing
together; and I love him more than ever. He _tells_ me that he loves me
more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he couldn't love me
more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me.
So no more just at present from your loving

"LUCY.

"P. S.--Mother sends her love. She seems better, poor dear. "P. P.
S.--We are to be married on 28 September."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_20 August._--The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has
now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
himself: "Now I can wait; now I can wait." The attendant came to tell
me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the
strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might
almost say, "cringing"--softness. I was satisfied with his present
condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,
but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange
thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking
furtively at them:--

"They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!"

It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I
do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in
common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful
to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the
offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will
only say: "I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,
and I can wait; I can wait."

After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet
until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at
length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted
him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.

       *       *       *       *       *

... Three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet
from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I could get some clue to the cause. It
would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
Happy thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He
escaped before without our help; to-night he shall escape with it. We
shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
are required....

       *       *       *       *       *

_23 August._--"The unexpected always happens." How well Disraeli knew
life. Our bird when he found the cage open would not fly, so all our
subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one
thing; that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in
future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day. I have given
orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
when once he is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. The poor soul's
body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark!
The unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the
attendant was entering the room to inspect. Then he dashed out past him
and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow.
Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me
he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing
happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught
the patient's eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and
ghostly way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and
presently said:--

"You needn't tie me; I shall go quietly!" Without trouble we came back
to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
not forget this night....


_Lucy Westenra's Diary_

_Hillingham, 24 August._--I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things
down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will
be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I
seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the
change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me,
for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so
weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved
when he saw me, and I hadn't the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder
if I could sleep in mother's room to-night. I shall make an excuse and
try.

       *       *       *       *       *

_25 August._--Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my
proposal. She seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the
clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling
asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I
did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have
fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This
morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains
me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem ever to
get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I
know he will be miserable to see me so.


_Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._

"_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._

"My dear Jack,--

"I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special
disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have
asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to
disturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state of
health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is
spoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I
am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind. I am
almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I
told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at
first--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be a
painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and
I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at
Hillingham to-morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being
alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I
am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I
can after you have seen her. Do not fail!

"ARTHUR."


_Telegram, Arthur Holmwood to Seward._

"_1 September._

"Am summoned to see my father, who is worse. Am writing. Write me fully
by to-night's post to Ring. Wire me if necessary."


_Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood._

"_2 September._

"My dear old fellow,--

"With regard to Miss Westenra's health I hasten to let you know at once
that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with
her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw
her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full
opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship
makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have
done and propose doing.

"I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,
and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no
doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with
me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,
however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair
with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her
high spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to
make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:--

"'I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.' I reminded her
that a doctor's confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
anxious about her. She caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
matter in a word. 'Tell Arthur everything you choose. I do not care for
myself, but all for him!' So I am quite free.

"I could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not see
the usual anæmic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to test the
quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff a cord
gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. It was a
slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I secured
a few drops of the blood and have analysed them. The qualitative
analysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in
itself a vigorous state of health. In other physical matters I was quite
satisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a
cause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something
mental. She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
regarding which she can remember nothing. She says that as a child she
used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came back,
and that once she walked out in the night and went to East Cliff, where
Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the habit has not
returned. I am in doubt, and so have done the best thing I know of; I
have written to my old friend and master, Professor Van Helsing, of
Amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
world. I have asked him to come over, and as you told me that all things
were to be at your charge, I have mentioned to him who you are and your
relations to Miss Westenra. This, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
your wishes, for I am only too proud and happy to do anything I can for
her. Van Helsing would, I know, do anything for me for a personal
reason, so, no matter on what ground he comes, we must accept his
wishes. He is a seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because he knows
what he is talking about better than any one else. He is a philosopher
and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
and he has, I believe, an absolutely open mind. This, with an iron
nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,
self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the
noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and
practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. I
tell you these facts that you may know why I have such confidence in
him. I have asked him to come at once. I shall see Miss Westenra
to-morrow again. She is to meet me at the Stores, so that I may not
alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call.

"My good Friend,--

"When I have received your letter I am already coming to you. By good
fortune I can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have
trusted me. Were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have
trusted, for I come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds
dear. Tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so
swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other
friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when he wants my
aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. But it
is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that I come.
Have then rooms for me at the Great Eastern Hotel, so that I may be near
to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too
late on to-morrow, for it is likely that I may have to return here that
night. But if need be I shall come again in three days, and stay longer
if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.

 "VAN HELSING."


_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._

"_3 September._

"My dear Art,--

"Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and
found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of
the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of
course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,
but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you
trust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.
Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not
jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I asked
what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had
come back to town, and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his
return to Amsterdam. He would not give me any further clue. You must not
be angry with me, Art, because his very reticence means that all his
brains are working for her good. He will speak plainly enough when the
time comes, be sure. So I told him I would simply write an account of
our visit, just as if I were doing a descriptive special article for
_The Daily Telegraph_. He seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
smuts in London were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a
student here. I am to get his report to-morrow if he can possibly make
it. In any case I am to have a letter.

"Well, as to the visit. Lucy was more cheerful than on the day I first
saw her, and certainly looked better. She had lost something of the
ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. She was
very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
feel at ease; though I could see that the poor girl was making a hard
struggle for it. I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick
look under his bushy brows that I knew of old. Then he began to chat of
all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
geniality that I could see poor Lucy's pretense of animation merge into
reality. Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation
gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--

"'My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so
much beloved. That is much, my dear, ever were there that which I do not
see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
ghastly pale. To them I say: "Pouf!"' And he snapped his fingers at me
and went on: 'But you and I shall show them how wrong they are. How can
he'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with
which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a
particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anything
of a young ladies? He has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,
oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the
young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to
smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all
to ourselves.' I took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but
said: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional
cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have
asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,
that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.
And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go
back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if
there be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well
is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'

"As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.
And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust
your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my
dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who
are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and
you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to
come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
me."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_4 September._--Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just
before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a
run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so
violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five
minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The
attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the
other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite
understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was
some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,
woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
something directly. I cannot quite understand it.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Another change in my patient. At five o'clock I looked in on
him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be. He
was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad
conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be led back to
his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to
humour him: so he is back in his room with the window open. He has the
sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a
box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not
rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of
far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--

"All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do
it for myself!" Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:
"Doctor, won't you be very good to me and let me have a little more
sugar? I think it would be good for me."

"And the flies?" I said.

"Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like
it." And there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man
as, I suppose, any in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Midnight._--Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra,
whom I found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As
his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in
the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky
beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less
frenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an
inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what intellectual
recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up
quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to
hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight
over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his
fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut
the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised
me, so I asked him: "Are you not going to keep flies any more?"

"No," said he; "I am sick of all that rubbish!" He certainly is a
wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his
mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue
after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at
periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?
We shall see.

CHAPTER X


_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._

"_6 September._

"My dear Art,--

"My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.
There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.
Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me
professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told
her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with
myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak
condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with
difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall
come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you
do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for
news. In haste

Yours ever,

"JOHN SEWARD."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at
Liverpool Street was:--

"Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?"

"No," I said. "I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I
wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming, as Miss
Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be."

"Right, my friend," he said, "quite right! Better he not know as yet;
perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but if it be needed, then he
shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal
with the madmen. All men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God's madmen,
too--the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why
you do it; you tell them not what you think. So you shall keep knowledge
in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it
and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and here." He
touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
the same way. "I have for myself thoughts at the present. Later I shall
unfold to you."

"Why not now?" I asked. "It may do some good; we may arrive at some
decision." He stopped and looked at me, and said:--

"My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has
ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the
ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
and say to you: 'Look! he's good corn; he will make good crop when the
time comes.'" I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply
he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: "The good husbandman tell
you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the
good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for
the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
the work of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn,
and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,
there's some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell." He broke
off, for he evidently saw that I understood. Then he went on, and very
gravely:--

"You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more
full than the rest. You were only student then; now you are master, and
I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that
knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that this
case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, I say _may be_--of such
interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is too
small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
Hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. We
learn from failure, not from success!"

When I described Lucy's symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely
more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. He took with him a
bag in which were many instruments and drugs, "the ghastly paraphernalia
of our beneficial trade," as he once called, in one of his lectures, the
equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,
Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I
expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case
where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her
daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is
something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an
envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered
selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
knowledge of.

I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness
more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that
I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were
shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I
was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not
seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then
Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The
instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to
the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and
closed the door. "My God!" he said; "this is dreadful. There is no time
to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's
action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is
it you or me?"

"I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me."

"Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared."

I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at
the hall-door. When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in
an eager whisper:--

"Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and
have been in an agony. The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for
myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I am so thankful to you,
sir, for coming." When first the Professor's eye had lit upon him he had
been angry at his interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in
his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to
him gravely as he held out his hand:--

"Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is
bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that." For he
suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. "You are to
help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
best help."

"What can I do?" asked Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me, and I shall do it. My
life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for
her." The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old
knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--

"My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!"

"What shall I do?" There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder. "Come!"
he said. "You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than
me, better than my friend John." Arthur looked bewildered, and the
Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--

"Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have
or die. My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform
what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to
the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is
the more young and strong than me"--here Arthur took my hand and wrung
it hard in silence--"but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not
so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!" Arthur turned to him
and said:--

"If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would
understand----"

He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.

"Good boy!" said Van Helsing. "In the not-so-far-off you will be happy
that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You
shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with
her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!"

We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.
Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not
asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke
to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid
them on a little table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and
coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--

"Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good
child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy. Yes." She had made
the effort with success.

It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked
the extent of her weakness. The time seemed endless until sleep began to
flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
its potency; and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was
satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
coat. Then he added: "You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring
over the table. Friend John, help to me!" So neither of us looked whilst
he bent over her.

Van Helsing turning to me, said:

"He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
defibrinate it."

Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the
operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy
of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow
anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he
was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must
have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.
But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own
heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: "Do not stir an instant.
It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her." When all was over I
could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his
arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the
man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--

"The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have
presently." And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the
pillow to the patient's head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band
which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,
and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing's
ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing at the moment, but turned to
me, saying: "Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
wine, and let him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep
much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to
his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir,
that you are anxious of result. Then bring it with you that in all ways
the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you
can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell
her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
have done. Good-bye."

When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently,
but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her
breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.
The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a
whisper:--

"What do you make of that mark on her throat?"

"What do you make of it?"

"I have not examined it yet," I answered, and then and there proceeded
to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two
punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of
disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it
was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned
the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed
would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must
have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.

"Well?" said Van Helsing.

"Well," said I, "I can make nothing of it." The Professor stood up. "I
must go back to Amsterdam to-night," he said. "There are books and
things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you
must not let your sight pass from her."

"Shall I have a nurse?" I asked.

"We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that
she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all
the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as
possible. And then we may begin."

"May begin?" I said. "What on earth do you mean?"

"We shall see!" he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment
later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
up:--

"Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you
shall not sleep easy hereafter!"


_Dr. Seward's Diary--continued._

_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself
off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being
from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,
and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the
absolute prostration which she had undergone. When I told Mrs. Westenra
that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she
almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed
strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made
preparations for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the
night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by
the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
gratefully whenever I caught her eye. After a long spell she seemed
sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
and shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort
and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It was apparent that she
did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--

"You do not want to go to sleep?"

"No; I am afraid."

"Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for."

"Ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!"

"A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?"

"I don't know; oh, I don't know. And that is what is so terrible. All
this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I dread the very thought."

"But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and
I can promise that nothing will happen."

"Ah, I can trust you!" I seized the opportunity, and said: "I promise
you that if I see any evidence of bad dreams I will wake you at once."

"You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will
sleep!" And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank
back, asleep.

All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on
in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were
slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad
dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.

In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took
myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short
wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result
of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all
day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my
zoöphagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the
past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst
I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as
it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the
night mail and would join me early in the morning.

       *       *       *       *       *

_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to
Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my
brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands
with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--

"No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well
again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who
will sit up with you." I would not argue the point, but went and had my
supper. Lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I
made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more than
excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next
her own, where a cozy fire was burning. "Now," she said, "you must stay
here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the
sofa for I know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I want anything I
shall call out, and you can come to me at once." I could not but
acquiesce, for I was "dog-tired," and could not have sat up had I tried.
So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything,
I lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.


_Lucy Westenra's Diary._

_9 September._--I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak,
that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very,
very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose
it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give Love
rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know
where my thoughts are. If Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears
must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me.
And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since he is close at hand and
within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God!
Good-night, Arthur.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and
started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn
in an asylum, at any rate.

"And how is our patient?"

"Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me," I answered.

"Come, let us see," he said. And together we went into the room.

The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van
Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.

As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I
heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and
his exclamation of horror, "Gott in Himmel!" needed no enforcement from
his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.

There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly
white and wan-looking than ever. Even the lips were white, and the gums
seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp
in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
stood to him, and he put it down again softly. "Quick!" he said. "Bring
the brandy." I flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising
suspense said:--

"It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is
undone; we must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have
to call on you yourself this time, friend John." As he spoke, he was
dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I
had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no
possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so,
without a moment's delay, we began the operation. After a time--it did
not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one's blood, no
matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling--Van Helsing
held up a warning finger. "Do not stir," he said, "but I fear that with
growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection
of morphia." He proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
subtly into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride
that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to
feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves.

The Professor watched me critically. "That will do," he said. "Already?"
I remonstrated. "You took a great deal more from Art." To which he
smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:--

"He is her lover, her _fiancé_. You have work, much work, to do for her
and for others; and the present will suffice."

When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied
digital pressure to my own incision. I laid down, whilst I waited his
leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by
he bound up my wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for
myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and half
whispered:--

"Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up
unexpected, as before, no word to him. It would at once frighten him and
enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!"

When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:--

"You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me."

I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I
had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. I
felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
what had occurred. I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how
she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to
show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
edges--tiny though they were.

Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing
had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict
injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his
voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.

Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother
came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
said to me gratefully:--

"We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really
must now take care not to overwork yourself. You are looking pale
yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you
do!" As she spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
imploring eyes on me. I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.

Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me:
"Now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. Make yourself strong. I
stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and
I must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave
reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do not fear to think
even the most not-probable. Good-night."

In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
them might not sit up with Miss Lucy. They implored me to let them; and
when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit
up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the "foreign
gentleman." I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because
I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that
their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen
similar instances of woman's kindness. I got back here in time for a
late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting
for sleep. It is coming.

       *       *       *       *       *

_11 September._--This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van
Helsing in excellent spirits, and Lucy much better. Shortly after I had
arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it
with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed a great bundle of
white flowers.

"These are for you, Miss Lucy," he said.

"For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!"

"Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines." Here
Lucy made a wry face. "Nay, but they are not to take in a decoction or
in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall
point out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing
so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my pretty miss,
that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but
you do not know how. I put him in your window, I make pretty wreath, and
hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the
lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters
of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the Conquistadores sought
for in the Floridas, and find him all too late."

Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
them. Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
half-disgust:--

"Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why,
these flowers are only common garlic."

To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--

"No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do;
and I warn you that you do not thwart me. Take care, for the sake of
others if not for your own." Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might
well be, he went on more gently: "Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the
wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so
inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;
and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall
help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,
where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here."

We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor's
actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia
that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows and latched them
securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over
the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed
all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
the fireplace in the same way. It all seemed grotesque to me, and
presently I said:--

"Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but
this certainly puzzles me. It is well we have no sceptic here, or he
would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit."

"Perhaps I am!" he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which
Lucy was to wear round her neck.

We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
neck. The last words he said to her were:--

"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
not to-night open the window or the door."

"I promise," said Lucy, "and thank you both a thousand times for all
your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to be blessed with such
friends?"

As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--

"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel,
much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early
you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
more strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"

He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights
before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must
have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.




CHAPTER XI

_Lucy Westenra's Diary._


_12 September._--How good they all are to me. I quite love that dear Dr.
Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been
right, for I feel comfort from them already. Somehow, I do not dread
being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I shall not
mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I
have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no
dreads; to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings
nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am to-night, hoping for sleep,
and lying like Ophelia in the play, with "virgin crants and maiden
strewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
There is peace in its smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night,
everybody.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_13 September._--Called at the Berkeley and found Van Helsing, as usual,
up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.

Let all be put down exactly. Van Helsing and I arrived at Hillingham at
eight o'clock. It was a lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's
annual work. The leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. When we entered we met
Mrs. Westenra coming out of the morning room. She is always an early
riser. She greeted us warmly and said:--

"You will be glad to know that Lucy is better. The dear child is still
asleep. I looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest I
should disturb her." The Professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. He
rubbed his hands together, and said:--

"Aha! I thought I had diagnosed the case. My treatment is working," to
which she answered:--

"You must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. Lucy's state this
morning is due in part to me."

"How you do mean, ma'am?" asked the Professor.

"Well, I was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
her room. She was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did
not wake her. But the room was awfully stuffy. There were a lot of those
horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
a bunch of them round her neck. I feared that the heavy odour would be
too much for the dear child in her weak state, so I took them all away
and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air. You will be
pleased with her, I am sure."

She moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. As
she had spoken, I watched the Professor's face, and saw it turn ashen
grey. He had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
was present, for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be;
he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into
her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and
forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.

Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He
raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat
his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair,
and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised
his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. "God! God!
God!" he said. "What have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
we are so sore beset? Is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? This poor
mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. Oh, how we are
beset! How are all the powers of the devils against us!" Suddenly he
jumped to his feet. "Come," he said, "come, we must see and act. Devils
or no devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
all the same." He went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we
went up to Lucy's room.

Once again I drew up the blind, whilst Van Helsing went towards the bed.
This time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same
awful, waxen pallor as before. He wore a look of stern sadness and
infinite pity.

"As I expected," he murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
meant so much. Without a word he went and locked the door, and then
began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
operation of transfusion of blood. I had long ago recognised the
necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but he stopped me with a
warning hand. "No!" he said. "To-day you must operate. I shall provide.
You are weakened already." As he spoke he took off his coat and rolled
up his shirt-sleeve.

Again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. This time I
watched whilst Van Helsing recruited himself and rested.

Presently he took an opportunity of telling Mrs. Westenra that she must
not remove anything from Lucy's room without consulting him; that the
flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
was a part of the system of cure. Then he took over the care of the case
himself, saying that he would watch this night and the next and would
send me word when to come.

After another hour Lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.

What does it all mean? I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.


_Lucy Westenra's Diary._

_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong
again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some
long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim
half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,
however, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my
wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and
commanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now
without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown
quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from
Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a
day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left
alone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our
friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for
last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found
him asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,
although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
the window-panes.


_"The Pall Mall Gazette," 18 September._

                           THE ESCAPED WOLF.

         PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.

         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens._

After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
the words "Pall Mall Gazette" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find
the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf
department is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in
the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
elderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their
hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
comfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called "business"
until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the
table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--

"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose me
refoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the
wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
I begins to arsk them questions."

"How do you mean, ask them questions?" I queried, wishful to get him
into a talkative humour.

"'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin' of
their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf
to their gals. I don't so much mind the fust--the 'ittin' with a pole
afore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they've 'ad their
sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the
ear-scratchin'. Mind you," he added philosophically, "there's a deal of
the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a-comin' and
arskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that
only for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'd
answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I'd like you to
arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence
did I tell yer to go to 'ell?"

"You did."

"An' when you said you'd report me for usin' of obscene language that
was 'ittin' me over the 'ead; but the 'arf-quid made that all right. I
weren't a-goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owl
as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor' love yer 'art, now
that the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an' rinsed
me out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratch
my ears for all you're worth, and won't git even a growl out of me.
Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin' at, that 'ere
escaped wolf."

"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it
happened; and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what you
consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
end."

"All right, guv'nor. This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolf
what we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
Norway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a
nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm more
surprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in the
place. But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women."

"Don't you mind him, sir!" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. "'E's
got mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf
'isself! But there ain't no 'arm in 'im."

"Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I first
hear my disturbance. I was makin' up a litter in the monkey-house for a
young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem
away straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the
bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about that
day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook
nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. He
had a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,
for it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad white
kid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:
'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'

"'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give
'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kind
of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, they
wouldn't like me,' 'e says.

"'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a
bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you 'as a
bagful.'

"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' they
lay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears
same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put
in his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!

"'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'

"'Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'

"'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for a
man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.

"'No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets of
several.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks
away. Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight,
and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole
hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
here all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.
There warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' a
dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice
I went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling
stopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore
turnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's
cage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And
that's all I know for certing."

"Did any one else see anything?"

"One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony,
when he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. At
least, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'e
never said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it was
only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
night-a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein'
anything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead."

"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
wolf?"

"Well, sir," he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, "I think I can;
but I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory."

"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from
experience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?"

"Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'ere
wolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out."

From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I
could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinage
with the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,
so I said:--

"Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me
what you think will happen."

"Right y'are, sir," he said briskly. "Ye'll excoose me, I know, for
a-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
as telling me to go on."

"Well, I never!" said the old lady.

"My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a-'idin' of, somewheres. The
gard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin' northward faster
than a horse could go; but I don't believe him, for, yer see, sir,
wolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built that
way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets
in packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is
they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,
Lor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so
clever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in
'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for
hisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a-'idin' an'
a-shiverin' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to get
his breakfast from; or maybe he's got down some area and is in a
coal-cellar. My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees his
green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he's
bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's
shop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin' orf with
a soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I
shouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That's
all."

I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
against the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length
with surprise.

"God bless me!" he said. "If there ain't old Bersicker come back by
'isself!"

He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it
seemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so
well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.

After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor
his wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal
itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
picture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her
confidence in masquerade.

The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The
wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the
children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of
penitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine
prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender
solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--

"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
didn't I say it all along? Here's his head all cut and full of broken
glass. 'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other. It's a
shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
This 'ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker."

He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that
satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
fatted calf, and went off to report.

I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
to-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,
had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was
thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord
into the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's
pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,
as I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was
too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my
balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.
Before he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was
sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a
little pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not
intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the
attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking
up, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was
easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
placidly, simply repeating over and over again: "The blood is the life!
The blood is the life!"

I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of
late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's
illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and
weary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned
me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without
it.


_Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._

(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by
twenty-two hours.)

"_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not
watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as
placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as
possible after arrival."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van
Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know
by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is
possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely
there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with
me, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph.


_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._

_17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
one may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact
record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and
have barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the
doing.

I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.
Van Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.

I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I
know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in
the next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have
called him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me
the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep
would try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be
alone, I opened my door and called out: "Is there anybody there?" There
was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
Then outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but
more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could
see nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
wings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined
not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
seeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She
said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--

"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
right."

I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while
and then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in
hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was
startled and a little frightened, and cried out: "What is that?" I tried
to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could
hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was
the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
crash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey
wolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting
posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst
other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing
insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a
second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange
and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck
with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a
moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my
eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole
myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to
stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,
which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to
beat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.

The time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered
consciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the
dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
seemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and
stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
me. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear
their bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they
came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
over me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the
broken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my
dear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I
had got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them
to go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew
open for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went
in a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear
mother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing
had told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would
have some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that
the maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went
to the dining-room to look for them.

My heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless
on the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table
half full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,
and examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
sideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for
her--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back
in the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for
the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I
dare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
broken window.

The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God
shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,
where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother
gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not
survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!




CHAPTER XII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.
Keeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently
and rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her
mother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,
finding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed
the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
hour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but
more impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only
the servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this
desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
tight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too
late? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
danger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
and I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry
anywhere.

I could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and
locked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the
rapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the
gate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.
When he saw me, he gasped out:--

"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you
not get my telegram?"

I answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his
telegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,
and that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and
raised his hat as he said solemnly:--

"Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!" With his usual
recuperative energy, he went on: "Come. If there be no way open to get
in, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now."

We went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen
window. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and
handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I
attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then
with a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
opened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There
was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at
hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,
dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
servant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,
for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
room left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at
each other, and as we moved away he said: "We can attend to them later."
Then we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the
door to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white
faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
room.

How shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her
mother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white
sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror
fixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more
drawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
mother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
Without a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
poor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who
listens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--

"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!"

I flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found
on the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I
fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,
but returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another
occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
hands. He said to me:--

"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.
Flick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them
get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as
that beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything
more."

I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
women. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently
affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her
sleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life
was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
as they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and
boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We
got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst
we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One
of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then
she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come
with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he
must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,
and, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.

I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly
earnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,
and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not
understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--

"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
away into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon." He went
on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.

Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
be of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the
stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's
face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--

"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!"

We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed
that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was
still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
ever seen her.

Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
out of the room.

"We must consult as to what is to be done," he said as we descended the
stairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he
closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but
the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly
observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light
enough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved
by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--

"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have
another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life
won't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am
exhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have
courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his
veins for her?"

"What's the matter with me, anyhow?"

The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van
Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: "Quincey Morris!" and
rushed towards him with outstretched hands.

"What brought you here?" I cried as our hands met.

"I guess Art is the cause."

He handed me a telegram:--

"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
Cannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.
Do not delay.--HOLMWOOD."

"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell
me what to do."

Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
the eyes as he said:--

"A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in
trouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against
us for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them."

Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart
to go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it
told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
occasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van
Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
good effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched
whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids
to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down
after having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good
breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where
Lucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or
two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was
thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look
of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.
He handed me the paper saying only: "It dropped from Lucy's breast when
we carried her to the bath."

When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause
asked him: "In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,
mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?" I was so bewildered that I
did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the
paper, saying:--

"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know
and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what
is it that you came to me to say?" This brought me back to fact, and I
was all myself again.

"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act
properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we
had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you
know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra
had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us
fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the
registrar and go on to the undertaker."

"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be
sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the
more for it! Now go."

In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him
that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now
going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him
where I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--

"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to
ourselves?" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about
the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.

When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him
as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still
sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
side. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he
expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
the blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or
rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said
to me:--

"Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no
right to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl
and wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't
help feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong
with her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see
that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.
Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man
must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is
no common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that
so?"

"That's so," I said, and he went on:--

"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did
to-day. Is not that so?"

"That's so."

"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his
own place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick
since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass
all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a
bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without
betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?" As he spoke
the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense
regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very
heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a
royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before
answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the
Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed
so much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered
in the same phrase: "That's so."

"And how long has this been going on?"

"About ten days."

"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature
that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it." Then,
coming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: "What took it
out?"

I shook my head. "That," I said, "is the crux. Van Helsing is simply
frantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.
There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out
all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall
not occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill." Quincey held
out his hand. "Count me in," he said. "You and the Dutchman will tell me
what to do, and I'll do it."

When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel
in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing
had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had
come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van
Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,
and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her
poor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that
meant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried
what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with
her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell
into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she
took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped
over and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on
with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
the fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
if in thought, but he said nothing.

       *       *       *       *       *

_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and
I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment
unattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew
that all night long he patrolled round and round the house.

When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's
strength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she
slept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between
sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying
one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
Quincey went off to meet him at the station.

When he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full
and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking
with emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,
the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
were shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a
stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
had done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as
cheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.

It was now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with
her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering
this on Lucy's phonograph. Until six o'clock they are to try to rest. I
fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.

"_17 September._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You
will pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my
budget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived
at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had
an attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there
were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After
dinner Mr. Hawkins said:--

"'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
blessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with
love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here
with me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
my will I have left you everything.' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and
the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.

"So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral
close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
rooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and
housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the
clients.

"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a
day or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my
shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to
put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the
long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden
way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual
placidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the
days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now
I have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,
and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,
dear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his
'respectful duty,' but I do not think that is good enough from the
junior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you
love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses
of the verb, I send you simply his 'love' instead. Good-bye, my dearest
Lucy, and all blessings on you.

"Yours,

"MINA HARKER."


_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,
etc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._

"_20 September._

"My dear Sir,--

"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of
everything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there
is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a
dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men
made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to
which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at
our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was
myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and
saw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of
Renfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a
decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to "shut up for a
foul-mouthed beggar," whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to
swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless
yer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I
pity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild
beast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him
where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats
and curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could
make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a
well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe
that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to
say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the
window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the
attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent
on some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which
had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
face, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the
patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
knock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the
moment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other
fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his
heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but
seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others
were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we
began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat
on him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!
they shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and
all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable
difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set
it all right; and he is going on well.

"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their
threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it
had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
him. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
labours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their
drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
with each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of
meeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent. I took their
names and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as
follows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, Great
Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal
Green. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and
Shipment Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho.

"I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
wire you at once if there is anything of importance.

"_18 September._

"My dearest Lucy,--

"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.
Some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either
father or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.
Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,
deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a
fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the
amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He
begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_
helps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave
shock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard
that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which
enabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master
in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its
strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in
the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some one,
for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan
tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming
up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.
Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his
father. As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief
mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few
minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,

"Your loving

_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry
to-night. I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard
this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has
been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy's mother
and Arthur's father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.

I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to
go to rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when I told him
that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed
to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. "Come, my child," he said;
"come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. You
must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two
sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will
be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
sleep." Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on Lucy's
face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay
quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it
should be. I could see that the Professor had carried out in this room,
as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy's neck, over the silk
handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of
the same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. Her
teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
had been in the morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the
canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat down by her,
and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort
of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. I went over to it softly,
and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight,
and I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled
round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now
and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat,
I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
flowers from her throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat
watching her.

Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.
She took but a little, and that languidly. There did not seem to be with
her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
so marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she
became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. It was
certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making any
mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.

At six o'clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen
into a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on. When he saw Lucy's face
I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a
sharp whisper: "Draw up the blind; I want light!" Then he bent down,
and, with his face almost touching Lucy's, examined her carefully. He
removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As
he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, "Mein
Gott!" as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,
and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.

The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.

For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face
at its sternest. Then he turned to me and said calmly:--

"She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark
me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. Wake that poor boy, and
let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him."

I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but
when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy
was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van
Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his face with his
hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,
perhaps a minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. "Come," I
said, "my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
and easiest for her."

When we came into Lucy's room I could see that Van Helsing had, with
his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even brushed Lucy's
hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we
came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
softly:--

"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!" He was stooping to
kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him back. "No," he whispered, "not
yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more."

So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. Then
gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her
breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child's.

And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in
the night. Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a
sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice,
such as I had never heard from her lips:--

"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!" Arthur bent
eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,
had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which
I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
across the room.

"Not for your life!" he said; "not for your living soul and hers!" And
he stood between them like a lion at bay.

Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do
or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised
the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.

I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as
of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.

Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing's great brown
one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. "My true friend," she said, in a
faint voice, but with untellable pathos, "My true friend, and his! Oh,
guard him, and give me peace!"

"I swear it!" he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
hand, as one who registers an oath. Then he turned to Arthur, and said
to him: "Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
forehead, and only once."

Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.

Lucy's eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took
Arthur's arm, and drew him away.

And then Lucy's breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
ceased.

"It is all over," said Van Helsing. "She is dead!"

I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he
sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that
nearly broke me down to see.

I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and
his face was sterner than ever. Some change had come over her body.
Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working
of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
might be.

    "We thought her dying whilst she slept,
        And sleeping when she died."

I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--

"Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!"

He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--

"Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!"

When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--

"We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see."




CHAPTER XIII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.


The funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and
her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly
formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.
Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
from the death-chamber:--

"She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite a privilege to
attend on her. It's not too much to say that she will do credit to our
establishment!"

I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from
the disordered state of things in the household. There were no relatives
at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
father's funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it upon
ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy's
papers himself. I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a
foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and
so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:--

"I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But
this is not altogether for the law. You knew that, when you avoided the
coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more--such
as this."

As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.

"When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.
Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. For me, I watch
here in the room and in Miss Lucy's old room all night, and I myself
search for what may be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into
the hands of strangers."

I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
the name and address of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and had written to
him. All the poor lady's papers were in order; explicit directions
regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the
letter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,
saying:--

"Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to
you."

"Have you got what you looked for?" I asked, to which he replied:--

"I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I
have, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a
diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say
nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
his sanction, I shall use some."

When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--

"And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you
and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we shall have much to do, but
for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!"

Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had
certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small
_chapelle ardente_. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
and death was made as little repulsive as might be. The end of the
winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over and
turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well. All Lucy's
loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
instead of leaving traces of "decay's effacing fingers," had but
restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes
that I was looking at a corpse.

The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and
there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: "Remain till I
return," and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic
from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he
took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and
placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet to its place, and we
came away.

I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the
door, he entered, and at once began to speak:--

"To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem
knives."

"Must we make an autopsy?" I asked.

"Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you
now, but not a word to another. I want to cut off her head and take out
her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with
no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John, that
you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall
operate, and you must only help. I would like to do it to-night, but for
Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father's funeral to-morrow,
and he will want to see her--to see _it_. Then, when she is coffined
ready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep. We shall
unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
all, so that none know, save we alone."

"But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body
without need? And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and nothing
to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human
knowledge--why do it? Without such it is monstrous."

For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
tenderness:--

"Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more
because it does so bleed. If I could, I would take on myself the burden
that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you
shall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant
things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err--I am but
man; but I believe in all I do. Was it not for these causes that you
send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was
dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? Yes! And yet you saw
how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not
hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? Yes!

"Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many
years trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so
strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend
John. If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is
not perhaps well. And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no
trust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart and feel,
oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!" He paused a
moment and went on solemnly: "Friend John, there are strange and
terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
a good end. Will you not have faith in me?"

I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away,
and watched him go into his room and close the door. As I stood without
moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had
her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy
lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl
putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....

       *       *       *       *       *

I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van
Helsing waked me by coming into my room. He came over to my bedside and
said:--

"You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it."

"Why not?" I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly
impressed me.

"Because," he said sternly, "it is too late--or too early. See!" Here he
held up the little golden crucifix. "This was stolen in the night."

"How, stolen," I asked in wonder, "since you have it now?"

"Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
woman who robbed the dead and the living. Her punishment will surely
come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
unknowing, she only stole. Now we must wait."

He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a
new puzzle to grapple with.

The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.
Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale. He was very genial
and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
cares as to details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for
some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain
entailed property of Lucy's father's which now, in default of direct
issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
told us so much he went on:--

"Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and
pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial
alliance. Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were
right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should
have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of
disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come
into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her
mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
will--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have been
treated at her decease as under intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming,
though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the
inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. I assure
you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced."

He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which
he was officially interested--of so great a tragedy, was an
object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.

He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and
see Lord Godalming. His coming, however, had been a certain comfort to
us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
criticism as to any of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o'clock, so
a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was so in
very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker,
true to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods, and
there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
once. Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be
less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_
quite alone. The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
the night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings
as we could avoid were saved.

Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a
bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he
was sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some
constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to
bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I
felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and
led me in, saying huskily:--

"You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was
no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to
thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet...."

Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
laid his head on my breast, crying:--

"Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me
all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for."

I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much
expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's
heart. I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said
softly to him:--

"Come and look at her."

Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.
God! how beautiful she was. Every hour seemed to be enhancing her
loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he
fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At
last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--

"Jack, is she really dead?"

I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt
that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than
I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became
softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and
long, he turned aside. I told him that that must be good-bye, as the
coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his
and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away,
fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.

I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said
good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men
to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he
came out of the room again I told him of Arthur's question, and he
replied:--

"I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!"

We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make
the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but
when we had lit our cigars he said--

"Lord----"; but Arthur interrupted him:--

"No, no, not that, for God's sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir:
I did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
recent."

The Professor answered very sweetly:--

"I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you
'Mr.,' and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as
Arthur."

Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man's warmly.

"Call me what you will," he said. "I hope I may always have the title of
a friend. And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for
your goodness to my poor dear." He paused a moment, and went on: "I know
that she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was
rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember"--the
Professor nodded--"you must forgive me."

He answered with a grave kindness:--

"I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such
violence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you
cannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be
more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may
not--and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust
shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from
first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
dear sake to whom I swore to protect."

"And, indeed, indeed, sir," said Arthur warmly, "I shall in all ways
trust you. I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are
Jack's friend, and you were hers. You shall do what you like."

The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to
speak, and finally said:--

"May I ask you something now?"

"Certainly."

"You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?"

"No, poor dear; I never thought of it."

"And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I
want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy's papers and
letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which,
be sure, she would have approved. I have them all here. I took them
before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch
them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep
them, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them
safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back
to you. It's a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
Lucy's sake?"

Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I
am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you
with questions till the time comes."

The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--

"And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be
all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too--you most of
all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we
reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
duty, and all will be well!"

I slept on a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Helsing did not go to
bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_22 September._--In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.

It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
between then, in Whitby and all the world before me, Jonathan away and
no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a
partner, rich, master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and
Jonathan with another attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me
about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand--see what
unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up
again with an exercise anyhow....

The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves
and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from Exeter, his
London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the
President of the Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in
hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....

We came back to town quietly, taking a 'bus to Hyde Park Corner.
Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the Row for a while, so
we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. It made us think
of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days
before I went to school. I felt it very improper, for you can't go on
for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the
pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he
was my husband, and we didn't know anybody who saw us--and we didn't
care if they did--so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful
girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano's,
when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said
under his breath: "My God!" I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I
fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to him
quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.

He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and
black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
girl. He was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us,
and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good face; it was
hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal's.
Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I
feared he might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked
Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently thinking that
I knew as much about it as he did: "Do you see who it is?"

"No, dear," I said; "I don't know him; who is it?" His answer seemed to
shock and thrill me, for it was said as if he did not know that it was
to me, Mina, to whom he was speaking:--

"It is the man himself!"

The poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly
terrified; I do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to
support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of
the shop with a small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a
hansom. Jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--

"I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be
so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if I only knew!" He was
distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the
subject by asking him any questions, so I remained silent. I drew him
away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was
a hot day for autumn, and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place.
After a few minutes' staring at nothing, Jonathan's eyes closed, and he
went quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it
was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. In about twenty
minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:--

"Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude.
Come, and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere." He had evidently forgotten
all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that
this episode had reminded him of. I don't like this lapsing into
forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. I must
not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow
learn the facts of his journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I
must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will,
I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--A sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear
soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight
relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
may be:--

"You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and
that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day."

Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor
Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And poor, poor Arthur, to have
lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all to bear our
troubles.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_22 September._--It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has
taken Quincey Morris with him. What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe
in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy's death as any
of us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America
can go on breeding men like that, she will be a power in the world
indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his
journey. He goes over to Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns
to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can
only be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says
he has work to do in London which may take him some time. Poor old
fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
iron strength. All the time of the burial he was, I could see, putting
some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were
standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in
the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy's veins; I
could see Van Helsing's face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was
saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married
and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of
the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went
away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The
moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of
hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted
that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down
the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,
till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman
does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in
manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew
grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
forceful and mysterious. He said:--

"Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come
just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
door and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is a
king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no
time of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my
heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though
I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other
sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very
grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood
from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of
the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his
hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend
John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even
at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,
'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of
the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is
a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and
troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the
tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he
make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that
he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,
like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the
sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
our labour, what it may be."

I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I
did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
tone:--

"Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with
flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going 'Toll!
toll! toll!' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all
for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?"

"Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can't see anything to
laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking."

"Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
made her truly his bride?"

"Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him."

"Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,
and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though
no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
am bigamist."

"I don't see where the joke comes in there either!" I said; and I did
not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
his hand on my arm, and said:--

"Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for
he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would
perhaps pity me the most of all."

I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.

"Because I know!"

And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming
London; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill,
and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.

So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin
another. If I do, or if I even open this again, it will be to deal with
different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
romance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my
life-work, I say sadly and without hope,

                        "FINIS."


_"The Westminster Gazette," 25 September._

                          A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.


The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
was known to the writers of headlines as "The Kensington Horror," or
"The Stabbing Woman," or "The Woman in Black." During the past two or
three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all
these cases the children were too young to give any properly
intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
is that they had been with a "bloofer lady." It has always been late in
the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is
generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
gave as his reason for being away that a "bloofer lady" had asked him to
come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the
little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A
correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
be the "bloofer lady" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists
might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
principles of human nature that the "bloofer lady" should be the popular
rôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely says
that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine
themselves--to be.

There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of
the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be
made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance

a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been

when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
which may be about.

We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
night, was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the
Shooter's Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less
frequented than the other parts. It has the same tiny wound in the
throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and
looked quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common
story to tell of being lured away by the "bloofer lady."




CHAPTER XIV

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that
he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,
and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his
advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch
at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his foreign journal,
and lock myself up in my room and read it....


_24 September_.--I hadn't the heart to write last night; that terrible
record of Jonathan's upset me so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered,
whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth
in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those
terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall
never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man
we saw yesterday! He seemed quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I
suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
train of thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our
wedding-day he said: "Unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to
the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane." There seems to be
through it all some thread of continuity.... That fearful Count was
coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his
teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must
not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared. I shall get my typewriter
this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other
eyes if required. And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready,
poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never let
him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets
over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all, and I can ask him
questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.


_Letter, Van Helsing to Mrs. Harker._

"_24 September._

(_Confidence_)

"Dear Madam,--

"I pray you to pardon my writing, in that I am so far friend as that I
sent to you sad news of Miss Lucy Westenra's death. By the kindness of
Lord Godalming, I am empowered to read her letters and papers, for I am
deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. In them I find
some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you
love her. Oh, Madam Mina, by that love, I implore you, help me. It is
for others' good that I ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much
and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. May it
be that I see you? You can trust me. I am friend of Dr. John Seward and
of Lord Godalming (that was Arthur of Miss Lucy). I must keep it private
for the present from all. I should come to Exeter to see you at once if
you tell me I am privilege to come, and where and when. I implore your
pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good
you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,
enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.

"VAN HELSING."


_Telegram, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing._

"_25 September._--Come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch
it. Can see you any time you call.

"WILHELMINA HARKER."

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL.

_25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that
it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience; and as he
attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real
truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that
awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten
in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him
of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about
it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may
understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.
Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van
Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of
late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.

I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain
does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
occur to upset him. It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon
now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me. I am
so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks
about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--He has come and gone. Oh, what a strange meeting, and how it
all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all
possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan's journal
first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear
Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its
consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt
which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter
which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more
satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a
good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr.
Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after
Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a
noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;
and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's
friend on "The Exeter News" told him that memory was everything in such
work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare
interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.

It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à
deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
announced "Dr. Van Helsing."

I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,
strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and
a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise
of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,
clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile
mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set
widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. He
said to me:--

"Mrs. Harker, is it not?" I bowed assent.

"That was Miss Mina Murray?" Again I assented.

"It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come."

"Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me than that you were
a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra." And I held out my hand. He took
it and said tenderly:--

"Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
good, but I had yet to learn----" He finished his speech with a courtly
bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
once began:--

"I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look
surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain
things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."

"I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it."

"Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always
so with young ladies."

"No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
if you like."

"Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour." I
could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is
some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
bow, and said:--

"May I read it?"

"If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.

"Oh, you so clever woman!" he said. "I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a
man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?
Alas! I know not the shorthand." By this time my little joke was over,
and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
workbasket and handed it to him.

"Forgive me," I said: "I could not help it; but I had been thinking that
it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must
be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you."

He took it and his eyes glistened. "You are so good," he said. "And may
I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read."

"By all means," I said, "read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you
can ask me questions whilst we eat." He bowed and settled himself in a
chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be
disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down
the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and
took me by both hands.

"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so
much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that
you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
clever woman. Madam"--he said this very solemnly--"if ever Abraham Van
Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you
and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and
your husband will be blessed in you."

"But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me."

"Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you
have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
angels' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
husband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and
is he strong and hearty?" I saw here an opening to ask him about
Jonathan, so I said:--

"He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins's
death." He interrupted:--

"Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters." I went
on:--

"I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
had a sort of shock."

"A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of
a shock was it?"

"He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
which led to his brain fever." And here the whole thing seemed to
overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my
hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--

"My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not
had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by
my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such
nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing
years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here
full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I
am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some
use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my
study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him
that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy
one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not
where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat
and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not
speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I
want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I
will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of
husband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat
now; afterwards you shall tell me all."

After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--

"And now tell me all about him." When it came to speaking to this great
learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go
on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
trusted him, so I said:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
have even half believed some very strange things." He reassured me by
his manner as well as his words when he said:--

"Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little
of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep
an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
make one doubt if they be mad or sane."

"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my
mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,
but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
Jonathan's. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
me what you think."

"I promise," he said as I gave him the papers; "I shall in the morning,
so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may."

"Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
will leave you at Paddington before eight." He was surprised at my
knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made
up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
case he is in a hurry.

So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here
thinking--thinking I don't know what.

"Dear Madam Mina,--

"I have read your husband's so wonderful diary. You may sleep without
doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! I will pledge my
life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no
dread. He is a noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men,
that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that
room--ay, and going a second time--is not one to be injured in
permanence by a shock. His brain and his heart are all right; this I
swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to
ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for
I have learn all at once so much that again I am dazzle--dazzle more

"A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight
off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in
the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really
in London! I fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a
wire from Jonathan, saying that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from
Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall have no fear
to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
to breakfast at eight o'clock, if this be not too early for you? You can
get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring
you to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that,
if I do not hear, you will come to breakfast.

"Your faithful and grateful friend,

"MINA HARKER."


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her having
given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
about me. She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was
true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the
reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in
the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even
of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing
is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I
shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....

He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he
was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my
face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--

"But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock." It was
so funny to hear my wife called "Madam Mina" by this kindly,
strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--

"I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already."

"And how?"

"By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know
what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
myself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even
yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours." He
seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--

"So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife." I
would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
and stood silent.

"She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and
other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
selfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our
lives."

We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
choky.

"And now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help? I have a great
task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.
Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I
may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do."

"Look here, sir," I said, "does what you have to do concern the Count?"

"It does," he said solemnly.

"Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you
will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.
You can take them with you and read them in the train."

After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he
said:--

"Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina
too."

"We shall both come when you will," I said.

I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to
catch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette"--I knew it by
the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
groaning to himself: "Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!" I do not
think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
the window and waved his hand, calling out: "Love to Madam Mina; I shall
write so soon as ever I can."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
since I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had
just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble
to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I
gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with
him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of
good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He
went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came
back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock,
and thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.

"What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded his
arms.

I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he
took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed
away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a
passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An
idea struck me, and I looked up. "Well?" he said.

"It is like poor Lucy's."

"And what do you make of it?"

"Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured
her has injured them." I did not quite understand his answer:--

"That is true indirectly, but not directly."

"How do you mean, Professor?" I asked. I was a little inclined to take
his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but
when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.

"Tell me!" I said. "I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture."

"Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to
what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
events, but by me?"

"Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood."

"And how the blood lost or waste?" I shook my head. He stepped over and
sat down beside me, and went on:--

"You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears
hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But
there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's
eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men
have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not
believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor
in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in
hypnotism----"

"Yes," I said. "Charcot has proved that pretty well." He smiled as he
went on: "Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you
understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
Charcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient
that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
be a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you
accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my
friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned
as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that
Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and
sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor
veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we
could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do
you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me
why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can
you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang
on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are
found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"

"Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up. "Do you mean to tell me that
Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London
in the nineteenth century?" He waved his hand for silence, and went
on:--

"Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
women who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the
fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian
fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?" Here
I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind
his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me
some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but
he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of
thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I
wanted to follow him, so I said:--

"Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an
idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping
from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
knowing where I am going."

"That is good image," he said. "Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
this: I want you to believe."

"To believe what?"

"To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
of an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us to
believe things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.
He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of
truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway
truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value
him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
the universe."

"Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
your lesson aright?"

"Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's
throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?"

"I suppose so." He stood up and said solemnly:--

"Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
far, far worse."

"In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?" I cried.

He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--

"They were made by Miss Lucy!"




CHAPTER XV

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.


For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life
struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to
him:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?" He raised his head and looked at me, and
somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" he
said. "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my
friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell
you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all
my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,
now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
fearful death? Ah no!"

"Forgive me," said I. He went on:--

"My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not
expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove
it. Dare you come with me?"

This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
excepted from the category, jealousy.

    "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."

He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--

"The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock
to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;
at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet
very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,
I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers
say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were
in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he
will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we
wish to learn. And then----"

"And then?" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. "And then we
spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is
the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to
Arthur." My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful
ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what
heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
passing....

We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and
altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its
throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,
and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some
animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think
that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
heights of London. "Out of so many harmless ones," he said, "there may
be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred
there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago
a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a
week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the
Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare
came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even
this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he
might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
to play with the 'bloofer lady.'"

"I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending the child home
you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies
to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will
not let it away for some days?"

"Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
healed."

Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
was, he said:--

"There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way."

We dined at "Jack Straw's Castle" along with a little crowd of
bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we
started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of
the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for
it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found
the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to
precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,
one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was
not the only thing which could pass away.

Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
made assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
out a turnscrew.

"What are you going to do?" I asked.

"To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced." Straightway he began
taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: "You shall see," and again
fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We
doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never
stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of
the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the
edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the
coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to
look.

I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.

It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but
Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,
and so emboldened to proceed in his task. "Are you satisfied now, friend
John?" he asked.

I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
I answered him:--

"I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only
proves one thing."

"And what is that, friend John?"

"That it is not there."

"That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes. But how do you--how
can you--account for it not being there?"

"Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested. "Some of the undertaker's people
may have stolen it." I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was
the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. "Ah
well!" he said, "we must have more proof. Come with me."

He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
locked it. He handed me the key, saying: "Will you keep it? You had
better be assured." I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. "A key is nothing," I said;
"there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
of that kind." He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark
figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
sight.

It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and
unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand
and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had
a dreary, miserable time.

Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I
too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I
stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--

"Are you satisfied now?"

"No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.

"Do you not see the child?"

"Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?" I
asked.

"We shall see," said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way
out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.

When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was
without a scratch or scar of any kind.

"Was I right?" I asked triumphantly.

"We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.

We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to
give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find
it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out
well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy
tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation
of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a
cab near the "Spaniards," and drove to town.

I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'
sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall
go with him on another expedition.

       *       *       *       *       *

_27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable
opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,
and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw
the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till
morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not
want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the
reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.
Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead
nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,
and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,
no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again
courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as
last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.
He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock
of surprise and dismay shot through me.

There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I
could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than
before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.

"Is this a juggle?" I said to him.

"Are you convinced now?" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke
he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the
dead lips and showed the white teeth.

"See," he went on, "see, they are even sharper than before. With this
and this"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
it--"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
John?" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not
accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to
argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--

"She may have been placed here since last night."

"Indeed? That is so, and by whom?"

"I do not know. Some one has done it."

"And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not
look so." I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not
seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor
triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--

"Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know
that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could
he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
the Un-Dead sleep at home"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
his arm to designate what to a vampire was "home"--"their face show what
they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to
the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so
it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep." This turned my blood
cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's
theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
my face, for he said almost joyously:--

"Ah, you believe now?"

I answered: "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
accept. How will you do this bloody work?"

"I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
drive a stake through her body." It made me shudder to think of so
mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing
called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,
or all objective?

I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
snap, and said:--

"I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I
did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is
to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to
want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at
the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know
of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect
Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I
took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me
because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say
good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet
he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will
sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint
his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since
I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he
must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,
must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is
made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see
that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this
churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the
Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,
and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we
shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and
there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set."

So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.


_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to
John Seward, M. D._

(Not delivered.)

"_27 September._

"Friend John,--

"I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not
leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a
crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,
and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss
Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that
she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all
along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, and
we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the
strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and
I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall
find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that
he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his
hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.

"Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,
the diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
great Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake
through it, so that the world may rest from him.

"If it be so, farewell.

"VAN HELSING."



_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for
one. Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous
ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_
rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that
the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that
if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to
some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed
it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van
Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some
light on the mystery.

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,
Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he
wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would
all come with him too, "for," he said, "there is a grave duty to be done
there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?" This query was
directly addressed to Lord Godalming.

"I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the
more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself
that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything."

"Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically.

"Oh," said the Professor, "then you are nearer the beginning, both of
you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
even get so far as to begin."

It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
with intense gravity:--

"I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will
know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me
in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a
time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything."

"That's frank anyhow," broke in Quincey. "I'll answer for the Professor.
I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's good
enough for me."

"I thank you, sir," said Van Helsing proudly. "I have done myself the
honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
to me." He held out a hand, which Quincey took.

Then Arthur spoke out:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as they
say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman
or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of
these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I
cannot understand what you are driving at."

"I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all I ask of you is
that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
reservations."

"Agreed!" said Arthur; "that is only fair. And now that the
_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?"

"I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
Kingstead."

Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--

"Where poor Lucy is buried?" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: "And
when there?"

"To enter the tomb!" Arthur stood up.

"Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,
I see that you are in earnest." He sat down again, but I could see that
he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
silence until he asked again:--

"And when in the tomb?"

"To open the coffin."

"This is too much!" he said, angrily rising again. "I am willing to be
patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration
of the grave--of one who----" He fairly choked with indignation. The
Professor looked pityingly at him.

"If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend," he said, "God knows I
would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!"

Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--

"Take care, sir, take care!"

"Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said Van Helsing.
"And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go
on?"

"That's fair enough," broke in Morris.

After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--

"Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
her. But if she be not dead----"

Arthur jumped to his feet.

"Good God!" he cried. "What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has
she been buried alive?" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could
soften.

"I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
further than to say that she might be Un-Dead."

"Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
is it?"

"There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?"

"Heavens and earth, no!" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. "Not for
the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should
torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad to speak such things, or
am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a
desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do
it!"

Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
said, gravely and sternly:--

"My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty
to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it
may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall
hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
you will." His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of
pity:--

"But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of
acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if
the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can
to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so
much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land
to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and
then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I
am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you
gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her
lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights
and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely." He
said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected
by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--

"Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
shall go with you and wait."




CHAPTER XVI

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_


It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the
churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams
of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly
in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked
well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so
sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it
that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant
to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural
hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.
He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped
forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--

"You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
coffin?"

"It was." The Professor turned to the rest saying:--

"You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me." He
took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
recoiled.

The coffin was empty!

For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
Quincey Morris:--

"Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask
such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a
doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
Is this your doing?"

"I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and
I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which
was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and
saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in
day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?"

"Yes."

"That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came
here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here
all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable
that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last
night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my
garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me
outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
So"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--"now to the outside."
He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the
door behind him.

Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was
to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how
humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each
in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I
could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey
Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to
stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of
tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
also, as they too were curious. He answered:--

"I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter."

"And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?" asked Quincey.
"Great Scott! Is this a game?"

"It is."

"What is that which you are using?" This time the question was by
Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--

"The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence." It was an
answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a
purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places
assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself
been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,
who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
woeful presage through the night.

There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the
Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something
dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of
moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a
child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We
were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as
he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see
clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,
and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of
Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the
tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips
were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.

We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had
not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.

When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form
and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to
the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
back and hid his face in his hands.

She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
said:--

"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!"

There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the
tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us
who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under
a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She
was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between
them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a
suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
the tomb.

When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by
mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,
blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could
kill--we saw it at that moment.

And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--

"Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?"

Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
answered:--

"Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
this ever any more;" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the
click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close
to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
to the edges of the door.

When this was done, he lifted the child and said:

"Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a
funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of
to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow
night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find
him, as on the other night; and then to home." Coming close to Arthur,
he said:--

"My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look
back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have
passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me."

Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
slept with more or less reality of sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,
Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to
notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
fair weight.

When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also
two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own
ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur
trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its
death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but
loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her
soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently
he said to Van Helsing:--

"Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?"

"It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
as she was, and is."

She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to
see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual
methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue
flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about
three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such
as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To
me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was
to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their
courage, and remained silent and quiet.

When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--

"Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey
on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met
that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night
when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would
all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.
The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those
children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be
such a one amongst us?"

We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and
said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
snow:--

"My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me
what I am to do, and I shall not falter!" Van Helsing laid a hand on his
shoulder, and said:--

"Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be
driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in
that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only
think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
you all the time."

"Go on," said Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me what I am to do."

"Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
follow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that
we love and that the Un-Dead pass away."

Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.

The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech
came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur
never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm
rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His
face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
vault.

And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The
terrible task was over.

The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one
to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had
been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,
strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
horror that lay upon it.

There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded
and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in
her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that
there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.

Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to
him:--

"And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?"

The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand
in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--

"Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
and me peace." He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying
his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood
unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--

"And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as
she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning
devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is
the devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!"

Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,
and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked
the door he gave the key to Arthur.

Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.

Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--

"Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all
of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
we not promise to go on to the bitter end?"

Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
Professor as we moved off:--

"Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult
about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall
return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I
shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
must not draw back."




CHAPTER XVII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_


When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
waiting for him:--

     "Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA
     HARKER."

The Professor was delighted. "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina," he said,
"pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en
route_, so that she may be prepared."

When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. "Take these," he
said, "and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your
faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What
is here told," he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
papers as he spoke, "may be the beginning of the end to you and me and
many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the
earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have
kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we
shall go through all these together when we meet." He then made ready
for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I
took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
the train came in.

The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
after a quick glance, said: "Dr. Seward, is it not?"

"And you are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once; whereupon she held out
her hand.

"I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----" She stopped
suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.

The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had
sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom
prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.

In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder
when we entered.

She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at
the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before
me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an
opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or
what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here
she is!


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's
study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
the door, and on his calling out, "Come in," I entered.

To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
interested.

"I hope I did not keep you waiting," I said; "but I stayed at the door
as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you."

"Oh," he replied with a smile, "I was only entering my diary."

"Your diary?" I asked him in surprise.

"Yes," he answered. "I keep it in this." As he spoke he laid his hand on
the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--

"Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?"

"Certainly," he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.

"The fact is," he began awkwardly, "I only keep my diary in it; and as
it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that
is, I mean----" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
embarrassment:--

"You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very
dear to me."

To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--

"Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!"

"Why not?" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
At length he stammered out:--

"You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
diary." Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté
of a child: "That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!" I could
not but smile, at which he grimaced. "I gave myself away that time!" he
said. "But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months
past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular
part of it in case I wanted to look it up?" By this time my mind was
made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and
I said boldly:--

"Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
typewriter." He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--

"No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible
story!"

Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on
the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.

"You do not know me," I said. "When you have read those papers--my own
diary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know me
better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not
expect you to trust me so far."

He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
said:--

"You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make
the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the
first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the
meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
able to understand certain things." He carried the phonograph himself up
to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something
pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love
episode of which I know one side already....


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan
Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
dinner, so I said: "She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour," and
I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when
she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had
cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--

"I greatly fear I have distressed you."

"Oh, no, not distressed me," she replied, "but I have been more touched
than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them
spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the
words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
I did."

"No one need ever know, shall ever know," I said in a low voice. She
laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--

"Ah, but they must!"

"Must! But why?" I asked.

"Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy's
death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;
but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain
point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,
how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van
Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he
will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;
working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
if some of us were in the dark." She looked at me so appealingly, and at
the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
that I gave in at once to her wishes. "You shall," I said, "do as you
like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible
things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
poor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the
dark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,
there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;
we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything
which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
present."


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his
back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I
put the forked metal to my ears and listened.

When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and--and all that followed, was
done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a
fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a
cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I
had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have
believed. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my
difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--

"Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him
when they come." He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used
manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with
all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about
his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he
came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely
whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of
good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I
remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's
perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the
files of "The Westminster Gazette" and "The Pall Mall Gazette," and took
them to my room. I remember how much "The Dailygraph" and "The Whitby
Gazette," of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look
through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new
light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock. He had got his
wife's wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can
judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and
judging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man
of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a
remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
business-like gentleman who came here to-day.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They
are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got
the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's
typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it
is....

     Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be
     the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues
     from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters
     relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,
     if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!
     Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again
     collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be
     able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the
     meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of
     index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
     but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing
     that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have
     found the dates otherwise....

     I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
     folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any
     one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of
     subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own
     accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my
     knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite
     confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I
     not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of
     his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a
     brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All
     those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
     Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that
     his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?
     Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
     chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of "master." This
     all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came
     away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it
     safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,
     and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
     I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to
     have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington's
courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I
thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
of the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must
stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had
ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
out. To use an Americanism, he had "taken no chances," and the absolute
accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:
"Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes."
Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of
these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could
give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the
strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
tradition; but no one could add to the simple description "Fifty cases
of common earth." I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in
communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their
tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
the boxes were "main and mortal heavy," and that shifting them was dry
work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any
gentleman "such-like as yourself, squire," to show some sort of
appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider
that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care
before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
reproach.

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to
his old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when I
arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of
the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was
compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.

From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met
with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross
office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
exactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the
written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected
almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,
through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--

"That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it
ain't been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in
the place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones;
an' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole
Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me
and my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough. Lor', I
wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark."

Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.

Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
since been removed--as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.

I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good
deal.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
into order.


_Mina Harker's Journal_

_30 September._--I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself.
It is, I suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which I have had:
that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a
face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never
so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good
Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under
strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and
hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I
feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any
thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not
human--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's
death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
one's heart.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with
him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it
brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago. Of
course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van
Helsing, too, has been quite "blowing my trumpet," as Mr. Morris
expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to
say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and
came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post
them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that
they had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear
to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I
could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--

"Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"

I nodded, and he went on:--

"I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have
had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble
to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--"
Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear
the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
room. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man
free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and
gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I
hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it
afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I
_know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I
could see that his heart was breaking:--

"I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to
her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have
had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for
Lucy's sake?"

In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed
to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a
vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat
down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite
pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his
head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with
emotion.

We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big
sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.

After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for
days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been
unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of
sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
surrounded, he could speak freely. "I know now how I suffered," he said,
as he dried his eyes, "but I do not know even yet--and none other can
ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall
know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful
now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be
like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?"

"For dear Lucy's sake," I said as we clasped hands. "Ay, and for your
own sake," he added, "for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth
the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring
to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call
in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you
will let me know." He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--

"I promise."

As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
He turned as he heard my footsteps. "How is Art?" he said. Then noticing
my red eyes, he went on: "Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor
old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him."

He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the
manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise
how much I knew; so I said to him:--

"I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
will know, later on, why I speak." He saw that I was in earnest, and
stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed
but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--

"Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
as ever you live!" Then he went into the study to his friend.

"Little girl!"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
proved himself a friend!




CHAPTER XVIII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming
and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife
had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave
us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I
have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had
finished, Mrs. Harker said:--

"Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
interests me so much!" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: "Why?"

"She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it," I
answered. "Oh, very well," he said; "let her come in, by all means; but
just wait a minute till I tidy up the place." His method of tidying was
peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
task, he said cheerfully: "Let the lady come in," and sat down on the
edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just
before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I
could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad
people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
held out her hand.

"Good-evening, Mr. Renfield," said she. "You see, I know you, for Dr.
Seward has told me of you." He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all
over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one
of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
said:--

"You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,
you know, for she's dead." Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--

"Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker."

"Then what are you doing here?"

"My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward."

"Then don't stay."

"But why not?" I thought that this style of conversation might not be
pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--

"How did you know I wanted to marry any one?" His reply was simply
contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--

"What an asinine question!"

"I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield," said Mrs. Harker, at once
championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
he had shown contempt to me:--

"You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so
loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_." I
positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet
lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished
gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched
some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
power.

We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for
he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
certain things.

"Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,
it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and
perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no
matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to
take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I
tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is
the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,
doctor?" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to
either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up
his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I
saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.
Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying
pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: "Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,
under auspices pleasanter to yourself," to which, to my astonishment, he
replied:--

"Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
May He bless and keep you!"

When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took
ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
many a long day.

Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--

"Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!"

As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at
which the Professor interrupted me:--

"Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a man
should have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good God
fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is
no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in
waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she
must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and
we go alone." I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was
the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed
to come on him. "Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we
might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk
that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think
of that, but go on our way to the end." Then he fell into a silence that
lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for
dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--

"I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have
put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment."

"Not up to this moment, Professor," she said impulsively, "but up to
this morning."

"But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
has told is the worse for it."

Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she
said:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It
is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
what is personal. Must it go in?" The Professor read it over gravely,
and handed it back, saying:--

"It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can
but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
honour you--as well as more esteem and love." She took it back with
another blush and a bright smile.

And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us
have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
terrible and mysterious enemy.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after
dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of
board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit
next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat
next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
centre. The Professor said:--

"I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
that are in these papers." We all expressed assent, and he went on:--

"Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
according.

"There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not
have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!
I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,
had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of
us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other
poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die
like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being
stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of
cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have
still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are
for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in
callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear
at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become
small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to
begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having
found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible
task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then
where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not
mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward
become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,
preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for
ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's
sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face
to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;
but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are
young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What
say you?"

Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so
strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for
itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.

When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I
in his; there was no need for speaking between us.

"I answer for Mina and myself," he said.

"Count me in, Professor," said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.

"I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy's sake, if for no other
reason."

Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his
golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with
his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our
solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing
went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
as any other transaction of life:--

"Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power
denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to
achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.

"Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.

"All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not
at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay
of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the
first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and
secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and
superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would
have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so
far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we
have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the
beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again
Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again
Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John
saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at
the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble
ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He
come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw
Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the
tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or
into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,
in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me
through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even
more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey
some of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the
first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does
that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times
can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is
bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he
have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place
unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at
Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is
said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no
power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and
silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,
lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his
coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
We have seen it with our eyes.

"Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to
make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he
has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his
name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the
forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says
Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They
learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake
Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the
records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and
'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been
from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it
is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest."

Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
pause, and then the Professor went on:--

"And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to
ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
latter, we must trace----"

Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came
the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the
window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice
without:--

"Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
it." A minute later he came in and said:--

"It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat
and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have
seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art."

"Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.

"I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood." Without
saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
statement:--

"We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.

"And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you
no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men
and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
are."

All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their
minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.

Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--

"As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
another victim."

I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
with means to get into the house.

Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an
urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see
him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the
morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--

"He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't
know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his
violent fits." I knew the man would not have said this without some
cause, so I said: "All right; I'll go now"; and I asked the others to
wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my "patient."

"Take me with you, friend John," said the Professor. "His case in your
diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
disturbed."

"May I come also?" asked Lord Godalming.

"Me too?" said Quincey Morris. "May I come?" said Harker. I nodded, and
we all went down the passage together.

We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an
unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever
met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would
prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but
none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would
at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up
with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
existing sanity. "I appeal to your friends," he said, "they will,
perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have
not introduced me." I was so much astonished, that the oddness of
introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,
besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of
the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: "Lord
Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.
Renfield." He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--

"Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great
state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have
far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold
alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a
vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true
place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at
meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at
least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to
be considered as under exceptional circumstances." He made this last
appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
charm.

I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,
that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of
meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
quickly:--

"But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to
go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time
presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put
before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment." He looked at me keenly, and
seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--

"Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?"

"You have," I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--

"Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for
this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore
in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I
am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I
assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and
unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,
sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of
your friends." Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing
conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like
all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at
him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone
which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it
afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--

"Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,
without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.
Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
privilege you seek." He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--

"Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If
you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish." He still shook
his head as he said:--

"Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my
own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
refused, the responsibility does not rest with me." I thought it was now
time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went
towards the door, simply saying:--

"Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night."

As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He
moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was
about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,
and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more
fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of
which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same
sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,
for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into
quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up
his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--

"Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;
send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a
strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go
out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am
speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know
whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is
lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out
of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you
understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and
earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!"

I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.

"Come," I said sternly, "no more of this; we have had quite enough
already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly."

He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,
without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had
expected.

When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
quiet, well-bred voice:--

"You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later
on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night."




CHAPTER XIX

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


_1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy
mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am
so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way
that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a
little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his
room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said
to Dr. Seward:--

"Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the
sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some
serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
chance." Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--

"Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,
for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in
our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.
All is best as they are." Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a
dreamy kind of way:--

"I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how
he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my
throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and
master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He
certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is
best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
help to unnerve a man." The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand
on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--

"Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad
and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to
hope for, except the pity of the good God?" Lord Godalming had slipped
away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver
whistle, as he remarked:--

"That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on
call." Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out
a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four
little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--

"My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of
many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the
strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not
amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
touch. Keep this near your heart"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver
crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--"put these
flowers round your neck"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered
garlic blossoms--"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
which we must not desecrate needless." This was a portion of Sacred
Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others
was similarly equipped. "Now," he said, "friend John, where are the
skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house
by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's."

Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after
a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty
clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in
Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that
the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
into the open door.

"_In manus tuas, Domine!_" he said, crossing himself as he passed over
the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The
Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
lamps and proceeded on our search.

The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,
for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.

The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches
deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The
walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the
hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They
had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor
lifted them. He turned to me and said:--

"You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know
it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?" I had an
idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to
get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings
found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
"This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small
map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the
bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close
quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of
his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in
a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was
an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not
alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath
exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
intensified its loathsomeness.

Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our
enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and
terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose
above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking
consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.

We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we
began:--

"The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
clue as to what has become of the rest." A glance was sufficient to show
how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
no mistaking them.

There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,
for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my
heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to
see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,
as Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face, but it was only the
shadows," and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,
and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there
were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid
walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I
took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.

A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which
he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for
undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass
of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew
back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.

For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was
seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great
iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,
and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the
huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered
from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I
noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had
elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to
swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the
threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were
multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.

Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before
him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other
dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
ere the whole mass had vanished.

With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our
resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found
nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.

The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
when he had done.

"So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful. No harm has
come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable
to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and
to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters
before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,
and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be
ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink."

The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound
from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.

I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly
thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a
sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I
daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep
dark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all
overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of
blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She
complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the
day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas
Snelling to-day.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the
brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
night he suddenly said:--

"Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
and reason so sound." I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him
that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to
keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary
instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against
getting any false impression from my patient. "But," he answered, "I
want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that
he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?"

"Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here." I laid my hand on the
type-written matter. "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
Harker entered the room." Van Helsing smiled in turn. "Good!" he said.
"Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
Who knows?" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
Van Helsing back in the study. "Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he
stood at the door.

"Not at all," I answered. "Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
I can go with you now, if you like.

"It is needless; I have seen him!"

"Well?"

"I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. "Don't
you know me?" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: "I know you well
enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself
and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed
Dutchmen!" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable
sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at
all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few
happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be
worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it
is better so."

"I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I did
not want him to weaken in this matter. "Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,
and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
infallibly have wrecked her."

So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I
shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;
after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him
manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went
out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must
have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great
love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.

That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
excitement.

Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I
kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to
see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does
seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear
Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard
till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she
wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at
night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.
Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what
has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew
that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my
own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear
fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
that we poor women have to learn....

I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere
under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so
profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be
stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin
streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a
vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must
have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out
and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now
close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the
wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was
more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,
I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into
bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have
fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the
morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a
little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was
bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.

I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,
came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I
had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to
make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed
my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what
tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The
mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I
could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things
began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words "a
pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night." Was it indeed some such
spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was
composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I
looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like
two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's
Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became
black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to
show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were
too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm
them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their
fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do
not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that
cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last
night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless
me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This
is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be
miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till
dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten
them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke
together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other
of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's
manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so
sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to
give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night
before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to
me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I
have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope
I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.




CHAPTER XX

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


_1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The
very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I
learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he
was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the
responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph
Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a
saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable
type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all
about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared
notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at
197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he
deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were
chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more
fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now
fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to
be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the
very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back
to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had
been taken from Carfax.

He replied:--

"Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some"--I had given him half a
sovereign--"an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,
as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at
Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'
that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut." I asked if he could tell me
where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search
then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--

"Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I
may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way
to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on
it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But
ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch
'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore."

This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had
again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way
to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.
Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as
though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be
kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the
others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and
worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors
were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence
must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she
herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first
post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--

"Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for
the depite."

I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy
and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,
but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for
her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,
with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I
was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should
have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some
difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked
for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found
the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.
When I asked the man who came to the door for the "depite," he shook his
head, and said: "I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never
'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody
of that kind livin' ere or anywheres." I took out Smollet's letter, and
as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name
of the court might guide me. "What are you?" I asked.

"I'm the depity," he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the
deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who
had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that
morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but
he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a "new-fangled ware'us";
and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve
o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this
I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One
of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a
new "cold storage" building; and as this suited the condition of a
"new-fangled ware'us," I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly
gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my
suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for
the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was
a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had
promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me
that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,
and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--"main
heavy ones"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I
asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to
which he replied:--

"Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a
big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a
dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we
tooked the bloomin' boxes from."

"How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?"

"There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin' in the 'ouse at
Purfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse
me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,
with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw
a shadder."

How this phrase thrilled through me!

"Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
me a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an' I'm no
chicken, neither."

"How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked.

"He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for
when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me
to carry the boxes into the 'all."

"The whole nine?" I asked.

"Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was
main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome." I
interrupted him:--

"Were the boxes left in the hall?"

"Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it." I made one
more attempt to further matters:--

"You didn't have any key?"

"Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself
an' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time--but
that was the beer."

"And you can't remember the number of the house?"

"No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un
with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I
know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'
they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them
by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot
of them went away cussin'." I thought that with this description I could
find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started
off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count
could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was
precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of
distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked
westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house
described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long
untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been
a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,
whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have
been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my
experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not
but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means
discovered of gaining access to the house.

There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and
nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything
could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the
Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the
grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been
taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to
very lately there had been a notice-board of "For Sale" up, and that
perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me
something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled
away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I
did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &
Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in
Sackville Street.

The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but
uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a
"mansion"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I
asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and
paused a few seconds before replying:--

"It is sold, sir."

"Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have a special reason
for wishing to know who purchased it."

Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. "It is sold,
sir," was again his laconic reply.

"Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so much."

"But I do mind," he answered. "The affairs of their clients are
absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy." This was
manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with
him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--

"Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their
confidence. I am myself a professional man." Here I handed him my card.
"In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of
Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
he understood, lately for sale." These words put a different complexion
on affairs. He said:--

"I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would
I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of
renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur
Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult
the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
lordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far
deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
lordship."

I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,
gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I
was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company
and came down to Purfleet by the next train.

I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she
made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at
our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or
else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we
made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing
knowledge would be torture to her.

I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;
so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even
amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me
as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I
came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no
difference between us.

When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in
the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read
it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--

"This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on
the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then
our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search
until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
wretch to his real death." We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.
Morris spoke:--

"Say! how are we going to get into that house?"

"We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly.

"But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night
and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to
commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't
see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key
of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
morning." Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked
about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to
another of us:--

"Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we
got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we
can find the Count's key basket."

As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,
we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good
while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....

Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her
forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be
herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so
rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more
than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his
repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really
care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and
looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I
thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked
him:--

"What about the flies these times?" He smiled on me in quite a superior
sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as
he answered me:--

"The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
when they typified the soul as a butterfly!"

I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said
quickly:--

"Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?" His madness foiled his
reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--

"Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want." Here he brightened
up; "I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I
have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to
study zoöphagy!"

This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--

"Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?" He smiled with an
ineffably benign superiority.

"Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I
may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
spiritually!" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--

"And why with Enoch?"

"Because he walked with God." I could not see the analogy, but did not
like to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--

"So you don't care about life and you don't want souls. Why not?" I put
my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his
old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as
he replied:--

"I don't want any souls, indeed, indeed! I don't. I couldn't use them if
I had them; they would be no manner of use to me. I couldn't eat them
or----" He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water. "And doctor, as to
life, what is it after all? When you've got all you require, and you
know that you will never want, that is all. I have friends--good
friends--like you, Dr. Seward"; this was said with a leer of
inexpressible cunning. "I know that I shall never lack the means of
life!"

I think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some
antagonism in me, for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as
he--a dogged silence. After a short time I saw that for the present it
was useless to speak to him. He was sulky, and so I came away.

Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come
without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him
that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything
to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are
Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the
record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate
knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish
to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with
me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he
might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield
might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were
alone.

I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose
which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I
came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
lips:--

"What about souls?" It was evident then that my surmise had been
correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. "What about them
yourself?" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round
him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for
an answer.

"I don't want any souls!" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The
matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to "be
cruel only to be kind." So I said:--

"You like life, and you want life?"

"Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!"

"But," I asked, "how are we to get the life without getting the soul
also?" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--

"A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with
the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you
know, and you must put up with their souls!" Something seemed to affect
his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being
soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave
me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,
though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It
was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,
and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and
go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him,
speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--

"Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?" He seemed to
wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--

"Not much! flies are poor things, after all!" After a pause he added,
"But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same."

"Or spiders?" I went on.

"Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them
to eat or"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden
topic.

"So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time he has suddenly
stopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?" Renfield seemed himself
aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract
my attention from it:--

"I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such
small deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' they
might be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well
ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to
interest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before
me."

"I see," I said. "You want big things that you can make your teeth meet
in? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?"

"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!" He was getting too wide
awake, so I thought I would press him hard. "I wonder," I said
reflectively, "what an elephant's soul is like!"

The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his
high-horse and became a child again.

"I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!" he said. For a
few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with
his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. "To
hell with you and your souls!" he shouted. "Why do you plague me about
souls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,
without thinking of souls!" He looked so hostile that I thought he was
in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,
however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--

"Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so
worried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the
problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and
tolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I
want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am
sure you will understand!" He had evidently self-control; so when the
attendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield
watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable
dignity and sweetness:--

"Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that
I am very, very grateful to you!" I thought it well to leave him in this
mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in
this man's state. Several points seem to make what the American
interviewer calls "a story," if one could only get them in proper order.
Here they are:--

Will not mention "drinking."

Fears the thought of being burdened with the "soul" of anything.

Has no dread of wanting "life" in the future.

Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being
haunted by their souls.

Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind
that he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the
burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!

And the assurance--?

Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of
terror afoot!

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my
suspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a
while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door
we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time
which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that
he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk
of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He
went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had
got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come
away as ignorant as we went in.

His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.


_Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._

_"1 October._

"My Lord,

"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with
regard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your
behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
purchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors
of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign
nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
purchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardon
us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever
of him.

"We are, my Lord,

"Your Lordship's humble servants,

"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to
make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room,
and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
was to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
in the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts
and discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,
and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.

Before going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked in
through the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart
rose and fell with regular respiration.

This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight
he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him
if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was
something about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if
he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having "dozed" for
a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are
watched.

To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are
looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have
horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported
earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his
weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the
British Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old
physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
and the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
useful to us later.

I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in
strait-waistcoats.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our
work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if
Renfield's quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so
followed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the
monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get
some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument
with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a
valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That
wild yell seemed to come from his room....

       *       *       *       *       *

The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had
somehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went
to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
I must go at once....




CHAPTER XXI

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well
as I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I
can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.

When I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his
left side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it
became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;
there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body
which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see
that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the
floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood
originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as
we turned him over:--

"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and
the whole side of his face are paralysed." How such a thing could have
happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite
bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--

"I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by
beating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the
Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he
might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward
kink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things
occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his
face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of
it." I said to him:--

"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want
him without an instant's delay." The man ran off, and within a few
minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When
he saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and
then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he
said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--

"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much
attention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.
If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you."

The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that
he had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with
extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had
evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he
looked at the patient, he whispered to me:--

"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes
conscious, after the operation." So I said:--

"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at
present. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.
Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere."

The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.
The wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed
fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The
Professor thought a moment and said:--

"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far
as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of
his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the
brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be
too late." As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I
went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and
Quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--

"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.
So I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things
are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us
these times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things
as they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more
than we have done. May we come in?" I nodded, and held the door open
till they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the
attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
floor, he said softly:--

"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!" I told him
briefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after
the operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat
down on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched
in patience.

"We shall wait," said Van Helsing, "just long enough to fix the best
spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing."

The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a
horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered
that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded
the words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;
but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men
who have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in
uncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes
and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he
would relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick
beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost
hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my
temples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became
agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal
torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect
it.

At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was
sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor
and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he
spoke:--

"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have
been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!
We shall operate just above the ear."

Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the
breathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so
prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.
This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad
surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved
convulsively, and as he did so, said:--

"I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I
have had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot
move. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
dreadfully." He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van
Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:--

"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield." As he heard the voice his face
brightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--

"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some
water, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed"--he
stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--"The
brandy--it is in my study--quick!" He flew and returned with a glass,
the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched
lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor
injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite
conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I
shall never forget, and said:--

"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality."
Then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two
figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--

"If I were not sure already, I would know from them." For an instant his
eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were
bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,
hurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--

"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;
and then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy
again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor
crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left
me, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I
felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as
I am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left
me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain
seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the
dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!" As he spoke, Van
Helsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and
gripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly
and said: "Go on," in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--

"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;
but he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a
man's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white
teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt
of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in
at first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.
Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them." He
was interrupted by a word from the Professor:--

"How?"

"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the
sun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their
wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their
backs." Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--

"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the
'Death's-head Moth'?" The patient went on without stopping.

"Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,
millions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely
buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.
Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He
beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his
hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass
spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and
then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there
were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only
smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he
seemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more
and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship
me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close
over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening
the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were
all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only
open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through
the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and
splendour."

His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and
he continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in
the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him
back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: "Let him go on. Do
not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all
if once he lost the thread of his thought." He proceeded:--

"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not
even a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.
When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked
out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he
owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same
as he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.
Harker had come into the room."

The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
him so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.
They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,
however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without
noticing:--

"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;
it was like tea after the teapot had been watered." Here we all moved,
but no one said a word; he went on:--

"I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the
same. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood
in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it
at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad
to know that He had been taking the life out of her." I could feel that
the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. "So when
He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I
grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and
as I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.
Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle
with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't
mean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned
into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and
when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There
was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
to steal away under the door." His voice was becoming fainter and his
breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.

"We know the worst now," he said. "He is here, and we know his purpose.
It may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other
night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare." There was no
need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in
common. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we
had when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and
as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--

"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is
over. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.
Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!" He stopped; his
voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in
my own heart.

Outside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the
latter said:--

"Should we disturb her?"

"We must," said Van Helsing grimly. "If the door be locked, I shall
break it in."

"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's
room!"

Van Helsing said solemnly, "You are always right; but this is life and
death. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they
are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if
the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you
too, my friends. Now!"

He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw
ourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell
headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw
across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw
appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
and my heart seemed to stand still.

The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
was light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan
Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.
Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.
His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised
the Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left
hand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms
at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared
with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which
was shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible
resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to
compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his
face, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap
into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils
of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the
white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,
champed together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw
his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned
and sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,
and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred
Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside
the tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,
lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a
great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up
under Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we
looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting
open, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved
forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with
it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it
seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a
few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was
ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared
her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of
blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her
poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the
Count's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail
which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an
endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant
despairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--

"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can
do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers
herself; I must wake him!" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water
and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while
holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was
heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the
window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey
Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great
yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the
instant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial
consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well
be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and
then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he
started up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to
him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,
however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held
her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.

"In God's name what does this mean?" Harker cried out. "Dr. Seward, Dr.
Van Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,
what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to
this!" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly
together. "Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!" With a quick
movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the
man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. "What has happened?
Tell me all about it!" he cried without pausing. "Dr. Van Helsing, you
love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too
far yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!" His wife, through her terror
and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly
forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--

"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough
to-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay
with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!" Her
expression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she
pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.

Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his
little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--

"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no
foul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm
and take counsel together." She shuddered and was silent, holding down
her head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white
night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where
the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she
saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking
sobs:--

"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it
should be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have
most cause to fear." To this he spoke out resolutely:--

"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not
hear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my
deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!" He put out
his arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there
sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked
damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a
while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to
me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous
power to the utmost:--

"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad
fact; tell me all that has been." I told him exactly what had happened,
and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched
and his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had
held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to
the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to
see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over
the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled
hair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.
They entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me
questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of
their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband
and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence
to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming
answered:--

"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I
looked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,
however----" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--

"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now
is in knowing all. Tell freely!" So Art went on:--

"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few
seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been
burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the
cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
had helped the flames." Here I interrupted. "Thank God there is the
other copy in the safe!" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he
went on: "I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked
into Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!" Again he
paused. "Go on," said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and
moistening his lips with his tongue, added: "except that the poor fellow
is dead." Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of
us she said solemnly:--

"God's will be done!" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back
something; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.
Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--

"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?"

"A little," he answered. "It may be much eventually, but at present I
can't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would
go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from
Renfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some
shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He
will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the
dawn is close. We must work to-morrow!"

He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps
a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could
hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his
hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--

"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what
happened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is
need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done
quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must
end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and
learn."

The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves
as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held
out one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and
kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that
of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.
After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
began:--

"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a
long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads
of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them
connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble."
Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
lovingly: "Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me
through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me
to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I
need your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work
with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to
sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no
more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when
next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I
had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find
it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague
terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.
I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it
seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I
tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I
looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside
the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist
had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a
tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of
the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white
teeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the
sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the
red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant
my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was
paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,
pointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--

"'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out
before your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or
say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder
and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did
so, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well
be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have
appeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not
want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that
such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity
me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!" Her husband groaned
again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if
he were the injured one, and went on:--

"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long
this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time
must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I
saw it drip with the fresh blood!" The remembrance seemed for a while to
overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
husband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and
went on:--

"Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play
your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and
frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,
and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They
should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they
played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued
for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were
born--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now
to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful
wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my
helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall
minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you
have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
call. When my brain says "Come!" to you, you shall cross land or sea to
do my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his
shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When
the blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding
them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to
the wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh
my God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a
fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my
days. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;
and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!" Then she began to rub her
lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.

As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
and everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;
but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look
which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first
red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out
against the whitening hair.

We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.

Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in
all the great round of its daily course.




CHAPTER XXII

JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL


_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It
is now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and
take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed
that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God
knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare
not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end
the little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could
not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,
we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears
running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our
faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us
up to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!

When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor
Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward
told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below
they had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was
all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.

Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had
heard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to
half dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield
had called out loudly several times, "God! God! God!" after that there
was a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying
on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing
asked if he had heard "voices" or "a voice," and he said he could not
say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear
to it, if required, that the word "God" was spoken by the patient. Dr.
Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into
the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it
would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As
it was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a
certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the
coroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily
to the same result.

When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next
step, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full
confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be
kept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful
to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of
despair. "There must be no concealment," she said, "Alas! we have had
too much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can
give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!
Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!"
Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly
but quietly:--

"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for
others from yourself, after what has happened?" Her face grew set in its
lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she
answered:--

"Ah no! for my mind is made up!"

"To what?" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in
our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer
came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--

"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of
harm to any that I love, I shall die!"

"You would not kill yourself?" he asked, hoarsely.

"I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a
pain, and so desperate an effort!" She looked at him meaningly as she
spoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and
put his hand on her head as he said solemnly:

"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I
could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,
even at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my
child----" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his
throat; he gulped it down and went on:--

"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not
die. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until
the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not
die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make
you even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to
live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death
himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the
night; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you
do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past." The
poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a
quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all
silent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to
him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--

"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall
strive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may
have passed away from me." She was so good and brave that we all felt
that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
began to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all
the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we
might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.
She was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if "pleased" could
be used in connection with so grim an interest.

As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
prepared with an exact ordering of our work.

"It is perhaps well," he said, "that at our meeting after our visit to
Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay
there. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and
would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an
effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our
intentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a
power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use
them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as
to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in
Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;
and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must
retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations
of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
through cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he
must open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out
all his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch
him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching
and the destroying shall be, in time, sure." Here I started up for I
could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so
preciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,
since whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up
his hand warningly. "Nay, friend Jonathan," he said, "in this, the
quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all
act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in
all probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.
The Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have
deeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he
write on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings
that he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the
very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and
search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our
friend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we
run down our old fox--so? is it not?"

"Then let us come at once," I cried, "we are wasting the precious,
precious time!" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--

"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?"

"Any way!" I cried. "We shall break in if need be."

"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?"

I was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good
reason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--

"Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am
in."

"Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to
your anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at
movement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it
seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get
into the house, but we have no key; is it not so?" I nodded.

"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could
not still get in; and think there was to you no conscience of the
housebreaker, what would you do?"

"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the
lock for me."

"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?"

"Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed."

"Then," he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, "all that is in doubt is
the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to
whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your
police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading
the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my
friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this
your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such
things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,
no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine
house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland
and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and
got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he
have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;
and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of
that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him
that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away
within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all
they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland
he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done
_en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. We shall not go
so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem
it strange; but we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many
about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the
house."

I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina's
face became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel. Van
Helsing went on:--

"When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of
us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
more earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End."

Lord Godalming stood up. "I can be of some use here," he said. "I shall
wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most
convenient."

"Look here, old fellow," said Morris, "it is a capital idea to have all
ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don't you think that one
of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of
Walworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?
It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and
even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to."

"Friend Quincey is right!" said the Professor. "His head is what you
call in plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to
do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may."

Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see
that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the
terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale--almost
ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in
somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it should give
her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
what had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As
yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
was short, and there was time for fear.

When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the
disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. It was
finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the
Count's lair close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we
should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his
presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us
some new clue.

As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,
after our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;
that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming
and Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them.
It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the Count
might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be
able to cope with him then and there. At any rate, we might be able to
follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as
my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect
Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but Mina would
not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter
in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count's papers might be
some clue which I could understand out of my experience in Transylvania;
and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to
cope with the Count's extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina's
resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that
we should all work together. "As for me," she said, "I have no fear.
Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must
have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if
He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present." So I
started up crying out: "Then in God's name let us come at once, for we
are losing time. The Count may come to Piccadilly earlier than we
think."

"Not so!" said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.

"But why?" I asked.

"Do you forget," he said, with actually a smile, "that last night he
banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?"

Did I forget! shall I ever--can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that
terrible scene! Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but
the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and
shuddered whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her
frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her and her part in
the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said,
he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. "Oh,
Madam Mina," he said, "dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who so
reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old
lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will
forget it, will you not?" He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took
his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--

"No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I
have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all
together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we
must all eat that we may be strong."

Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and
encourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of
us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--

"Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we
all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's
lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?" We all assured
him. "Then it is well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe
here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- We shall
return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I
have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing
of things of which we know, so that He may not enter. Now let me guard
yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the
name of the Father, the Son, and----"

There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he
had placed the Wafer on Mina's forehead, it had seared it--had burned
into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor
darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as
her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that
her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. But the
words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased
to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her
knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair
over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--

"Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must
bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day." They
all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless
grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our
sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away
their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said
gravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some
way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--

"It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit,
as He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day, to redress all wrongs of
the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam
Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that
red scar, the sign of God's knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as
we live, that scar shall pass away when God sees right to lift the
burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did
in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of
His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other
through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and
fears, and all that makes the difference between God and man."

There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.
Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
man's hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all
knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each
other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the
head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help
and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.

It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which
neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.

To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a
vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant
many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so
the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.

We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on
the first occasion. It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic
surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such
fear as already we knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there
not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and
in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.
Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--

"And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this
earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far
distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has
been holy. Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more
holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
God." As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and
very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled
musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the
Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.

One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left
them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion
of the Host.

When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--

"So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can
be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam
Mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!"

As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our
train we could see the front of the asylum. I looked eagerly, and in the
window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to
tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in
reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving her
hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station
and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the
platform.

I have written this in the train.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Piccadilly, 12:30 o'clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street
Lord Godalming said to me:--

"Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in
case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it
wouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a
solicitor and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you
should have known better." I demurred as to my not sharing any danger
even of odium, but he went on: "Besides, it will attract less attention
if there are not too many of us. My title will make it all right with
the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had
better go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,
somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and
the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the
lookout for you, and shall let you in."

"The advice is good!" said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming
and Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another. At the corner
of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green
Park. My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was
centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst
its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench
within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little
attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
waited for the coming of the others.

At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely
fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended
a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid
the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. Together the two
ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.
The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes
of the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered
along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down
placed his bag beside him. After searching through it, he took out a
selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly
fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and
turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and
the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he
began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling
about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the
door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others
entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van
Helsing's went cold altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the
workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly
open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.
This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and
gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his
coat and departed; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole
transaction.

When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at
the door. It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood
Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.

"The place smells so vilely," said the latter as we came in. It did
indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our
previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the
place pretty freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together
in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal
with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the
house. In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found
eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the
missing box. First we opened the shutters of the window which looked out
across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable,
pointed to look like the front of a miniature house. There were no
windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did not
lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had
brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had
treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the
Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for
any of his effects.

After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects
which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine
them. They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room
table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great bundle;
deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;
note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. All were covered up in thin
wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes
brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing
dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. Last of all was a
little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
the other houses. When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming
and Quincey Morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great
bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us
are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of
the Count.




CHAPTER XXIII

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for
the coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep
our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent
purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.
The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.
Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful
face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn,
haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning
eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in
fact, he is like a living flame. This may yet be his salvation, for, if
all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then,
in a kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I
thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! The Professor knows
this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he
has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So
well as I can remember, here it is:--

"I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all
the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the
greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there
are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of
it. As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminus of Buda-Pesth,
he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and
alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the
science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond
compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to
attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time
that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the
physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is
growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of
man's stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not
been that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we
fail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must
lead through Death, not Life."

Harker groaned and said, "And this is all arrayed against my darling!
But how is he experimenting? The knowledge may help us to defeat him!"

"He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but
surely; that big child-brain of his is working. Well for us, it is, as
yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain
things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means
to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait
and to go slow. _Festina lente_ may well be his motto."

"I fail to understand," said Harker wearily. "Oh, do be more plain to
me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain."

The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--

"Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this
monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. How he has been
making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend
John's home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when
and how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by
an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not
see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. He
knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great
child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he
might not himself move the box. So he began to help; and then, when he
found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he
progress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where
they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. So
that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his
form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him
just too late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;
and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have no place where he
can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is
there not more at stake for us than for him? Then why we not be even
more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our
day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance. See! there are
five of us when those absent ones return."

Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the
double postman's knock of the telegraph boy. We all moved out to the
hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to
keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a
despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
direction, opened it and read aloud.

"Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and
hastened towards the South. He seems to be going the round and may want
to see you: Mina."

There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker's voice:--

"Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!" Van Helsing turned to him
quickly and said:--

"God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice
as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings."

"I care for nothing now," he answered hotly, "except to wipe out this
brute from the face of creation. I would sell my soul to do it!"

"Oh, hush, hush, my child!" said Van Helsing. "God does not purchase
souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep
faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be
doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are
all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is
coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of man,
and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive
here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times
before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we must hope for
is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first."

About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker's telegram, there
came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. It was just an ordinary
knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made
the Professor's heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and
together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various
armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van
Helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood
back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts
must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we
saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They came quickly in and closed
the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
hall:--

"It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we
destroyed them all!"

"Destroyed?" asked the Professor.

"For him!" We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--

"There's nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn't turn up
by five o'clock, we must start off; for it won't do to leave Mrs. Harker
alone after sunset."

"He will be here before long now," said Van Helsing, who had been
consulting his pocket-book. "_Nota bene_, in Madam's telegram he went
south from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could
only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one
o'clock. That he went south has a meaning for us. He is as yet only
suspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would
suspect interference least. You must have been at Bermondsey only a
short time before him. That he is not here already shows that he went to
Mile End next. This took him some time; for he would then have to be
carried over the river in some way. Believe me, my friends, we shall not
have long to wait now. We should have ready some plan of attack, so that
we may throw away no chance. Hush, there is no time now. Have all your
arms! Be ready!" He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could
hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.

I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a
dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and
adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always
been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been
accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be
renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once
laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a
gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were
just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could
guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the
seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along
the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least
he feared it.

Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way past
us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him. There was something
so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed
to sober us all from the shock of his coming. The first to act was
Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door
leading into the room in the front of the house. As the Count saw us, a
horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long
and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of
lion-like disdain. His expression again changed as, with a single
impulse, we all advanced upon him. It was a pity that we had not some
better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what
we were to do. I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would
avail us anything. Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he had
ready his great Kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him. The
blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the Count's
leap back saved him. A second less and the trenchant blade had shorne
through his heart. As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,
making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold
fell out. The expression of the Count's face was so hellish, that for a
moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible knife
aloft again for another stroke. Instinctively I moved forward with a
protective impulse, holding the Crucifix and Wafer in my left hand. I
felt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I
saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously
by each one of us. It would be impossible to describe the expression of
hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over
the Count's face. His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast
of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the
pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous
dive he swept under Harker's arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping
a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw
himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the
shivering glass I could hear the "ting" of the gold, as some of the
sovereigns fell on the flagging.

We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. He, rushing up
the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
There he turned and spoke to us:--

"You think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in a row, like
sheep in a butcher's. You shall be sorry yet, each one of you! You think
you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more. My revenge is
just begun! I spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. Your
girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and
others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my
jackals when I want to feed. Bah!" With a contemptuous sneer, he passed
quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he
fastened it behind him. A door beyond opened and shut. The first of us
to speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following
him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.

"We have learnt something--much! Notwithstanding his brave words, he
fears us; he fear time, he fear want! For if not, why he hurry so? His
very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. Why take that money? You
follow quick. You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. For
me, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he
return." As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took
the title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the
remaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with
a match.

Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had
lowered himself from the window to follow the Count. He had, however,
bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there
was no sign of him. Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back
of the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.

It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. We had to
recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the
Professor when he said:--

"Let us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do
just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need
not despair. There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find
it; when that is done all may yet be well." I could see that he spoke as
bravely as he could to comfort Harker. The poor fellow was quite broken
down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress--he
was thinking of his wife.

With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs. Harker
waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her
bravery and unselfishness. When she saw our faces, her own became as
pale as death: for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--

"I can never thank you all enough. Oh, my poor darling!" As she spoke,
she took her husband's grey head in her hands and kissed it--"Lay your
poor head here and rest it. All will yet be well, dear! God will protect
us if He so will it in His good intent." The poor fellow groaned. There
was no place for words in his sublime misery.

We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered us
all up somewhat. It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry
people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense
of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less
miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. True to
our promise, we told Mrs. Harker everything which had passed; and
although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to
threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was
manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. When we came to the
part where Harker had rushed at the Count so recklessly, she clung to
her husband's arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could
protect him from any harm that might come. She said nothing, however,
till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up
to the present time. Then without letting go her husband's hand she
stood up amongst us and spoke. Oh, that I could give any idea of the
scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which
she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our
teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
purity and faith, was outcast from God.

"Jonathan," she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was
so full of love and tenderness, "Jonathan dear, and you all my true,
true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all this
dreadful time. I know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as
you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live hereafter;
but it is not a work of hate. That poor soul who has wrought all this
misery is the saddest case of all. Just think what will be his joy when
he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
spiritual immortality. You must be pitiful to him, too, though it may
not hold your hands from his destruction."

As she spoke I could see her husband's face darken and draw together, as
though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.
Instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer, till his
knuckles looked white. She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she
must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing
than ever. As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost tearing
his hand from hers as he spoke:--

"May God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
earthly life of him which we are aiming at. If beyond it I could send
his soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!"

"Oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good God. Don't say such things,
Jonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror. Just
think, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that
... perhaps ... some day ... I, too, may need such pity; and that some
other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! Oh,
my husband! my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought
had there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured
your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of a very loving and
sorely stricken man. Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom
so many sorrows have come."

We men were all in tears now. There was no resisting them, and we wept
openly. She wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.
Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms
round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. Van Helsing beckoned
to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone
with their God.

Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming
of the Vampire, and assured Mrs. Harker that she might rest in peace.
She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her
husband's sake, tried to seem content. It was a brave struggle; and was,
I think and believe, not without its reward. Van Helsing had placed at
hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should
sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the
poor stricken lady. The first watch falls to Quincey, so the rest of us
shall be off to bed as soon as we can. Godalming has already turned in,
for his is the second watch. Now that my work is done I, too, shall go
to bed.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_3-4 October, close to midnight._--I thought yesterday would never end.
There was over me a yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief
that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must
now be for the better. Before we parted, we discussed what our next step
was to be, but we could arrive at no result. All we knew was that one
earth-box remained, and that the Count alone knew where it was. If he
chooses to lie hidden, he may baffle us for years; and in the
meantime!--the thought is too horrible, I dare not think of it even now.
This I know: that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection, that
one is my poor wronged darling. I love her a thousand times more for her
sweet pity of last night, a pity that made my own hate of the monster
seem despicable. Surely God will not permit the world to be the poorer
by the loss of such a creature. This is hope to me. We are all drifting
reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. Thank God! Mina is
sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. I fear what her dreams might be
like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. She has not been so
calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. Then, for a while, there came
over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of March.
I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning. I am not sleepy
myself, though I am weary--weary to death. However, I must try to sleep;
for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is no rest for me
until....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was
sitting up in bed, with a startled look on her face. I could see easily,
for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning hand
over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--

"Hush! there is someone in the corridor!" I got up softly, and crossing
the room, gently opened the door.

Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He
raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me:--

"Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all
night. We don't mean to take any chances!"

His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina.
She sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor, pale
face as she put her arms round me and said softly:--

"Oh, thank God for good brave men!" With a sigh she sank back again to
sleep. I write this now as I am not sleepy, though I must try again.

       *       *       *       *       *

_4 October, morning._--Once again during the night I was wakened by
Mina. This time we had all had a good sleep, for the grey of the coming
dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was
like a speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:--

"Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once."

"Why?" I asked.

"I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured
without my knowing it. He must hypnotise me before the dawn, and then I
shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close." I
went to the door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing
me, he sprang to his feet.

"Is anything wrong?" he asked, in alarm.

"No," I replied; "but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once."

"I will go," he said, and hurried into the Professor's room.

In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his
dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at
the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile--a
positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he
said:--

"Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan,
we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!" Then
turning to her, he said, cheerfully: "And what am I do for you? For at
this hour you do not want me for nothings."

"I want you to hypnotise me!" she said. "Do it before the dawn, for I
feel that then I can speak, and speak freely. Be quick, for the time is
short!" Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.

Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her,
from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. Mina
gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat
like a trip hammer, for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually
her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of
her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few
more passes and then stopped, and I could see that his forehead was
covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she
did not seem the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and
her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me. Raising his hand to
impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the others in.
They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the
foot of the bed, looking on. Mina appeared not to see them. The
stillness was broken by Van Helsing's voice speaking in a low level tone
which would not break the current of her thoughts:--

"Where are you?" The answer came in a neutral way:--

"I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own." For several
minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid, and the Professor stood
staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room
was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina's face, Dr. Van
Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and the day seemed
just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse
itself through the room. On the instant the Professor spoke again:--

"Where are you now?" The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
were as though she were interpreting something. I have heard her use the
same tone when reading her shorthand notes.

"I do not know. It is all strange to me!"

"What do you see?"

"I can see nothing; it is all dark."

"What do you hear?" I could detect the strain in the Professor's patient
voice.

"The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can
hear them on the outside."

"Then you are on a ship?" We all looked at each other, trying to glean
something each from the other. We were afraid to think. The answer came
quick:--

"Oh, yes!"

"What else do you hear?"

"The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the
creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan
falls into the rachet."

"What are you doing?"

"I am still--oh, so still. It is like death!" The voice faded away into
a deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.

By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on Mina's shoulders, and laid her
head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few
moments, and then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see
us all around her. "Have I been talking in my sleep?" was all she said.
She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the
conversation, and she said:--

"Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!" Mr.
Morris and Lord Godalming started for the door but the Professor's calm
voice called them back:--

"Stay, my friends. That ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor
whilst she spoke. There are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in
your so great Port of London. Which of them is it that you seek? God be
thanked that we have once again a clue, though whither it may lead us we
know not. We have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,
since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! Alas, but
that sentence is a puddle; is it not? We can know now what was in the
Count's mind, when he seize that money, though Jonathan's so fierce
knife put him in the danger that even he dread. He meant escape. Hear
me, ESCAPE! He saw that with but one earth-box left, and a pack of men
following like dogs after a fox, this London was no place for him. He
have take his last earth-box on board a ship, and he leave the land. He
think to escape, but no! we follow him. Tally Ho! as friend Arthur would
say when he put on his red frock! Our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
we must follow with wile. I, too, am wily and I think his mind in a
little while. In meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters
between us which he do not want to pass, and which he could not if he
would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or
slack tide. See, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to
us. Let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with
us." Mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--

"But why need we seek him further, when he is gone away from us?" He
took her hand and patted it as he replied:--

"Ask me nothings as yet. When we have breakfast, then I answer all
questions." He would say no more, and we separated to dress.

After breakfast Mina repeated her question. He looked at her gravely for
a minute and then said sorrowfully:--

"Because my dear, dear Madam Mina, now more than ever must we find him
even if we have to follow him to the jaws of Hell!" She grew paler as
she asked faintly:--

"Why?"

"Because," he answered solemnly, "he can live for centuries, and you are
but mortal woman. Time is now to be dreaded--since once he put that mark
upon your throat."

I was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint.




CHAPTER XXIV

DR. SEWARD'S PHONOGRAPH DIARY, SPOKEN BY VAN HELSING


This to Jonathan Harker.

You are to stay with your dear Madam Mina. We shall go to make our
search--if I can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we
seek confirmation only. But do you stay and take care of her to-day.
This is your best and most holiest office. This day nothing can find him
here. Let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
for I have tell them. He, our enemy, have gone away; he have gone back
to his Castle in Transylvania. I know it so well, as if a great hand of
fire wrote it on the wall. He have prepare for this in some way, and
that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. For this he took the
money; for this he hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
go down. It was his last hope, save that he might hide in the tomb that
he think poor Miss Lucy, being as he thought like him, keep open to him.
But there was not of time. When that fail he make straight for his last
resource--his last earth-work I might say did I wish _double entente_.
He is clever, oh, so clever! he know that his game here was finish; and
so he decide he go back home. He find ship going by the route he came,
and he go in it. We go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;
when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. Then we will
comfort you and poor dear Madam Mina with new hope. For it will be hope
when you think it over: that all is not lost. This very creature that we
pursue, he take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in
one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is
finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is
but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that God sits on high
to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.

VAN HELSING.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_4 October._--When I read to Mina, Van Helsing's message in the
phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the
certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort;
and comfort is strength to her. For my own part, now that his horrible
danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
believe in it. Even my own terrible experiences in Castle Dracula seem
like a long-forgotten dream. Here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
sunlight----

Alas! how can I disbelieve! In the midst of my thought my eye fell on
the red scar on my poor darling's white forehead. Whilst that lasts,
there can be no disbelief. And afterwards the very memory of it will
keep faith crystal clear. Mina and I fear to be idle, so we have been
over all the diaries again and again. Somehow, although the reality
seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. There is
something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
Mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. It may
be! I shall try to think as she does. We have never spoken to each other
yet of the future. It is better to wait till we see the Professor and
the others after their investigations.

The day is running by more quickly than I ever thought a day could run
for me again. It is now three o'clock.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_5 October, 5 p. m._--Our meeting for report. Present: Professor Van
Helsing, Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, Mr. Quincey Morris, Jonathan
Harker, Mina Harker.

Dr. Van Helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
discover on what boat and whither bound Count Dracula made his escape:--

"As I knew that he wanted to get back to Transylvania, I felt sure that
he must go by the Danube mouth; or by somewhere in the Black Sea, since
by that way he come. It was a dreary blank that was before us. _Omne
ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what
ships leave for the Black Sea last night. He was in sailing ship, since
Madam Mina tell of sails being set. These not so important as to go in
your list of the shipping in the _Times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
Lord Godalming, to your Lloyd's, where are note of all ships that sail,
however so small. There we find that only one Black-Sea-bound ship go
out with the tide. She is the _Czarina Catherine_, and she sail from
Doolittle's Wharf for Varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
Danube. 'Soh!' said I, 'this is the ship whereon is the Count.' So off
we go to Doolittle's Wharf, and there we find a man in an office of wood
so small that the man look bigger than the office. From him we inquire
of the goings of the _Czarina Catherine_. He swear much, and he red face
and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same; and when Quincey
give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up, and
put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing, he
still better fellow and humble servant to us. He come with us, and ask
many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they
have been no more thirsty. They say much of blood and bloom, and of
others which I comprehend not, though I guess what they mean; but
nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.

"They make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
o'clock comes a man so hurry. A tall man, thin and pale, with high nose
and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. That he be all in
black, except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the
time. That he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
sails for the Black Sea and for where. Some took him to the office and
then to the ship, where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. The captain come, when
told that he will be pay well; and though he swear much at the first he
agree to term. Then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse
and cart can be hired. He go there and soon he come again, himself
driving cart on which a great box; this he himself lift down, though it
take several to put it on truck for the ship. He give much talk to
captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like
it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if he like he
can come and see where it shall be. But he say 'no'; that he come not
yet, for that he have much to do. Whereupon the captain tell him that he
had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the
place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. Then the thin
man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit; but he
will be surprise if he go quite so soon. The captain swear again,
polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the
sailing. Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell
him that he doesn't want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also
with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. And so, after asking
where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship
forms, he departed.

"No one knew where he went 'or bloomin' well cared,' as they said, for
they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon
became apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as
was expected. A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,
and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and
blood; but he could do nothing. The water rose and rose; and he began to
fear that he would lose the tide altogether. He was in no friendly mood,
when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and
asked to see where his box had been stowed. Then the captain replied
that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and
blood--were in hell. But the thin man did not be offend, and went down
with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile
on deck in fog. He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.
Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and
all was clear again. My friends of the thirst and the language that was
of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain's swears
exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up
and down on the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any
of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. However, the ship
went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the
river mouth. She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.

"And so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for
our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the
Danube mouth. To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when
we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. Our best hope
is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then
he can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. There
are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. We know all about
where he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us
invoices and all papers that can be. The box we seek is to be landed in
Varna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present
his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.
When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and
have inquiry made at Varna, we say 'no'; for what is to be done is not
for police or of the customs. It must be done by us alone and in our own
way."

When Dr. Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if he were certain
that the Count had remained on board the ship. He replied: "We have the
best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this
morning." I asked him again if it were really necessary that they should
pursue the Count, for oh! I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I know that
he would surely go if the others went. He answered in growing passion,
at first quietly. As he went on, however, he grew more angry and more
forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some
of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst
men:--

"Yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! For your sake in the first,
and then for the sake of humanity. This monster has done much harm
already, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short
time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in
darkness and not knowing. All this have I told these others; you, my
dear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or
in that of your husband. I have told them how the measure of leaving his
own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life
of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the
work of centuries. Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do
what he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have
been, or that will be, could aid him. With this one, all the forces of
nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in
some wondrous way. The very place, where he have been alive, Un-Dead for
all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters
of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless,
there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of
occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in
himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike
time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,
more braver heart, than any man. In him some vital principle have in
strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and
thrive, so his brain grow too. All this without that diabolic aid which
is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,
and are, symbolic of good. And now this is what he is to us. He have
infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for
good of you that I speak. He infect you in such wise, that even if he do
no more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and
so in time, death, which is of man's common lot and with God's sanction,
shall make you like to him. This must not be! We have sworn together
that it must not. Thus are we ministers of God's own wish: that the
world, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,
whose very existence would defame Him. He have allowed us to redeem one
soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem
more. Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if
we fall, we fall in good cause." He paused and I said:--

"But will not the Count take his rebuff wisely? Since he has been driven
from England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from
which he has been hunted?"

"Aha!" he said, "your simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall
adopt him. Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has once
tasted blood of the human, care no more for the other prey, but prowl
unceasing till he get him. This that we hunt from our village is a
tiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl. Nay, in himself he
is not one to retire and stay afar. In his life, his living life, he go
over the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be
beaten back, but did he stay? No! He come again, and again, and again.
Look at his persistence and endurance. With the child-brain that was to
him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city. What
does he do? He find out the place of all the world most of promise for
him. Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. He
find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. He
study new tongues. He learn new social life; new environment of old
ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of a new
land and a new people who have come to be since he was. His glimpse that
he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. Nay, it help
him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he was at
the first in his surmises. He have done this alone; all alone! from a
ruin tomb in a forgotten land. What more may he not do when the greater
world of thought is open to him. He that can smile at death, as we know
him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
peoples. Oh, if such an one was to come from God, and not the Devil,
what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours. But we
are pledged to set the world free. Our toil must be in silence, and our
efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not
even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest
strength. It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons
to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the
honour and glory of God."

After a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing
be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to
think out the proper conclusions. To-morrow, at breakfast, we are to
meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we
shall decide on some definite cause of action.

       *       *       *       *       *

I feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night. It is as if some haunting
presence were removed from me. Perhaps ...

My surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the
mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still
unclean.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_5 October._--We all rose early, and I think that sleep did much for
each and all of us. When we met at early breakfast there was more
general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience
again.

It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let
any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even by
death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More
than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether
the whole of the past days had not been a dream. It was only when I
caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker's forehead that I was
brought back to reality. Even now, when I am gravely revolving the
matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
trouble is still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her
trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something
recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to
meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct
rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear
that in some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker's tongue is tied. I _know_
that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can
guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or
cannot, give them utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and
he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is some of
that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The
Count had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called "the
Vampire's baptism of blood." Well, there may be a poison that distils
itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One thing I know: that if my
instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker's silences, then there is a
terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. The same
power that compels her silence may compel her speech. I dare not think
further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!

Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall
try to open the subject with him.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of
things. I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to
say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating
about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--

"Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just
at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our
confidence"; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--

"Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing." A cold shiver ran
through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed. Van Helsing
continued:--

"With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned
before things go too far. Our task is now in reality more difficult than
ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I
can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now
but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice
without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes
are more hard. But these are not all, there is to her the silence now
often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she
wrote that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If
it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and
hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who
have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he
will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?" I nodded
acquiescence; he went on:--

"Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of
our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. This is a painful
task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be.
When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not
to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by
us." He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration
at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor
soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of comfort
to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at
any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. I told him, and the
effect was as I expected.

It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has
gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. I
really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was
experienced by both Van Helsing and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a
message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as
she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
without her presence to embarrass us. The Professor and I looked at each
other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own
part, I thought that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was
much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the circumstances we
agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to
preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to
confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van
Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--

"The _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take
her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to
reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship's voyage, owing to such
weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear; and if
we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
then we have a margin of nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite
safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. Then we shall at any rate
be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
preparations as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed--armed
against evil things, spiritual as well as physical." Here Quincey Morris
added:--

"I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be
that he shall get there before us. I propose that we add Winchesters to
our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any
trouble of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack
after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn't we have given then for a repeater
apiece!"

"Good!" said Van Helsing, "Winchesters it shall be. Quincey's head is
level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more
dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we
can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of
us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here as there.
To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we
four can set out on our journey."

"We four?" said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of
us.

"Of course!" answered the Professor quickly, "you must remain to take
care of your so sweet wife!" Harker was silent for awhile and then said
in a hollow voice:--

"Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with
Mina." I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not
to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him
significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and
turned away.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I
could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of
wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina's determination not
to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not
argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I am as far as ever from
a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the
last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no
more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly
and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams
with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina's happy sleep, and
came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the
evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at
once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--

"Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A
promise made to me, but made holily in God's hearing, and not to be
broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter
tears. Quick, you must make it to me at once."

"Mina," I said, "a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have
no right to make it."

"But, dear one," she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
were like pole stars, "it is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.
You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may
do as you will. Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved
from the promise."

"I promise!" I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though
to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.
She said:--

"Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for
the campaign against the Count. Not by word, or inference, or
implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!" and she
solemnly pointed to the scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said
solemnly:--

"I promise!" and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had
been shut between us.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall
of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired
early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing
that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible
trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall
try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

_6 October, morning._--Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the
same time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought
that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went
for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I found
him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the
opening of the door of our room. He came at once; as he passed into the
room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.

"No," she said quite simply, "it will not be necessary. You can tell
them just as well. I must go with you on your journey."

Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment's pause he
asked:--

"But why?"

"You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer,
too."

"But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest
duty. We go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than
any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been." He paused,
embarrassed.

As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--

"I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is
coming up; I may not be able again. I know that when the Count wills me
I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by
wile; by any device to hoodwink--even Jonathan." God saw the look that
she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed a Recording Angel
that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her
hand. I could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of
tears. She went on:--

"You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you
can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had
to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me
and so learn that which even I myself do not know." Dr. Van Helsing said
very gravely:--

"Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and
together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve." When he had
spoken, Mina's long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen
back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up
the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. Van Helsing
motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within
a minute Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also.
He told them what Mina had said, and went on:--

"In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a
new factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony
to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are
warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be
ready to act the instant when that ship arrives."

"What shall we do exactly?" asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor
paused before replying:--

"We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified
the box, we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it. This we shall
fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the
superstition. And to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
man's faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. Then,
when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
shall open the box, and--and all will be well."

"I shall not wait for any opportunity," said Morris. "When I see the box
I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand
men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!" I
grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel.
I think he understood my look; I hope he did.

"Good boy," said Dr. Van Helsing. "Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God
bless him for it. My child, believe me none of us shall lag behind or
pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do--what we must do. But,
indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things
which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and
when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now
let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch
on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us
can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own
affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make
arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for
our journey."

There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle
up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she
survive is my sole heir. If it should not be so, then the others who
have been so good to us shall have remainder.

It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina's uneasiness calls my
attention to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the
time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are becoming harrowing
times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new
danger--some new pain, which, however, may in God's will be means to a
good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling must
not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they
shall be ready.

She is calling to me.




CHAPTER XXV

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_11 October, Evening._--Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he
says he is hardly equal to the task, and he wants an exact record kept.

I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs.
Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to
understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition
begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts
till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with
the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of
negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the
change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of
warning silence.

To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a
violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few
minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband's hand
in hers began:--

"We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know,
dear; I know that you will always be with me to the end." This was to
her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. "In
the morning we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in
store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me as to take me
with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak
woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
at stake--you will do. But you must remember that I am not as you are.
There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. Oh, my friends, you
know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there
is one way out for me, you must not and I must not take it!" She looked
appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.

"What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. "What is that
way, which we must not--may not--take?"

"That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
the greater evil is entirely wrought. I know, and you know, that were I
once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
did my poor Lucy's. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die
in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be
done, is God's will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the
certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the
blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!" We were all
silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The
faces of the others were set and Harker's grew ashen grey; perhaps he
guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:--

"This is what I can give into the hotch-pot." I could not but note the
quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place, and with all
seriousness. "What will each of you give? Your lives I know," she went
on quickly, "that is easy for brave men. Your lives are God's, and you
can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?" She looked
again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband's face. Quincey
seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. "Then I shall tell
you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this
connection between us now. You must promise me, one and all--even you,
my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me."

"What is that time?" The voice was Quincey's, but it was low and
strained.

"When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that
I die than I may live. When I am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
without a moment's delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head;
or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!"

Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her
and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--

"I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps, lived as a man should to
win such a distinction, but I swear to you by all that I hold sacred and
dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not flinch from the duty
that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all
certain, for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has
come!"

"My true friend!" was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,
bending over, she kissed his hand.

"I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!" said Van Helsing.

"And I!" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her husband turned to her
wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
his hair, and asked:--

"And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?"

"You too, my dearest," she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her
voice and eyes. "You must not shrink. You are nearest and dearest and
all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all
time. Think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed
their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the
hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because
those that they loved implored them to slay them. It is men's duty
towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my
dear, if it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at
the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I have not
forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to him who loved"--she stopped
with a flying blush, and changed her phrase--"to him who had best right
to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you to make
it a happy memory of my husband's life that it was his loving hand which
set me free from the awful thrall upon me."

"Again I swear!" came the Professor's resonant voice. Mrs. Harker
smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and
said:--

"And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget:
this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a
time I myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
with your enemy against you."

"One more request;" she became very solemn as she said this, "it is not
vital and necessary like the other, but I want you to do one thing for
me, if you will." We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need
to speak:--

"I want you to read the Burial Service." She was interrupted by a deep
groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
heart, and continued: "You must read it over me some day. Whatever may
be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet
thought to all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!"

"But oh, my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off from you."

"Nay," she said, holding up a warning hand. "I am deeper in death at
this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!"

"Oh, my wife, must I read it?" he said, before he began.

"It would comfort me, my husband!" was all she said; and he began to
read when she had got the book ready.

"How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its
solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter
truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
her husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial
of the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!"

       *       *       *       *       *

She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's coming
relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
of us as we had dreaded.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_15 October, Varna._--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th,
got to Paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
o'clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had
arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--"the
Odessus." The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager
to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into
port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world.
Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is
coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept
nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very
wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to
hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he
had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at
these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He
always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the first:--

"Nothing; all is dark." And to the second:--

"I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. The wind is
high--I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam."
It is evident that the _Czarina Catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on
her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned. He had four
telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
that the _Czarina Catherine_ had not been reported to Lloyd's from
anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should
send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He
was to have a message even if she were not reported, so that he might be
sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.

We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the
Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get
on the boat between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the
form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man's form without
suspicion--which he evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the
box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at our mercy;
for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy,
before he wakes. What mercy he shall get from us will not count for
much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the
ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I
think!

       *       *       *       *       *

_16 October._--Mina's report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
water, darkness and favouring winds. We are evidently in good time, and
when we hear of the _Czarina Catherine_ we shall be ready. As she must
pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.

       *       *       *       *       *

_17 October._--Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome
the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that
he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
a friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own
risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every
facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a
similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who
was much impressed with Godalming's kindly manner to him, and we are all
satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We
have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the
Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and
drive a stake through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall
prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall
have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count's body,
it will soon after fall into dust. In such case there would be no
evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But
even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it
were to come. We mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our
intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the
_Czarina Catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by a special
messenger.

       *       *       *       *       *

_24 October._--A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming,
but only the same story: "Not yet reported." Mina's morning and evening
hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
masts.

_Telegram, October 24th._

_Rufus Smith, Lloyd's, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.
Vice-Consul, Varna._

"_Czarina Catherine_ reported this morning from Dardanelles."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_25 October._--How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is
irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must. We were all wild with
excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's. I
know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs.
Harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After
all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to
let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any
excitement when we were in her presence. In old days she would, I am
sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but
in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The
lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We
talk of her often; we have not, however, said a word to the others. It
would break poor Harker's heart--certainly his nerve--if he knew that we
had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me,
her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for
he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active
danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be
necessary to take steps!... We both know what those steps would have to
be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should
neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
"Euthanasia" is an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to
whoever invented it.

It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the
rate the _Czarina Catherine_ has come from London. She should therefore
arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one
o'clock, so as to be ready.

       *       *       *       *       *

_25 October, Noon_.--No news yet of the ship's arrival. Mrs. Harker's
hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of
excitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and
an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife
which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the
Count if the edge of that "Kukri" ever touches his throat, driven by
that stern, ice-cold hand!

Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About
noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She
had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
that she was sleeping. When, however, her husband mentioned casually
that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to
her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so
well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder
that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep
of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had
been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he
may be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To
his doom, I trust!

       *       *       *       *       *

_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.
She ought to be here by now. That she is still journeying _somewhere_ is
apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as
the ship may now be signalled any moment.

       *       *       *       *       *

_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.
Mrs. Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: "lapping
waves and rushing water," though she added that "the waves were very
faint." The telegrams from London have been the same: "no further
report." Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he
fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:--

"I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina's. Souls and memories can do
strange things during trance." I was about to ask him more, but Harker
just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night
at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.

       *       *       *       *       *

     _28 October._--Telegram. _Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming,
     care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna._

     "_Czarina Catherine_ reported entering Galatz at one o'clock
     to-day."


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_28 October._--When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I
do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been
expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.
The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things
would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose
that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against
ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know
that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if
it be a will-o'-the-wisp to man. It was an odd experience and we all
took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a
moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a
word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. Lord
Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half
stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. Quincey Morris
tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our
old wandering days it meant "action." Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled--actually smiled--the
dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his
action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of
the great Kukri knife and rested there. "When does the next train start
for Galatz?" said Van Helsing to us generally.

"At 6:30 to-morrow morning!" We all started, for the answer came from
Mrs. Harker.

"How on earth do you know?" said Art.

"You forget--or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so
does Dr. Van Helsing--that I am the train fiend. At home in Exeter I
always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my
husband. I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of
the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle
Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I
learned the times very carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn,
as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say."

"Wonderful woman!" murmured the Professor.

"Can't we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his
head: "I fear not. This land is very different from yours or mine; even
if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think.
Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the
tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do
you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship
just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get
his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way
smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John will stay
with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you
may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here
with Madam to make report."

"And I," said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
had been for many a long day, "shall try to be of use in all ways, and
shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting
from me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!"
The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to
each other, met each a grave and troubled glance. We said nothing at the
time, however.

When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.
Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
Harker's journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door
was shut upon her he said to me:--

"We mean the same! speak out!"

"There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may
deceive us."

"Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?"

"No!" said I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone."

"You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell
you something. And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;
but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those
words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In
the trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her
mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship
with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn
then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.
Now he make his most effort to escape us. At present he want her not.

"He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
but he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that
so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that
have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will
come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!
She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great
brain which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and have
a special power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away
altogether--though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall
learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never
feared before. We can only trust the good God. Silence! here she comes!"

I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled
himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into
the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets
of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face
brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and
thumb he said:--

"Friend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,
dear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to
think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to
let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to
where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought
at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet
strong to use his little wings. Nay, like the "Ugly Duck" of my friend
Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that
sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I
read here what Jonathan have written:--

"That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought
his forces over The Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was
beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come
alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph."

"What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count's child-thought see
nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your man-thought see nothing; my
man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word
from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what
it mean--what it _might_ mean. Just as there are elements which rest,
yet when in nature's course they move on their way and they touch--then
pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill
and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and
leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever
study the philosophy of crime? 'Yes' and 'No.' You, John, yes; for it is
a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina; for crime touch you not--not
but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad
universale_. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant,
in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much
from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. That is to
be empiric. The criminal always work at one crime--that is the true
criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and
resourceful; but he be not of man-stature as to brain. He be of
child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he
have done. The little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to
him the ground to start from to do more. '_Dos pou sto_,' said
Archimedes. 'Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!' To do once,
is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have
the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again every time,
just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are
opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues," for
Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He went on:--

"Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with
those so bright eyes." He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and
unconsciously, as she spoke:--

"The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would
so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind.
Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a
clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own
lips--tells that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a
'tight place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had
tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won.
So he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all
hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over
the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube
from Turkey Land."

"Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A moment later he
said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room
consultation:--

"Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope." Turning to
her again, he said with keen expectation:--

"But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid;
John and I know. I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
Speak, without fear!"

"I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical."

"Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think."

"Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small
and his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one
purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube,
leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being
safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful
night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for His great mercy! My soul
is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me
is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for
his ends." The Professor stood up:--

"He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,
whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us.
But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in
God's Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for
his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken
in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he
is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us with so
many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to
sleep. He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind,
there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That
terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him
in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the
sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his;
and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your
suffering at his hands. This is now all the more precious that he know
it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
knowledge of our where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe
that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
hours. We shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril
ourselves that we become like him. Friend John, this has been a great
hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe
and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work
you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do."

And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker
has written with her typewriter all since she brought the MS. to us.




CHAPTER XXVI

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY


_29 October._--This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last
night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset. Each of us
had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual time came round Mrs.
Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and
more serious effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually
necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but
this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--

"I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a
steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. I can hear
men's voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
the rowlocks. A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air
blowing upon me."

Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a
weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.
Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
Harker's hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri. There
was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was
passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. Suddenly she
sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--

"Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!" We
could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. She bustled off to get
tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--

"You see, my friends. _He_ is close to land: he has left his
earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In the night he may lie
hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
not touch it, he cannot achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be
in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did
at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he
be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men
may discover what the box contain. Thus, in fine, if he escape not on
shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
We may then arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come
on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he dare not be his
true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered."

There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
at which time we might learn more from Mrs. Harker.

Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
so short that we began to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole
soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
reply:--

"All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
of wood on wood." She paused, and the red sun shot up. We must wait till
to-night.

And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of
expectation. We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
possibly get in till well after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more
hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw
more light on what is happening.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when
there was no distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
Mrs. Harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the Count's
sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that
her imagination is beginning to work. Whilst she has been in the trance
hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes
on it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count's power
over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did
speak, her words were enigmatical:--

"Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can
hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,
fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves." She stopped and a
shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds,
till, at the end, she shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even
in answer to the Professor's imperative questioning. When she woke from
the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
all alert. She could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in
silence.

       *       *       *       *       *

_30 October, 7 a. m._--We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time
to write later. Sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no
effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with a still
greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor
lost no time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--

"All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off. There is another sound, a
queer one like----" She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.

"Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!" said Van Helsing in an agonised
voice. At the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun
was reddening even Mrs. Harker's pale face. She opened her eyes, and we
all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost
unconcern:--

"Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can't? I don't remember
anything." Then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
turning from one to the other with a troubled look:--

"What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was
lying here, half asleep, and heard you say go on! speak, I command you!'
It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad
child!"

"Oh, Madam Mina," he said, sadly, "it is proof, if proof be needed, of
how I love and honour you, when a word for your good, spoken more
earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I
am proud to obey!"

The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with
anxiety and eagerness.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_30 October._--Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been
ordered by telegraph, he being the one who could best be spared, since
he does not speak any foreign language. The forces were distributed
much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. Jonathan and the two
doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
of the _Czarina Catherine_.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the
Vice-Consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk.
He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_30 October._--At nine o'clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called
on Messrs. Mackenzie & Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of
Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
Godalming's telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
their power. They were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once
on board the _Czarina Catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his
voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a
run.

"Man!" he said, "but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should
have to pay for it wi' some rare piece o' ill luck, so as to keep up the
average. It's no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi' a wind
ahint ye, as though the Deil himself were blawin' on yer sail for his
ain purpose. An' a' the time we could no speer a thing. Gin we were nigh
a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi' us,
till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could
we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi'oot bein' able to signal; an' till we
came to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
never were within hail o' aught. At first I inclined to slack off sail
and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the
Deil was minded to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it
whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would be no to our
miscredit wi' the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an' the Old Mon who
had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
hinderin' him." This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
and commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:--

"Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and
he know when he meet his match!" The skipper was not displeased with the
compliment, and went on:--

"When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o' them,
the Roumanians, came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had
been put on board by a queer lookin' old man just before we had started
frae London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. Man! but the
supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot
their business pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I
felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I wouldn't say it was
agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn't let up for
five days I joost let the wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get
somewheres--well, he would fetch it up a'reet. An' if he didn't, well,
we'd keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and
deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin' sun came
through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz.
The Roumanians were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the
box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi' them aboot it wi' a
handspike; an' when the last o' them rose off the deck wi' his head in
his hand, I had convinced them that, evil eye or no evil eye, the
property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the
river Danube. They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
fling in, and as it was marked Galatz _via_ Varna, I thocht I'd let it
lie till we discharged in the port an' get rid o't althegither. We
didn't do much clearin' that day, an' had to remain the nicht at anchor;
but in the mornin', braw an' airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came
aboard wi' an order, written to him from England, to receive a box
marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the matter was one ready to
his hand. He had his papers a' reet, an' glad I was to be rid o' the
dam' thing, for I was beginnin' masel' to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil
did have any luggage aboord the ship, I'm thinkin' it was nane ither
than that same!"

"What was the name of the man who took it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing with
restrained eagerness.

"I'll be tellin' ye quick!" he answered, and, stepping down to his
cabin, produced a receipt signed "Immanuel Hildesheim." Burgen-strasse
16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so
with thanks we came away.

We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi
Theatre type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were
pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with a little
bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but
important. He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling
him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, a box
which would arrive at Galatz in the _Czarina Catherine_. This he was to
give in charge to a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks
who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his work by
an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube
International Bank. When Skinsky had come to him, he had taken him to
the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all
he knew.

We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable to find him. One of his
neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that he had
gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by
his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
together with the rent due, in English money. This had been between ten
and eleven o'clock last night. We were at a standstill again.

Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that
the body of Skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of
St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
animal. Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the
women crying out "This is the work of a Slovak!" We hurried away lest we
should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.

As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all
convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home
to the hotel to Mina.

When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina
again into our confidence. Things are getting desperate, and it is at
least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was
released from my promise to her.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_30 October, evening._--They were so tired and worn out and dispirited
that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so I asked
them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything
up to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the
"Traveller's" typewriter, and to Mr. Morris for getting this one for
me. I should have felt quite astray doing the work if I had to write
with a pen....

It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered,
what must he be suffering now. He lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his
face is drawn with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can
see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. Oh!
if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.

I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I
have not yet seen.... Whilst they are resting, I shall go over all
carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to
follow the Professor's example, and think without prejudice on the facts
before me....

       *       *       *       *       *

I do believe that under God's providence I have made a discovery. I
shall get the maps and look over them....

       *       *       *       *       *

I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so
I shall get our party together and read it. They can judge it; it is
well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.


_Mina Harker's Memorandum._

(Entered in her Journal.)

_Ground of inquiry._--Count Dracula's problem is to get back to his own
place.

(_a_) He must be _brought back_ by some one. This is evident; for had he
power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man, or wolf,
or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be--confined
as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.

(_b_) _How is he to be taken?_--Here a process of exclusions may help
us. By road, by rail, by water?

1. _By Road._--There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the
city.

(_x_) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint,
a surmise, a doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.

(_y_) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.

(_z_) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order
to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even
his victim--me!

2. _By Rail._--There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to
take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if
left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not
what he intends; and he does not mean to risk it.

3. _By Water._--Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
danger in another. On the water he is powerless except at night; even
then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were
he wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would
indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would
still be desperate.

We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do
is to ascertain _what_ water.

The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may,
then, get a light on what his later task is to be.

_Firstly._--We must differentiate between what he did in London as part
of his general plan of action, when he was pressed for moments and had
to arrange as best he could.

_Secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
know of, what he has done here.

As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent
invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel
Hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. There is
also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but
there must have been some letter or message, since Skinsky came to
Hildesheim.

That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The _Czarina Catherine_
made a phenomenally quick journey--so much so that Captain Donelson's
suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
played the Count's game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind
through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at Galatz. That the
Count's arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared
the box, took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it--and here
we lose the trail. We only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
avoided.

Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival--_on
land_, at Galatz.

The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could
appear in his own form. Here, we ask why Skinsky was chosen at all to
aid in the work? In my husband's diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing
with the Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man's
remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed the general
feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.

My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his
castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from
the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks
who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.
Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and
he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,
by murdering his agent.

I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the
Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in
the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling
level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then,
was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or
poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There
would be no such sound if floating down stream.

Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may
possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more
easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza
which runs up round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as
close to Dracula's castle as can be got by water.


_Mina Harker's Journal--continued._

When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The
others kept shaking me by both hands, and Dr. Van Helsing said:--

"Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where
we were blinded. Now we are on the track once again, and this time we
may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
him by day, on the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he
is powerless to hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry
him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men,
to our Council of War; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
shall do."

"I shall get a steam launch and follow him," said Lord Godalming.

"And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land," said Mr.
Morris.

"Good!" said the Professor, "both good. But neither must go alone. There
must be force to overcome force if need be; the Slovak is strong and
rough, and he carries rude arms." All the men smiled, for amongst them
they carried a small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:--

"I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and
there may be wolves. The Count, if you remember, took some other
precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could
not quite hear or understand. We must be ready at all points." Dr.
Seward said:--

"I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt
together, and we two, well armed, will be a match for whatever may come
along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the
Slovaks, and a chance thrust--for I don't suppose these fellows carry
guns--would undo all our plans. There must be no chances, this time; we
shall not rest until the Count's head and body have been separated, and
we are sure that he cannot re-incarnate." He looked at Jonathan as he
spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear was
torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the
boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...
the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was
silent awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:--

"Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you
are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the
last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has
wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she
will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs are not so quick to run as
once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to
fight with lethal weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in
other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men. Now let
me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and
friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be
landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy's
country. Whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
stream whence he cannot escape to land--where he dares not raise the lid
of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
perish--we shall go in the track where Jonathan went,--from Bistritz
over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam
Mina's hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all
dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near
that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be
made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated." Here
Jonathan interrupted him hotly:--

"Do you mean to say, Professor Van Helsing, that you would bring Mina,
in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil's illness, right
into the jaws of his death-trap? Not for the world! Not for Heaven or
Hell!" He became almost speechless for a minute, and then went on:--

"Do you know what the place is? Have you seen that awful den of hellish
infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every
speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo?
Have you felt the Vampire's lips upon your throat?" Here he turned to
me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry:
"Oh, my God, what have we done to have this terror upon us!" and he sank
down on the sofa in a collapse of misery. The Professor's voice, as he
spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed
us all:--

"Oh, my friend, it is because I would save Madam Mina from that awful
place that I would go. God forbid that I should take her into that
place. There is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not
see. We men here, all save Jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what
is to be done before that place can be purify. Remember that we are in
terrible straits. If the Count escape us this time--and he is strong and
subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for a century, and then
in time our dear one"--he took my hand--"would come to him to keep him
company, and would be as those others that you, Jonathan, saw. You have
told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they
clutched the moving bag that the Count threw to them. You shudder; and
well may it be. Forgive me that I make you so much pain, but it is
necessary. My friend, is it not a dire need for the which I am giving,
possibly my life? If it were that any one went into that place to stay,
it is I who would have to go to keep them company."

"Do as you will," said Jonathan, with a sob that shook him all over, "we
are in the hands of God!"

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Oh, it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked.
How can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
so brave! And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money!
What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
when basely used. I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and
that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could
not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
another hour. It is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
of us was to do; and now Lord Godalming and Jonathan have a lovely steam
launch, with steam up ready to start at a moment's notice. Dr. Seward
and Mr. Morris have half a dozen good horses, well appointed. We have
all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. Professor
Van Helsing and I are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for Veresti,
where we are to get a carriage to drive to the Borgo Pass. We are
bringing a good deal of ready money, as we are to buy a carriage and
horses. We shall drive ourselves, for we have no one whom we can trust
in the matter. The Professor knows something of a great many languages,
so we shall get on all right. We have all got arms, even for me a
large-bore revolver; Jonathan would not be happy unless I was armed like
the rest. Alas! I cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my
forehead forbids that. Dear Dr. Van Helsing comforts me by telling me
that I am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as
warnings.

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--It took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. We may
never meet again. Courage, Mina! the Professor is looking at you keenly;
his look is a warning. There must be no tears now--unless it may be that
God will let them fall in gladness.


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_October 30. Night._--I am writing this in the light from the furnace
door of the steam launch: Lord Godalming is firing up. He is an
experienced hand at the work, as he has had for years a launch of his
own on the Thames, and another on the Norfolk Broads. Regarding our
plans, we finally decided that Mina's guess was correct, and that if any
waterway was chosen for the Count's escape back to his Castle, the
Sereth and then the Bistritza at its junction, would be the one. We took
it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the
place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the
Carpathians. We have no fear in running at good speed up the river at
night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to
make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. Lord Godalming tells me to
sleep for a while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on
watch. But I cannot sleep--how can I with the terrible danger hanging
over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... My only
comfort is that we are in the hands of God. Only for that faith it would
be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. Mr.
Morris and Dr. Seward were off on their long ride before we started;
they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following
of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When
they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and
can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.

It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through
the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the
furnace door....

       *       *       *       *       *

_31 October._--Still hurrying along. The day has come, and Godalming is
sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only
a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every
time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
prayed.

       *       *       *       *       *

_1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the
kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong
in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big
and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,
and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,
so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a
Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we
have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This
was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu
we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he
shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor
dear Mina and me.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 November, morning._--It is broad daylight. That good fellow would not
wake me. He says it would have been a sin to, for I slept peacefully and
was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept
so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new
man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do
all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to
Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the
carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am
afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we
cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how
Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless
streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible
doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have
met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
necessary to take counsel together what to do next.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_2 November._--Three days on the road. No news, and no time to write it
if there had been, for every moment is precious. We have had only the
rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
Those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. We must push on;
we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.

       *       *       *       *       *

_3 November._--We heard at Fundu that the launch had gone up the
Bistritza. I wish it wasn't so cold. There are signs of snow coming; and
if it falls heavy it will stop us. In such case we must get a sledge and
go on, Russian fashion.

       *       *       *       *       *

_4 November._--To-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
accident when trying to force a way up the rapids. The Slovak boats get
up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up
only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got
up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push
on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_31 October._--Arrived at Veresti at noon. The Professor tells me that
this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all, and that all I
could say was: "dark and quiet." He is off now buying a carriage and
horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so
that we may be able to change them on the way. We have something more
than 70 miles before us. The country is lovely, and most interesting; if
only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to
see it all. If Jonathan and I were driving through it alone what a
pleasure it would be. To stop and see people, and learn something of
their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
people! But, alas!--

       *       *       *       *       *

_Later._--Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and
horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The
landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to
me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has
been shopping too, and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats
and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. There will not be any chance of
our being cold.

       *       *       *       *       *

We shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are
truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him,
with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over
my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I
loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and
truest thought will be always for him.




CHAPTER XXVII

MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL


_1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The
horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many
changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;
he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well
to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first
house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an
extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever
since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no
driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay
that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The
Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he
made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he
says that I answered as usual "darkness, lapping water and creaking
wood"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of
Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write
this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.
Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and
grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep
he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make
him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
needed.... All is ready; we are off shortly.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all
night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange
heaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean
that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered
"darkness, creaking wood and roaring water," so the river is changing as
they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
danger--more than need be; but we are in God's hands.

       *       *       *       *       *

_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as
we go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed
so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an
effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.
Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The
houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse
we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He
got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude
four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can
drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what
will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor
darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and
that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His
sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign
to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred
His wrath.


_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._

_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of
Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is
morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept
alive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have
affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so
faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh
and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,
God's will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!

Now to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I
must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
unrecorded.

We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I
saw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our
carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a
couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As
before, came the answer: "darkness and the swirling of water." Then she
woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.
At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--

"This is the way."

"How know you it?" I ask.

"Of course I know it," she answer, and with a pause, add: "Have not my
Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?"

At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one
such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach
road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
more of use.

So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we
sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and
they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan
have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and
she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to
suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may
not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm
her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the
reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I
look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset
time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
it were the end of the world.

Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and
then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as
though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and
myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,
and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we
first enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I
light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go
to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that
she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have
grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She
help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all
of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying
quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice
more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I
wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have
to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have
harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look
in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it
not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even
to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and
death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.

       *       *       *       *       *

_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you
and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long
strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.

All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held
sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I
did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I
began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
she is with that Vampire baptism. "Well," said I to myself, "if it be
that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at
night." As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and
imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked
with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still
sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning
mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell
of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
the end was near.

I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for
even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed
them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make
Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But
I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the
fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round
where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the
time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she
clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when
she had grown more quiet:--

"Will you not come over to the fire?" for I wished to make a test of
what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she
stopped, and stood as one stricken.

"Why not go on?" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat
down in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked
from sleep, she said simply:--

"I cannot!" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she
could not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be
danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!

Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I
came to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they
whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a
time. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to
the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was
with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was
about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying
sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of
some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the
snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to
fear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that
ring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and
all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's
horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy
glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses
cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even
the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I
feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and
circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held
me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low
it was:--

"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!" I turned to her, and
looking in her eyes, said:--

"But you? It is for you that I fear!" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low
and unreal, and said:--

"Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them
than I am," and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of
wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.
Then, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the
wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not
take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me
in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when
they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the
bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came
through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were
of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--

"Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!" In fear I turned to my poor
Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my
heart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I
seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and
laughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for
I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not
approach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within
the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The
horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on
them softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor
beasts no more of terror.

And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but
when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.
At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
towards the castle, and were lost.

Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending
to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I
could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
no response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have
made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have
much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
obscure it, will be to me a safety.

I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible
work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her
sleep....


_Jonathan Harker's Journal._

_4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible
thing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,
off on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we
follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We
have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only
Morris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more
Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.


_Dr. Seward's Diary._

_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing
away from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a
cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly
and there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own
feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of
wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
dangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,
and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,
or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....


_Dr. Van Helsing's Memorandum._

_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy
at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left
Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.
The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was
useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty
hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that
being entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served
me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I
knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if
there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either
there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.
Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.
The dilemma had me between his horns.

Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I
resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
submit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and
freedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the
choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
the grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.

I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are
inhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her
Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as
though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when
such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,
found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,
and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the
wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset
come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair
woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
kiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire
fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...

There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence
of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and
heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
as the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,
with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a
yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my
very soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it
was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields
to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a
long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound
of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.

Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not
pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should
begin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in
a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister
which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of
the mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so
exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls
some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl
with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam
Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought
further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had
searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as
there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the
night, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.
There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
nobly proportioned. On it was but one word

                                DRACULA.

This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more
were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.
Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
awful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished
him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.

Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it
had been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had
been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....

Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by
thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of
fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though
till all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen
the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
won, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have
endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and
left my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them
now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
for a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife
severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and
crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come
centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud "I
am here!"

Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can
the Count enter there Un-Dead.

When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her
sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.

"Come!" she said, "come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my
husband who is, I know, coming towards us." She was looking thin and
pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was
glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.

And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are
coming to meet us.


_Mina Harker's Journal._

_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I
took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did
not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take
heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being
left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our
provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we
could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of
habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy
walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the
clear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under
the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
Carpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,
perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with
seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
on any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We
could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the
sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about
that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
exposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we
could trace it through the drifted snow.

In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined
him. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,
with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the
hand and drew me in: "See!" he said, "here you will be in shelter; and
if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one." He brought in our
furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and
forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was
repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could
not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not
reproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top
of the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--

"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!" I sprang up and stood beside him on the
rock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling
more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning
to blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the
snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we
were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the
white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in
kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far
off--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a
group of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a
long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail
wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the
snow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were
peasants or gypsies of some kind.

On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I
felt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and
well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned
there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all
pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,
however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round
the rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last
night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--

"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!" He took the glasses from
me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
"See," he said, "they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and
galloping as hard as they can." He paused and went on in a hollow
voice:--

"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be
done!" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his
glasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--

"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow
blots it all out!" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward
and Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.
At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around
I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at
break-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,
of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with
the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,
and, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he
laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the
opening of our shelter. "They are all converging," he said. "When the
time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides." I got out my revolver
ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came
louder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.
It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could
see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger
numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.

Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in
fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in
circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;
but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of
late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various
bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer
and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly
had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,
the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each
party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did
not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they
seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
and lower on the mountain tops.

Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind
our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined
that they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our
presence.

All at once two voices shouted out to: "Halt!" One was my Jonathan's,
raised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute
tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but
there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming
and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the
other. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his
horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his
companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang
forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an
unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van
Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew
up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the
gypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held
himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.

The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in
front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill
tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.
For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses
and dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing
Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been
upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,
surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our
parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly
formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
order.

In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring
of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was
evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the
levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor
the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their
attention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they
cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the
cart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great
box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.
Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of
Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,
with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had
seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and
they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first
I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang
beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that
with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was
spurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for
as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked
the other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the
lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and
the top of the box was thrown back.

By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,
and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made
no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the
shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count
lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen
image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I
knew too well.

As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
turned to triumph.

But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.
I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
moment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.

It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from
our sight.

I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final
dissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never
could have imagined might have rested there.

The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
setting sun.

The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
disappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as
if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the
leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,
which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving
us alone.

Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I
flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the
two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his
head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand
in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of
my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--

"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!" he cried
suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, "It was
worth for this to die! Look! look!"

The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse
the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest "Amen" broke from all
as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man
spoke:--

"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not
more stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!"

And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a
gallant gentleman.




                                  NOTE


Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It
is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same
day as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the
secret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into
him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
we call him Quincey.

In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went
over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things
which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The
castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.

When we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all
look back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily
married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since
our return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the
mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later
note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.
We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as
proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with
our boy on his knee:--

"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day
know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her
sweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so
loved her, that they did dare much for her sake."

FROM "THE JOURNAL OF OCCULTISM"
MID-JANUARY, 1907.


A strange story comes from the Adriatic.  It appears that on the night of
the 9th, as the Italia Steamship Company's vessel "Victorine" was passing
a little before midnight the point known as "the Spear of Ivan," on the
coast of the Blue Mountains, the attention of the Captain, then on the
bridge, was called by the look-out man to a tiny floating light close
inshore.  It is the custom of some South-going ships to run close to the
Spear of Ivan in fine weather, as the water is deep, and there is no
settled current; also there are no outlying rocks.  Indeed, some years
ago the local steamers had become accustomed to hug the shore here so
closely that an intimation was sent from Lloyd's that any mischance under
the circumstances would not be included in ordinary sea risks.  Captain
Mirolani is one of those who insist on a wholesome distance from the
promontory being kept; but on his attention having been called to the
circumstance reported, he thought it well to investigate it, as it might
be some case of personal distress.  Accordingly, he had the engines
slowed down, and edged cautiously in towards shore.  He was joined on the
bridge by two of his officers, Signori Falamano and Destilia, and by one
passenger on board, Mr. Peter Caulfield, whose reports of Spiritual
Phenomena in remote places are well known to the readers of "The Journal
of Occultism."  The following account of the strange occurrence written
by him, and attested by the signatures of Captain Mirolani and the other
gentleman named, has been sent to us.

" . . . It was eleven minutes before twelve midnight on Saturday, the 9th
day of January, 1907, when I saw the strange sight off the headland known
as the Spear of Ivan on the coast of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  It
was a fine night, and I stood right on the bows of the ship, where there
was nothing to obstruct my view.  We were some distance from the Spear of
Ivan, passing from northern to southern point of the wide bay into which
it projects.  Captain Mirolani, the Master, is a very careful seaman, and
gives on his journeys a wide berth to the bay which is tabooed by
Lloyd's.  But when he saw in the moonlight, though far off, a tiny white
figure of a woman drifting on some strange current in a small boat, on
the prow of which rested a faint light (to me it looked like a
corpse-candle!), he thought it might be some person in distress, and
began to cautiously edge towards it.  Two of his officers were with him
on the bridge--Signori Falamano and Destilia.  All these three, as well
as myself, saw It.  The rest of the crew and passengers were below.  As
we got close the true inwardness of It became apparent to me; but the
mariners did not seem to realize till the very last.  This is, after all,
not strange, for none of them had either knowledge or experience in
Occult matters, whereas for over thirty years I have made a special study
of this subject, and have gone to and fro over the earth investigating to
the nth all records of Spiritual Phenomena.  As I could see from their
movements that the officers did not comprehend that which was so apparent
to myself, I took care not to enlighten them, lest such should result in
the changing of the vessel's course before I should be near enough to
make accurate observation.  All turned out as I wished--at least, nearly
so--as shall be seen.  Being in the bow, I had, of course, a better view
than from the bridge.   Presently I made out that the boat, which had all
along seemed to be of a queer shape, was none other than a _Coffin_, and
that the woman standing up in it was clothed in a shroud.  Her back was
towards us, and she had evidently not heard our approach.  As we were
creeping along slowly, the engines were almost noiseless, and there was
hardly a ripple as our fore-foot cut the dark water.  Suddenly there was
a wild cry from the bridge--Italians are certainly very excitable; hoarse
commands were given to the Quartermaster at the wheel; the engine-room
bell clanged.  On the instant, as it seemed, the ship's head began to
swing round to starboard; full steam ahead was in action, and before one
could understand, the Apparition was fading in the distance.  The last
thing I saw was the flash of a white face with dark, burning eyes as the
figure sank down into the coffin--just as mist or smoke disappears under
a breeze."




BOOK I: THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON


The Reading of the Will of Roger Melton and all that Followed


Record made by Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, law-student of the Inner
Temple, eldest son of Ernest Halbard Melton, eldest son of Ernest Melton,
elder brother of the said Roger Melton and his next of kin.

I consider it at least useful--perhaps necessary--to have a complete and
accurate record of all pertaining to the Will of my late grand-uncle
Roger Melton.

To which end let me put down the various members of his family, and
explain some of their occupations and idiosyncrasies.  My father, Ernest
Halbard Melton, was the only son of Ernest Melton, eldest son of Sir
Geoffrey Halbard Melton of Humcroft, in the shire of Salop, a Justice of
the Peace, and at one time Sheriff.  My great-grandfather, Sir Geoffrey,
had inherited a small estate from his father, Roger Melton.  In his time,
by the way, the name was spelled Milton; but my great-great-grandfather
changed the spelling to the later form, as he was a practical man not
given to sentiment, and feared lest he should in the public eye be
confused with others belonging to the family of a Radical person called
Milton, who wrote poetry and was some sort of official in the time of
Cromwell, whilst we are Conservatives.  The same practical spirit which
originated the change in the spelling of the family name inclined him to
go into business.  So he became, whilst still young, a tanner and
leather-dresser.  He utilized for the purpose the ponds and streams, and
also the oak-woods on his estate--Torraby in Suffolk.  He made a fine
business, and accumulated a considerable fortune, with a part of which he
purchased the Shropshire estate, which he entailed, and to which I am
therefore heir-apparent.

Sir Geoffrey had, in addition to my grandfather, three sons and a
daughter, the latter being born twenty years after her youngest brother.
These sons were: Geoffrey, who died without issue, having been killed in
the Indian Mutiny at Meerut in 1857, at which he took up a sword, though
a civilian, to fight for his life; Roger (to whom I shall refer
presently); and John--the latter, like Geoffrey, dying unmarried.  Out of
Sir Geoffrey's family of five, therefore, only three have to be
considered: My grandfather, who had three children, two of whom, a son
and a daughter, died young, leaving only my father, Roger and Patience.
Patience, who was born in 1858, married an Irishman of the name of
Sellenger--which was the usual way of pronouncing the name of St. Leger,
or, as they spelled it, Sent Leger--restored by later generations to the
still older form.  He was a reckless, dare-devil sort of fellow, then a
Captain in the Lancers, a man not without the quality of bravery--he won
the Victoria Cross at the Battle of Amoaful in the Ashantee Campaign.
But I fear he lacked the seriousness and steadfast strenuous purpose
which my father always says marks the character of our own family.  He
ran through nearly all of his patrimony--never a very large one; and had
it not been for my grand-aunt's little fortune, his days, had he lived,
must have ended in comparative poverty.  Comparative, not actual; for the
Meltons, who are persons of considerable pride, would not have tolerated
a poverty-stricken branch of the family.  We don't think much of that
lot--any of us.

Fortunately, my great-aunt Patience had only one child, and the premature
decease of Captain St. Leger (as I prefer to call the name) did not allow
of the possibility of her having more.  She did not marry again, though
my grandmother tried several times to arrange an alliance for her.  She
was, I am told, always a stiff, uppish person, who would not yield
herself to the wisdom of her superiors.  Her own child was a son, who
seemed to take his character rather from his father's family than from my
own.  He was a wastrel and a rolling stone, always in scrapes at school,
and always wanting to do ridiculous things.  My father, as Head of the
House and his own senior by eighteen years, tried often to admonish him;
but his perversity of spirit and his truculence were such that he had to
desist.  Indeed, I have heard my father say that he sometimes threatened
his life.  A desperate character he was, and almost devoid of reverence.
No one, not even my father, had any influence--good influence, of course,
I mean--over him, except his mother, who was of my family; and also a
woman who lived with her--a sort of governess--aunt, he called her.  The
way of it was this: Captain St. Leger had a younger brother, who made an
improvident marriage with a Scotch girl when they were both very young.
They had nothing to live on except what the reckless Lancer gave them,
for he had next to nothing himself, and she was "bare"--which is, I
understand, the indelicate Scottish way of expressing lack of fortune.
She was, however, I understand, of an old and somewhat good family,
though broken in fortune--to use an expression which, however, could
hardly be used precisely in regard to a family or a person who never had
fortune to be broken in!  It was so far well that the MacKelpies--that
was the maiden name of Mrs. St. Leger--were reputable--so far as fighting
was concerned.  It would have been too humiliating to have allied to our
family, even on the distaff side, a family both poor and of no account.
Fighting alone does not make a family, I think.  Soldiers are not
everything, though they think they are.  We have had in our family men
who fought; but I never heard of any of them who fought because they
_wanted_ to.  Mrs. St. Leger had a sister; fortunately there were only
those two children in the family, or else they would all have had to be
supported by the money of my family.

Mr. St. Leger, who was only a subaltern, was killed at Maiwand; and his
wife was left a beggar.  Fortunately, however, she died--her sister
spread a story that it was from the shock and grief--before the child
which she expected was born.  This all happened when my cousin--or,
rather, my father's cousin, my first-cousin-once-removed, to be
accurate--was still a very small child.  His mother then sent for Miss
MacKelpie, her brother-in-law's sister-in-law, to come and live with her,
which she did--beggars can't be choosers; and she helped to bring up
young St. Leger.

I remember once my father giving me a sovereign for making a witty remark
about her.  I was quite a boy then, not more than thirteen; but our
family were always clever from the very beginning of life, and father was
telling me about the St. Leger family.  My family hadn't, of course, seen
anything of them since Captain St. Leger died--the circle to which we
belong don't care for poor relations--and was explaining where Miss
MacKelpie came in.  She must have been a sort of nursery governess, for
Mrs. St. Leger once told him that she helped her to educate the child.

"Then, father," I said, "if she helped to educate the child she ought to
have been called Miss MacSkelpie!"

When my first-cousin-once-removed, Rupert, was twelve years old, his
mother died, and he was in the dolefuls about it for more than a year.
Miss MacKelpie kept on living with him all the same.  Catch her quitting!
That sort don't go into the poor-house when they can keep out!  My
father, being Head of the Family, was, of course, one of the trustees,
and his uncle Roger, brother of the testator, another.  The third was
General MacKelpie, a poverty-stricken Scotch laird who had a lot of
valueless land at Croom, in Ross-shire.  I remember father gave me a new
ten-pound note when I interrupted him whilst he was telling me of the
incident of young St. Leger's improvidence by remarking that he was in
error as to the land.  From what I had heard of MacKelpie's estate, it
was productive of one thing; when he asked me "What?" I answered
"Mortgages!"  Father, I knew, had bought, not long before, a lot of them
at what a college friend of mine from Chicago used to call "cut-throat"
price.  When I remonstrated with my father for buying them at all, and so
injuring the family estate which I was to inherit, he gave me an answer,
the astuteness of which I have never forgotten.

"I did it so that I might keep my hand on the bold General, in case he
should ever prove troublesome.  And if the worst should ever come to the
worst, Croom is a good country for grouse and stags!"  My father can see
as far as most men!

When my cousin--I shall call him cousin henceforth in this record, lest
it might seem to any unkind person who might hereafter read it that I
wished to taunt Rupert St. Leger with his somewhat obscure position, in
reiterating his real distance in kinship with my family--when my cousin,
Rupert St. Leger, wished to commit a certain idiotic act of financial
folly, he approached my father on the subject, arriving at our estate,
Humcroft, at an inconvenient time, without permission, not having had
even the decent courtesy to say he was coming.  I was then a little chap
of six years old, but I could not help noticing his mean appearance.  He
was all dusty and dishevelled.  When my father saw him--I came into the
study with him--he said in a horrified voice:

"Good God!"  He was further shocked when the boy brusquely acknowledged,
in reply to my father's greeting, that he had travelled third class.  Of
course, none of my family ever go anything but first class; even the
servants go second.  My father was really angry when he said he had
walked up from the station.

"A nice spectacle for my tenants and my tradesmen!  To see my--my--a
kinsman of my house, howsoever remote, trudging like a tramp on the road
to my estate!  Why, my avenue is two miles and a perch!  No wonder you
are filthy and insolent!"  Rupert--really, I cannot call him cousin
here--was exceedingly impertinent to my father.

"I walked, sir, because I had no money; but I assure you I did not mean
to be insolent.  I simply came here because I wished to ask your advice
and assistance, not because you are an important person, and have a long
avenue--as I know to my cost--but simply because you are one of my
trustees."

"_Your_ trustees, sirrah!" said my father, interrupting him.  "Your
trustees?"

"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, quite quietly.  "I meant the trustees
of my dear mother's will."

"And what, may I ask you," said father, "do you want in the way of advice
from one of the trustees of your dear mother's will?"  Rupert got very
red, and was going to say something rude--I knew it from his look--but he
stopped, and said in the same gentle way:

"I want your advice, sir, as to the best way of doing something which I
wish to do, and, as I am under age, cannot do myself.  It must be done
through the trustees of my mother's will."

"And the assistance for which you wish?" said father, putting his hand in
his pocket.  I know what that action means when I am talking to him.

"The assistance I want," said Rupert, getting redder than ever, "is from
my--the trustee also.  To carry out what I want to do."

"And what may that be?" asked my father.  "I would like, sir, to make
over to my Aunt Janet--"  My father interrupted him by asking--he had
evidently remembered my jest:

"Miss MacSkelpie?"  Rupert got still redder, and I turned away; I didn't
quite wish that he should see me laughing.  He went on quietly:

"_MacKelpie_, sir!  Miss Janet MacKelpie, my aunt, who has always been so
kind to me, and whom my mother loved--I want to have made over to her the
money which my dear mother left to me."  Father doubtless wished to have
the matter take a less serious turn, for Rupert's eyes were all shiny
with tears which had not fallen; so after a little pause he said, with
indignation, which I knew was simulated:

"Have you forgotten your mother so soon, Rupert, that you wish to give
away the very last gift which she bestowed on you?"  Rupert was sitting,
but he jumped up and stood opposite my father with his fist clenched.  He
was quite pale now, and his eyes looked so fierce that I thought he would
do my father an injury.  He spoke in a voice which did not seem like his
own, it was so strong and deep.

"Sir!" he roared out.  I suppose, if I was a writer, which, thank God, I
am not--I have no need to follow a menial occupation--I would call it
"thundered."  "Thundered" is a longer word than "roared," and would, of
course, help to gain the penny which a writer gets for a line.  Father
got pale too, and stood quite still.  Rupert looked at him steadily for
quite half a minute--it seemed longer at the time--and suddenly smiled
and said, as he sat down again:

"Sorry.  But, of course, you don't understand such things."  Then he went
on talking before father had time to say a word.

"Let us get back to business.  As you do not seem to follow me, let me
explain that it is _because_ I do not forget that I wish to do this.  I
remember my dear mother's wish to make Aunt Janet happy, and would like
to do as she did."

"_Aunt_ Janet?" said father, very properly sneering at his ignorance.
"She is not your aunt.  Why, even her sister, who was married to your
uncle, was only your aunt by courtesy."  I could not help feeling that
Rupert meant to be rude to my father, though his words were quite polite.
If I had been as much bigger than him as he was than me, I should have
flown at him; but he was a very big boy for his age.  I am myself rather
thin.  Mother says thinness is an "appanage of birth."

"My Aunt Janet, sir, is an aunt by love.  Courtesy is a small word to use
in connection with such devotion as she has given to us.  But I needn't
trouble you with such things, sir.  I take it that my relations on the
side of my own house do not affect you.  I am a Sent Leger!"  Father
looked quite taken aback.  He sat quite still before he spoke.

"Well, Mr. St. Leger, I shall think over the matter for a while, and
shall presently let you know my decision.  In the meantime, would you
like something to eat?  I take it that as you must have started very
early, you have not had any breakfast?"  Rupert smiled quite genially:

"That is true, sir.  I haven't broken bread since dinner last night, and
I am ravenously hungry."  Father rang the bell, and told the footman who
answered it to send the housekeeper.  When she came, father said to her:

"Mrs. Martindale, take this boy to your room and give him some
breakfast."  Rupert stood very still for some seconds.  His face had got
red again after his paleness.  Then he bowed to my father, and followed
Mrs. Martindale, who had moved to the door.

Nearly an hour afterwards my father sent a servant to tell him to come to
the study.  My mother was there, too, and I had gone back with her.  The
man came back and said:

"Mrs. Martindale, sir, wishes to know, with her respectful service, if
she may have a word with you."  Before father could reply mother told him
to bring her.  The housekeeper could not have been far off--that kind are
generally near a keyhole--for she came at once.  When she came in, she
stood at the door curtseying and looking pale.  Father said:

"Well?"

"I thought, sir and ma'am, that I had better come and tell you about
Master Sent Leger.  I would have come at once, but I feared to disturb
you."

"Well?"  Father had a stern way with servants.  When I'm head of the
family I'll tread them under my feet.  That's the way to get real
devotion from servants!

"If you please, sir, I took the young gentleman into my room and ordered
a nice breakfast for him, for I could see he was half famished--a growing
boy like him, and so tall!  Presently it came along.  It was a good
breakfast, too!  The very smell of it made even me hungry.  There were
eggs and frizzled ham, and grilled kidneys, and coffee, and buttered
toast, and bloater-paste--"

"That will do as to the menu," said mother.  "Go on!"

"When it was all ready, and the maid had gone, I put a chair to the table
and said, 'Now, sir, your breakfast is ready!'  He stood up and said,
'Thank you, madam; you are very kind!' and he bowed to me quite nicely,
just as if I was a lady, ma'am!"

"Go on," said mother.

"Then, sir, he held out his hand and said, 'Good-bye, and thank you,' and
he took up his cap.

"'But aren't you going to have any breakfast, sir?' I says.

"'No, thank you, madam,' he said; 'I couldn't eat here . . . in this
house, I mean!'  Well, ma'am, he looked so lonely that I felt my heart
melting, and I ventured to ask him if there was any mortal thing I could
do for him.  'Do tell me, dear,' I ventured to say.  'I am an old woman,
and you, sir, are only a boy, though it's a fine man you will be--like
your dear, splendid father, which I remember so well, and gentle like
your poor dear mother.'

"'You're a dear!' he says; and with that I took up his hand and kissed
it, for I remember his poor dear mother so well, that was dead only a
year.  Well, with that he turned his head away, and when I took him by
the shoulders and turned him round--he is only a young boy, ma'am, for
all he is so big--I saw that the tears were rolling down his cheeks.
With that I laid his head on my breast--I've had children of my own,
ma'am, as you know, though they're all gone.  He came willing enough, and
sobbed for a little bit.  Then he straightened himself up, and I stood
respectfully beside him.

"'Tell Mr. Melton,' he said, 'that I shall not trouble him about the
trustee business.'

"'But won't you tell him yourself, sir, when you see him?' I says.

"'I shall not see him again,' he says; 'I am going back now!'

"Well, ma'am, I knew he'd had no breakfast, though he was hungry, and
that he would walk as he come, so I ventured to say: 'If you won't take
it a liberty, sir, may I do anything to make your going easier?  Have you
sufficient money, sir?  If not, may I give, or lend, you some?  I shall
be very proud if you will allow me to.'

"'Yes,' he says quite hearty.  'If you will, you might lend me a
shilling, as I have no money.  I shall not forget it.'  He said, as he
took the coin: 'I shall return the amount, though I never can the
kindness.  I shall keep the coin.'  He took the shilling, sir--he
wouldn't take any more--and then he said good-bye.  At the door he turned
and walked back to me, and put his arms round me like a real boy does,
and gave me a hug, and says he:

"'Thank you a thousand times, Mrs. Martindale, for your goodness to me,
for your sympathy, and for the way you have spoken of my father and
mother.  You have seen me cry, Mrs. Martindale,' he said; 'I don't often
cry: the last time was when I came back to the lonely house after my poor
dear was laid to rest.  But you nor any other shall ever see a tear of
mine again.'  And with that he straightened out his big back and held up
his fine proud head, and walked out.  I saw him from the window striding
down the avenue.  My! but he is a proud boy, sir--an honour to your
family, sir, say I respectfully.  And there, the proud child has gone
away hungry, and he won't, I know, ever use that shilling to buy food!"

Father was not going to have that, you know, so he said to her:

"He does not belong to my family, I would have you to know.  True, he is
allied to us through the female side; but we do not count him or his in
my family."  He turned away and began to read a book.  It was a decided
snub to her.

But mother had a word to say before Mrs. Martindale was done with.
Mother has a pride of her own, and doesn't brook insolence from
inferiors; and the housekeeper's conduct seemed to be rather presuming.
Mother, of course, isn't quite our class, though her folk are quite
worthy and enormously rich.  She is one of the Dalmallingtons, the salt
people, one of whom got a peerage when the Conservatives went out.  She
said to the housekeeper:

"I think, Mrs. Martindale, that I shall not require your services after
this day month!  And as I don't keep servants in my employment when I
dismiss them, here is your month's wages due on the 25th of this month,
and another month in lieu of notice.  Sign this receipt."  She was
writing a receipt as she spoke.  The other signed it without a word, and
handed it to her.  She seemed quite flabbergasted.  Mother got up and
sailed--that is the way that mother moves when she is in a wax--out of
the room.

Lest I should forget it, let me say here that the dismissed housekeeper
was engaged the very next day by the Countess of Salop.  I may say in
explanation that the Earl of Salop, K.G., who is Lord-Lieutenant of the
County, is jealous of father's position and his growing influence.
Father is going to contest the next election on the Conservative side,
and is sure to be made a Baronet before long.

_K.C.B._, _of Croom_, _Ross_, _N.B._, _to Rupert Sent Leger_, _Esq._, 14,

    MY DEAR GODSON,

    I am truly sorry I am unable to agree with your request that I should
    acquiesce in your desire to transfer to Miss Janet MacKelpie the
    property bequeathed to you by your mother, of which property I am a
    trustee.  Let me say at once that, had it been possible to me to do
    so, I should have held it a privilege to further such a wish--not
    because the beneficiare whom you would create is a near kinswoman of
    my own.  That, in truth, is my real difficulty.  I have undertaken a
    trust made by an honourable lady on behalf of her only son--son of a
    man of stainless honour, and a dear friend of my own, and whose son
    has a rich heritage of honour from both parents, and who will, I am
    sure, like to look back on his whole life as worthy of his parents,
    and of those whom his parents trusted.  You will see, I am sure, that
    whatsoever I might grant regarding anyone else, my hands are tied in
    this matter.

    And now let me say, my dear boy, that your letter has given me the
    most intense pleasure.  It is an unspeakable delight to me to find in
    the son of your father--a man whom I loved, and a boy whom I
    love--the same generosity of spirit which endeared your father to all
    his comrades, old as well as young.  Come what may, I shall always be
    proud of you; and if the sword of an old soldier--it is all I
    have--can ever serve you in any way, it and its master's life are,
    and shall be, whilst life remains to him, yours.

    It grieves me to think that Janet cannot, through my act, be given
    that ease and tranquillity of spirit which come from competence.
    But, my dear Rupert, you will be of full age in seven years more.
    Then, if you are in the same mind--and I am sure you will not
    change--you, being your own master, can do freely as you will.  In
    the meantime, to secure, so far as I can, my dear Janet against any
    malign stroke of fortune, I have given orders to my factor to remit
    semi-annually to Janet one full half of such income as may be derived
    in any form from my estate of Croom.  It is, I am sorry to say,
    heavily mortgaged; but of such as is--or may be, free from such
    charge as the mortgage entails--something at least will, I trust,
    remain to her.  And, my dear boy, I can frankly say that it is to me
    a real pleasure that you and I can be linked in one more bond in this
    association of purpose.  I have always held you in my heart as though
    you were my own son.  Let me tell you now that you have acted as I
    should have liked a son of my own, had I been blessed with one, to
    have acted.  God bless you, my dear.

                                                               Yours ever,
                                                    COLIN ALEX. MACKELPIE.

    MY DEAR NEPHEW,

    Your letter of the 30th ult. received.  Have carefully considered
    matter stated, and have come to the conclusion that my duty as a
    trustee would not allow me to give full consent, as you wish.  Let me
    explain.  The testator, in making her will, intended that such
    fortune as she had at disposal should be used to supply to you her
    son such benefits as its annual product should procure.  To this end,
    and to provide against wastefulness or foolishness on your part, or,
    indeed, against any generosity, howsoever worthy, which might
    impoverish you and so defeat her benevolent intentions regarding your
    education, comfort, and future good, she did not place the estate
    directly in your hands, leaving you to do as you might feel inclined
    about it.  But, on the contrary, she entrusted the corpus of it in
    the hands of men whom she believed should be resolute enough and
    strong enough to carry out her intent, even against any cajolements
    or pressure which might be employed to the contrary.  It being her
    intention, then, that such trustees as she appointed would use for
    your benefit the interest accruing annually from the capital at
    command, _and that only_ (as specifically directed in the will), so
    that on your arriving at full age the capital entrusted to us should
    be handed over to you intact, I find a hard-and-fast duty in the
    matter of adhering exactly to the directions given.  I have no doubt
    that my co-trustees regard the matter in exactly the same light.
    Under the circumstances, therefore, we, the trustees, have not only a
    single and united duty towards you as the object of the testator's
    wishes, but towards each other as regards the manner of the carrying
    out of that duty.  I take it, therefore, that it would not be
    consonant with the spirit of the trust or of our own ideas in
    accepting it that any of us should take a course pleasant to himself
    which would or might involve a stern opposition on the part of other
    of the co-trustees.  We have each of us to do the unpleasant part of
    this duty without fear or favour.  You understand, of course, that
    the time which must elapse before you come into absolute possession
    of your estate is a limited one.  As by the terms of the will we are
    to hand over our trust when you have reached the age of twenty-one,
    there are only seven years to expire.  But till then, though I should
    gladly meet your wishes if I could, I must adhere to the duty which I
    have undertaken.  At the expiration of that period you will be quite
    free to divest yourself of your estate without protest or comment of
    any man.

    Having now expressed as clearly as I can the limitations by which I
    am bound with regard to the corpus of your estate, let me say that in
    any other way which is in my power or discretion I shall be most
    happy to see your wishes carried out so far as rests with me.
    Indeed, I shall undertake to use what influence I may possess with my
    co-trustees to induce them to take a similar view of your wishes.  In
    my own thinking you are quite free to use your own property in your
    own way.  But as, until you shall have attained your majority, you
    have only life-user in your mother's bequest, you are only at liberty
    to deal with the annual increment.  On our part as trustees we have a
    first charge on that increment to be used for purposes of your
    maintenance, clothes, and education.  As to what may remain over each
    half-year, you will be free to deal with it as you choose.  On
    receiving from you a written authorization to your trustees, if you
    desire the whole sum or any part of it to be paid over to Miss Janet
    MacKelpie, I shall see that it is effected.  Believe me, that our
    duty is to protect the corpus of the estate, and to this end we may
    not act on any instruction to imperil it.  But there our warranty
    stops.  We can deal during our trusteeship with the corpus only.
    Further, lest there should arise any error on your part, we can deal
    with any general instruction for only so long as it may remain
    unrevoked.  You are, and must be, free to alter your instructions or
    authorizations at any time.  Thus your latest document must be used
    for our guidance.

    As to the general principle involved in your wish I make no comment.
    You are at liberty to deal with your own how you will.  I quite
    understand that your impulse is a generous one, and I fully believe
    that it is in consonance with what had always been the wishes of my
    sister.  Had she been happily alive and had to give judgment of your
    intent, I am convinced that she would have approved.  Therefore, my
    dear nephew, should you so wish, I shall be happy for her sake as
    well as your own to pay over on your account (as a confidential
    matter between you and me), but from my own pocket, a sum equal to
    that which you wish transferred to Miss Janet MacKelpie.  On hearing
    from you I shall know how to act in the matter.  With all good
    wishes,

                                                         Believe me to be,
                                                  Your affectionate uncle,
                                                             ROGER MELTON.

    TO RUPERT SENT LEGER, ESQ.

_Letter from Rupert Sent Leger to Roger Melton_,

                                                           _July_ 5, 1892.

    MY DEAR UNCLE,

    Thank you heartily for your kind letter.  I quite understand, and now
    see that I should not have asked you as a trustee, such a thing.  I
    see your duty clearly, and agree with your view of it.  I enclose a
    letter directed to my trustees, asking them to pay over annually till
    further direction to Miss Janet MacKelpie at this address whatever
    sum may remain over from the interest of my mother's bequest after
    deduction of such expenses as you may deem fit for my maintenance,
    clothing, and education, together with a sum of one pound sterling
    per month, which was the amount my dear mother always gave me for my
    personal use--"pocket-money," she called it.

    With regard to your most kind and generous offer to give to my dear
    Aunt Janet the sum which I would have given myself, had such been in
    my power, I thank you most truly and sincerely, both for my dear aunt
    (to whom, of course, I shall not mention the matter unless you
    specially authorize me) and myself.  But, indeed, I think it will be
    better not to offer it.  Aunt Janet is very proud, and would not
    accept any benefit.  With me, of course, it is different, for since I
    was a wee child she has been like another mother to me, and I love
    her very much.  Since my mother died--and she, of course, was
    all-in-all to me--there has been no other.  And in such a love as
    ours pride has no place.  Thank you again, dear uncle, and God bless
    you.

                                                       Your loving nephew,
                                                        RUPERT SENT LEGER.



ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD--_Continued_.


And now _re_ the remaining one of Sir Geoffrey's children, Roger.  He was
the third child and third son, the only daughter, Patience, having been
born twenty years after the last of the four sons.  Concerning Roger, I
shall put down all I have heard of him from my father and grandfather.
From my grand-aunt I heard nothing, I was a very small kid when she died;
but I remember seeing her, but only once.  A very tall, handsome woman of
a little over thirty, with very dark hair and light-coloured eyes.  I
think they were either grey or blue, but I can't remember which.  She
looked very proud and haughty, but I am bound to say that she was very
nice to me.  I remember feeling very jealous of Rupert because his mother
looked so distinguished.  Rupert was eight years older than me, and I was
afraid he would beat me if I said anything he did not like.  So I was
silent except when I forgot to be, and Rupert said very unkindly, and I
think very unfairly, that I was "A sulky little beast."  I haven't forgot
that, and I don't mean to.  However, it doesn't matter much what he said
or thought.  There he is--if he is at all--where no one can find him,
with no money or nothing, for what little he had he settled when he came
of age, on the MacSkelpie.  He wanted to give it to her when his mother
died, but father, who was a trustee, refused; and Uncle Roger, as I call
him, who is another, thought the trustees had no power to allow Rupert to
throw away his matrimony, as I called it, making a joke to father when he
called it patrimony.  Old Sir Colin MacSkelpie, who is the third, said he
couldn't take any part in such a permission, as the MacSkelpie was his
niece.  He is a rude old man, that.  I remember when, not remembering his
relationship, I spoke of the MacSkelpie, he caught me a clip on the ear
that sent me across the room.  His Scotch is very broad.  I can hear him
say, "Hae some attempt at even Soothern manners, and dinna misca' yer
betters, ye young puddock, or I'll wring yer snoot!"  Father was, I could
see, very much offended, but he didn't say anything.  He remembered, I
think, that the General is a V.C. man, and was fond of fighting duels.
But to show that the fault was not his, _he_ wrung _my_ ear--and the same
ear too!  I suppose he thought that was justice!  But it's only right to
say that he made up for it afterwards.  When the General had gone he gave
me a five-pound note.

I don't think Uncle Roger was very pleased with the way Rupert behaved
about the legacy, for I don't think he ever saw him from that day to
this.  Perhaps, of course, it was because Rupert ran away shortly
afterwards; but I shall tell about that when I come to him.  After all,
why should my uncle bother about him?  He is not a Melton at all, and I
am to be Head of the House--of course, when the Lord thinks right to take
father to Himself!  Uncle Roger has tons of money, and he never married,
so if he wants to leave it in the right direction he needn't have any
trouble.  He made his money in what he calls "the Eastern Trade."  This,
so far as I can gather, takes in the Levant and all east of it.  I know
he has what they call in trade "houses" in all sorts of places--Turkey,
and Greece, and all round them, Morocco, Egypt, and Southern Russia, and
the Holy Land; then on to Persia, India, and all round it; the
Chersonese, China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands.  It is not to be
expected that we landowners can know much about trade, but my uncle
covers--or alas! I must say "covered"--a lot of ground, I can tell you.
Uncle Roger was a very grim sort of man, and only that I was brought up
to try and be kind to him I shouldn't ever have dared to speak to him.
But when was a child father and mother--especially mother--forced me to
go and see him and be affectionate to him.  He wasn't ever even civil to
me, that I can remember--grumpy old bear!  But, then, he never saw Rupert
at all, so that I take it Master R--- is out of the running altogether
for testamentary honours.  The last time I saw him myself he was
distinctly rude.  He treated me as a boy, though I was getting on for
eighteen years of age.  I came into his office without knocking; and
without looking up from his desk, where he was writing, he said: "Get
out!  Why do you venture to disturb me when I'm busy?  Get out, and be
damned to you!"  I waited where I was, ready to transfix him with my eye
when he should look up, for I cannot forget that when my father dies I
shall be Head of my House.  But when he did there was no transfixing
possible.  He said quite coolly:

"Oh, it's you, is it?  I thought it was one of my office boys.  Sit down,
if you want to see me, and wait till I am ready."  So I sat down and
waited.  Father always said that I should try to conciliate and please my
uncle.  Father is a very shrewd man, and Uncle Roger is a very rich one.

But I don't think Uncle R--- is as shrewd as he thinks he is.  He
sometimes makes awful mistakes in business.  For instance, some years ago
he bought an enormous estate on the Adriatic, in the country they call
the "Land of Blue Mountains."  At least, he says he bought it.  He told
father so in confidence.  But he didn't show any title-deeds, and I'm
greatly afraid he was "had."  A bad job for me that he was, for father
believes he paid an enormous sum for it, and as I am his natural heir, it
reduces his available estate to so much less.

And now about Rupert.  As I have said, he ran away when he was about
fourteen, and we did not hear about him for years.  When we--or, rather,
my father--did hear of him, it was no good that he heard.  He had gone as
a cabin-boy on a sailing ship round the Horn.  Then he joined an
exploring party through the centre of Patagonia, and then another up in
Alaska, and a third to the Aleutian Islands.  After that he went through
Central America, and then to Western Africa, the Pacific Islands, India,
and a lot of places.  We all know the wisdom of the adage that "A rolling
stone gathers no moss"; and certainly, if there be any value in moss,
Cousin Rupert will die a poor man.  Indeed, nothing will stand his
idiotic, boastful wastefulness.  Look at the way in which, when he came
of age, he made over all his mother's little fortune to the MacSkelpie! I
am sure that, though Uncle Roger made no comment to my father, who, as
Head of our House, should, of course, have been informed, he was not
pleased.  My mother, who has a good fortune in her own right, and has had
the sense to keep it in her own control--as I am to inherit it, and it is
not in the entail, I am therefore quite impartial--I can approve of her
spirited conduct in the matter.  We never did think much of Rupert,
anyhow; but now, since he is in the way to be a pauper, and therefore a
dangerous nuisance, we look on him as quite an outsider.  We know what he
really is.  For my own part, I loathe and despise him.  Just now we are
irritated with him, for we are all kept on tenterhooks regarding my dear
Uncle Roger's Will.  For Mr. Trent, the attorney who regulated my dear
uncle's affairs and has possession of the Will, says it is necessary to
know where every possible beneficiary is to be found before making the
Will public, so we all have to wait.  It is especially hard on me, who am
the natural heir.  It is very thoughtless indeed of Rupert to keep away
like that.  I wrote to old MacSkelpie about it, but he didn't seem to
understand or to be at all anxious--he is not the heir!  He said that
probably Rupert Sent Leger--he, too, keeps to the old spelling--did not
know of his uncle's death, or he would have taken steps to relieve our
anxiety.  Our anxiety, forsooth!  We are not anxious; we only wish to
_know_.  And if we--and especially me--who have all the annoyance of
thinking of the detestable and unfair death-duties, are anxious, we
should be so.  Well, anyhow, he'll get a properly bitter disappointment
and set down when he does turn up and discovers that he is a pauper
without hope!

                                * * * * *

To-day we (father and I) had letters from Mr. Trent, telling us that the
whereabouts of "Mr. Rupert Sent Leger" had been discovered, and that a
letter disclosing the fact of poor Uncle Roger's death had been sent to
him.  He was at Titicaca when last heard of.  So goodness only knows when
he may get the letter, which "asks him to come home at once, but only
gives to him such information about the Will as has already been given to
every member of the testator's family."  And that is nil.  I dare say we
shall be kept waiting for months before we get hold of the estate which
is ours.  It is too bad!

    DEAR SIR,

    I am glad to be able to inform you that I have just heard by letter
    from Mr. Rupert St. Leger that he intended leaving Rio de Janeiro by
    the S.S. _Amazon_, of the Royal Mail Company, on December 15.  He
    further stated that he would cable just before leaving Rio de
    Janeiro, to say on what day the ship was expected to arrive in
    London.  As all the others possibly interested in the Will of the
    late Roger Melton, and whose names are given to me in his
    instructions regarding the reading of the Will, have been advised,
    and have expressed their intention of being present at that event on
    being apprised of the time and place, I now beg to inform you that by
    cable message received the date scheduled for arrival at the Port of
    London was January 1 prox.  I therefore beg to notify you, subject to
    postponement due to the non-arrival of the _Amazon_, the reading of
    the Will of the late Roger Melton, Esq., will take place in my office
    on Thursday, January 3 prox., at eleven o'clock a.m.

                                             I have the honour to be, sir,
                                                         Yours faithfully,
                                                     EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT.

ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON'S RECORD.


                                                        _January_ 4, 1907.

The reading of Uncle Roger's Will is over.  Father got a duplicate of Mr.
Trent's letter to me, and of the cable and two telegrams pasted into this
Record.  We both waited patiently till the third--that is, we did not say
anything.  The only impatient member of our family was my mother.  She
_did_ say things, and if old Trent had been here his ears would have been
red.  She said what ridiculous nonsense it was delaying the reading of
the Will, and keeping the Heir waiting for the arrival of an obscure
person who wasn't even a member of the family, inasmuch as he didn't bear
the name.  I don't think it's quite respectful to one who is some day to
be Head of the House!  I thought father was weakening in his patience
when he said: "True, my dear--true!" and got up and left the room.  Some
time afterwards when I passed the library I heard him walking up and
down.

Father and I went up to town on the afternoon of Wednesday, January 2.
We stayed, of course, at Claridge's, where we always stay when we go to
town.  Mother wanted to come, too, but father thought it better not.  She
would not agree to stay at home till we both promised to send her
separate telegrams after the reading.

At five minutes to eleven we entered Mr. Trent's office.  Father would
not go a moment earlier, as he said it was bad form to seem eager at any
time, but most of all at the reading of a will.  It was a rotten grind,
for we had to be walking all over the neighbourhood for half an hour
before it was time, not to be too early.

When we went into the room we found there General Sir Colin MacKelpie and
a big man, very bronzed, whom I took to be Rupert St. Leger--not a very
creditable connection to look at, I thought!  He and old MacKelpie took
care to be in time!  Rather low, I thought it.  Mr. St. Leger was reading
a letter.  He had evidently come in but lately, for though he seemed to
be eager about it, he was only at the first page, and I could see that
there were many sheets.  He did not look up when we came in, or till he
had finished the letter; and you may be sure that neither I nor my father
(who, as Head of the House, should have had more respect from him) took
the trouble to go to him.  After all, he is a pauper and a wastrel, and
he has not the honour of bearing our Name.  The General, however, came
forward and greeted us both cordially.  He evidently had forgotten--or
pretended to have--the discourteous way he once treated me, for he spoke
to me quite in a friendly way--I thought more warmly than he did to
father.  I was pleased to be spoken to so nicely, for, after all,
whatever his manners may be, he is a distinguished man--has won the V.C.
and a Baronetcy.  He got the latter not long ago, after the Frontier War
in India.  I was not, however, led away into cordiality myself.  I had
not forgotten his rudeness, and I thought that he might be sucking up to
me.  I knew that when I had my dear Uncle Roger's many millions I should
be a rather important person; and, of course, he knew it too.  So I got
even with him for his former impudence.  When he held out his hand I put
one finger in it, and said, "How do?"  He got very red and turned away.
Father and he had ended by glaring at each other, so neither of us was
sorry to be done with him.  All the time Mr. St. Leger did not seem to
see or hear anything, but went on reading his letter.  I thought the old
MacSkelpie was going to bring him into the matter between us, for as he
turned away I heard him say something under his breath.  It sounded like
"Help!" but Mr. S--- did not hear.  He certainly no notice of it.

As the MacS--- and Mr. S--- sat quite silent, neither looking at us, and
as father was sitting on the other side of the room with his chin in his
hand, and as I wanted to show that I was indifferent to the two S's, I
took out this notebook, and went on with the Record, bringing it up to
this moment.



THE RECORD--_Continued_.


When I had finished writing I looked over at Rupert.

When he saw us, he jumped up and went over to father and shook his hand
quite warmly.  Father took him very coolly.  Rupert, however, did not
seem to see it, but came towards me heartily.  I happened to be doing
something else at the moment, and at first I did not see his hand; but
just as I was looking at it the clock struck eleven.  Whilst it was
striking Mr. Trent came into the room.  Close behind him came his clerk,
carrying a locked tin box.  There were two other men also.  He bowed to
us all in turn, beginning with me.  I was standing opposite the door; the
others were scattered about.  Father sat still, but Sir Colin and Mr. St.
Leger rose.  Mr. Trent not did shake hands with any of us--not even me.
Nothing but his respectful bow.  That is the etiquette for an attorney, I
understand, on such formal occasions.

He sat down at the end of the big table in the centre of the room, and
asked us to sit round.  Father, of course, as Head of the Family, took
the seat at his right hand.  Sir Colin and St. Leger went to the other
side, the former taking the seat next to the attorney.  The General
knows, of course, that a Baronet takes precedence at a ceremony.  I may
be a Baronet some day myself, and have to know these things.

The clerk took the key which his master handed to him, opened the tin
box, and took from it a bundle of papers tied with red tape.  This he
placed before the attorney, and put the empty box behind him on the
floor.  Then he and the other man sat at the far end of the table; the
latter took out a big notebook and several pencils, and put them before
him.  He was evidently a shorthand-writer.   Mr. Trent removed the tape
from the bundle of papers, which he placed a little distance in front of
him.  He took a sealed envelope from the top, broke the seal, opened the
envelope, and from it took a parchment, in the folds of which were some
sealed envelopes, which he laid in a heap in front of the other paper.
Then he unfolded the parchment, and laid it before him with the outside
page up.  He fixed his glasses, and said:

"Gentlemen, the sealed envelope which you have seen me open is endorsed
'My Last Will and Testament--ROGER MELTON, _June_, 1906.'  This
document"--holding it up--"is as follows:

    "'I Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange in the County of Dorset; of
    number one hundred and twenty-three Berkeley Square London; and of
    the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains, being of
    sound mind do make this my Last Will and Testament on this day Monday
    the eleventh day of the month of June in the year of Our Lord one
    thousand nine hundred and six at the office of my old friend and
    Attorney Edward Bingham Trent in number one hundred and seventy-six
    Lincoln's Inn Fields London hereby revoking all other wills that I
    may have formerly made and giving this as my sole and last Will
    making dispositions of my property as follows:

    "'1.  To my kinsman and nephew Ernest Halbard Melton Esquire, justice
    of the Peace, Humcroft the County of Salop, for his sole use and
    benefit the sum of twenty thousand pounds sterling free of all Duties
    Taxes and charges whatever to be paid out of my Five per centum Bonds
    of the City of Montreal, Canada.

    "'2.  To my respected friend and colleague as co-trustee to the Will
    of my late sister Patience late widow of the late Captain Rupert Sent
    Leger who predeceased her, Major-General Sir Colin Alexander
    MacKelpie, Baronet, holder of the Victoria Cross, Knight Commander of
    the Order of the Bath, of Croom in the county of Ross Scotland a sum
    of Twenty thousand pounds sterling free of all Taxes and charges
    whatsoever; to be paid out of my Five per centum Bonds of the City of
    Toronto, Canada.

    "'3.  To Miss Janet MacKelpie presently residing at Croom in the
    County of Ross Scotland the sum of Twenty thousand pounds sterling
    free of all Duties Taxes and Charges whatsoever, to be paid out of my
    Five per centum Bonds of the London County Council.

    "'4.  To the various persons charities and Trustees named in the
    schedule attached to this Will and marked A. the various sums
    mentioned therein, all free of Duties and Taxes and charges
    whatsoever.'"

Here Mr. Trent read out the list here following, and announced for our
immediate understanding of the situation the total amount as two hundred
and fifty thousand pounds.  Many of the beneficiaries were old friends,
comrades, dependents, and servants, some of them being left quite large
sums of money and specific objects, such as curios and pictures.

    "'5.  To my kinsman and nephew Ernest Roger Halbard Melton presently
    living in the house of his father at Humcroft Salop the sum of Ten
    thousand pounds sterling.

    "'6.  To my old and valued friend Edward Bingham Trent of one hundred
    and seventy-six Lincoln's Inn Fields sum of Twenty thousand pounds
    sterling free from all Duties Taxes and Charges whatsoever to be paid
    out of my Five per centum Bonds of the city of Manchester England.

    "'7.  To my dear nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my dear sister
    Patience Melton by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger the
    sum of one thousand pounds sterling.  I also bequeath to the said
    Rupert Sent Leger a further sum conditional upon his acceptance of
    the terms of a letter addressed to him marked B, and left in the
    custody of the above Edward Bingham Trent and which letter is an
    integral part of this my Will.  In case of the non-acceptance of the
    conditions of such letter, I devise and bequeath the whole of the
    sums and properties reserved therein to the executors herein
    appointed Colin Alexander MacKelpie and Edward Bingham Trent in trust
    to distribute the same in accordance with the terms of the letter in
    the present custody of Edward Bingham Trent marked C, and now
    deposited sealed with my seal in the sealed envelope containing my
    last Will to be kept in the custody of the said Edward Bingham Trent
    and which said letter C is also an integral part of my Will.  And in
    case any doubt should arise as to my ultimate intention as to the
    disposal of my property the above-mentioned Executors are to have
    full power to arrange and dispose all such matters as may seem best
    to them without further appeal.  And if any beneficiary under this
    Will shall challenge the same or any part of it, or dispute the
    validity thereof, he shall forfeit to the general estate the bequest
    made herein to him, and any such bequest shall cease and be void to
    all intents and purposes whatsoever.

    "'8.  For proper compliance with laws and duties connected with
    testamentary proceedings and to keep my secret trusts secret I direct
    my Executors to pay all Death, Estate, Settlement, Legacy,
    Succession, or other duties charges impositions and assessments
    whatever on the residue of my estate beyond the bequests already
    named, at the scale charged in the case of most distant relatives or
    strangers in blood.

    "'9.  I hereby appoint as my Executors Major-General Sir Colin
    Alexander MacKelpie, Baronet, of Croom in the County of Ross, and
    Edward Bingham Trent Attorney at Law of one hundred and seventy-six
    Lincoln's Inn Fields London West Central with full power to exercise
    their discretion in any circumstance which may arise in the carrying
    out my wishes as expressed in this Will.  As reward for their
    services in this capacity as Executors they are to receive each out
    of the general estate a sum of one hundred thousand pounds sterling
    free of all Duties and impositions whatsoever.

    "12.  The two Memoranda contained in the letters marked B and C are
    Integral Parts of this my Last Will are ultimately at the Probate of
    the Will to be taken as Clauses 10 and 11 of it.  The envelopes are
    marked B and C on both envelope and contents and the contents of each
    is headed thus: B to be read as Clause 10 of my Will and the other C
    to be read as Clause 11 of my Will.

    "13.  Should either of the above-mentioned Executors die before the
    completion of the above year and a half from the date of the Reading
    of my Will or before the Conditions rehearsed in Letter C the
    remaining Executor shall have all and several the Rights and Duties
    entrusted by my Will to both.  And if both Executors should die then
    the matter of interpretation and execution of all matters in
    connection with this my Last Will shall rest with the Lord Chancellor
    of England for the time being or with whomsoever he may appoint for
    the purpose.

    "'This my Last Will is given by me on the first day of January in the
    year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seven.

    other and of the Testator have seen the Testator Roger Melton sign
    and seal this document.  In witness thereof we hereby set our names

    "'ANDREW ROSSITER clerk of 9 Primrose Avenue London W.C.

    "'JOHN COLSON caretaker of 176 Lincoln's Inn Fields and Verger of St.
    Tabitha's Church Clerkenwell London.'"

When Mr. Trent had finished the reading he put all the papers together,
and tied them up in a bundle again with the red tape.  Holding the bundle
in his hand, he stood up, saying as he did so:

"That is all, gentlemen, unless any of you wish to ask me any questions;
in which case I shall answer, of course, to the best of my power.  I
shall ask you, Sir Colin, to remain with me, as we have to deal with some
matters, or to arrange a time when we may meet to do so.  And you also,
Mr. Sent Leger, as there is this letter to submit to you.  It is
necessary that you should open it in the presence of the executors, but
there is no necessity that anyone else should be present."

The first to speak was my father.  Of course, as a county gentleman of
position and estate, who is sometimes asked to take the chair at
Sessions--of course, when there is not anyone with a title present--he
found himself under the duty of expressing himself first.  Old MacKelpie
has superior rank; but this was a family affair, in which my father is
Head of the House, whilst old MacKelpie is only an outsider brought into
it--and then only to the distaff side, by the wife of a younger brother
of the man who married into our family.  Father spoke with the same look
on his face as when he asks important questions of witnesses at Quarter
Sessions.

"I should like some points elucidated."  The attorney bowed (he gets his
120 thou', any way, so he can afford to be oily--suave, I suppose he
would call it); so father looked at a slip of paper in his hand and
asked:

"How much is the amount of the whole estate?"

The attorney answered quickly, and I thought rather rudely.  He was red
in the face, and didn't bow this time; I suppose a man of his class
hasn't more than a very limited stock of manners:

"That, sir, I am not at liberty to tell you.  And I may say that I would
not if I could."

"Is it a million?" said father again.  He was angry this time, and even
redder than the old attorney.  The attorney said in answer, very quietly
this time:

"Ah, that's cross-examining.  Let me say, sir, that no one can know that
until the accountants to be appointed for the purpose have examined the
affairs of the testator up to date."

Mr. Rupert St. Leger, who was looking all this time angrier than even the
attorney or my father--though at what he had to be angry about I can't
imagine--struck his fist on the table and rose up as if to speak, but as
he caught sight of both old MacKelpie and the attorney he sat down again.
_Mem._--Those three seem to agree too well.  I must keep a sharp eye on
them.  I didn't think of this part any more at the time, for father asked
another question which interested me much:

"May I ask why the other matters of the Will are not shown to us?"  The
attorney wiped his spectacles carefully with a big silk bandanna
handkerchief before he answered:

"Simply because each of the two letters marked 'B' and 'C' is enclosed
with instructions regarding their opening and the keeping secret of their
contents.  I shall call your attention to the fact that both envelopes
are sealed, and that the testator and both witnesses have signed their
names across the flap of each envelope.  I shall read them.  The letter
marked 'B,' directed to 'Rupert Sent Leger,' is thus endorsed:

    "'This letter is to be given to Rupert Sent Leger by the Trustees and
    is to be opened by him in their presence.  He is to take such copy or
    make such notes as he may wish and is then to hand the letter with
    envelope to the Executors who are at once to read it, each of them
    being entitled to make copy or notes if desirous of so doing.  The
    letter is then to be replaced in its envelope and letter and envelope
    are to be placed in another envelope to be endorsed on outside as to
    its contents and to be signed across the flap by both the Executors
    and by the said Rupert Sent Leger.

                                          "'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.

"The letter marked 'C,' directed to 'Edward Bingham Trent,' is thus
endorsed:

    "'This letter directed to Edward Bingham Trent is to be kept by him
    unopened for a term of two years after the reading of my Last Will
    unless said period is earlier terminated by either the acceptance or
    refusal of Rupert Sent Leger to accept the conditions mentioned in my
    letter to him marked 'B' which he is to receive and read in the
    presence of my Executors at the same meeting as but subsequent to the
    Reading of the clauses (except those to be ultimately numbers ten and
    eleven) of my Last Will.  This letter contains instructions as to
    what both the Executors and the said Rupert Sent Leger are to do when
    such acceptance or refusal of the said Rupert Sent Leger has been
    made known, or if he omit or refuse to make any such acceptance or
    refusal, at the end of two years next after my decease.

    "'(Signed) ROGER MELTON 1/6/'06.'"

When the attorney had finished reading the last letter he put it
carefully in his pocket.  Then he took the other letter in his hand, and
stood up.  "Mr. Rupert Sent Leger," he said, "please to open this letter,
and in such a way that all present may see that the memorandum at top of
the contents is given as--

    "'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will.'"

St. Leger rolled up his sleeves and cuffs just as if he was going to
perform some sort of prestidigitation--it was very theatrical and
ridiculous--then, his wrists being quite bare, he opened the envelope and
took out the letter.  We all saw it quite well.  It was folded with the
first page outward, and on the top was written a line just as the
attorney said.  In obedience to a request from the attorney, he laid both
letter and envelope on the table in front of him.  The clerk then rose
up, and, after handing a piece of paper to the attorney, went back to his
seat.  Mr. Trent, having written something on the paper, asked us all who
were present, even the clerk and the shorthand man, to look at the
memorandum on the letter and what was written on the envelope, and to
sign the paper, which ran:

"We the signatories of this paper hereby declare that we have seen the
sealed letter marked B and enclosed in the Will of Roger Melton opened in
the presence of us all including Mr. Edward Bingham Trent and Sir Colin
Alexander MacKelpie and we declare that the paper therein contained was
headed 'B.  To be read as clause ten of my Will' and that there were no
other contents in the envelope.  In attestation of which we in the
presence of each other append our signatures."

The attorney motioned to my father to begin.  Father is a cautious man,
and he asked for a magnifying-glass, which was shortly brought to him by
a clerk for whom the clerk in the room called.  Father examined the
envelope all over very carefully, and also the memorandum at top of the
paper.  Then, without a word, he signed the paper.  Father is a just man.
Then we all signed.  The attorney folded the paper and put it in an
envelope.  Before closing it he passed it round, and we all saw that it
had not been tampered with.  Father took it out and read it, and then put
it back.  Then the attorney asked us all to sign it across the flap,
which we did.  Then he put the sealing-wax on it and asked father to seal
it with his own seal.  He did so.  Then he and MacKelpie sealed it also
with their own seals, Then he put it in another envelope, which he sealed
himself, and he and MacKelpie signed it across the flap.

Then father stood up, and so did I.  So did the two men--the clerk and
the shorthand writer.  Father did not say a word till we got out into the
street.  We walked along, and presently we passed an open gate into the
fields.  He turned back, saying to me:

"Come in here.  There is no one about, and we can be quiet.  I want to
speak to you."  When we sat down on a seat with none other near it,
father said:

"You are a student of the law.  What does all that mean?"  I thought it a
good occasion for an epigram, so I said one word:

"Bilk!"

"H'm!" said father; "that is so far as you and I are concerned.  You with
a beggarly ten thousand, and I with twenty.  But what is, or will be, the
effect of those secret trusts?"

"Oh, that," I said, "will, I dare say, be all right.  Uncle Roger
evidently did not intend the older generation to benefit too much by his
death.  But he only gave Rupert St. Leger one thousand pounds, whilst he
gave me ten.  That looks as if he had more regard for the direct line.
Of course--"  Father interrupted me:

"But what was the meaning of a further sum?"

"I don't know, father.  There was evidently some condition which he was
to fulfil; but he evidently didn't expect that he would.  Why, otherwise,
did he leave a second trust to Mr. Trent?"

"True!" said father.  Then he went on: "I wonder why he left those
enormous sums to Trent and old MacKelpie.  They seem out of all
proportion as executors' fees, unless--"

"Unless what, father?"

"Unless the fortune he has left is an enormous one.  That is why I
asked."

"And that," I laughed, "is why he refused to answer."

"Why, Ernest, it must run into big figures."

"Right-ho, father.  The death-duties will be annoying.  What a beastly
swindle the death-duties are!  Why, I shall suffer even on your own
little estate . . . "

"That will do!" he said curtly.  Father is so ridiculously touchy.  One
would think he expects to live for ever.  Presently he spoke again:

"I wonder what are the conditions of that trust.  They are as
important--almost--as the amount of the bequest--whatever it is.  By the
way, there seems to be no mention in the will of a residuary legatee.
Ernest, my boy, we may have to fight over that."

"How do you make that out, father?" I asked.  He had been very rude over
the matter of the death-duties of his own estate, though it is entailed
and I _must_ inherit.  So I determined to let him see that I know a good
deal more than he does--of law, at any rate.  "I fear that when we come
to look into it closely that dog won't fight.  In the first place, that
may be all arranged in the letter to St. Leger, which is a part of the
Will.  And if that letter should be inoperative by his refusal of the
conditions (whatever they may be), then the letter to the attorney begins
to work.  What it is we don't know, and perhaps even he doesn't--I looked
at it as well as I could--and we law men are trained to observation.  But
even if the instructions mentioned as being in Letter C fail, then the
corpus of the Will gives full power to Trent to act just as he darn
pleases.  He can give the whole thing to himself if he likes, and no one
can say a word.  In fact, he is himself the final court of appeal."

"H'm!" said father to himself.  "It is a queer kind of will, I take it,
that can override the Court of Chancery.  We shall perhaps have to try it
before we are done with this!"  With that he rose, and we walked home
together--without saying another word.

My mother was very inquisitive about the whole thing--women always are.
Father and I between us told her all it was necessary for her to know.  I
think we were both afraid that, woman-like, she would make trouble for us
by saying or doing something injudicious.  Indeed, she manifested such
hostility towards Rupert St. Leger that it is quite on the cards that she
may try to injure him in some way.  So when father said that he would
have to go out shortly again, as he wished to consult his solicitor, I
jumped up and said I would go with him, as I, too, should take advice as
to how I stood in the matter.

    "This letter an integral part of my Last Will regards the entire
    residue of my estate beyond the specific bequests made in the body of
    my Will.  It is to appoint as Residuary Legatee of such Will--in case
    he may accept in due form the Conditions herein laid down--my dear
    Nephew Rupert Sent Leger only son of my sister Patience Melton now
    deceased by her marriage with Captain Rupert Sent Leger also now
    deceased.  On his acceptance of the Conditions and the fulfilment of
    the first of them the Entire residue of my estate after payments of
    all specific Legacies and of all my debts and other obligations is to
    become his absolute property to be dealt with or disposed of as he
    may desire.  The following are the conditions.

    "1.  He is to accept provisionally by letter addressed to my
    Executors a sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand pounds
    sterling free of all Duties Taxes or other imposts.  This he will
    hold for a period of six months from the date of the Reading of my
    Last Will and have user of the accruements thereto calculated at the
    rate of ten per centum per annum which amount he shall under no
    circumstances be required to replace.  At the end of said six months
    he must express in writing directed to the Executors of my Will his
    acceptance or refusal of the other conditions herein to follow.  But
    if he may so choose he shall be free to declare in writing to the
    Executors within one week from the time of the Reading of the Will
    his wish to accept or to withdraw altogether from the responsibility
    of this Trust.  In case of withdrawal he is to retain absolutely and
    for his own use the above-mentioned sum of nine hundred and
    ninety-nine thousand pounds sterling free of all Duties Taxes and
    imposts whatsoever making with the specific bequest of one thousand
    pounds a clear sum of one million pounds sterling free of all
    imposts.  And he will from the moment of the delivery of such written
    withdrawal cease to have any right or interest whatsoever in the
    further disposition of my estate under this instrument.  Should such
    written withdrawal be received by my Executors they shall have
    possession of such residue of my estate as shall remain after the
    payment of the above sum of nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand
    pounds sterling and the payment of all Duties Taxes assessments or
    Imposts as may be entailed by law by its conveyance to the said
    Rupert Sent Leger and these my Executors shall hold the same for the
    further disposal of it according to the instructions given in the
    letter marked C and which is also an integral part of my Last Will
    and Testament.

    "2.  If at or before the expiration of the six months above-mentioned
    the said Rupert Sent Leger shall have accepted the further conditions
    herein stated, he is to have user of the entire income produced by
    such residue of my estate the said income being paid to him Quarterly
    on the usual Quarter Days by the aforesaid Executors to wit Major
    General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie Bart. and Edward Bingham Trent
    to be used by him in accordance with the terms and conditions
    hereinafter mentioned.

    "3.  The said Rupert Sent Leger is to reside for a period of at least
    six months to begin not later than three months from the reading of
    my Will in the Castle of Vissarion in the Land of the Blue Mountains.
    And if he fulfil the Conditions imposed on him and shall thereby
    become possessed of the residue of my estate he is to continue to
    reside there in part for a period of one year.  He is not to change
    his British Nationality except by a formal consent of the Privy
    Council of Great Britain.

    "At the end of a year and a half from the Reading of my Will he is to
    report in person to my Executors of the expenditure of amounts paid
    or due by him in the carrying out of the Trust and if they are
    satisfied that same are in general accord with the conditions named
    in above-mentioned letter marked C and which is an integral part of
    my Will they are to record their approval on such Will which can then
    go for final Probate and Taxation.  On the Completion of which the
    said Rupert Sent Leger shall become possessed absolutely and without
    further act or need of the entire residue of my estate.  In witness

    MEMORANDA MADE BY EDWARD BINGHAM TRENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE WILL OF
    ROGER MELTON.

                                                        _January_ 3, 1907.

    The interests and issues of all concerned in the Will and estate of
    the late Roger Melton of Openshaw Grange are so vast that in case any
    litigation should take place regarding the same, I, as the solicitor,
    having the carriage of the testator's wishes, think it well to make
    certain memoranda of events, conversations, etc., not covered by
    documentary evidence.  I make the first memorandum immediately after
    the event, whilst every detail of act and conversation is still fresh
    in my mind.  I shall also try to make such comments thereon as may
    serve to refresh my memory hereafter, and which in case of my death
    may perhaps afford as opinions contemporaneously recorded some
    guiding light to other or others who may later on have to continue
    and complete the tasks entrusted to me.

    I.

    CONCERNING THE READING OF THE WILL OF ROGER MELTON.

    When, beginning at 11 o'clock a.m. on this the forenoon of Thursday,
    the 3rd day of January, 1907, I opened the Will and read it in full,
    except the clauses contained in the letters marked "B" and "C"; there
    were present in addition to myself, the following:

    1.  Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P, nephew of the testator.

    2.  Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, son of the above.

    3.  Rupert Sent Leger, nephew of the testator.

    4.  Major-General Sir Colin Alexander MacKelpie, Bart., co-executor
    with myself of the Will.

    5.  Andrew Rossiter, my clerk, one of the witnesses of the testator's
    Will.

    6.  Alfred Nugent, stenographer (of Messrs. Castle's office, 21,
    Bream's Buildings, W.C.).

When the Will had been read, Mr. E. H. Melton asked the value of the
estate left by the testator, which query I did not feel empowered or
otherwise able to answer; and a further query, as to why those present
were not shown the secret clauses of the Will.  I answered by reading the
instructions endorsed on the envelopes of the two letters marked "B" and
"C," which were sufficiently explanatory.

But, lest any question should hereafter arise as to the fact that the
memoranda in letters marked "B" and "C," which were to be read as clauses
10 and 11 of the Will, I caused Rupert Sent Leger to open the envelope
marked "B" in the presence of all in the room.  These all signed a paper
which I had already prepared, to the effect that they had seen the
envelope opened, and that the memorandum marked "B.  To be read as clause
ten of my Will," was contained in the envelope, of which it was to be the
sole contents.  Mr. Ernest Halbard Melton, J.P., before signing,
carefully examined with a magnifying-glass, for which he had asked, both
the envelope and the heading of the memorandum enclosed in the letter.
He was about to turn the folded paper which was lying on the table over,
by which he might have been able to read the matter of the memorandum had
he so desired.  I at once advised him that the memorandum he was to sign
dealt only with the heading of the page, and not with the matter.  He
looked very angry, but said nothing, and after a second scrutiny signed.
I put the memorandum in an envelope, which we all signed across the flap.
Before signing, Mr Ernest Halbard Melton took out the paper and verified
it.  I then asked him to close it, which he did, and when the sealing-wax
was on it he sealed it with his own seal.  Sir Colin A. MacKelpie and I
also appended our own seals.  I put the envelope in another, which I
sealed with my own seal, and my co-executor and I signed it across the
flap and added the date.  I took charge of this.  When the others present
had taken their departure, my co-executor and I, together with Mr. Rupert
Sent Leger, who had remained at my request, went into my private room.

Here Mr. Rupert Sent Leger read the memorandum marked "B," which is to be
read as clause 10 of the Will.  He is evidently a man of considerable
nerve, for his face was quite impassive as he read the document, which
conveyed to him (subject to the conditions laid down) a fortune which has
no equal in amount in Europe, even, so far as I know, amongst the crowned
heads.  When he had read it over a second time he stood up and said:

"I wish I had known my uncle better.  He must have had the heart of a
king.  I never heard of such generosity as he has shown me.  Mr. Trent, I
see, from the conditions of this memorandum, or codicil, or whatever it
is, that I am to declare within a week as to whether I accept the
conditions imposed on me.  Now, I want you to tell me this: must I wait a
week to declare?"  In answer, I told him that the testator's intention
was manifestly to see that he had full time to consider fully every point
before making formal decision and declaration.  But, in answer to the
specific question, I could answer that he might make declaration when he
would, provided it was _within_, or rather not after, the week named.  I
added:

"But I strongly advise you not to act hurriedly.  So enormous a sum is
involved that you may be sure that all possible efforts will be made by
someone or other to dispossess you of your inheritance, and it will be
well that everything shall be done, not only in perfect order, but with
such manifest care and deliberation that there can be no question as to
your intention."

"Thank you, sir," he answered; "I shall do as you shall kindly advise me
in this as in other things.  But I may tell you now--and you, too, my
dear Sir Colin--that I not only accept my Uncle Roger's conditions in
this, but that when the time comes in the other matters I shall accept
every condition that he had in his mind--and that I may know of--in
everything."  He looked exceedingly in earnest, and it gave me much
pleasure to see and hear him.  It was just what a young man should do who
had seen so generously treated.  As the time had now come, I gave him the
bulky letter addressed to him, marked "D" which I had in my safe.  As I
fulfilled my obligation in the matter, I said:

"You need not read the letter here.  You can take it away with you, and
read it by yourself at leisure.  It is your own property, without any
obligation whatever attached to it.  By the way, perhaps it would be well
if you knew.  I have a copy sealed up in an envelope, and endorsed, 'To
be opened if occasion should arise,' but not otherwise.  Will you see me
to-morrow, or, better still, dine with me alone here to-night?  I should
like to have a talk with you, and you may wish to ask me some questions."
He answered me cordially.  I actually felt touched by the way he said
good-bye before he went away.  Sir Colin MacKelpie went with him, as Sent
Leger was to drop him at the Reform.

    My Dear Nephew,

    When (if ever) you receive this you will know that (with the
    exception of some definite bequests) I have left to you, under
    certain conditions, the entire bulk of my fortune--a fortune so great
    that by its aid as a help, a man of courage and ability may carve out
    for himself a name and place in history.  The specific conditions
    contained in Clause 10 of my Will have to be observed, for such I
    deem to be of service to your own fortune; but herein I give my
    advice, which you are at liberty to follow or not as you will, and my
    wishes, which I shall try to explain fully and clearly, so that you
    may be in possession of my views in case you should desire to carry
    them out, or, at least, to so endeavour that the results I hope for
    may be ultimately achieved.  First let me explain--for your
    understanding and your guidance--that the power, or perhaps it had
    better be called the pressure, behind the accumulation of my fortune
    has been ambition.  In obedience to its compulsion, I toiled early
    and late until I had so arranged matters that, subject to broad
    supervision, my ideas could be carried out by men whom I had selected
    and tested, and not found wanting.  This was for years to the
    satisfaction, and ultimately to the accumulation by these men of
    fortune commensurate in some measure to their own worth and their
    importance to my designs.  Thus I had accumulated, whilst still a
    young man, a considerable fortune.  This I have for over forty years
    used sparingly as regards my personal needs, daringly with regard to
    speculative investments.  With the latter I took such very great
    care, studying the conditions surrounding them so thoroughly, that
    even now my schedule of bad debts or unsuccessful investments is
    almost a blank.  Perhaps by such means things flourished with me, and
    wealth piled in so fast that at times I could hardly use it to
    advantage.  This was all done as the forerunner of ambition, but I
    was over fifty years of age when the horizon of ambition itself
    opened up to me.  I speak thus freely, my dear Rupert, as when you
    read it I shall have passed away, and not ambition nor the fear of
    misunderstanding, nor even of scorn can touch me.  My ventures in
    commerce and finance covered not only the Far East, but every foot of
    the way to it, so that the Mediterranean and all its opening seas
    were familiar to me.  In my journeyings up and down the Adriatic I
    was always struck by the great beauty and seeming richness--native
    richness--of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  At last Chance took me
    into that delectable region.  When the "Balkan Struggle" of '90 was
    on, one of the great Voivodes came to me in secret to arrange a large
    loan for national purposes.  It was known in financial circles of
    both Europe and Asia that I took an active part in the _haute
    politique_ of national treasuries, and the Voivode Vissarion came to
    me as to one able and willing to carry out his wishes.  After
    confidential pour-parlers, he explained to me that his nation was in
    the throes of a great crisis.  As you perhaps know, the gallant
    little Nation in the Land of the Blue Mountains has had a strange
    history.  For more than a thousand years--ever since its settlement
    after the disaster of Rossoro--it had maintained its national
    independence under several forms of Government.  At first it had a
    King whose successors became so despotic that they were dethroned.
    Then it was governed by its Voivodes, with the combining influence of
    a Vladika somewhat similar in power and function to the
    Prince-Bishops of Montenegro; afterwards by a Prince; or, as at
    present, by an irregular elective Council, influenced in a modified
    form by the Vladika, who was then supposed to exercise a purely
    spiritual function.  Such a Council in a small, poor nation did not
    have sufficient funds for armaments, which were not immediately and
    imperatively necessary; and therefore the Voivode Vissarion, who had
    vast estates in his own possession, and who was the present
    representative a family which of old had been leaders in the land,
    found it a duty to do on his own account that which the State could
    not do.  For security as to the loan which he wished to get, and
    which was indeed a vast one, he offered to sell me his whole estate
    if I would secure to him a right to repurchase it within a given time
    (a time which I may say has some time ago expired).  He made it a
    condition that the sale and agreement should remain a strict secret
    between us, as a widespread knowledge that his estate had changed
    hands would in all probability result in my death and his own at the
    hands of the mountaineers, who are beyond everything loyal, and were
    jealous to the last degree.  An attack by Turkey was feared, and new
    armaments were required; and the patriotic Voivode was sacrificing
    his own great fortune for the public good.  What a sacrifice this was
    he well knew, for in all discussions regarding a possible change in
    the Constitution of the Blue Mountains it was always taken for
    granted that if the principles of the Constitution should change to a
    more personal rule, his own family should be regarded as the Most
    Noble.  It had ever been on the side of freedom in olden time; before
    the establishment of the Council, or even during the rule of the
    Voivodes, the Vissarion had every now and again stood out against the
    King or challenged the Princedom.  The very name stood for freedom,
    for nationality, against foreign oppression; and the bold
    mountaineers were devoted to it, as in other free countries men
    follow the flag.

    Such loyalty was a power and a help in the land, for it knew danger
    in every form; and anything which aided the cohesion of its integers
    was a natural asset.  On every side other powers, great and small,
    pressed the land, anxious to acquire its suzerainty by any
    means--fraud or force.  Greece, Turkey, Austria, Russia, Italy,
    France, had all tried in vain.  Russia, often hurled back, was
    waiting an opportunity to attack.  Austria and Greece, although
    united by no common purpose or design, were ready to throw in their
    forces with whomsoever might seem most likely to be victor.  Other
    Balkan States, too, were not lacking in desire to add the little
    territory of the Blue Mountains to their more ample possessions.
    Albania, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Servia, Bulgaria, looked with lustful
    eyes on the land, which was in itself a vast natural fortress, having
    close under its shelter perhaps the finest harbour between Gibraltar
    and the Dardanelles.

    But the fierce, hardy mountaineers were unconquerable.  For centuries
    they had fought, with a fervour and fury that nothing could withstand
    or abate, attacks on their independence.  Time after time, century
    after century, they had opposed with dauntless front invading armies
    sent against them.  This unquenchable fire of freedom had had its
    effect.  One and all, the great Powers knew that to conquer that
    little nation would be no mean task, but rather that of a tireless
    giant.  Over and over again had they fought with units against
    hundreds, never ceasing until they had either wiped out their foes
    entirely or seen them retreat across the frontier in diminished
    numbers.

    For many years past, however, the Land of the Blue Mountains had
    remained unassailable, for all the Powers and States had feared lest
    the others should unite against the one who should begin the attack.

    At the time I speak of there was a feeling throughout the Blue
    Mountains--and, indeed, elsewhere--that Turkey was preparing for a
    war of offence.  The objective of her attack was not known anywhere,
    but here there was evidence that the Turkish "Bureau of Spies" was in
    active exercise towards their sturdy little neighbour.  To prepare
    for this, the Voivode Peter Vissarion approached me in order to
    obtain the necessary "sinews of war."

    The situation was complicated by the fact that the Elective Council
    was at present largely held together by the old Greek Church, which
    was the religion of the people, and which had had since the beginning
    its destinies linked in a large degree with theirs.  Thus it was
    possible that if a war should break out, it might easily
    become--whatever might have been its cause or beginnings--a war of
    creeds.  This in the Balkans must be largely one of races, the end of
    which no mind could diagnose or even guess at.

    I had now for some time had knowledge of the country and its people,
    and had come to love them both.  The nobility of Vissarion's
    self-sacrifice at once appealed to me, and I felt that I, too, should
    like to have a hand in the upholding of such a land and such a
    people.  They both deserved freedom.  When Vissarion handed me the
    completed deed of sale I was going to tear it up; but he somehow
    recognized my intention, and forestalled it.  He held up his hand
    arrestingly as he said:

    "I recognize your purpose, and, believe me, I honour you for it from
    the very depths of my soul.  But, my friend, it must not be.  Our
    mountaineers are proud beyond belief.  Though they would allow
    me--who am one of themselves, and whose fathers have been in some way
    leaders and spokesmen amongst them for many centuries--to do all that
    is in my power to do--and what, each and all, they would be glad to
    do were the call to them--they would not accept aid from one outside
    themselves.  My good friend, they would resent it, and might show to
    you, who wish us all so well, active hostility, which might end in
    danger, or even death.  That was why, my friend, I asked to put a
    clause in our agreement, that I might have right to repurchase my
    estate, regarding which you would fain act so generously."

    Thus it is, my dear nephew Rupert, only son of my dear sister, that I
    hereby charge you solemnly as you value me--as you value yourself--as
    you value honour, that, should it ever become known that that noble
    Voivode, Peter Vissarion, imperilled himself for his country's good,
    and if it be of danger or evil repute to him that even for such a
    purpose he sold his heritage, you shall at once and to the knowledge
    of the mountaineers--though not necessarily to others--reconvey to
    him or his heirs the freehold that he was willing to part with--and
    that he has _de facto_ parted with by the effluxion of the time
    during which his right of repurchase existed.  This is a secret trust
    and duty which is between thee and me alone in the first instance; a
    duty which I have undertaken on behalf of my heirs, and which must be
    carried out, at whatsoever cost may ensue.  You must not take it that
    it is from any mistrust of you or belief that you will fail that I
    have taken another measure to insure that this my cherished idea is
    borne out.  Indeed, it is that the law may, in case of need--for no
    man can know what may happen after his own hand be taken from the
    plough--be complied with, that I have in another letter written for
    the guidance of others, directed that in case of any failure to carry
    out this trust--death or other--the direction become a clause or
    codicil to my Will.  But in the meantime I wish that this be kept a
    secret between us two.  To show you the full extent of my confidence,
    let me here tell you that the letter alluded to above is marked "C,"
    and directed to my solicitor and co-executor, Edward Bingham Trent,
    which is finally to be regarded as clause eleven of my Will.  To
    which end he has my instructions and also a copy of this letter,
    which is, in case of need, and that only, to be opened, and is to be
    a guide to my wishes as to the carrying out by you of the conditions
    on which you inherit.

    And now, my dear nephew, let me change to another subject more dear
    to me--yourself.  When you read this I shall have passed away, so
    that I need not be hampered now by that reserve which I feel has
    grown upon me through a long and self-contained life.  Your mother
    was very dear to me.  As you know, she was twenty years younger than
    her youngest brother, who was two years younger than me.  So we were
    all young men when she was a baby, and, I need not say, a pet amongst
    us--almost like our own child to each of us, as well as our sister.
    You knew her sweetness and high quality, so I need say nothing of
    these; but I should like you to understand that she was very dear to
    me.  When she and your father came to know and love each other I was
    far away, opening up a new branch of business in the interior of
    China, and it was not for several months that I got home news.  When
    I first heard of him they had already been married.  I was delighted
    to find that they were very happy.  They needed nothing that I could
    give.  When he died so suddenly I tried to comfort her, and all I had
    was at her disposal, did she want it.  She was a proud woman--though
    not with me.  She had come to understand that, though I seemed cold
    and hard (and perhaps was so generally), I was not so to her.  But
    she would not have help of any kind.  When I pressed her, she told me
    that she had enough for your keep and education and her own
    sustenance for the time she must still live; that your father and she
    had agreed that you should be brought up to a healthy and strenuous
    life rather than to one of luxury; and she thought that it would be
    better for the development of your character that you should learn to
    be self-reliant and to be content with what your dear father had left
    you.  She had always been a wise and thoughtful girl, and now all her
    wisdom and thought were for you, your father's and her child.  When
    she spoke of you and your future, she said many things which I
    thought memorable.  One of them I remember to this day.  It was
    apropos of my saying that there is a danger of its own kind in
    extreme poverty.  A young man might know too much want.  She answered
    me: "True!  That is so!  But there is a danger that overrides it;"
    and after a time went on:

    "It is better not to know wants than not to know want!"  I tell you,
    boy, that is a great truth, and I hope you will remember it for
    yourself as well as a part of the wisdom of your mother.  And here
    let me say something else which is a sort of corollary of that wise
    utterance:

    I dare say you thought me very hard and unsympathetic that time I
    would not, as one of your trustees, agree to your transferring your
    little fortune to Miss MacKelpie.  I dare say you bear a grudge
    towards me about it up to this day.  Well, if you have any of that
    remaining, put it aside when you know the truth.  That request of
    yours was an unspeakable delight to me.  It was like your mother
    coming back from the dead.  That little letter of yours made me wish
    for the first time that I had a son--and that he should be like you.
    I fell into a sort of reverie, thinking if I were yet too old to
    marry, so that a son might be with me in my declining years--if such
    were to ever be for me.  But I concluded that this might not be.
    There was no woman whom I knew or had ever met with that I could love
    as your mother loved your father and as he loved her.  So I resigned
    myself to my fate.  I must go my lonely road on to the end.  And then
    came a ray of light into my darkness: there was you.  Though you
    might not feel like a son to me--I could not expect it when the
    memory of that sweet relationship was more worthily filled.  But I
    could feel like a father to you.  Nothing could prevent that or
    interfere with it, for I would keep it as my secret in the very holy
    of holies of my heart, where had been for thirty years the image of a
    sweet little child--your mother.  My boy, when in your future life
    you shall have happiness and honour and power, I hope you will
    sometimes give a thought to the lonely old man whose later years your
    very existence seemed to brighten.

    The thought of your mother recalled me to my duty.  I had undertaken
    for her a sacred task: to carry out her wishes regarding her son.  I
    knew how she would have acted.  It might--would--have been to her a
    struggle of inclination and duty; and duty would have won.  And so I
    carried out my duty, though I tell you it was a harsh and bitter task
    to me at the time.  But I may tell you that I have since been glad
    when I think of the result.  I tried, as you may perhaps remember, to
    carry out your wishes in another way, but your letter put the
    difficulty of doing so so clearly before me that I had to give it up.
    And let me tell you that that letter endeared you to me more than
    ever.

    I need not tell you that thenceforth I followed your life very
    closely.  When you ran away to sea, I used in secret every part of
    the mechanism of commerce to find out what had become of you.  Then,
    until you had reached your majority, I had a constant watch kept upon
    you--not to interfere with you in any way, but so that I might be
    able to find you should need arise.  When in due course I heard of
    your first act on coming of age I was satisfied.  I had to know of
    the carrying out of your original intention towards Janet Mac Kelpie,
    for the securities had to be transferred.

    From that time on I watched--of course through other eyes--your chief
    doings.  It would have been a pleasure to me to have been able to
    help in carrying out any hope or ambition of yours, but I realized
    that in the years intervening between your coming of age and the
    present moment you were fulfilling your ideas and ambitions in your
    own way, and, as I shall try to explain to you presently, my
    ambitions also.  You were of so adventurous a nature that even my own
    widely-spread machinery of acquiring information--what I may call my
    private "intelligence department"--was inadequate.  My machinery was
    fairly adequate for the East--in great part, at all events.  But you
    went North and South, and West also, and, in addition, you essayed
    realms where commerce and purely real affairs have no
    foothold--worlds of thought, of spiritual import, of psychic
    phenomena--speaking generally, of mysteries.  As now and again I was
    baffled in my inquiries, I had to enlarge my mechanism, and to this
    end started--not in my own name, of course--some new magazines
    devoted to certain branches of inquiry and adventure.  Should you
    ever care to know more of these things, Mr. Trent, in whose name the
    stock is left, will be delighted to give you all details.  Indeed,
    these stocks, like all else I have, shall be yours when the time
    comes, if you care to ask for them.  By means of _The Journal of
    Adventure_, _The Magazine of Mystery_, _Occultism_, _Balloon and
    Aeroplane_, _The Submarine_, _Jungle and Pampas_, _The Ghost World_,
    _The Explorer_, _Forest and Island_, _Ocean and Creek_, I was often
    kept informed when I should otherwise have been ignorant of your
    whereabouts and designs.  For instance, when you had disappeared into
    the Forest of the Incas, I got the first whisper of your strange
    adventures and discoveries in the buried cities of Eudori from a
    correspondent of _The Journal of Adventure_ long before the details
    given in _The Times_ of the rock-temple of the primeval savages,
    where only remained the little dragon serpents, whose giant ancestors
    were rudely sculptured on the sacrificial altar.  I well remember how
    I thrilled at even that meagre account of your going in alone into
    that veritable hell.  It was from _Occultism_ that I learned how you
    had made a stay alone in the haunted catacombs of Elora, in the far
    recesses of the Himalayas, and of the fearful experiences which, when
    you came out shuddering and ghastly, overcame to almost epileptic
    fear those who had banded themselves together to go as far as the
    rock-cut approach to the hidden temple.

    All such things I read with rejoicing.  You were shaping yourself for
    a wider and loftier adventure, which would crown more worthily your
    matured manhood.  When I read of you in a description of Mihask, in
    Madagascar, and the devil-worship there rarely held, I felt I had
    only to wait for your home-coming in order to broach the enterprise I
    had so long contemplated.  This was what I read:

    "He is a man to whom no adventure is too wild or too daring.  His
    reckless bravery is a byword amongst many savage peoples and amongst
    many others not savages, whose fears are not of material things, but
    of the world of mysteries in and beyond the grave.  He dares not only
    wild animals and savage men; but has tackled African magic and Indian
    mysticism.  The Psychical Research Society has long exploited his
    deeds of valiance, and looked upon him as perhaps their most trusted
    agent or source of discovery.  He is in the very prime of life, of
    almost giant stature and strength, trained to the use of all arms of
    all countries, inured to every kind of hardship, subtle-minded and
    resourceful, understanding human nature from its elemental form up.
    To say that he is fearless would be inadequate.  In a word, he is a
    man whose strength and daring fit him for any enterprise of any kind.
    He would dare and do anything in the world or out of it, on the earth
    or under it, in the sea or--in the air, fearing nothing material or
    unseen, not man or ghost, nor God nor Devil."

    If you ever care to think of it, I carried that cutting in my
    pocket-book from that hour I read it till now.

    Remember, again, I say, that I never interfered in the slightest way
    in any of your adventures.  I wanted you to "dree your own weird," as
    the Scotch say; and I wanted to know of it--that was all.  Now, as I
    hold you fully equipped for greater enterprise, I want to set your
    feet on the road and to provide you with the most potent
    weapon--beyond personal qualities--for the winning of great honour--a
    gain, my dear nephew, which, I am right sure, does and will appeal to
    you as it has ever done to me.  I have worked for it for more than
    fifty years; but now that the time has come when the torch is
    slipping from my old hands, I look to you, my dearest kinsman, to
    lift it and carry it on.

    The little nation of the Blue Mountains has from the first appealed
    to me.  It is poor and proud and brave.  Its people are well worth
    winning, and I would advise you to throw in your lot with them.  You
    may find them hard to win, for when peoples, like individuals, are
    poor and proud, these qualities are apt to react on each other to an
    endless degree.  These men are untamable, and no one can ever succeed
    with them unless he is with them in all-in-all, and is a leader
    recognized.  But if you can win them they are loyal to death.  If you
    are ambitious--and I know you are--there may be a field for you in
    such a country.  With your qualifications, fortified by the fortune
    which I am happy enough to be able to leave you, you may dare much
    and go far.  Should I be alive when you return from your exploration
    in Northern South America, I may have the happiness of helping you to
    this or any other ambition, and I shall deem it a privilege to share
    it with you; but time is going on.  I am in my seventy-second year .
    . . the years of man are three-score and ten--I suppose you
    understand; I do . . . Let me point out this: For ambitious projects
    the great nationalities are impossible to a stranger--and in our own
    we are limited by loyalty (and common-sense).  It is only in a small
    nation that great ambitions can be achieved.  If you share my own
    views and wishes, the Blue Mountains is your ground.  I hoped at one
    time that I might yet become a Voivode--even a great one.  But age
    has dulled my personal ambitions as it has cramped my powers.  I no
    longer dream of such honour for myself, though I do look on it as a
    possibility for you if you care for it.  Through my Will you will
    have a great position and a great estate, and though you may have to
    yield up the latter in accordance with my wish, as already expressed
    in this letter, the very doing so will give you an even greater hold
    than this possession in the hearts of the mountaineers, should they
    ever come to know it.  Should it be that at the time you inherit from
    me the Voivode Vissarion should not be alive, it may serve or aid you
    to know that in such case you would be absolved from any conditions
    of mine, though I trust you would in that, as in all other matters,
    hold obligation enforced by your own honour as to my wishes.
    Therefore the matter stands thus: If Vissarion lives, you will
    relinquish the estates.  Should such not be the case, you will act as
    you believe that I would wish you to.  In either case the
    mountaineers should not know from you in any way of the secret
    contracts between Vissarion and myself.  Enlightenment of the many
    should (if ever) come from others than yourself.  And unless such
    take place, you would leave the estates without any _quid pro quo_
    whatever.  This you need not mind, for the fortune you will inherit
    will leave you free and able to purchase other estates in the Blue
    Mountains or elsewhere that you may select in the world.

    If others attack, attack them, and quicker and harder than they can,
    if such be a possibility.  Should it ever be that you inherit the
    Castle of Vissarion on the Spear of Ivan, remember that I had it
    secretly fortified and armed against attack.  There are not only
    massive grilles, but doors of chilled bronze where such be needed.
    My adherent Rooke, who has faithfully served me for nearly forty
    years, and has gone on my behalf on many perilous expeditions, will,
    I trust, serve you in the same way.  Treat him well for my sake, if
    not for your own.  I have left him provision for a life of ease; but
    he would rather take a part in dangerous enterprises.  He is silent
    as the grave and as bold as a lion.  He knows every detail of the
    fortification and of the secret means of defence.  A word in your
    ear--he was once a pirate.  He was then in his extreme youth, and
    long since changed his ways in this respect; but from this fact you
    can understand his nature.  You will find him useful should occasion
    ever arise.  Should you accept the conditions of my letter, you are
    to make the Blue Mountains--in part, at least--your home, living
    there a part of the year, if only for a week, as in England men of
    many estates share the time amongst them.  To this you are not bound,
    and no one shall have power to compel you or interfere with you.  I
    only express a hope.  But one thing I do more than hope--I desire, if
    you will honour my wishes, that, come what may, you are to keep your
    British nationality, unless by special arrangement with and consent
    of the Privy Council.  Such arrangement to be formally made by my
    friend, Edward Bingham Trent, or whomsoever he may appoint by deed or
    will to act in the matter, and made in such a way that no act save
    that alone of Parliament in all its estates, and endorsed by the
    King, may or can prevail against it.

    My last word to you is, Be bold and honest, and fear not.  Most
    things--even kingship--_somewhere_ may now and again be won by the
    sword.  A brave heart and a strong arm may go far.  But whatever is
    so won cannot be held merely by the sword.  Justice alone can hold in
    the long run.  Where men trust they will follow, and the rank and
    file of people want to follow, not to lead.  If it be your fortune to
    lead, be bold.  Be wary, if you will; exercise any other faculties
    that may aid or guard.  Shrink from nothing.  Avoid nothing that is
    honourable in itself.  Take responsibility when such presents itself.
    What others shrink from, accept.  That is to be great in what world,
    little or big, you move.  Fear nothing, no matter of what kind danger
    may be or whence it come.  The only real way to meet danger is to
    despise it--except with your brains.  Meet it in the gate, not the
    hall.

    My kinsman, the name of my race and your own, worthily mingled in
    your own person, now rests with you!

    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,

    You will, I know, be rejoiced to hear of the great good-fortune which
    has come to me through the Will of Uncle Roger.  Perhaps Sir Colin
    will have written to you, as he is one of the executors, and there is
    a bequest to you, so I must not spoil his pleasure of telling you of
    that part himself.  Unfortunately, I am not free to speak fully of my
    own legacy yet, but I want you to know that at worst I am to receive
    an amount many times more than I ever dreamt of possessing through
    any possible stroke of fortune.  So soon as I can leave
    London--where, of course, I must remain until things are settled--I
    am coming up to Croom to see you, and I hope I shall by then be able
    to let you know so much that you will be able to guess at the
    extraordinary change that has come to my circumstances.  It is all
    like an impossible dream: there is nothing like it in the "Arabian
    Nights."  However, the details must wait, I am pledged to secrecy for
    the present.  And you must be pledged too.  You won't mind, dear,
    will you?  What I want to do at present is merely to tell you of my
    own good-fortune, and that I shall be going presently to live for a
    while at Vissarion.  Won't you come with me, Aunt Janet?  We shall
    talk more of this when I come to Croom; but I want you to keep the
    subject in your mind.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

_From Rupert Sent Leger's Journal_.

                                                        _January_ 4, 1907.

    Things have been humming about me so fast that I have had hardly time
    to think.  But some of the things have been so important, and have so
    changed my entire outlook on life, that it may be well to keep some
    personal record of them.  I may some day want to remember some
    detail--perhaps the sequence of events, or something like that--and
    it may be useful.  It ought to be, if there is any justice in things,
    for it will be an awful swot to write it when I have so many things
    to think of now.  Aunt Janet, I suppose, will like to keep it locked
    up for me, as she does with all my journals and papers.  That is one
    good thing about Aunt Janet amongst many: she has no curiosity, or
    else she has some other quality which keeps her from prying as other
    women would.  It would seem that she has not so much as opened the
    cover of one of my journals ever in her life, and that she would not
    without my permission.  So this can in time go to her also.

    I dined last night with Mr. Trent, by his special desire.  The dinner
    was in his own rooms.  Dinner sent in from the hotel.  He would not
    have any waiters at all, but made them send in the dinner all at
    once, and we helped ourselves.  As we were quite alone, we could talk
    freely, and we got over a lot of ground while we were dining.  He
    began to tell me about Uncle Roger.  I was glad of that, for, of
    course, I wanted to know all I could of him, and the fact was I had
    seen very little of him.  Of course, when I was a small kid he was
    often in our house, for he was very fond of mother, and she of him.
    But I fancy that a small boy was rather a nuisance to him.  And then
    I was at school, and he was away in the East.  And then poor mother
    died while he was living in the Blue Mountains, and I never saw him
    again.  When I wrote to him about Aunt Janet he answered me very
    kindly but he was so very just in the matter that I got afraid of
    him.  And after that I ran away, and have been roaming ever since; so
    there was never a chance of our meeting.  But that letter of his has
    opened my eyes.  To think of him following me that way all over the
    world, waiting to hold out a helping hand if I should want it, I only
    wish I had known, or even suspected, the sort of man he was, and how
    he cared for me, and I would sometimes have come back to see him, if
    I had to come half round the world.  Well, all I can do now is to
    carry out his wishes; that will be my expiation for my neglect.  He
    knew what he wanted exactly, and I suppose I shall come in time to
    know it all and understand it, too.

    I was thinking something like this when Mr. Trent began to talk, so
    that all he said fitted exactly into my own thought.  The two men
    were evidently great friends--I should have gathered that, anyhow,
    from the Will--and the letters--so I was not surprised when Mr. Trent
    told me that they had been to school together, Uncle Roger being a
    senior when he was a junior; and had then and ever after shared each
    other's confidence.  Mr. Trent, I gathered, had from the very first
    been in love with my mother, even when she was a little girl; but he
    was poor and shy, and did not like to speak.  When he had made up his
    mind to do so, he found that she had by then met my father, and could
    not help seeing that they loved each other.  So he was silent.  He
    told me he had never said a word about it to anyone--not even to my
    Uncle Roger, though he knew from one thing and another, though he
    never spoke of it, that he would like it.  I could not help seeing
    that the dear old man regarded me in a sort of parental way--I have
    heard of such romantic attachments being transferred to the later
    generation.  I was not displeased with it; on the contrary, I liked
    him better for it.  I love my mother so much--I always think of her
    in the present--that I cannot think of her as dead.  There is a tie
    between anyone else who loved her and myself.  I tried to let Mr.
    Trent see that I liked him, and it pleased him so much that I could
    see his liking for me growing greater.  Before we parted he told me
    that he was going to give up business.  He must have understood how
    disappointed I was--for how could I ever get along at all without
    him?--for he said, as he laid a hand quite affectionately, I
    thought--on my shoulder:

    "I shall have one client, though, whose business I always hope to
    keep, and for whom I shall be always whilst I live glad to act--if he
    will have me."  I did not care to speak as I took his hand.  He
    squeezed mine, too, and said very earnestly:

    "I served your uncle's interests to the very best of my ability for
    nearly fifty years.  He had full confidence in me, and I was proud of
    his trust.  I can honestly say, Rupert--you won't mind me using that
    familiarity, will you?--that, though the interests which I guarded
    were so vast that without abusing my trust I could often have used my
    knowledge to my personal advantage, I never once, in little matters
    or big, abused that trust--no, not even rubbed the bloom off it.  And
    now that he has remembered me in his Will so generously that I need
    work no more, it will be a very genuine pleasure and pride to me to
    carry out as well as I can the wishes that I partly knew, and now
    realize more fully towards you, his nephew."

    In the long chat which we had, and which lasted till midnight, he
    told me many very interesting things about Uncle Roger.  When, in the
    course of conversation, he mentioned that the fortune Uncle Roger
    left must be well over a hundred millions, I was so surprised that I
    said out loud--I did not mean to ask a question:

    "How on earth could a man beginning with nothing realize such a
    gigantic fortune?"

    "By all honest ways," he answered, "and his clever human insight.  He
    knew one half of the world, and so kept abreast of all public and
    national movements that he knew the critical moment to advance money
    required.  He was always generous, and always on the side of freedom.
    There are nations at this moment only now entering on the
    consolidation of their liberty, who owe all to him, who knew when and
    how to help.  No wonder that in some lands they will drink to his
    memory on great occasions as they used to drink his health."

    "As you and I shall do now, sir!" I said, as I filled my glass and
    stood up.  We drank it in bumpers.  We did not say a word, either of
    us; but the old gentleman held out his hand, and I took it.  And so,
    holding hands, we drank in silence.  It made me feel quite choky; and
    I could see that he, too, was moved.

    I asked Mr. Rupert Sent Leger to dine with me at my office alone, as
    I wished to have a chat with him.  To-morrow Sir Colin and I will
    have a formal meeting with him for the settlement of affairs, but I
    thought it best to have an informal talk with him alone first, as I
    wished to tell him certain matters which will make our meeting
    to-morrow more productive of utility, as he can now have more full
    understanding of the subjects which we have to discuss.  Sir Colin is
    all that can be in manhood, and I could wish no better colleague in
    the executorship of this phenomenal Will; but he has not had the
    privilege of a lifelong friendship with the testator as I have had.
    And as Rupert Sent Leger had to learn intimate details regarding his
    uncle, I could best make my confidences alone.  To-morrow we shall
    have plenty of formality.  I was delighted with Rupert.  He is just
    what I could have wished his mother's boy to be--or a son of my own
    to be, had I had the good-fortune to have been a father.  But this is
    not for me.  I remember long, long ago reading a passage in Lamb's
    Essays which hangs in my mind: "The children of Alice call Bartrum
    father."  Some of my old friends would laugh to see _me_ write this,
    but these memoranda are for my eyes alone, and no one shall see them
    till after my death, unless by my own permission.  The boy takes some
    qualities after his father; he has a daring that is disturbing to an
    old dryasdust lawyer like me.  But somehow I like him more than I
    ever liked anyone--any man--in my life--more even than his uncle, my
    old friend, Roger Melton; and Lord knows I had much cause to like
    him.  I have more than ever now.  It was quite delightful to see the
    way the young adventurer was touched by his uncle's thought of him.
    He is a truly gallant fellow, but venturesome exploits have not
    affected the goodness of heart.  It is a pleasure to me to think that
    Roger and Colin came together apropos of the boy's thoughtful
    generosity towards Miss MacKelpie.  The old soldier will be a good
    friend to him, or I am much mistaken.  With an old lawyer like me,
    and an old soldier like him, and a real old gentlewoman like Miss
    MacKelpie, who loves the very ground he walks on, to look after him,
    together with all his own fine qualities and his marvellous
    experience of the world, and the gigantic wealth that will surely be
    his, that young man will go far.

    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,

    It is all over--the first stage of it; and that is as far as I can
    get at present.  I shall have to wait for a few days--or it may be
    weeks--in London for the doing of certain things now necessitated by
    my acceptance of Uncle Roger's bequest.  But as soon as I can, dear,
    I shall come down to Croom and spend with you as many days as
    possible.  I shall then tell you all I am at liberty to tell, and I
    shall thank you personally for your consent to come with me to
    Vissarion.  Oh, how I wish my dear mother had lived to be with us!
    It would have made her happy, I know, to have come; and then we three
    who shared together the old dear, hard days would have shared in the
    same way the new splendour.  I would try to show all my love and
    gratitude to you both . . . You must take the whole burden of it now,
    dear, for you and I are alone.  No, not alone, as we used to be, for
    I have now two old friends who are already dear to me.  One is so to
    you already.  Sir Colin is simply splendid, and so, in his own way,
    is Mr. Trent.  I am lucky, Aunt Janet, to have two such men to think
    of affairs for me.  Am I not?  I shall send you a wire as soon as
    ever I can see my way to get through my work; and I want you to think
    over all the things you ever wished for in your life, so that I
    may--if there is any mortal way of doing so--get them for you.  You
    will not stand in the way of my having this great pleasure, will you,
    dear?  Good-bye.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    The formal meeting of Sir Colin and myself with Rupert Sent Leger
    went off quite satisfactorily.  From what he had said yesterday, and
    again last night, I had almost come to expect an unreserved
    acceptance of everything stated or implied in Roger Melton's Will;
    but when we had sat round the table--this appeared, by the way, to be
    a formality for which we were all prepared, for we sat down as if by
    instinct--the very first words he said were:

    "As I suppose I must go through this formality, I may as well say at
    once that I accept every possible condition which was in the mind of
    Uncle Roger; and to this end I am prepared to sign, seal, and
    deliver--or whatever is the ritual--whatever document you,
    sir"--turning to me--"may think necessary or advisable, and of which
    you both approve."  He stood up and walked about the room for a few
    moments, Sir Colin and I sitting quite still, silent.  He came back
    to his seat, and after a few seconds of nervousness--a rare thing
    with him, I fancy--said: "I hope you both understand--of course, I
    know you do; I only speak because this is an occasion for
    formality--that I am willing to accept, and at once!  I do so,
    believe me, not to get possession of this vast fortune, but because
    of him who has given it.  The man who was fond of me, and who trusted
    me, and yet had strength to keep his own feelings in check--who
    followed me in spirit to far lands and desperate adventures, and who,
    though he might be across the world from me, was ready to put out a
    hand to save or help me, was no common man; and his care of my
    mother's son meant no common love for my dear mother.  And so she and
    I together accept his trust, come of it what may.  I have been
    thinking it over all night, and all the time I could not get out of
    the idea that mother was somewhere near me.  The only thought that
    could debar me from doing as I wished to do--and intend to do--would
    be that she would not approve.  Now that I am satisfied she would
    approve, I accept.  Whatever may result or happen, I shall go on
    following the course that he has set for me.  So help me, God!"  Sir
    Colin stood up, and I must say a more martial figure I never saw.  He
    was in full uniform, for he was going on to the King's levee after
    our business.  He drew his sword from the scabbard and laid it naked
    on the table before Rupert, and said:

    "You are going, sir, into a strange and danger country--I have been
    reading about it since we met--and you will be largely alone amongst
    fierce mountaineers who resent the very presence of a stranger, and
    to whom you are, and must be, one.  If you should ever be in any
    trouble and want a man to stand back to back with you, I hope you
    will give me the honour!"  As he said this pointed to his sword.
    Rupert and I were also standing now--one cannot sit down in the
    presence of such an act as that.  "You are, I am proud to say, allied
    with my family: and I only wish to God it was closer to myself."
    Rupert took him by the hand and bent his head before him as answered:

    "The honour is mine, Sir Colin; and no greater can come to any man
    than that which you have just done me.  The best way I can show how I
    value it will be to call on you if I am ever in such a tight place.
    By Jove, sir, this is history repeating itself.  Aunt Janet used to
    tell me when I was a youngster how MacKelpie of Croom laid his sword
    before Prince Charlie.  I hope I may tell her of this; it would make
    her so proud and happy.  Don't imagine, sir, that I am thinking
    myself a Charles Edward.  It is only that Aunt Janet is so good to me
    that I might well think I was."

    Sir Colin bowed grandly:

    "Rupert Sent Leger, my dear niece is a woman of great discretion and
    discernment.  And, moreover, I am thinking she has in her some of the
    gift of Second Sight that has been a heritage of our blood.  And I am
    one with my niece--in everything!"  The whole thing was quite regal
    in manner; it seemed to take me back to the days of the Pretender.

    It was not, however, a time for sentiment, but for action--we had met
    regarding the future, not the past; so I produced the short document
    I had already prepared.  On the strength of his steadfast declaration
    that he would accept the terms of the Will and the secret letters, I
    had got ready a formal acceptance.  When I had once again formally
    asked Mr. Sent Leger's wishes, and he had declared his wish to
    accept, I got in a couple of my clerks as witnesses.

    Then, having again asked him in their presence if it was his wish to
    declare acceptance of the conditions, the document was signed and
    witnessed, Sir Colin and I both appending our signatures to the
    Attestation.

    And so the first stage of Rupert Sent Leger's inheritance is
    completed.  The next step will not have to be undertaken on my part
    until the expiration of six months from his entry on his estate at
    Vissarion.  As he announces his intention of going within a
    fortnight, this will mean practically a little over six months from
    now.

                                                       _January_ 23, 1907.

    MY DEAREST AUNT JANET,

    As you see, I am here at last.  Having got my formal duty done, as
    you made me promise--my letters reporting arrival to Sir Colin and
    Mr. Trent are lying sealed in front of me ready to post (for nothing
    shall go before yours)--I am free to speak to you.

    This is a most lovely place, and I hope you will like it.  I am quite
    sure you will.  We passed it in the steamer coming from Trieste to
    Durazzo.  I knew the locality from the chart, and it was pointed out
    to me by one of the officers with whom I had become quite friendly,
    and who kindly showed me interesting places whenever we got within
    sight of shore.  The Spear of Ivan, on which the Castle stands, is a
    headland running well out into the sea.  It is quite a peculiar
    place--a sort of headland on a headland, jutting out into a deep,
    wide bay, so that, though it is a promontory, it is as far away from
    the traffic of coast life as anything you can conceive.  The main
    promontory is the end of a range of mountains, and looms up vast,
    towering over everything, a mass of sapphire blue.  I can well
    understand how the country came to be called the "Land of the Blue
    Mountains," for it is all mountains, and they are all blue!  The
    coast-line is magnificent--what is called "iron-bound"--being all
    rocky; sometimes great frowning precipices; sometimes jutting spurs
    of rock; again little rocky islets, now and again clad with trees and
    verdure, at other places stark and bare.  Elsewhere are little rocky
    bays and indentations--always rock, and often with long, interesting
    caves.  Some of the shores of the bays are sandy, or else ridges of
    beautiful pebbles, where the waves make endless murmur.

    But of all the places I have seen--in this land or any other--the
    most absolutely beautiful is Vissarion.  It stands at the ultimate
    point of the promontory--I mean the little, or, rather, lesser
    promontory--that continues on the spur of the mountain range.  For
    the lesser promontory or extension of the mountain is in reality
    vast; the lowest bit of cliff along the sea-front is not less than a
    couple of hundred feet high.  That point of rock is really very
    peculiar.  I think Dame Nature must, in the early days of her
    housekeeping--or, rather, house-_building_--have intended to give her
    little child, man, a rudimentary lesson in self-protection.  It is
    just a natural bastion such as a titanic Vauban might have designed
    in primeval times.  So far as the Castle is concerned, it is alone
    visible from the sea.  Any enemy approaching could see only that
    frowning wall of black rock, of vast height and perpendicular
    steepness.  Even the old fortifications which crown it are not built,
    but cut in the solid rock.  A long narrow creek of very deep water,
    walled in by high, steep cliffs, runs in behind the Castle, bending
    north and west, making safe and secret anchorage.  Into the creek
    falls over a precipice a mountain-stream, which never fails in volume
    of water.  On the western shore of that creek is the Castle, a huge
    pile of buildings of every style of architecture, from the Twelfth
    century to where such things seemed to stop in this dear old-world
    land--about the time of Queen Elizabeth.  So it is pretty
    picturesque.  I can tell you.  When we got the first glimpse of the
    place from the steamer the officer, with whom I was on the bridge,
    pointed towards it and said:

    "That is where we saw the dead woman floating in a coffin."  That was
    rather interesting, so I asked him all about it.  He took from his
    pocket-book a cutting from an Italian paper, which he handed to me.
    As I can read and speak Italian fairly well, it was all right; but as
    you, my dear Aunt Janet, are not skilled in languages, and as I doubt
    if there is any assistance of the kind to be had at Croom, I do not
    send it.  But as I have heard that the item has been produced in the
    last number of _The Journal of Occultism_, you will be easily able to
    get it.  As he handed me the cutting he said: "I am Destilia!"  His
    story was so strange that I asked him a good many questions about it.
    He answered me quite frankly on every point, but always adhering
    stoutly to the main point--namely, that it was no phantom or mirage,
    no dream or imperfect vision in a fog.  "We were four in all who saw
    it," he said--"three from the bridge and the Englishman,
    Caulfield--from the bows--whose account exactly agreed with what we
    saw.  Captain Mirolani and Falamano and I were all awake and in good
    trim.  We looked with our night-glasses, which are more than usually
    powerful.  You know, we need good glasses for the east shore of the
    Adriatic and for among the islands to the south.  There was a full
    moon and a brilliant light.  Of course we were a little way off, for
    though the Spear of Ivan is in deep water, one has to be careful of
    currents, for it is in just such places that the dangerous currents
    run."  The agent of Lloyd's told me only a few weeks ago that it was
    only after a prolonged investigation of the tidal and sea currents
    that the house decided to except from ordinary sea risks losses due
    to a too close course by the Spear of Ivan.  When I tried to get a
    little more definite account of the coffin-boat and the dead lady
    that is given in _The Journal of Occultism_ he simply shrugged his
    shoulders.  "Signor, it is all," he said.  "That Englishman wrote
    everything after endless questioning."

    So you see, my dear, that our new home is not without superstitious
    interests of its own.  It is rather a nice idea, is it not, to have a
    dead woman cruising round our promontory in a coffin?  I doubt if
    even at Croom you can beat that.  "Makes the place kind of homey," as
    an American would say.  When you come, Aunt Janet, you will not feel
    lonesome, at any rate, and it will save us the trouble of importing
    some of your Highland ghosts to make you feel at home in the new
    land.  I don't know, but we might ask the stiff to come to tea with
    us.  Of course, it would be a late tea.  Somewhere between midnight
    and cock-crow would be about the etiquette of the thing, I fancy!

    But I must tell you all the realities of the Castle and around it.
    So I will write again within a day or two, and try to let you know
    enough to prepare you for coming here.  Till then adieu, my dear.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    I hope I did not frighten you, dear Aunt Janet, by the yarn of the
    lady in the coffin.  But I know you are not afraid; you have told me
    too many weird stories for me to dread that.  Besides, you have
    Second Sight--latent, at all events.  However, there won't be any
    more ghosts, or about ghosts, in this letter.  I want to tell you all
    about our new home.  I am so glad you are coming out so soon; I am
    beginning to feel so lonesome--I walk about sometimes aimlessly, and
    find my thoughts drifting in such an odd way.  If I didn't know
    better, I might begin to think I was in love!  There is no one here
    to be in love with; so make your mind easy, Aunt Janet.  Not that you
    would be unhappy, I know, dear, if I _did_ fall in love.  I suppose I
    must marry some day.  It is a duty now, I know, when there is such an
    estate as Uncle Roger has left me.  And I know this: I shall never
    marry any woman unless I love her.  And I am right sure that if I do
    love her you will love her, too, Aunt Janet!  Won't you, dear?  It
    wouldn't be half a delight if you didn't.  It won't if you don't.
    There, now!

    But before I begin to describe Vissarion I shall throw a sop to you
    as a chatelaine; that may give you patience to read the rest.  The
    Castle needs a lot of things to make it comfortable--as you would
    consider it.  In fact, it is absolutely destitute of everything of a
    domestic nature.  Uncle Roger had it vetted on the defence side, and
    so far it could stand a siege.  But it couldn't cook a dinner or go
    through a spring-cleaning!  As you know, I am not much up in domestic
    matters, and so I cannot give you details; but you may take it that
    it wants everything.  I don't mean furniture, or silver, or even
    gold-plate, or works of art, for it is full of the most magnificent
    old things that you can imagine.  I think Uncle Roger must have been
    a collector, and gathered a lot of good things in all sorts of
    places, stored them for years, and then sent them here.  But as to
    glass, china, delft, all sorts of crockery, linen, household
    appliances and machinery, cooking utensils--except of the
    simplest--there are none.  I don't think Uncle Roger could have lived
    here more than on a temporary picnic.  So far as I only am concerned,
    I am all right; a gridiron and a saucepan are all _I_ want--and I can
    use them myself.  But, dear Aunt Janet, I don't want you to pig it.
    I would like you to have everything you can imagine, and all of the
    very best.  Cost doesn't count now for us, thanks to Uncle Roger; and
    so I want you to order all.  I know you, dear--being a woman--won't
    object to shopping.  But it will have to be wholesale.  This is an
    enormous place, and will swallow up all you can buy--like a
    quicksand.  Do as you like about choosing, but get all the help you
    can.  Don't be afraid of getting too much.  You can't, or of being
    idle when you are here.  I assure you that when you come there will
    be so much to do and so many things to think of that you will want to
    get away from it all.  And, besides, Aunt Janet, I hope you won't be
    too long.  Indeed, I don't wish to be selfish, but your boy is
    lonely, and wants you.  And when you get here you will be an EMPRESS.
    I don't altogether like doing so, lest I should offend a
    millionairess like you; but it may facilitate matters, and the way's
    of commerce are strict, though devious.  So I send you a cheque for
    1,000 pounds for the little things: and a letter to the bank to
    honour your own cheques for any amount I have got.

    I think, by the way, I should, if I were you, take or send out a few
    servants--not too many at first, only just enough to attend on our
    two selves.  You can arrange to send for any more you may want later.
    Engage them, and arrange for their being paid--when they are in our
    service we must treat them well--and then they can be at our call as
    you find that we want them.  I think you should secure, say, fifty or
    a hundred--'tis an awfu' big place, Aunt Janet!  And in the same way
    will you secure--and, of course, arrange for pay similarly--a hundred
    men, exclusive of any servants you think it well to have.  I should
    like the General, if he can give the time, to choose or pass them.  I
    want clansmen that I can depend on, if need be.  We are going to live
    in a country which is at present strange to us, and it is well to
    look things in the face.  I know Sir Colin will only have men who are
    a credit to Scotland and to Ross and to Croom--men who will impress
    the Blue Mountaineers.  I know they will take them to their
    hearts--certainly if any of them are bachelors the girls will!
    Forgive me!  But if we are to settle here, our followers will
    probably want to settle also.  Moreover, the Blue Mountaineers may
    want followers also!  And will want them to settle, too, and have
    successors!

    Now for the description of the place.  Well, I simply can't just now.
    It is all so wonderful and so beautiful.  The Castle--I have written
    so much already about other things that I really must keep the Castle
    for another letter!  Love to Sir Colin if he is at Croom.  And oh,
    dear Aunt Janet, how I wish that my dear mother was coming out!  It
    all seems so dark and empty without her.  How she would have enjoyed
    it!  How proud she would have been!  And, my dear, if she could be
    with us again, how grateful she would have been to you for all you
    have done for her boy!  As I am, believe me, most truly and sincerely
    and affectionately grateful.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    Please read this as if it was a part of the letter I wrote yesterday.

    The Castle itself is so vast that I really can't describe it in
    detail.  So I am waiting till you come; and then you and I will go
    over it together and learn all that we can about it.  We shall take
    Rooke with us, and, as he is supposed to know every part of it, from
    the keep to the torture-chamber, we can spend a few days over it.  Of
    course, I have been over most of it, since I came--that, is, I went
    at various times to see different portions--the battlements, the
    bastions, the old guard-room, the hall, the chapel, the walls, the
    roof.  And I have been through some of the network of rock passages.
    Uncle Roger must have spent a mint of money on it, so far as I can
    see; and though I am not a soldier, I have been in so many places
    fortified in different ways that I am not entirely ignorant of the
    subject.  He has restored it in such an up-to-date way that it is
    practically impregnable to anything under big guns or a siege-train.
    He has gone so far as to have certain outworks and the keep covered
    with armoured plating of what looks like harveyized steel.  You will
    wonder when you see it.  But as yet I really know only a few rooms,
    and am familiar with only one--my own room.  The drawing-room--not
    the great hall, which is a vast place; the library--a magnificent
    one, but in sad disorder--we must get a librarian some day to put it
    in trim; and the drawing-room and boudoir and bedroom suite which I
    have selected for you, are all fine.  But my own room is what suits
    me best, though I do not think you would care for it for yourself.
    If you do, you shall have it.  It was Uncle Roger's own room when he
    stayed here; living in it for a few days served to give me more
    insight to his character--or rather to his mind--than I could have
    otherwise had.  It is just the kind of place I like myself; so,
    naturally, I understand the other chap who liked it too.  It is a
    fine big room, not quite within the Castle, but an outlying part of
    it.  It is not detached, or anything of that sort, but is a sort of
    garden-room built on to it.  There seems to have been always some
    sort of place where it is, for the passages and openings inside seem
    to accept or recognize it.  It can be shut off if necessary--it would
    be in case of attack--by a great slab of steel, just like the door of
    a safe, which slides from inside the wall, and can be operated from
    either inside or outside--if you know how.  That is from my room or
    from within the keep.  The mechanism is a secret, and no one but
    Rooke and I know it.  The room opens out through a great French
    window--the French window is modern, I take it, and was arranged by
    or for Uncle Roger; I think there must have been always a large
    opening there, for centuries at least--which opens on a wide terrace
    or balcony of white marble, extending right and left.  From this a
    white marble stair lies straight in front of the window, and leads
    down to the garden.  The balcony and staircase are quite ancient--of
    old Italian work, beautifully carved, and, of course, weather-worn
    through centuries.  There is just that little tinging of green here
    and there which makes all outdoor marble so charming.  It is hard to
    believe at times that it is a part of a fortified castle, it is so
    elegant and free and open.  The first glance of it would make a
    burglar's heart glad.  He would say to himself: "Here is the sort of
    crib I like when I'm on the job.  You can just walk in and out as you
    choose."  But, Aunt Janet, old Roger was cuter than any burglar.  He
    had the place so guarded that the burglar would have been a baffled
    burglar.  There are two steel shields which can slide out from the
    wall and lock into the other side right across the whole big window.
    One is a grille of steel bands that open out into diamond-shaped
    lozenges.  Nothing bigger than a kitten could get through; and yet
    you can see the garden and the mountains and the whole view--much the
    same as you ladies can see through your veils.  The other is a great
    sheet of steel, which slides out in a similar way in different
    grooves.  It is not, of course, so heavy and strong as the safe-door
    which covers the little opening in the main wall, but Rooke tells me
    it is proof against the heaviest rifle-hall.

    Having told you this, I must tell you, too, Aunt Janet, lest you
    should be made anxious by the _arriere-pensee_ of all these warlike
    measures of defence, that I always sleep at night with one of these
    iron screens across the window.  Of course, when I am awake I leave
    it open.  As yet I have tried only, but not used, the grille; and I
    don't think I shall ever use anything else, for it is a perfect
    guard.  If it should be tampered with from outside it would sound an
    alarm at the head of the bed, and the pressing of a button would roll
    out the solid steel screen in front of it.  As a matter of fact, I
    have been so used to the open that I don't feel comfortable shut in.
    I only close windows against cold or rain.  The weather here is
    delightful--as yet, at all events--but they tell me that the rainy
    season will be on us before very long.

    I think you will like my den, aunty dear, though it will doubtless be
    a worry to you to see it so untidy.  But that can't be helped.  I
    must be untidy _somewhere_; and it is best in my own den!

    Again I find my letter so long that I must cut it off now and go on
    again to-night.  So this must go as it stands.  I shall not cause you
    to wait to hear all I can tell you about our new home.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    My den looks out, as I told you in my last letter, on the garden, or,
    to speak more accurately, on _one_ of the gardens, for there are
    acres of them.  This is the old one, which must be almost as old as
    the Castle itself, for it was within the defences in the old days of
    bows.  The wall that surrounds the inner portion of it has long ago
    been levelled, but sufficient remains at either end where it joined
    the outer defences to show the long casemates for the bowmen to shoot
    through and the raised stone gallery where they stood.  It is just
    the same kind of building as the stone-work of the sentry's walk on
    the roof and of the great old guard-room under it.

    But whatever the garden may have been, and no matter how it was
    guarded, it is a most lovely place.  There are whole sections of
    garden here of various styles--Greek, Italian, French, German, Dutch,
    British, Spanish, African, Moorish--all the older nationalities.  I
    am going to have a new one laid out for you--a Japanese garden.  I
    have sent to the great gardener of Japan, Minaro, to make the plans
    for it, and to come over with workmen to carry it out.  He is to
    bring trees and shrubs and flowers and stone-work, and everything
    that can be required; and you shall superintend the finishing, if not
    the doing, of it yourself.  We have such a fine head of water here,
    and the climate is, they tell me, usually so lovely that we can do
    anything in the gardening way.  If it should ever turn out that the
    climate does not suit, we shall put a great high glass roof over it,
    and _make_ a suitable climate.

    This garden in front of my room is the old Italian garden.  It must
    have been done with extraordinary taste and care, for there is not a
    bit of it which is not rarely beautiful.  Sir Thomas Browne himself,
    for all his _Quincunx_, would have been delighted with it, and have
    found material for another "Garden of Cyrus."  It is so big that
    there are endless "episodes" of garden beauty I think all Italy must
    have been ransacked in old times for garden stone-work of exceptional
    beauty; and these treasures have been put together by some
    master-hand.  Even the formal borders of the walks are of old porous
    stone, which takes the weather-staining so beautifully, and are
    carved in endless variety.  Now that the gardens have been so long
    neglected or left in abeyance, the green staining has become perfect.
    Though the stone-work is itself intact, it has all the picturesque
    effect of the wear and ruin wrought by many centuries.  I am having
    it kept for you just as it is, except that I have had the weeds and
    undergrowth cleared away so that its beauties might be visible.

    But it is not merely the architect work of the garden that is so
    beautiful, nor is the assembling there of the manifold wealth of
    floral beauty--there is the beauty that Nature creates by the hand of
    her servant, Time.  You see, Aunt Janet, how the beautiful garden
    inspires a danger-hardened old tramp like me to high-grade sentiments
    of poetic fancy!  Not only have limestone and sandstone, and even
    marble, grown green in time, but even the shrubs planted and then
    neglected have developed new kinds of beauty of their own.  In some
    far-distant time some master-gardener of the Vissarions has tried to
    realize an idea--that of tiny plants that would grow just a little
    higher than the flowers, so that the effect of an uneven floral
    surface would be achieved without any hiding of anything in the
    garden seen from anywhere.  This is only my reading of what has been
    from the effect of what is!  In the long period of neglect the shrubs
    have outlived the flowers.  Nature has been doing her own work all
    the time in enforcing the survival of the fittest.  The shrubs have
    grown and grown, and have overtopped flower and weed, according to
    their inherent varieties of stature; to the effect that now you see
    irregularly scattered through the garden quite a number--for it is a
    big place--of vegetable products which from a landscape standpoint
    have something of the general effect of statues without the cramping
    feeling of detail.  Whoever it was that laid out that part of the
    garden or made the choice of items, must have taken pains to get
    strange specimens, for all those taller shrubs are in special
    colours, mostly yellow or white--white cypress, white holly, yellow
    yew, grey-golden box, silver juniper, variegated maple, spiraea, and
    numbers of dwarf shrubs whose names I don't know.  I only know that
    when the moon shines--and this, my dear Aunt Janet, is the very land
    of moonlight itself!--they all look ghastly pale.  The effect is
    weird to the last degree, and I am sure that you will enjoy it.  For
    myself, as you know, uncanny things hold no fear.  I suppose it is
    that I have been up against so many different kinds of fears, or,
    rather, of things which for most people have terrors of their own,
    that I have come to have a contempt--not an active contempt, you
    know, but a tolerative contempt--for the whole family of them.  And
    you, too, will enjoy yourself here famously, I know.  You'll have to
    collect all the stories of such matters in our new world and make a
    new book of facts for the Psychical Research Society.  It will be
    nice to see your own name on a title-page, won't it, Aunt Janet?

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    I stopped writing last night--do you know why?  Because I wanted to
    write more!  This sounds a paradox, but it is true.  The fact is
    that, as I go on telling you of this delightful place, I keep finding
    out new beauties myself.  Broadly speaking, it _is all_ beautiful.
    In the long view or the little view--as the telescope or the
    microscope directs--it is all the same.  Your eye can turn on nothing
    that does not entrance you.  I was yesterday roaming about the upper
    part of time Castle, and came across some delightful nooks, which at
    once I became fond of, and already like them as if I had known them
    all my life.  I felt at first a sense of greediness when I had
    appropriated to myself several rooms in different places--I who have
    never in my life had more than one room which I could call my
    own--and that only for a time!  But when I slept on it the feeling
    changed, and its aspect is now not half bad.  It is now under another
    classification--under a much more important label--_proprietorship_.
    If I were writing philosophy, I should here put in a cynical remark:

    "Selfishness is an appanage of poverty.  It might appear in the
    stud-book as by 'Morals' out of 'Wants.'"

    I have now three bedrooms arranged as my own particular dens.  One of
    the other two was also a choice of Uncle Roger's.  It is at the top
    of one of the towers to the extreme east, and from it I can catch the
    first ray of light over the mountains.  I slept in it last night, and
    when I woke, as in my travelling I was accustomed to do, at dawn, I
    saw from my bed through an open window--a small window, for it is in
    a fortress tower--the whole great expanse to the east.  Not far off,
    and springing from the summit of a great ruin, where long ago a seed
    had fallen, rose a great silver-birch, and the half-transparent,
    drooping branches and hanging clusters of leaf broke the outline of
    the grey hills beyond, for the hills were, for a wonder, grey instead
    of blue.  There was a mackerel sky, with the clouds dropping on the
    mountain-tops till you could hardly say which was which.  It was a
    mackerel sky of a very bold and extraordinary kind--not a dish of
    mackerel, but a world of mackerel!  The mountains are certainly most
    lovely.  In this clear air they usually seem close at hand.  It was
    only this morning, with the faint glimpse of the dawn whilst the
    night clouds were still unpierced by the sunlight, that I seemed to
    realize their greatness.  I have seen the same enlightening effect of
    aerial perspective a few times before--in Colorado, in Upper India,
    in Thibet, and in the uplands amongst the Andes.

    There is certainly something in looking at things from above which
    tends to raise one's own self-esteem.  From the height, inequalities
    simply disappear.  This I have often felt on a big scale when
    ballooning, or, better still, from an aeroplane.  Even here from the
    tower the outlook is somehow quite different from below.  One
    realizes the place and all around it, not in detail, but as a whole.
    I shall certainly sleep up here occasionally, when you have come and
    we have settled down to our life as it is to be.  I shall live in my
    own room downstairs, where I can have the intimacy of the garden.
    But I shall appreciate it all the more from now and again losing the
    sense of intimacy for a while, and surveying it without the sense of
    one's own self-importance.

    I hope you have started on that matter of the servants.  For myself,
    I don't care a button whether or not there are any servants at all;
    but I know well that you won't come till you have made your
    arrangements regarding them!  Another thing, Aunt Janet.  You must
    not be killed with work here, and it is all so vast . . . Why can't
    you get some sort of secretary who will write your letters and do all
    that sort of thing for you?  I know you won't have a man secretary;
    but there are lots of women now who can write shorthand and
    typewrite.  You could doubtless get one in the clan--someone with a
    desire to better herself.  I know you would make her happy here.  If
    she is not too young, all the better; she will have learned to hold
    her tongue and mind her own business, and not be too inquisitive.
    That would be a nuisance when we are finding our way about in a new
    country and trying to reconcile all sorts of opposites in a whole new
    country with new people, whom at first we shan't understand, and who
    certainly won't understand us; where every man carries a gun with as
    little thought of it as he has of buttons!  Good-bye for a while.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    I am back in my own room again.  Already it seems to me that to get
    here again is like coming home.  I have been going about for the last
    few days amongst the mountaineers and trying to make their
    acquaintance.  It is a tough job; and I can see that there will be
    nothing but to stick to it.  They are in reality the most primitive
    people I ever met--the most fixed to their own ideas, which belong to
    centuries back.  I can understand now what people were like in
    England--not in Queen Elizabeth's time, for that was civilized time,
    but in the time of Coeur-de-Lion, or even earlier--and all the time
    with the most absolute mastery of weapons of precision.  Every man
    carries a rifle--and knows how to use it, too.  I do believe they
    would rather go without their clothes than their guns if they had to
    choose between them.  They also carry a handjar, which used to be
    their national weapon.  It is a sort of heavy, straight cutlass, and
    they are so expert with it as well as so strong that it is as facile
    in the hands of a Blue Mountaineer as is a foil in the hands of a
    Persian _maitre d'armes_.  They are so proud and reserved that they
    make one feel quite small, and an "outsider" as well.  I can see
    quite well that they rather resent my being here at all.  It is not
    personal, for when alone with me they are genial, almost brotherly;
    but the moment a few of them get together they are like a sort of
    jury, with me as the criminal before them.  It is an odd situation,
    and quite new to me.  I am pretty well accustomed to all sorts of
    people, from cannibals to Mahatmas, but I'm blessed if I ever struck
    such a type as this--so proud, so haughty, so reserved, so distant,
    so absolutely fearless, so honourable, so hospitable.  Uncle Roger's
    head was level when he chose them out as a people to live amongst.
    Do you know, Aunt Janet, I can't help feeling that they are very much
    like your own Highlanders--only more so.  I'm sure of one thing: that
    in the end we shall get on capitally together.  But it will be a slow
    job, and will need a lot of patience.  I have a feeling in my bones
    that when they know me better they will be very loyal and very true;
    and I am not a hair's-breadth afraid of them or anything they shall
    or might do.  That is, of course, if I live long enough for them to
    have time to know me.  Anything may happen with such an indomitable,
    proud people to whom pride is more than victuals.  After all, it only
    needs one man out of a crowd to have a wrong idea or to make a
    mistake as to one's motive--and there you are.  But it will be all
    right that way, I am sure.  I am come here to stay, as Uncle Roger
    wished.  And stay I shall even if it has to be in a little bed of my
    own beyond the garden--seven feet odd long, and not too narrow--or
    else a stone-box of equal proportions in the vaults of St. Sava's
    Church across the Creek--the old burial-place of the Vissarions and
    other noble people for a good many centuries back . . .

    I have been reading over this letter, dear Aunt Janet, and I am
    afraid the record is rather an alarming one.  But don't you go
    building up superstitious horrors or fears on it.  Honestly, I am
    only joking about death--a thing to which I have been rather prone
    for a good many years back.  Not in very good taste, I suppose, but
    certainly very useful when the old man with the black wings goes
    flying about you day and night in strange places, sometimes visible
    and at others invisible.  But you can always hear wings, especially
    in the dark, when you cannot see them.  _You_ know that, Aunt Janet,
    who come of a race of warriors, and who have special sight behind or
    through the black curtain.

    Honestly, I am in no whit afraid of the Blue Mountaineers, nor have I
    a doubt of them.  I love them already for their splendid qualities,
    and I am prepared to love them for themselves.  I feel, too, that
    they will love me (and incidentally they are sure to love you).  I
    have a sort of undercurrent of thought that there is something in
    their minds concerning me--something not painful, but disturbing;
    something that has a base in the past; something that has hope in it
    and possible pride, and not a little respect.  As yet they can have
    had no opportunity of forming such impression from seeing me or from
    any thing I have done.  Of course, it may be that, although they are
    fine, tall, stalwart men, I am still a head and shoulders over the
    tallest of them that I have yet seen.  I catch their eyes looking up
    at me as though they were measuring me, even when they are keeping
    away from me, or, rather, keeping me from them at arm's length.  I
    suppose I shall understand what it all means some day.  In the
    meantime there is nothing to do but to go on my own way--which is
    Uncle Roger's--and wait and be patient and just.  I have learned the
    value of that, any way, in my life amongst strange peoples.
    Good-night.

                                                               Your loving
                                                                   RUPERT.

    MY DEAR AUNT JANET,

    I am more than rejoiced to hear that you are coming here so soon.
    This isolation is, I think, getting on my nerves.  I thought for a
    while last night that I was getting on, but the reaction came all too
    soon.  I was in my room in the east turret, the room on the
    _corbeille_, and saw here and there men passing silently and swiftly
    between the trees as though in secret.  By-and-by I located their
    meeting-place, which was in a hollow in the midst of the wood just
    outside the "natural" garden, as the map or plan of the castle calls
    it.  I stalked that place for all I was worth, and suddenly walked
    straight into the midst of them.  There were perhaps two or three
    hundred gathered, about the very finest lot of men I ever saw in my
    life.  It was in its way quite an experience, and one not likely to
    be repeated, for, as I told you, in this country every man carries a
    rifle, and knows how to use it.  I do not think I have seen a single
    man (or married man either) without his rifle since I came here.  I
    wonder if they take them with them to bed!  Well, the instant after I
    stood amongst them every rifle in the place was aimed straight at me.
    Don't be alarmed, Aunt Janet; they did not fire at me.  If they had I
    should not be writing to you now.  I should be in that little bit of
    real estate or the stone box, and about as full of lead as I could
    hold.  Ordinarily, I take it, they would have fired on the instant;
    that is the etiquette here.  But this time they--all separately but
    all together--made a new rule.  No one said a word or, so far as I
    could see, made a movement.  Here came in my own experience.  I had
    been more than once in a tight place of something of the same kind,
    so I simply behaved in the most natural way I could.  I felt
    conscious--it was all in a flash, remember--that if I showed fear or
    cause for fear, or even acknowledged danger by so much as even
    holding up my hands, I should have drawn all the fire.  They all
    remained stock-still, as though they had been turned into stone, for
    several seconds.  Then a queer kind of look flashed round them like
    wind over corn--something like the surprise one shows unconsciously
    on waking in a strange place.  A second after they each dropped the
    rifle to the hollow of his arm and stood ready for anything.  It was
    all as regular and quick and simultaneous as a salute at St. James's
    Palace.

    Happily I had no arms of any kind with me, so that there could be no
    complication.  I am rather a quick hand myself when there is any
    shooting to be done.  However, there was no trouble here, but the
    contrary; the Blue Mountaineers--it sounds like a new sort of Bond
    Street band, doesn't it?--treated me in quite a different way than
    they did when I first met them.  They were amazingly civil, almost
    deferential.  But, all time same, they were more distant than ever,
    and all the time I was there I could get not a whit closer to them.
    They seemed in a sort of way to be afraid or in awe of me.  No doubt
    that will soon pass away, and when we know one another better we
    shall become close friends.  They are too fine fellows not to be
    worth a little waiting for.  (That sentence, by the way, is a pretty
    bad sentence!  In old days you would have slippered me for it!)  Your
    journey is all arranged, and I hope you will be comfortable.  Rooke
    will meet you at Liverpool Street and look after everything.

    I shan't write again, but when we meet at Fiume I shall begin to tell
    you all the rest.  Till then, good-bye.  A good journey to you, and a
    happy meeting to us both.

                                                                   RUPERT.

    DEAREST UNCLE,

    I had a very comfortable journey all across Europe.  Rupert wrote to
    me some time ago to say that when I got to Vissarion I should be an
    Empress, and he certainly took care that on the way here I should be
    treated like one.  Rooke, who seems a wonderful old man, was in the
    next compartment to that reserved for me.  At Harwich he had
    everything arranged perfectly, and so right on to Fiume.  Everywhere
    there were attentive officials waiting.  I had a carriage all to
    myself, which I joined at Antwerp--a whole carriage with a suite of
    rooms, dining-room, drawing-room, bedroom, even bath-room.  There was
    a cook with a kitchen of his own on board, a real chef like a French
    nobleman in disguise.  There were also a waiter and a servant-maid.
    My own maid Maggie was quite awed at first.  We were as far as
    Cologne before she summoned up courage to order them about.  Whenever
    we stopped Rooke was on the platform with local officials, and kept
    the door of my carriage like a sentry on duty.

    At Fiume, when the train slowed down, I saw Rupert waiting on the
    platform.  He looked magnificent, towering over everybody there like
    a giant.  He is in perfect health, and seemed glad to see me.  He
    took me off at once on an automobile to a quay where an electric
    launch was waiting.  This took us on board a beautiful big
    steam-yacht, which was waiting with full steam up and--how he got
    there I don't know--Rooke waiting at the gangway.

    I had another suite all to myself.  Rupert and I had dinner
    together--I think the finest dinner I ever sat down to.  This was
    very nice of Rupert, for it was all for me.  He himself only ate a
    piece of steak and drank a glass of water.  I went to bed early, for,
    despite the luxury of the journey, I was very tired.

    I awoke in the grey of the morning, and came on deck.  We were close
    to the coast.  Rupert was on the bridge with the Captain, and Rooke
    was acting as pilot.  When Rupert saw me, he ran down the ladder and
    took me up on the bridge.  He left me there while he ran down again
    and brought me up a lovely fur cloak which I had never seen.  He put
    it on me and kissed me.  He is the tenderest-hearted boy in the
    world, as well as the best and bravest!  He made me take his arm
    whilst he pointed out Vissarion, towards which we were steering.  It
    is the most lovely place I ever saw.  I won't stop to describe it
    now, for it will be better that you see it for yourself and enjoy it
    all fresh as I did.

    The Castle is an immense place.  You had better ship off, as soon as
    all is ready here and you can arrange it, the servants whom I
    engaged; and I am not sure that we shall not want as many more.
    There has hardly been a mop or broom on the place for centuries, and
    I doubt if it ever had a thorough good cleaning all over since it was
    built.  And, do you know, Uncle, that it might be well to double that
    little army of yours that you are arranging for Rupert?  Indeed, the
    boy told me himself that he was going to write to you about it.  I
    think old Lachlan and his wife, Sandy's Mary, had better be in charge
    of the maids when they come over.  A lot of lassies like yon will be
    iller to keep together than a flock of sheep.  So it will be wise to
    have authority over them, especially as none of them speaks a word of
    foreign tongues.  Rooke--you saw him at the station at Liverpool
    Street--will, if he be available, go over to bring the whole body
    here.  He has offered to do it if I should wish.  And, by the way, I
    think it will be well, when the time comes for their departure, if
    not only the lassies, but Lachlan and Sandy's Mary, too, will call
    him _Mister_ Rooke.  He is a very important person indeed here.  He
    is, in fact, a sort of Master of the Castle, and though he is very
    self-suppressing, is a man of rarely fine qualities.  Also it will be
    well to keep authority.  When your clansmen come over, he will have
    charge of them, too.  Dear me!  I find I have written such a long
    letter, I must stop and get to work.  I shall write again.

                                                    Your very affectionate
                                                                    JANET.

    DEAREST UNCLE,

    All goes well here, and as there is no news, I only write because you
    are a dear, and I want to thank you for all the trouble you have
    taken for me--and for Rupert.  I think we had better wait awhile
    before bringing out the servants.  Rooke is away on some business for
    Rupert, and will not be back for some time; Rupert thinks it may be a
    couple of months.  There is no one else that he could send to take
    charge of the party from home, and I don't like the idea of all those
    lassies coming out without an escort.  Even Lachlan and Sandy's Mary
    are ignorant of foreign languages and foreign ways.  But as soon as
    Rooke returns we can have them all out.  I dare say you will have
    some of your clansmen ready by then, and I think the poor girls, who
    may feel a bit strange in a new country like this, where the ways are
    so different from ours, will feel easier when they know that there
    are some of their own mankind near them.  Perhaps it might be well
    that those of them who are engaged to each other--I know there are
    some--should marry before they come out here.  It will be more
    convenient in many ways, and will save lodgment, and, besides, these
    Blue Mountaineers are very handsome men.  Good-night.

                                                                    JANET.

    MY DEAR JANET,

    I have duly received both your letters, and am delighted to find you
    are so well pleased with your new home.  It must certainly be a very
    lovely and unique place, and I am myself longing to see it.  I came
    up here three days ago, and am, as usual, feeling all the better for
    a breath of my native air.  Time goes on, my dear, and I am beginning
    to feel not so young as I was.  Tell Rupert that the men are all fit,
    and longing to get out to him.  They are certainly a fine lot of men.
    I don't think I ever saw a finer.  I have had them drilled and
    trained as soldiers, and, in addition, have had them taught a lot of
    trades just as they selected themselves.  So he shall have nigh him
    men who can turn their hands to anything--not, of course, that they
    all know every trade, but amongst them there is someone who can do
    whatever may be required.  There are blacksmiths, carpenters,
    farriers, saddle-makers, gardeners, plumbers, cutlers, gunsmiths, so,
    as they all are farmers by origin and sportsmen by practice, they
    will make a rare household body of men.  They are nearly all
    first-class shots, and I am having them practise with revolvers.
    They are being taught fencing and broadsword and ju-jitsu; I have
    organized them in military form, with their own sergeants and
    corporals.  This morning I had an inspection, and I assure you, my
    dear, they could give points to the Household troop in matters of
    drill.  I tell you I am proud of my clansmen!

    I think you are quite wise about waiting to bring out the lassies,
    and wiser still about the marrying.  I dare say there will be more
    marrying when they all get settled in a foreign country.  I shall be
    glad of it, for as Rupert is going to settle there, it will be good
    for him to have round him a little colony of his own people.  And it
    will be good for them, too, for I know he will be good to them--as
    you will, my dear.  The hills are barren here, and life is hard, and
    each year there is more and more demand for crofts, and sooner or
    later our people must thin out.  And mayhap our little settlement of
    MacKelpie clan away beyond the frontiers of the Empire may be some
    service to the nation and the King.  But this is a dream!  I see that
    here I am beginning to realise in myself one part of Isaiah's
    prophecy:

    "Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
    dreams."

    By the way, my dear, talking about dreams, I am sending you out some
    boxes of books which were in your rooms.  They are nearly all on odd
    subjects that _we_ understand--Second Sight, Ghosts, Dreams (that was
    what brought the matter to my mind just now), superstitions,
    Vampires, Wehr-Wolves, and all such uncanny folk and things.  I
    looked over some of these books, and found your marks and underlining
    and comments, so I fancy you will miss them in your new home.  You
    will, I am sure, feel more at ease with such old friends close to
    you.  I have taken the names and sent the list to London, so that
    when you pay me a visit again you will be at home in all ways.  If
    you come to me altogether, you will be more welcome still--if
    possible.  But I am sure that Rupert, who I know loves you very much,
    will try to make you so happy that you will not want to leave him.
    So I will have to come out often to see you both, even at the cost of
    leaving Croom for so long.  Strange, is it not? that now, when,
    through Roger Melton's more than kind remembrance of me, I am able to
    go where I will and do what I will, I want more and more to remain at
    home by my own ingle.  I don't think that anyone but you or Rupert
    could get me away from it.  I am working very hard at my little
    regiment, as I call it.  They are simply fine, and will, I am sure,
    do us credit.  The uniforms are all made, and well made, too.  There
    is not a man of them that does not look like an officer.  I tell you,
    Janet, that when we turn out the Vissarion Guard we shall feel proud
    of them.  I dare say that a couple of months will do all that can be
    done here.  I shall come out with them myself.  Rupert writes me that
    he thinks it will be more comfortable to come out direct in a ship of
    our own.  So when I go up to London in a few weeks' time I shall see
    about chartering a suitable vessel.  It will certainly save a lot of
    trouble to us and anxiety to our people.  Would it not be well when I
    am getting the ship, if I charter one big enough to take out all your
    lassies, too?  It is not as if they were strangers.  After all, my
    dear, soldiers are soldiers and lassies are lassies.  But these are
    all kinsfolk, as well as clansmen and clanswomen, and I, their Chief,
    shall be there.  Let me know your views and wishes in this respect.
    Mr. Trent, whom I saw before leaving London, asked me to "convey to
    you his most respectful remembrances"--these were his very words, and
    here they are.  Trent is a nice fellow, and I like him.  He has
    promised to pay me a visit here before the month is up, and I look
    forward to our both enjoying ourselves.

    Good-bye, my dear, and the Lord watch over you and our dear boy.

                                                  Your affectionate Uncle,
                                                COLIN ALEXANDER MACKELPIE.




BOOK III: THE COMING OF THE LADY


Rupert Sent Leger's Journal.


                                                          _April_ 3, 1907.

I have waited till now--well into midday--before beginning to set down
the details of the strange episode of last night.  I have spoken with
persons whom I know to be of normal type.  I have breakfasted, as usual
heartily, and have every reason to consider myself in perfect health and
sanity.  So that the record following may be regarded as not only true in
substance, but exact as to details.  I have investigated and reported on
too many cases for the Psychical Research Society to be ignorant of the
necessity for absolute accuracy in such matters of even the minutest
detail.

Yesterday was Tuesday, the second day of April, 1907.  I passed a day of
interest, with its fair amount of work of varying kinds.  Aunt Janet and
I lunched together, had a stroll round the gardens after tea--especially
examining the site for the new Japanese garden, which we shall call
"Janet's Garden."  We went in mackintoshes, for the rainy season is in
its full, the only sign of its not being a repetition of the Deluge being
that breaks in the continuance are beginning.  They are short at present
but will doubtless enlarge themselves as the season comes towards an end.
We dined together at seven.  After dinner I had a cigar, and then joined
Aunt Janet for an hour in her drawing-room.  I left her at half-past ten,
when I went to my own room and wrote some letters.  At ten minutes past
eleven I wound my watch, so I know the time accurately.  Having prepared
for bed, I drew back the heavy curtain in front of my window, which opens
on the marble steps into the Italian garden.  I had put out my light
before drawing back the curtain, for I wanted to have a look at the scene
before turning in.  Aunt Janet has always had an old-fashioned idea of
the need (or propriety, I hardly know which) of keeping windows closed
and curtains drawn.  I am gradually getting her to leave my room alone in
this respect, but at present the change is in its fitful stage, and of
course I must not hurry matters or be too persistent, as it would hurt
her feelings.  This night was one of those under the old regime.  It was
a delight to look out, for the scene was perfect of its own kind.  The
long spell of rain--the ceaseless downpour which had for the time flooded
everywhere--had passed, and water in abnormal places rather trickled than
ran.  We were now beginning to be in the sloppy rather than the deluged
stage.  There was plenty of light to see by, for the moon had begun to
show out fitfully through the masses of flying clouds.  The uncertain
light made weird shadows with the shrubs and statues in the garden.  The
long straight walk which leads from the marble steps is strewn with fine
sand white from the quartz strand in the nook to the south of the Castle.
Tall shrubs of white holly, yew, juniper, cypress, and variegated maple
and spiraea, which stood at intervals along the walk and its branches,
appeared ghost-like in the fitful moonlight.  The many vases and statues
and urns, always like phantoms in a half-light, were more than ever
weird.  Last night the moonlight was unusually effective, and showed not
only the gardens down to the defending wall, but the deep gloom of the
great forest-trees beyond; and beyond that, again, to where the mountain
chain began, the forest running up their silvered slopes flamelike in
form, deviated here and there by great crags and the outcropping rocky
sinews of the vast mountains.

Whilst I was looking at this lovely prospect, I thought I saw something
white flit, like a modified white flash, at odd moments from one to
another of the shrubs or statues--anything which would afford cover from
observation.  At first I was not sure whether I really saw anything or
did not.  This was in itself a little disturbing to me, for I have been
so long trained to minute observation of facts surrounding me, on which
often depend not only my own life, but the lives of others, that I have
become accustomed to trust my eyes; and anything creating the faintest
doubt in this respect is a cause of more or less anxiety to me.  Now,
however, that my attention was called to myself, I looked more keenly,
and in a very short time was satisfied that something was
moving--something clad in white.  It was natural enough that my thoughts
should tend towards something uncanny--the belief that this place is
haunted, conveyed in a thousand ways of speech and inference.  Aunt
Janet's eerie beliefs, fortified by her books on occult subjects--and of
late, in our isolation from the rest of the world, the subject of daily
conversations--helped to this end.  No wonder, then, that, fully awake
and with senses all on edge, I waited for some further manifestation from
this ghostly visitor--as in my mind I took it to be.  It must surely be a
ghost or spiritual manifestation of some kind which moved in this silent
way.  In order to see and hear better, I softly moved back the folding
grille, opened the French window, and stepped out, bare-footed and
pyjama-clad as I was, on the marble terrace.  How cold the wet marble
was!  How heavy smelled the rain-laden garden!  It was as though the
night and the damp, and even the moonlight, were drawing the aroma from
all the flowers that blossomed.  The whole night seemed to exhale heavy,
half-intoxicating odours!  I stood at the head of the marble steps, and
all immediately before me was ghostly in the extreme--the white marble
terrace and steps, the white walks of quartz-sand glistening under the
fitful moonlight; the shrubs of white or pale green or yellow,--all
looking dim and ghostly in the glamorous light; the white statues and
vases.  And amongst them, still flitting noiselessly, that mysterious
elusive figure which I could not say was based on fact or imagination.  I
held my breath, listening intently for every sound; but sound there was
none, save those of the night and its denizens.  Owls hooted in the
forest; bats, taking advantage of the cessation of the rain, flitted
about silently, like shadows in the air.  But there was no more sign of
moving ghost or phantom, or whatever I had seen might have been--if,
indeed, there had been anything except imagination.

So, after waiting awhile, I returned to my room, closed the window, drew
the grille across again, and dragged the heavy curtain before the
opening; then, having extinguished my candles, went to bed in the dark.
In a few minutes I must have been asleep.

"What was that?"  I almost heard the words of my own thought as I sat up
in bed wide awake.  To memory rather than present hearing the disturbing
sound had seemed like the faint tapping at the window.  For some seconds
I listened, mechanically but intently, with bated breath and that quick
beating of the heart which in a timorous person speaks for fear, and for
expectation in another.  In the stillness the sound came again--this time
a very, very faint but unmistakable tapping at the glass door.

I jumped up, drew back the curtain, and for a moment stood appalled.

There, outside on the balcony, in the now brilliant moonlight, stood a
woman, wrapped in white grave-clothes saturated with water, which dripped
on the marble floor, making a pool which trickled slowly down the wet
steps.  Attitude and dress and circumstance all conveyed the idea that,
though she moved and spoke, she was not quick, but dead.  She was young
and very beautiful, but pale, like the grey pallor of death.  Through the
still white of her face, which made her look as cold as the wet marble
she stood on, her dark eyes seemed to gleam with a strange but enticing
lustre.  Even in the unsearching moonlight, which is after all rather
deceptive than illuminative, I could not but notice one rare quality of
her eyes.  Each had some quality of refraction which made it look as
though it contained a star.  At every movement she made, the stars
exhibited new beauties, of more rare and radiant force.  She looked at me
imploringly as the heavy curtain rolled back, and in eloquent gestures
implored me to admit her.  Instinctively I obeyed; I rolled back the
steel grille, and threw open the French window.  I noticed that she
shivered and trembled as the glass door fell open.  Indeed, she seemed so
overcome with cold as to seem almost unable to move.  In the sense of her
helplessness all idea of the strangeness of the situation entirely
disappeared.  It was not as if my first idea of death taken from her
cerements was negatived.  It was simply that I did not think of it at
all; I was content to accept things as they were--she was a woman, and in
some dreadful trouble; that was enough.

I am thus particular about my own emotions, as I may have to refer to
them again in matters of comprehension or comparison.  The whole thing is
so vastly strange and abnormal that the least thing may afterwards give
some guiding light or clue to something otherwise not understandable.  I
have always found that in recondite matters first impressions are of more
real value than later conclusions.  We humans place far too little
reliance on instinct as against reason; and yet instinct is the great
gift of Nature to all animals for their protection and the fulfilment of
their functions generally.

When I stepped out on the balcony, not thinking of my costume, I found
that the woman was benumbed and hardly able to move.  Even when I asked
her to enter, and supplemented my words with gestures in case she should
not understand my language, she stood stock-still, only rocking slightly
to and fro as though she had just strength enough left to balance herself
on her feet.  I was afraid, from the condition in which she was, that she
might drop down dead at any moment.  So I took her by the hand to lead
her in.  But she seemed too weak to even make the attempt.  When I pulled
her slightly forward, thinking to help her, she tottered, and would have
fallen had I not caught her in my arms.  Then, half lifting her, I moved
her forwards.  Her feet, relieved of her weight, now seemed able to make
the necessary effort; and so, I almost carrying her, we moved into the
room.  She was at the very end of her strength; I had to lift her over
the sill.  In obedience to her motion, I closed the French window and
bolted it.  I supposed the warmth of the room--though cool, it was warmer
than the damp air without--affected her quickly, for on the instant she
seemed to begin to recover herself.  In a few seconds, as though she had
reacquired her strength, she herself pulled the heavy curtain across the
window.  This left us in darkness, through which I heard her say in
English:

"Light.  Get a light!"

I found matches, and at once lit a candle.  As the wick flared, she moved
over to the door of the room, and tried if the lock and bolt were
fastened.  Satisfied as to this, she moved towards me, her wet shroud
leaving a trail of moisture on the green carpet.  By this time the wax of
the candle had melted sufficiently to let me see her clearly.  She was
shaking and quivering as though in an ague; she drew the wet shroud
around her piteously.  Instinctively I spoke:

"Can I do anything for you?"

She answered, still in English, and in a voice of thrilling, almost
piercing sweetness, which seemed somehow to go straight to my heart, and
affected me strangely: "Give me warmth."

I hurried to the fireplace.  It was empty; there was no fire laid.  I
turned to her, and said:

"Wait just a few minutes here.  I shall call someone, and get help--and
fire."

Her voice seemed to ring with intensity as she answered without a pause:

"No, no!  Rather would I be"--here she hesitated for an instant, but as
she caught sight of her cerements went on hurriedly--"as I am.  I trust
you--not others; and you must not betray my trust."  Almost instantly she
fell into a frightful fit of shivering, drawing again her death-clothes
close to her, so piteously that it wrung my heart.  I suppose I am a
practical man.  At any rate, I am accustomed to action.  I took from its
place beside my bed a thick Jaeger dressing-gown of dark brown--it was,
of course, of extra length--and held it out to her as I said:

"Put that on.  It is the only warm thing here which would be suitable.
Stay; you must remove that wet--wet"--I stumbled about for a word that
would not be offensive--"that frock--dress--costume--whatever it is."  I
pointed to where, in the corner of the room, stood a chintz-covered
folding-screen which fences in my cold sponge bath, which is laid ready
for me overnight, as I am an early riser.

She bowed gravely, and taking the dressing-gown in a long, white,
finely-shaped hand, bore it behind the screen.  There was a slight
rustle, and then a hollow "flop" as the wet garment fell on the floor;
more rustling and rubbing, and a minute later she emerged wrapped from
head to foot in the long Jaeger garment, which trailed on the floor
behind her, though she was a tall woman.  She was still shivering
painfully, however.  I took a flask of brandy and a glass from a
cupboard, and offered her some; but with a motion of her hand she refused
it, though she moaned grievously.

"Oh, I am so cold--so cold!"  Her teeth were chattering.  I was pained at
her sad condition, and said despairingly, for I was at my wits' end to
know what to do:

"Tell me anything that I can do to help you, and I will do it.  I may not
call help; there is no fire--nothing to make it with; you will not take
some brandy.  What on earth can I do to give you warmth?"

Her answer certainly surprised me when it came, though it was practical
enough--so practical that I should not have dared to say it.  She looked
me straight in the face for a few seconds before speaking.  Then, with an
air of girlish innocence which disarmed suspicion and convinced me at
once of her simple faith, she said in a voice that at once thrilled me
and evoked all my pity:

"Let me rest for a while, and cover me up with rugs.  That may give me
warmth.  I am dying of cold.  And I have a deadly fear upon me--a deadly
fear.  Sit by me, and let me hold your hand.  You are big and strong, and
you look brave.  It will reassure me.  I am not myself a coward, but
to-night fear has got me by the throat.  I can hardly breathe.  Do let me
stay till I am warm.  If you only knew what I have gone through, and have
to go through still, I am sure you would pity me and help me."

To say that I was astonished would be a mild description of my feelings.
I was not shocked.  The life which I have led was not one which makes for
prudery.  To travel in strange places amongst strange peoples with
strange views of their own is to have odd experiences and peculiar
adventures now and again; a man without human passions is not the type
necessary for an adventurous life, such as I myself have had.  But even a
man of passions and experiences can, when he respects a woman, be
shocked--even prudish--where his own opinion of her is concerned.  Such
must bring to her guarding any generosity which he has, and any
self-restraint also.  Even should she place herself in a doubtful
position, her honour calls to his honour.  This is a call which may not
be--_must_ not be--unanswered.  Even passion must pause for at least a
while at sound of such a trumpet-call.

This woman I did respect--much respect.  Her youth and beauty; her
manifest ignorance of evil; her superb disdain of convention, which could
only come through hereditary dignity; her terrible fear and
suffering--for there must be more in her unhappy condition than meets the
eye--would all demand respect, even if one did not hasten to yield it.
Nevertheless, I thought it necessary to enter a protest against her
embarrassing suggestion.  I certainly did feel a fool when making it,
also a cad.  I can truly say it was made only for her good, and out of
the best of me, such as I am.  I felt impossibly awkward; and stuttered
and stumbled before I spoke:

"But surely--the convenances!  Your being here alone at night!  Mrs.
Grundy--convention--the--"

She interrupted me with an incomparable dignity--a dignity which had the
effect of shutting me up like a clasp-knife and making me feel a decided
inferior--and a poor show at that.  There was such a gracious simplicity
and honesty in it, too, such self-respecting knowledge of herself and her
position, that I could be neither angry nor hurt.  I could only feel
ashamed of myself, and of my own littleness of mind and morals.  She
seemed in her icy coldness--now spiritual as well as bodily--like an
incarnate figure of Pride as she answered:

"What are convenances or conventions to me!  If you only knew where I
have come from--the existence (if it can be called so) which I have
had--the loneliness--the horror!  And besides, it is for me to _make_
conventions, not to yield my personal freedom of action to them.  Even as
I am--even here and in this garb--I am above convention.  Convenances do
not trouble me or hamper me.  That, at least, I have won by what I have
gone through, even if it had never come to me through any other way.  Let
me stay."  She said the last words, in spite of all her pride,
appealingly.  But still, there was a note of high pride in all this--in
all she said and did, in her attitude and movement, in the tones of her
voice, in the loftiness of her carriage and the steadfast look of her
open, starlit eyes.  Altogether, there was something so rarely lofty in
herself and all that clad her that, face to face with it and with her, my
feeble attempt at moral precaution seemed puny, ridiculous, and out of
place.  Without a word in the doing, I took from an old chiffonier chest
an armful of blankets, several of which I threw over her as she lay, for
in the meantime, having replaced the coverlet, she had lain down at
length on the bed.  I took a chair, and sat down beside her.  When she
stretched out her hand from beneath the pile of wraps, I took it in mine,
saying:

"Get warm and rest.  Sleep if you can.  You need not fear; I shall guard
you with my life."

She looked at me gratefully, her starry eyes taking a new light more full
of illumination than was afforded by the wax candle, which was shaded
from her by my body . . . She was horribly cold, and her teeth chattered
so violently that I feared lest she should have incurred some dangerous
evil from her wetting and the cold that followed it.  I felt, however, so
awkward that I could find no words to express my fears; moreover, I
hardly dared say anything at all regarding herself after the haughty way
in which she had received my well-meant protest.  Manifestly I was but to
her as a sort of refuge and provider of heat, altogether impersonal, and
not to be regarded in any degree as an individual.  In these humiliating
circumstances what could I do but sit quiet--and wait developments?

Little by little the fierce chattering of her teeth began to abate as the
warmth of her surroundings stole through her.  I also felt, even in this
strangely awakening position, the influence of the quiet; and sleep began
to steal over me.  Several times I tried to fend it off, but, as I could
not make any overt movement without alarming my strange and beautiful
companion, I had to yield myself to drowsiness.  I was still in such an
overwhelming stupor of surprise that I could not even think freely.
There was nothing for me but to control myself and wait.  Before I could
well fix my thoughts I was asleep.

I was recalled to consciousness by hearing, even through the pall of
sleep that bound me, the crowing of a cock in some of the out-offices of
the castle.  At the same instant the figure, lying deathly still but for
the gentle heaving of her bosom, began to struggle wildly.  The sound had
won through the gates of her sleep also.  With a swift, gliding motion
she slipped from the bed to the floor, saying in a fierce whisper as she
pulled herself up to her full height:

"Let me out!  I must go!  I must go!"

By this time I was fully awake, and the whole position of things came to
me in an instant which I shall never--can never--forget: the dim light of
the candle, now nearly burned down to the socket, all the dimmer from the
fact that the first grey gleam of morning was stealing in round the edges
of the heavy curtain; the tall, slim figure in the brown dressing-gown
whose over-length trailed on the floor, the black hair showing glossy in
the light, and increasing by contrast the marble whiteness of the face,
in which the black eyes sent through their stars fiery gleams.  She
appeared quite in a frenzy of haste; her eagerness was simply
irresistible.

I was so stupefied with amazement, as well as with sleep, that I did not
attempt to stop her, but began instinctively to help her by furthering
her wishes.  As she ran behind the screen, and, as far as sound could
inform me,--began frantically to disrobe herself of the warm
dressing-gown and to don again the ice-cold wet shroud, I pulled back the
curtain from the window, and drew the bolt of the glass door.  As I did
so she was already behind me, shivering.  As I threw open the door she
glided out with a swift silent movement, but trembling in an agonized
way.  As she passed me, she murmured in a low voice, which was almost
lost in the chattering of her teeth:

"Oh, thank you--thank you a thousand times!  But I must go.  I _must_!  I
_must_!  I shall come again, and try to show my gratitude.  Do not
condemn me as ungrateful--till then."  And she was gone.

I watched her pass the length of the white path, flitting from shrub to
shrub or statue as she had come.  In the cold grey light of the
undeveloped dawn she seemed even more ghostly than she had done in the
black shadow of the night.

When she disappeared from sight in the shadow of the wood, I stood on the
terrace for a long time watching, in case I should be afforded another
glimpse of her, for there was now no doubt in my mind that she had for me
some strange attraction.  I felt even then that the look in those
glorious starry eyes would be with me always so long as I might live.
There was some fascination which went deeper than my eyes or my flesh or
my heart--down deep into the very depths of my soul.  My mind was all in
a whirl, so that I could hardly think coherently.  It all was like a
dream; the reality seemed far away.  It was not possible to doubt that
the phantom figure which had been so close to me during the dark hours of
the night was actual flesh and blood.  Yet she was so cold, so cold!
Altogether I could not fix my mind to either proposition: that it was a
living woman who had held my hand, or a dead body reanimated for the time
or the occasion in some strange manner.

The difficulty was too great for me to make up my mind upon it, even had
I wanted to.  But, in any case, I did not want to.  This would, no doubt,
come in time.  But till then I wished to dream on, as anyone does in a
dream which can still be blissful though there be pauses of pain, or
ghastliness, or doubt, or terror.

So I closed the window and drew the curtain again, feeling for the first
time the cold in which I had stood on the wet marble floor of the terrace
when my bare feet began to get warm on the soft carpet.  To get rid of
the chill feeling I got into the bed on which _she_ had lain, and as the
warmth restored me tried to think coherently.  For a short while I was
going over the facts of the night--or what seemed as facts to my
remembrance.  But as I continued to think, the possibilities of any
result seemed to get less, and I found myself vainly trying to reconcile
with the logic of life the grim episode of the night.  The effort proved
to be too much for such concentration as was left to me; moreover,
interrupted sleep was clamant, and would not be denied.  What I dreamt
of--if I dreamt at all--I know not.  I only know that I was ready for
waking when the time came.  It came with a violent knocking at my door.
I sprang from bed, fully awake in a second, drew the bolt, and slipped
back to bed.  With a hurried "May I come in?" Aunt Janet entered.  She
seemed relieved when she saw me, and gave without my asking an
explanation of her perturbation:

"Oh, laddie, I hae been so uneasy aboot ye all the nicht.  I hae had
dreams an' veesions an' a' sorts o' uncanny fancies.  I fear that--"  She
was by now drawing back the curtain, and as her eyes took in the marks of
wet all over the floor the current of her thoughts changed:

"Why, laddie, whativer hae ye been doin' wi' yer baith?  Oh, the mess ye
hae made!  'Tis sinful to gie sic trouble an' waste . . . "  And so she
went on.  I was glad to hear the tirade, which was only what a good
housewife, outraged in her sentiments of order, would have made.  I
listened in patience--with pleasure when I thought of what she would have
thought (and said) had she known the real facts.  I was well pleased to
have got off so easily.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 10, 1907.

For some days after what I call "the episode" I was in a strange
condition of mind.  I did not take anyone--not even Aunt Janet--into
confidence.  Even she dear, and open-hearted and liberal-minded as she
is, might not have understood well enough to be just and tolerant; and I
did not care to hear any adverse comment on my strange visitor.  Somehow
I could not bear the thought of anyone finding fault with her or in her,
though, strangely enough, I was eternally defending her to myself; for,
despite my wishes, embarrassing thoughts _would_ come again and again,
and again in all sorts and variants of queries difficult to answer.  I
found myself defending her, sometimes as a woman hard pressed by
spiritual fear and physical suffering, sometimes as not being amenable to
laws that govern the Living.  Indeed, I could not make up my mind whether
I looked on her as a living human being or as one with some strange
existence in another world, and having only a chance foothold in our own.
In such doubt imagination began to work, and thoughts of evil, of danger,
of doubt, even of fear, began to crowd on me with such persistence and in
such varied forms that I found my instinct of reticence growing into a
settled purpose.  The value of this instinctive precaution was promptly
shown by Aunt Janet's state of mind, with consequent revelation of it.
She became full of gloomy prognostications and what I thought were morbid
fears.  For the first time in my life I discovered that Aunt Janet had
nerves!  I had long had a secret belief that she was gifted, to some
degree at any rate, with Second Sight, which quality, or whatever it is,
skilled in the powers if not the lore of superstition, manages to keep at
stretch not only the mind of its immediate pathic, but of others relevant
to it.  Perhaps this natural quality had received a fresh impetus from
the arrival of some cases of her books sent on by Sir Colin.  She
appeared to read and reread these works, which were chiefly on occult
subjects, day and night, except when she was imparting to me choice
excerpts of the most baleful and fearsome kind.  Indeed, before a week
was over I found myself to be an expert in the history of the cult, as
well as in its manifestations, which latter I had been versed in for a
good many years.

The result of all this was that it set me brooding.  Such, at least, I
gathered was the fact when Aunt Janet took me to task for it.  She always
speaks out according to her convictions, so that her thinking I brooded
was to me a proof that I did; and after a personal examination I
came--reluctantly--to the conclusion that she was right, so far, at any
rate, as my outer conduct was concerned.  The state of mind I was in,
however, kept me from making any acknowledgment of it--the real cause of
my keeping so much to myself and of being so _distrait_.  And so I went
on, torturing myself as before with introspective questioning; and she,
with her mind set on my actions, and endeavouring to find a cause for
them, continued and expounded her beliefs and fears.

Her nightly chats with me when we were alone after dinner--for I had come
to avoid her questioning at other times--kept my imagination at high
pressure.  Despite myself, I could not but find new cause for concern in
the perennial founts of her superstition.  I had thought, years ago, that
I had then sounded the depths of this branch of psychicism; but this new
phase of thought, founded on the really deep hold which the existence of
my beautiful visitor and her sad and dreadful circumstances had taken
upon me, brought me a new concern in the matter of self-importance.  I
came to think that I must reconstruct my self-values, and begin a fresh
understanding of ethical beliefs.  Do what I would, my mind would keep
turning on the uncanny subjects brought before it.  I began to apply them
one by one to my own late experience, and unconsciously to try to fit
them in turn to the present case.

The effect of this brooding was that I was, despite my own will, struck
by the similarity of circumstances bearing on my visitor, and the
conditions apportioned by tradition and superstition to such strange
survivals from earlier ages as these partial existences which are rather
Undead than Living--still walking the earth, though claimed by the world
of the Dead.  Amongst them are the Vampire, or the Wehr-Wolf.  To this
class also might belong in a measure the Doppelganger--one of whose dual
existences commonly belongs to the actual world around it.  So, too, the
denizens of the world of Astralism.  In any of these named worlds there
is a material presence--which must be created, if only for a single or
periodic purpose.  It matters not whether a material presence already
created can be receptive of a disembodied soul, or a soul unattached can
have a body built up for it or around it; or, again, whether the body of
a dead person can be made seeming quick through some diabolic influence
manifested in the present, or an inheritance or result of some baleful
use of malefic power in the past.  The result is the same in each case,
though the ways be widely different: a soul and a body which are not in
unity but brought together for strange purposes through stranger means
and by powers still more strange.

Through much thought and a process of exclusions the eerie form which
seemed to be most in correspondence with my adventure, and most suitable
to my fascinating visitor, appeared to be the Vampire.  Doppelganger,
Astral creations, and all such-like, did not comply with the conditions
of my night experience.  The Wehr-Wolf is but a variant of the Vampire,
and so needed not to be classed or examined at all.  Then it was that,
thus focussed, the Lady of the Shroud (for so I came to hold her in my
mind) began to assume a new force.  Aunt Janet's library afforded me
clues which I followed with avidity.  In my secret heart I hated the
quest, and did not wish to go on with it.  But in this I was not my own
master.  Do what I would--brush away doubts never so often, new doubts
and imaginings came in their stead.  The circumstance almost repeated the
parable of the Seven Devils who took the place of the exorcised one.
Doubts I could stand.  Imaginings I could stand.  But doubts and
imaginings together made a force so fell that I was driven to accept any
reading of the mystery which might presumably afford a foothold for
satisfying thought.  And so I came to accept tentatively the Vampire
theory--accept it, at least, so far as to examine it as judicially as was
given me to do.  As the days wore on, so the conviction grew.  The more I
read on the subject, the more directly the evidences pointed towards this
view.  The more I thought, the more obstinate became the conviction.  I
ransacked Aunt Janet's volumes again and again to find anything to the
contrary; but in vain.  Again, no matter how obstinate were my
convictions at any given time, unsettlement came with fresh thinking over
the argument, so that I was kept in a harassing state of uncertainty.

Briefly, the evidence in favour of accord between the facts of the case
and the Vampire theory were:

Her coming was at night--the time the Vampire is according to the theory,
free to move at will.

She wore her shroud--a necessity of coming fresh from grave or tomb; for
there is nothing occult about clothing which is not subject to astral or
other influences.

She had to be helped into my room--in strict accordance with what one
sceptical critic of occultism has called "the Vampire etiquette."

She made violent haste in getting away at cock-crow.

She seemed preternaturally cold; her sleep was almost abnormal in
intensity, and yet the sound of the cock-crowing came through it.

These things showed her to be subject to _some_ laws, though not in exact
accord within those which govern human beings.  Under the stress of such
circumstances as she must have gone through, her vitality seemed more
than human--the quality of vitality which could outlive ordinary burial.
Again, such purpose as she had shown in donning, under stress of some
compelling direction, her ice-cold wet shroud, and, wrapt in it, going
out again into the night, was hardly normal for a woman.

But if so, and if she was indeed a Vampire, might not whatever it may be
that holds such beings in thrall be by some means or other exorcised?  To
find the means must be my next task.  I am actually pining to see her
again.  Never before have I been stirred to my depths by anyone.  Come it
from Heaven or Hell, from the Earth or the Grave, it does not matter; I
shall make it my task to win her back to life and peace.  If she be
indeed a Vampire, the task may be hard and long; if she be not so, and if
it be merely that circumstances have so gathered round her as to produce
that impression, the task may be simpler and the result more sweet.  No,
not more sweet; for what can be more sweet than to restore the lost or
seemingly lost soul of the woman you love!  There, the truth is out at
last!  I suppose that I have fallen in love with her.  If so, it is too
late for me to fight against it.  I can only wait with what patience I
can till I see her again.  But to that end I can do nothing.  I know
absolutely nothing about her--not even her name.  Patience!

                                                         _April_ 16, 1907.

The only relief I have had from the haunting anxiety regarding the Lady
of the Shroud has been in the troubled state of my adopted country.
There has evidently been something up which I have not been allowed to
know.  The mountaineers are troubled and restless; are wandering about,
singly and in parties, and holding meetings in strange places.  This is
what I gather used to be in old days when intrigues were on foot with
Turks, Greeks, Austrians, Italians, Russians.  This concerns me vitally,
for my mind has long been made up to share the fortunes of the Land of
the Blue Mountains.  For good or ill I mean to stay here: _J'y suis_,
_j'y reste_.  I share henceforth the lot of the Blue Mountaineers; and
not Turkey, nor Greece, nor Austria, nor Italy, nor Russia--no, not
France nor Germany either; not man nor God nor Devil shall drive me from
my purpose.  With these patriots I throw in my lot!  My only difficulty
seemed at first to be with the men themselves.  They are so proud that at
the beginning I feared they would not even accord me the honour of being
one of them!  However, things always move on somehow, no matter what
difficulties there be at the beginning.  Never mind!  When one looks back
at an accomplished fact the beginning is not to be seen--and if it were
it would not matter.  It is not of any account, anyhow.

I heard that there was going to be a great meeting near here yesterday
afternoon, and I attended it.  I think it was a success.  If such is any
proof, I felt elated as well as satisfied when I came away.  Aunt Janet's
Second Sight on the subject was comforting, though grim, and in a measure
disconcerting.  When I was saying good-night she asked me to bend down my
head.  As I did so, she laid her hands on it and passed them all over it.
I heard her say to herself:

"Strange!  There's nothing there; yet I could have sworn I saw it!"  I
asked her to explain, but she would not.  For once she was a little
obstinate, and refused point blank to even talk of the subject.  She was
not worried nor unhappy; so I had no cause for concern.  I said nothing,
but I shall wait and see.  Most mysteries become plain or disappear
altogether in time.  But about the meeting--lest I forget!

When I joined the mountaineers who had assembled, I really think they
were glad to see me; though some of them seemed adverse, and others did
not seem over well satisfied.  However, absolute unity is very seldom to
be found.  Indeed, it is almost impossible; and in a free community is
not altogether to be desired.  When it is apparent, the gathering lacks
that sense of individual feeling which makes for the real consensus of
opinion--which is the real unity of purpose.  The meeting was at first,
therefore, a little cold and distant.  But presently it began to thaw,
and after some fiery harangues I was asked to speak.  Happily, I had
begun to learn the Balkan language as soon as ever Uncle Roger's wishes
had been made known to me, and as I have some facility of tongues and a
great deal of experience, I soon began to know something of it.  Indeed,
when I had been here a few weeks, with opportunity of speaking daily with
the people themselves, and learned to understand the intonations and
vocal inflexions, I felt quite easy in speaking it.  I understood every
word which had up to then been spoken at the meeting, and when I spoke
myself I felt that they understood.  That is an experience which every
speaker has in a certain way and up to a certain point.  He knows by some
kind of instinct if his hearers are with him; if they respond, they must
certainly have understood.  Last night this was marked.  I felt it every
instant I was talking and when I came to realize that the men were in
strict accord with my general views, I took them into confidence with
regard to my own personal purpose.  It was the beginning of a mutual
trust; so for peroration I told them that I had come to the conclusion
that what they wanted most for their own protection and the security and
consolidation of their nation was arms--arms of the very latest pattern.
Here they interrupted me with wild cheers, which so strung me up that I
went farther than I intended, and made a daring venture.  "Ay," I
repeated, "the security and consolidation of your country--of _our_
country, for I have come to live amongst you.  Here is my home whilst I
live.  I am with you heart and soul.  I shall live with you, fight
shoulder to shoulder with you, and, if need be, shall die with you!"
Here the shouting was terrific, and the younger men raised their guns to
fire a salute in Blue Mountain fashion.  But on the instant the Vladika
{1} held up his hands and motioned them to desist.  In the immediate
silence he spoke, sharply at first, but later ascending to a high pitch
of single-minded, lofty eloquence.  His words rang in my ears long after
the meeting was over and other thoughts had come between them and the
present.

"Silence!" he thundered.  "Make no echoes in the forest or through the
hills at this dire time of stress and threatened danger to our land.
Bethink ye of this meeting, held here and in secret, in order that no
whisper of it may be heard afar.  Have ye all, brave men of the Blue
Mountains, come hither through the forest like shadows that some of you,
thoughtless, may enlighten your enemies as to our secret purpose?  The
thunder of your guns would doubtless sound well in the ears of those who
wish us ill and try to work us wrong.  Fellow-countrymen, know ye not
that the Turk is awake once more for our harming?  The Bureau of Spies
has risen from the torpor which came on it when the purpose against our
Teuta roused our mountains to such anger that the frontiers blazed with
passion, and were swept with fire and sword.  Moreover, there is a
traitor somewhere in the land, or else incautious carelessness has served
the same base purpose.  Something of our needs--our doing, whose secret
we have tried to hide, has gone out.  The myrmidons of the Turk are close
on our borders, and it may be that some of them have passed our guards
and are amidst us unknown.  So it behoves us doubly to be discreet.
Believe me that I share with you, my brothers, our love for the gallant
Englishman who has come amongst us to share our sorrows and
ambitions--and I trust it may be our joys.  We are all united in the wish
to do him honour--though not in the way by which danger might be carried
on the wings of love.  My brothers, our newest brother comes to us from
the Great Nation which amongst the nations has been our only friend, and
which has ere now helped us in our direst need--that mighty Britain whose
hand has ever been raised in the cause of freedom.  We of the Blue
Mountains know her best as she stands with sword in hand face to face
with our foes.  And this, her son and now our brother, brings further to
our need the hand of a giant and the heart of a lion.  Later on, when
danger does not ring us round, when silence is no longer our outer guard;
we shall bid him welcome in true fashion of our land.  But till then he
will believe--for he is great-hearted--that our love and thanks and
welcome are not to be measured by sound.  When the time comes, then shall
be sound in his honour--not of rifles alone, but bells and cannon and the
mighty voice of a free people shouting as one.  But now we must be wise
and silent, for the Turk is once again at our gates.  Alas! the cause of
his former coming may not be, for she whose beauty and nobility and whose
place in our nation and in our hearts tempted him to fraud and violence
is not with us to share even our anxiety."

Here his voice broke, and there arose from all a deep wailing sound,
which rose and rose till the woods around us seemed broken by a mighty
and long-sustained sob.  The orator saw that his purpose was
accomplished, and with a short sentence finished his harangue: "But the
need of our nation still remains!"  Then, with an eloquent gesture to me
to proceed, he merged in the crowd and disappeared.

How could I even attempt to follow such a speaker with any hope of
success?  I simply told them what I had already done in the way of help,
saying:

"As you needed arms, I have got them.  My agent sends me word through the
code between us that he has procured for me--for us--fifty thousand of
the newest-pattern rifles, the French Ingis-Malbron, which has surpassed
all others, and sufficient ammunition to last for a year of war.  The
first section is in hand, and will soon be ready for consignment.  There
are other war materials, too, which, when they arrive, will enable every
man and woman--even the children--of our land to take a part in its
defence should such be needed.  My brothers, I am with you in all things,
for good or ill!"

It made me very proud to hear the mighty shout which arose.  I had felt
exalted before, but now this personal development almost unmanned me.  I
was glad of the long-sustained applause to recover my self-control.

I was quite satisfied that the meeting did not want to hear any other
speaker, for they began to melt away without any formal notification
having been given.  I doubt if there will be another meeting soon again.
The weather has begun to break, and we are in for another spell of rain.
It is disagreeable, of course; but it has its own charm.  It was during a
spell of wet weather that the Lady of the Shroud came to me.  Perhaps the
rain may bring her again.  I hope so, with all my soul.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 23, 1907.

The rain has continued for four whole days and nights, and the low-lying
ground is like a quagmire in places.  In the sunlight the whole mountains
glisten with running streams and falling water.  I feel a strange kind of
elation, but from no visible cause.  Aunt Janet rather queered it by
telling me, as she said good-night, to be very careful of myself, as she
had seen in a dream last night a figure in a shroud.  I fear she was not
pleased that I did not take it with all the seriousness that she did.  I
would not wound her for the world if I could help it, but the idea of a
shroud gets too near the bone to be safe, and I had to fend her off at
all hazards.  So when I doubted if the Fates regarded the visionary
shroud as of necessity appertaining to me, she said, in a way that was,
for her, almost sharp:

"Take care, laddie.  'Tis ill jesting wi' the powers o' time Unknown."

Perhaps it was that her talk put the subject in my mind.  The woman
needed no such aid; she was always there; but when I locked myself into
my room that night, I half expected to find her in the room.  I was not
sleepy, so I took a book of Aunt Janet's and began to read.  The title
was "On the Powers and Qualities of Disembodied Spirits."  "Your
grammar," said I to the author, "is hardly attractive, but I may learn
something which might apply to her.  I shall read your book."  Before
settling down to it, however, I thought I would have a look at the
garden.  Since the night of the visit the garden seemed to have a new
attractiveness for me: a night seldom passed without my having a last
look at it before turning in.  So I drew the great curtain and looked
out.

The scene was beautiful, but almost entirely desolate.  All was ghastly
in the raw, hard gleams of moonlight coming fitfully through the masses
of flying cloud.  The wind was rising, and the air was damp and cold.  I
looked round the room instinctively, and noticed that the fire was laid
ready for lighting, and that there were small-cut logs of wood piled
beside the hearth.  Ever since that night I have had a fire laid ready.
I was tempted to light it, but as I never have a fire unless I sleep in
the open, I hesitated to begin.  I went back to the window, and, opening
the catch, stepped out on the terrace.  As I looked down the white walk
and let my eyes range over the expanse of the garden, where everything
glistened as the moonlight caught the wet, I half expected to see some
white figure flitting amongst the shrubs and statues.  The whole scene of
the former visit came back to me so vividly that I could hardly believe
that any time had passed since then.  It was the same scene, and again
late in the evening.  Life in Vissarion was primitive, and early hours
prevailed--though not so late as on that night.

As I looked I thought I caught a glimpse of something white far away.  It
was only a ray of moonlight coming through the rugged edge of a cloud.
But all the same it set me in a strange state of perturbation.  Somehow I
seemed to lose sight of my own identity.  It was as though I was
hypnotized by the situation or by memory, or perhaps by some occult
force.  Without thinking of what I was doing, or being conscious of any
reason for it, I crossed the room and set light to the fire.  Then I blew
out the candle and came to the window again.  I never thought it might be
a foolish thing to do--to stand at a window with a light behind me in
this country, where every man carries a gun with him always.  I was in my
evening clothes, too, with my breast well marked by a white shirt.  I
opened the window and stepped out on the terrace.  There I stood for many
minutes, thinking.  All the time my eyes kept ranging over the garden.
Once I thought I saw a white figure moving, but it was not followed up,
so, becoming conscious that it was again beginning to rain, I stepped
back into the room, shut the window, and drew the curtain.  Then I
realized the comforting appearance of the fire, and went over and stood
before it.

Hark!  Once more there was a gentle tapping at the window.  I rushed over
to it and drew the curtain.

There, out on the rain-beaten terrace, stood the white shrouded figure,
more desolate-appearing than ever.  Ghastly pale she looked, as before,
but her eyes had an eager look which was new.  I took it that she was
attracted by the fire, which was by now well ablaze, and was throwing up
jets of flame as the dry logs crackled.  The leaping flames threw fitful
light across the room, and every gleam threw the white-clad figure into
prominence, showing the gleam of the black eyes, and fixing the stars
that lay in them.

Without a word I threw open the window, and, taking the white hand
extended to me, drew into the room the Lady of the Shroud.

As she entered and felt the warmth of the blazing fire, a glad look
spread over her face.  She made a movement as if to run to it.  But she
drew back an instant after, looking round with instinctive caution.  She
closed the window and bolted it, touched the lever which spread the
grille across the opening, and pulled close the curtain behind it.  Then
she went swiftly to the door and tried if it was locked.  Satisfied as to
this, she came quickly over to the fire, and, kneeling before it,
stretched out her numbed hands to the blaze.  Almost on the instant her
wet shroud began to steam.  I stood wondering.  The precautions of
secrecy in the midst of her suffering--for that she did suffer was only
too painfully manifest--must have presupposed some danger.  Then and
there my mind was made up that there should no harm assail her that I by
any means could fend off.  Still, the present must be attended to;
pneumonia and other ills stalked behind such a chill as must infallibly
come on her unless precautions were taken.  I took again the
dressing-gown which she had worn before and handed it to her, motioning
as I did so towards the screen which had made a dressing-room for her on
the former occasion.  To my surprise she hesitated.  I waited.  She
waited, too, and then laid down the dressing-gown on the edge of the
stone fender.  So I spoke:

"Won't you change as you did before?  Your--your frock can then be dried.
Do!  It will be so much safer for you to be dry clad when you resume your
own dress."

"How can I whilst you are here?"

Her words made me stare, so different were they from her acts of the
other visit.  I simply bowed--speech on such a subject would be at least
inadequate--and walked over to the window.  Passing behind the curtain, I
opened the window.  Before stepping out on to the terrace, I looked into
the room and said:

"Take your own time.  There is no hurry.  I dare say you will find there
all you may want.  I shall remain on the terrace until you summon me."
With that I went out on the terrace, drawing close the glass door behind
me.

I stood looking out on the dreary scene for what seemed a very short
time, my mind in a whirl.  There came a rustle from within, and I saw a
dark brown figure steal round the edge of the curtain.  A white hand was
raised, and beckoned me to come in.  I entered, bolting the window behind
me.  She had passed across the room, and was again kneeling before the
fire with her hands outstretched.  The shroud was laid in partially
opened folds on one side of the hearth, and was steaming heavily.  I
brought over some cushions and pillows, and made a little pile of them
beside her.

"Sit there," I said, "and rest quietly in the heat."  It may have been
the effect of the glowing heat, but there was a rich colour in her face
as she looked at me with shining eyes.  Without a word, but with a
courteous little bow, she sat down at once.  I put a thick rug across her
shoulders, and sat down myself on a stool a couple of feet away.

For fully five or six minutes we sat in silence.  At last, turning her
head towards me she said in a sweet, low voice:

"I had intended coming earlier on purpose to thank you for your very
sweet and gracious courtesy to me, but circumstances were such that I
could not leave my--my"--she hesitated before saying--"my abode.  I am
not free, as you and others are, to do what I will.  My existence is
sadly cold and stern, and full of horrors that appal.  But I _do_ thank
you.  For myself I am not sorry for the delay, for every hour shows me
more clearly how good and understanding and sympathetic you have been to
me.  I only hope that some day you may realize how kind you have been,
and how much I appreciate it."

"I am only too glad to be of any service," I said, feebly I felt, as I
held out my hand.  She did not seem to see it.  Her eyes were now on the
fire, and a warm blush dyed forehead and cheek and neck.  The reproof was
so gentle that no one could have been offended.  It was evident that she
was something coy and reticent, and would not allow me to come at present
more close to her, even to the touching of her hand.  But that her heart
was not in the denial was also evident in the glance from her glorious
dark starry eyes.  These glances--veritable lightning flashes coming
through her pronounced reserve--finished entirely any wavering there
might be in my own purpose.  I was aware now to the full that my heart
was quite subjugated.  I knew that I was in love--veritably so much in
love as to feel that without this woman, be she what she might, by my
side my future must be absolutely barren.

It was presently apparent that she did not mean to stay as long on this
occasion as on the last.  When the castle clock struck midnight she
suddenly sprang to her feet with a bound, saying:

"I must go!  There is midnight!"  I rose at once, the intensity of her
speech having instantly obliterated the sleep which, under the influence
of rest and warmth, was creeping upon me.  Once more she was in a frenzy
of haste, so I hurried towards the window, but as I looked back saw her,
despite her haste, still standing.  I motioned towards the screen, and
slipping behind the curtain, opened the window and went out on the
terrace.  As I was disappearing behind the curtain I saw her with the
tail of my eye lifting the shroud, now dry, from the hearth.

She was out through the window in an incredibly short time, now clothed
once more in that dreadful wrapping.  As she sped past me barefooted on
the wet, chilly marble which made her shudder, she whispered:

"Thank you again.  You _are_ good to me.  You can understand."

Once again I stood on the terrace, saw her melt like a shadow down the
steps, and disappear behind the nearest shrub.  Thence she flitted away
from point to point with exceeding haste.  The moonlight had now
disappeared behind heavy banks of cloud, so there was little light to see
by.  I could just distinguish a pale gleam here and there as she wended
her secret way.

For a long time I stood there alone thinking, as I watched the course she
had taken, and wondering where might be her ultimate destination.  As she
had spoken of her "abode," I knew there was some definitive objective of
her flight.

It was no use wondering.  I was so entirely ignorant of her surroundings
that I had not even a starting-place for speculation.  So I went in,
leaving the window open.  It seemed that this being so made one barrier
the less between us.  I gathered the cushions and rugs from before the
fire, which was no longer leaping, but burning with a steady glow, and
put them back in their places.  Aunt Janet might come in the morning, as
she had done before, and I did not wish to set her thinking.  She is much
too clever a person to have treading on the heels of a
mystery--especially one in which my own affections are engaged.  I wonder
what she would have said had she seen me kiss the cushion on which my
beautiful guest's head had rested?

When I was in bed, and in the dark save for the fading glow of the fire,
my thoughts became fixed that whether she came from Earth or Heaven or
Hell, my lovely visitor was already more to me than aught else in the
world.  This time she had, on going, said no word of returning.  I had
been so much taken up with her presence, and so upset by her abrupt
departure, that I had omitted to ask her.  And so I am driven, as before,
to accept the chance of her returning--a chance which I fear I am or may
be unable to control.

Surely enough Aunt Janet did come in the morning, early.  I was still
asleep when she knocked at my door.  With that purely physical
subconsciousness which comes with habit I must have realized the cause of
the sound, for I woke fully conscious of the fact that Aunt Janet had
knocked and was waiting to come in.  I jumped from bed, and back again
when I had unlocked the door.  When Aunt Janet came in she noticed the
cold of the room.

"Save us, laddie, but ye'll get your death o' cold in this room."  Then,
as she looked round and noticed the ashes of the extinct fire in the
grate:

"Eh, but ye're no that daft after a'; ye've had the sense to light yer
fire.  Glad I am that we had the fire laid and a wheen o' dry logs ready
to yer hand."  She evidently felt the cold air coming from the window,
for she went over and drew the curtain.  When she saw the open window,
she raised her hands in a sort of dismay, which to me, knowing how little
base for concern could be within her knowledge, was comic.  Hurriedly she
shut the window, and then, coming close over to my bed, said:

"Yon has been a fearsome nicht again, laddie, for yer poor auld aunty."

"Dreaming again, Aunt Janet?" I asked--rather flippantly as it seemed to
me.  She shook her head:

"Not so, Rupert, unless it be that the Lord gies us in dreams what we in
our spiritual darkness think are veesions."  I roused up at this.  When
Aunt Janet calls me Rupert, as she always used to do in my dear mother's
time, things are serious with her.  As I was back in childhood now,
recalled by her word, I thought the best thing I could do to cheer her
would be to bring her back there too--if I could.  So I patted the edge
of the bed as I used to do when I was a wee kiddie and wanted her to
comfort me, and said:

"Sit down, Aunt Janet, and tell me."  She yielded at once, and the look
of the happy old days grew over her face as though there had come a gleam
of sunshine.  She sat down, and I put out my hands as I used to do, and
took her hand between them.  There was a tear in her eye as she raised my
hand and kissed it as in old times.  But for the infinite pathos of it,
it would have been comic:

Aunt Janet, old and grey-haired, but still retaining her girlish slimness
of figure, petite, dainty as a Dresden figure, her face lined with the
care of years, but softened and ennobled by the unselfishness of those
years, holding up my big hand, which would outweigh her whole arm;
sitting dainty as a pretty old fairy beside a recumbent giant--for my
bulk never seems so great as when I am near this real little good fairy
of my life--seven feet beside four feet seven.

So she began as of old, as though she were about to soothe a frightened
child with a fairy tale:

"'Twas a veesion, I think, though a dream it may hae been.  But whichever
or whatever it was, it concerned my little boy, who has grown to be a big
giant, so much that I woke all of a tremble.  Laddie dear, I thought that
I saw ye being married."  This gave me an opening, though a small one,
for comforting her, so I took it at once:

"Why, dear, there isn't anything to alarm you in that, is there?  It was
only the other day when you spoke to me about the need of my getting
married, if it was only that you might have children of your boy playing
around your knees as their father used to do when he was a helpless wee
child himself."

"That is so, laddie," she answered gravely.  "But your weddin' was none
so merry as I fain would see.  True, you seemed to lo'e her wi' all yer
hairt.  Yer eyes shone that bright that ye might ha' set her afire, for
all her black locks and her winsome face.  But, laddie, that was not
all--no, not though her black een, that had the licht o' all the stars o'
nicht in them, shone in yours as though a hairt o' love an' passion, too,
dwelt in them.  I saw ye join hands, an' heard a strange voice that
talked stranger still, but I saw none ither.  Your eyes an' her eyes, an'
your hand an' hers, were all I saw.  For all else was dim, and the
darkness was close around ye twa.  And when the benison was spoken--I
knew that by the voices that sang, and by the gladness of her een, as
well as by the pride and glory of yours--the licht began to glow a wee
more, an' I could see yer bride.  She was in a veil o' wondrous fine
lace.  And there were orange-flowers in her hair, though there were
twigs, too, and there was a crown o' flowers on head wi' a golden band
round it.  And the heathen candles that stood on the table wi' the Book
had some strange effect, for the reflex o' it hung in the air o'er her
head like the shadow of a crown.  There was a gold ring on her finger and
a silver one on yours."  Here she paused and trembled, so that, hoping to
dispel her fears, I said, as like as I could to the way I used to when I
was a child:

"Go on, Aunt Janet."

She did not seem to recognize consciously the likeness between past and
present; but the effect was there, for she went on more like her old
self, though there was a prophetic gravity in her voice, more marked than
I had ever heard from her:

"All this I've told ye was well; but, oh, laddie, there was a dreadful
lack o' livin' joy such as I should expect from the woman whom my boy had
chosen for his wife--and at the marriage coupling, too!  And no wonder,
when all is said; for though the marriage veil o' love was fine, an' the
garland o' flowers was fresh-gathered, underneath them a' was nane ither
than a ghastly shroud.  As I looked in my veesion--or maybe dream--I
expectit to see the worms crawl round the flagstane at her feet.  If
'twas not Death, laddie dear, that stood by ye, it was the shadow o'
Death that made the darkness round ye, that neither the light o' candles
nor the smoke o' heathen incense could pierce.  Oh, laddie, laddie, wae
is me that I hae seen sic a veesion--waking or sleeping, it matters not!
I was sair distressed--so sair that I woke wi' a shriek on my lips and
bathed in cold sweat.  I would hae come doon to ye to see if you were
hearty or no--or even to listen at your door for any sound o' yer being
quick, but that I feared to alarm ye till morn should come.  I've counted
the hours and the minutes since midnight, when I saw the veesion, till I
came hither just the now."

"Quite right, Aunt Janet," I said, "and I thank you for your kind thought
for me in the matter, now and always."  Then I went on, for I wanted to
take precautions against the possibility of her discovery of my secret.
I could not bear to think that she might run my precious secret to earth
in any well-meant piece of bungling.  That would be to me disaster
unbearable.  She might frighten away altogether my beautiful visitor,
even whose name or origin I did not know, and I might never see her
again:

"You must never do that, Aunt Janet.  You and I are too good friends to
have sense of distrust or annoyance come between us--which would surely
happen if I had to keep thinking that you or anyone else might be
watching me."

                                                         _April_ 27, 1907.

After a spell of loneliness which has seemed endless I have something to
write.  When the void in my heart was becoming the receptacle for many
devils of suspicion and distrust I set myself a task which might, I
thought, keep my thoughts in part, at any rate, occupied--to explore
minutely the neighbourhood round the Castle.  This might, I hoped, serve
as an anodyne to my pain of loneliness, which grew more acute as the
days, the hours, wore on, even if it should not ultimately afford me some
clue to the whereabouts of the woman whom I had now grown to love so
madly.

My exploration soon took a systematic form, as I intended that it should
be exhaustive.  I would take every day a separate line of advance from
the Castle, beginning at the south and working round by the east to the
north.  The first day only took me to the edge of the creek, which I
crossed in a boat, and landed at the base of the cliff opposite.  I found
the cliffs alone worth a visit.  Here and there were openings to caves
which I made up my mind to explore later.  I managed to climb up the
cliff at a spot less beetling than the rest, and continued my journey.
It was, though very beautiful, not a specially interesting place.  I
explored that spoke of the wheel of which Vissarion was the hub, and got
back just in time for dinner.

The next day I took a course slightly more to the eastward.  I had no
difficulty in keeping a straight path, for, once I had rowed across the
creek, the old church of St. Sava rose before me in stately gloom.  This
was the spot where many generations of the noblest of the Land of the
Blue Mountains had from time immemorial been laid to rest, amongst them
the Vissarions.  Again, I found the opposite cliffs pierced here and
there with caves, some with wide openings,--others the openings of which
were partly above and partly below water.  I could, however, find no
means of climbing the cliff at this part, and had to make a long detour,
following up the line of the creek till further on I found a piece of
beach from which ascent was possible.  Here I ascended, and found that I
was on a line between the Castle and the southern side of the mountains.
I saw the church of St. Sava away to my right, and not far from the edge
of the cliff.  I made my way to it at once, for as yet I had never been
near it.  Hitherto my excursions had been limited to the Castle and its
many gardens and surroundings.  It was of a style with which I was not
familiar--with four wings to the points of the compass.  The great
doorway, set in a magnificent frontage of carved stone of manifestly
ancient date, faced west, so that, when one entered, he went east.  To my
surprise--for somehow I expected the contrary--I found the door open.
Not wide open, but what is called ajar--manifestly not locked or barred,
but not sufficiently open for one to look in.  I entered, and after
passing through a wide vestibule, more like a section of a corridor than
an ostensible entrance, made my way through a spacious doorway into the
body of the church.  The church itself was almost circular, the openings
of the four naves being spacious enough to give the appearance of the
interior as a whole, being a huge cross.  It was strangely dim, for the
window openings were small and high-set, and were, moreover, filled with
green or blue glass, each window having a colour to itself.  The glass
was very old, being of the thirteenth or fourteenth century.  Such
appointments as there were--for it had a general air of desolation--were
of great beauty and richness,--especially so to be in a place--even a
church--where the door lay open, and no one was to be seen.  It was
strangely silent even for an old church on a lonesome headland.  There
reigned a dismal solemnity which seemed to chill me, accustomed as I have
been to strange and weird places.  It seemed abandoned, though it had not
that air of having been neglected which is so often to be noticed in old
churches.  There was none of the everlasting accumulation of dust which
prevails in places of higher cultivation and larger and more strenuous
work.

In the church itself or its appending chambers I could find no clue or
suggestion which could guide me in any way in my search for the Lady of
the Shroud.  Monuments there were in profusion--statues, tablets, and all
the customary memorials of the dead.  The families and dates represented
were simply bewildering.  Often the name of Vissarion was given, and the
inscription which it held I read through carefully, looking to find some
enlightenment of any kind.  But all in vain: there was nothing to see in
the church itself.  So I determined to visit the crypt.  I had no lantern
or candle with me, so had to go back to the Castle to secure one.

It was strange, coming in from the sunlight, here overwhelming to one so
recently accustomed to northern skies, to note the slender gleam of the
lantern which I carried, and which I had lit inside the door.  At my
first entry to the church my mind had been so much taken up with the
strangeness of the place, together with the intensity of wish for some
sort of clue, that I had really no opportunity of examining detail.  But
now detail became necessary, as I had to find the entrance to the crypt.
My puny light could not dissipate the semi-Cimmerian gloom of the vast
edifice; I had to throw the feeble gleam into one after another of the
dark corners.

At last I found, behind the great screen, a narrow stone staircase which
seemed to wind down into the rock.  It was not in any way secret, but
being in the narrow space behind the great screen, was not visible except
when close to it.  I knew I was now close to my objective, and began to
descend.  Accustomed though I have been to all sorts of mysteries and
dangers, I felt awed and almost overwhelmed by a sense of loneliness and
desolation as I descended the ancient winding steps.  These were many in
number, roughly hewn of old in the solid rock on which the church was
built.

I met a fresh surprise in finding that the door of the crypt was open.
After all, this was different from the church-door being open; for in
many places it is a custom to allow all comers at all times to find rest
and comfort in the sacred place.  But I did expect that at least the
final resting-place of the historic dead would be held safe against
casual intrusion.  Even I, on a quest which was very near my heart,
paused with an almost overwhelming sense of decorum before passing
through that open door.  The crypt was a huge place, strangely lofty for
a vault.  From its formation, however, I soon came to the conclusion that
it was originally a natural cavern altered to its present purpose by the
hand of man.  I could hear somewhere near the sound of running water, but
I could not locate it.  Now and again at irregular intervals there was a
prolonged booming, which could only come from a wave breaking in a
confined place.  The recollection then came to me of the proximity of the
church to the top of the beetling cliff, and of the half-sunk cavern
entrances which pierced it.

With the gleam of my lamp to guide me, I went through and round the whole
place.  There were many massive tombs, mostly rough-hewn from great slabs
or blocks of stone.  Some of them were marble, and the cutting of all was
ancient.  So large and heavy were some of them that it was a wonder to me
how they could ever have been brought to this place, to which the only
entrance was seemingly the narrow, tortuous stairway by which I had come.
At last I saw near one end of the crypt a great chain hanging.  Turning
the light upward, I found that it depended from a ring set over a wide
opening, evidently made artificially.  It must have been through this
opening that the great sarcophagi had been lowered.

Directly underneath the hanging chain, which did not come closer to the
ground than some eight or ten feet, was a huge tomb in the shape of a
rectangular coffer or sarcophagus.  It was open, save for a huge sheet of
thick glass which rested above it on two thick balks of dark oak, cut to
exceeding smoothness, which lay across it, one at either end.  On the far
side from where I stood each of these was joined to another oak plank,
also cut smooth, which sloped gently to the rocky floor.  Should it be
necessary to open the tomb, the glass could be made to slide along the
supports and descend by the sloping planks.

Naturally curious to know what might be within such a strange receptacle,
I raised the lantern, depressing its lens so that the light might fall
within.

Then I started back with a cry, the lantern slipping from my nerveless
hand and falling with a ringing sound on the great sheet of thick glass.

Within, pillowed on soft cushions, and covered with a mantle woven of
white natural fleece sprigged with tiny sprays of pine wrought in gold,
lay the body of a woman--none other than my beautiful visitor.  She was
marble white, and her long black eyelashes lay on her white cheeks as
though she slept.

Without a word or a sound, save the sounds made by my hurrying feet on
the stone flooring, I fled up the steep steps, and through the dim
expanse of the church, out into the bright sunlight.  I found that I had
mechanically raised the fallen lamp, and had taken it with me in my
flight.

My feet naturally turned towards home.  It was all instinctive.  The new
horror had--for the time, at any rate--drowned my mind in its mystery,
deeper than the deepest depths of thought or imagination.




BOOK IV: UNDER THE FLAGSTAFF


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                            _May_ 1, 1907.

For some days after the last adventure I was in truth in a half-dazed
condition, unable to think sensibly, hardly coherently.  Indeed, it was
as much as I could do to preserve something of my habitual appearance and
manner.  However, my first test happily came soon, and when I was once
through it I reacquired sufficient self-confidence to go through with my
purpose.  Gradually the original phase of stupefaction passed, and I was
able to look the situation in the face.  I knew the worst now, at any
rate; and when the lowest point has been reached things must begin to
mend.  Still, I was wofully sensitive regarding anything which might
affect my Lady of the Shroud, or even my opinion of her.  I even began to
dread Aunt Janet's Second-Sight visions or dreams.  These had a fatal
habit of coming so near to fact that they always made for a danger of
discovery.  I had to realize now that the Lady of the Shroud might indeed
be a Vampire--one of that horrid race that survives death and carries on
a life-in-death existence eternally and only for evil.  Indeed, I began
to _expect_ that Aunt Janet would ere long have some prophetic insight to
the matter.  She had been so wonderfully correct in her prophetic
surmises with regard to both the visits to my room that it was hardly
possible that she could fail to take cognizance of this last development.

But my dread was not justified; at any rate, I had no reason to suspect
that by any force or exercise of her occult gift she might cause me
concern by the discovery of my secret.  Only once did I feel that actual
danger in that respect was close to me.  That was when she came early one
morning and rapped at my door.  When I called out, "Who is that?  What is
it?" she said in an agitated way:

"Thank God, laddie, you are all right!  Go to sleep again."

Later on, when we met at breakfast, she explained that she had had a
nightmare in the grey of the morning.  She thought she had seen me in the
crypt of a great church close beside a stone coffin; and, knowing that
such was an ominous subject to dream about, came as soon as she dared to
see if I was all right.  Her mind was evidently set on death and burial,
for she went on:

"By the way, Rupert, I am told that the great church on time top of the
cliff across the creek is St. Sava's, where the great people of the
country used to be buried.  I want you to take me there some day.  We
shall go over it, and look at the tombs and monuments together.  I really
think I should be afraid to go alone, but it will be all right if you are
with me."  This was getting really dangerous, so I turned it aside:

"Really, Aunt Janet, I'm afraid it won't do.  If you go off to weird old
churches, and fill yourself up with a fresh supply of horrors, I don't
know what will happen.  You'll be dreaming dreadful things about me every
night and neither you nor I shall get any sleep."  It went to my heart to
oppose her in any wish; and also this kind of chaffy opposition might
pain her.  But I had no alternative; the matter was too serious to be
allowed to proceed.  Should Aunt Janet go to the church, she would surely
want to visit the crypt.  Should she do so, and there notice the
glass-covered tomb--as she could not help doing--the Lord only knew what
would happen.  She had already Second-Sighted a woman being married to
me, and before I myself knew that I had such a hope.  What might she not
reveal did she know where the woman came from?  It may have been that her
power of Second Sight had to rest on some basis of knowledge or belief,
and that her vision was but some intuitive perception of my own
subjective thought.  But whatever it was it should be stopped--at all
hazards.

This whole episode set me thinking introspectively, and led me gradually
but imperatively to self-analysis--not of powers, but of motives.  I
found myself before long examining myself as to what were my real
intentions.  I thought at first that this intellectual process was an
exercise of pure reason; but soon discarded this as inadequate--even
impossible.  Reason is a cold manifestation; this feeling which swayed
and dominated me is none other than passion, which is quick, hot, and
insistent.

As for myself, the self-analysis could lead to but one result--the
expression to myself of the reality and definiteness of an already-formed
though unconscious intention.  I wished to do the woman good--to serve
her in some way--to secure her some benefit by any means, no matter how
difficult, which might be within my power.  I knew that I loved
her--loved her most truly and fervently; there was no need for
self-analysis to tell me that.  And, moreover, no self-analysis, or any
other mental process that I knew of, could help my one doubt: whether she
was an ordinary woman (or an extraordinary woman, for the matter of that)
in some sore and terrible straits; or else one who lay under some
dreadful condition, only partially alive, and not mistress of herself or
her acts.  Whichever her condition might be, there was in my own feeling
a superfluity of affection for her.  The self-analysis taught me one
thing, at any rate--that I had for her, to start with, an infinite pity
which had softened towards her my whole being, and had already mastered
merely selfish desire.  Out of it I began to find excuses for her every
act.  In the doing so I knew now, though perhaps I did not at the time
the process was going on, that my view in its true inwardness was of her
as a living woman--the woman I loved.

In the forming of our ideas there are different methods of work, as
though the analogy with material life holds good.  In the building of a
house, for instance, there are many persons employed; men of different
trades and occupations--architect, builder, masons, carpenters, plumbers,
and a host of others--and all these with the officials of each guild or
trade.  So in the world of thought and feelings: knowledge and
understanding come through various agents, each competent to its task.

How far pity reacted with love I knew not; I only knew that whatever her
state might be, were she living or dead, I could find in my heart no
blame for the Lady of the Shroud.  It could not be that she was dead in
the real conventional way; for, after all, the Dead do not walk the earth
in corporal substance, even if there be spirits which take the corporal
form.  This woman was of actual form and weight.  How could I doubt that,
at all events--I, who had held her in my arms?  Might it not be that she
was not quite dead, and that it had been given to me to restore her to
life again?  Ah! that would be, indeed, a privilege well worth the giving
my life to accomplish.  That such a thing may be is possible.  Surely the
old myths were not absolute inventions; they must have had a basis
somewhere in fact.  May not the world-old story of Orpheus and Eurydice
have been based on some deep-lying principle or power of human nature?
There is not one of us but has wished at some time to bring back the
dead.  Ay, and who has not felt that in himself or herself was power in
the deep love for our dead to make them quick again, did we but know the
secret of how it was to be done?

For myself, I have seen such mysteries that I am open to conviction
regarding things not yet explained.  These have been, of course, amongst
savages or those old-world people who have brought unchecked traditions
and beliefs--ay, and powers too--down the ages from the dim days when the
world was young; when forces were elemental, and Nature's handiwork was
experimental rather than completed.  Some of these wonders may have been
older still than the accepted period of our own period of creation.  May
we not have to-day other wonders, different only in method, but not more
susceptible of belief?  Obi-ism and Fantee-ism have been exercised in my
own presence, and their results proved by the evidence of my own eyes and
other senses.  So, too, have stranger rites, with the same object and the
same success, in the far Pacific Islands.  So, too, in India and China,
in Thibet and in the Golden Chersonese.  On all and each of these
occasions there was, on my own part, enough belief to set in motion the
powers of understanding; and there were no moral scruples to stand in the
way of realization.  Those whose lives are so spent that they achieve the
reputation of not fearing man or God or devil are not deterred in their
doing or thwarted from a set purpose by things which might deter others
not so equipped for adventure.  Whatever may be before them--pleasant or
painful, bitter or sweet, arduous or facile, enjoyable or terrible,
humorous or full of awe and horror--they must accept, taking them in the
onward course as a good athlete takes hurdles in his stride.  And there
must be no hesitating, no looking back.  If the explorer or the
adventurer has scruples, he had better give up that special branch of
effort and come himself to a more level walk in life.  Neither must there
be regrets.  There is no need for such; savage life has this advantage:
it begets a certain toleration not to be found in conventional existence.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                            _May_ 2, 1907.

I had heard long ago that Second Sight is a terrible gift, even to its
possessor.  I am now inclined not only to believe, but to understand it.
Aunt Janet has made such a practice of it of late that I go in constant
dread of discovery of my secret.  She seems to parallel me all the time,
whatever I may do.  It is like a sort of dual existence to her; for she
is her dear old self all the time, and yet some other person with a sort
of intellectual kit of telescope and notebook, which are eternally used
on me.  I know they are _for_ me, too--for what she considers my good.
But all the same it makes an embarrassment.  Happily Second Sight cannot
speak as clearly as it sees, or, rather, as it understands.  For the
translation of the vague beliefs which it inculcates is both nebulous and
uncertain--a sort of Delphic oracle which always says things which no one
can make out at the time, but which can be afterwards read in any one of
several ways.  This is all right, for in my case it is a kind of safety;
but, then, Aunt Janet is a very clever woman, and some time she herself
may be able to understand.  Then she may begin to put two and two
together.  When she does that, it will not be long before she knows more
than I do of the facts of the whole affair.  And her reading of them and
of the Lady of the Shroud, round whom they circle, may not be the same as
mine.  Well, that will be all right too.  Aunt Janet loves me--God knows
I have good reason to know that all through these years--and whatever
view she may take, her acts will be all I could wish.  But I shall come
in for a good lot of scolding, I am sure.  By the way, I ought to think
of that; if Aunt Janet scolds me, it is a pretty good proof that I ought
to be scolded.  I wonder if I dare tell her all.  No!  It is too strange.
She is only a woman, after all: and if she knew I loved . . . I wish I
knew her name, and thought--as I might myself do, only that I resist
it--that she is not alive at all.  Well, what she would either think or
do beats me.  I suppose she would want to slipper me as she used to do
when I was a wee kiddie--in a different way, of course.

                                                            _May_ 3, 1907.

I really could not go on seriously last night.  The idea of Aunt Janet
giving me a licking as in the dear old days made me laugh so much that
nothing in the world seemed serious then.  Oh, Aunt Janet is all right
whatever comes.  That I am sure of, so I needn't worry over it.  A good
thing too; there will be plenty to worry about without that.  I shall not
check her telling me of her visions, however; I may learn something from
them.

For the last four-and-twenty hours I have, whilst awake, been looking
over Aunt Janet's books, of which I brought a wheen down here.  Gee
whizz!  No wonder the old dear is superstitious, when she is filled up to
the back teeth with that sort of stuff!  There may be some truth in some
of those yarns; those who wrote them may believe in them, or some of
them, at all events.  But as to coherence or logic, or any sort of
reasonable or instructive deduction, they might as well have been written
by so many hens!  These occult book-makers seem to gather only a lot of
bare, bald facts, which they put down in the most uninteresting way
possible.  They go by quantity only.  One story of the kind, well
examined and with logical comments, would be more convincing to a third
party than a whole hecatomb of them.

There is evidently something up in the country.  The mountaineers are
more uneasy than they have been as yet.  There is constant going to and
fro amongst them, mostly at night and in the grey of the morning.  I
spend many hours in my room in the eastern tower, from which I can watch
the woods, and gather from signs the passing to and fro.  But with all
this activity no one has said to me a word on the subject.  It is
undoubtedly a disappointment to me.  I had hoped that the mountaineers
had come to trust me; that gathering at which they wanted to fire their
guns for me gave me strong hopes.  But now it is apparent that they do
not trust me in full--as yet, at all events.  Well, I must not complain.
It is all only right and just.  As yet I have done nothing to prove to
them the love and devotion that I feel to the country.  I know that such
individuals as I have met trust me, and I believe like me.  But the trust
of a nation is different.  That has to be won and tested; he who would
win it must justify, and in a way that only troublous times can allow.
No nation will--can--give full meed of honour to a stranger in times of
peace.  Why should it?  I must not forget that I am here a stranger in
the land, and that to the great mass of people even my name is unknown.
Perhaps they will know me better when Rooke comes back with that store of
arms and ammunition that he has bought, and the little warship he has got
from South America.  When they see that I hand over the whole lot to the
nation without a string on them, they may begin to believe.  In the
meantime all I can do is to wait.  It will all come right in time, I have
no doubt.  And if it doesn't come right, well, we can only die once!

Is that so?  What about my Lady of the Shroud?  I must not think of that
or of her in this gallery.  Love and war are separate, and may not
mix--cannot mix, if it comes to that.  I must be wise in the matter; and
if I have got the hump in any degree whatever, must not show it.

But one thing is certain: something is up, and it must be the Turks.
From what the Vladika said at that meeting they have some intention of an
attack on the Blue Mountains.  If that be so, we must be ready; and
perhaps I can help there.  The forces must be organized; we must have
some method of communication.  In this country, where are neither roads
nor railways nor telegraphs, we must establish a signalling system of
some sort.  _That_ I can begin at once.  I can make a code, or adapt one
that I have used elsewhere already.  I shall rig up a semaphore on the
top of the Castle which can be seen for an enormous distance around.  I
shall train a number of men to be facile in signalling.  And then, should
need come, I may be able to show the mountaineers that I am fit to live
in their hearts . . .

And all this work may prove an anodyne to pain of another kind.  It will
help, at any rate, to keep my mind occupied whilst I am waiting for
another visit from my Lady of the Shroud.

The two weeks that have passed have been busy, and may, as time goes on,
prove eventful.  I really think they have placed me in a different
position with the Blue Mountaineers--certainly so far as those in this
part of the country are concerned.  They are no longer suspicious of
me--which is much; though they have not yet received me into their
confidence.  I suppose this will come in time, but I must not try to
hustle them.  Already they are willing, so far as I can see, to use me to
their own ends.  They accepted the signalling idea very readily, and are
quite willing to drill as much as I like.  This can be (and I think is,
in its way) a pleasure to them.  They are born soldiers, every man of
them; and practice together is only a realization of their own wishes and
a further development of their powers.  I think I can understand the
trend of their thoughts, and what ideas of public policy lie behind them.
In all that we have attempted together as yet they are themselves in
absolute power.  It rests with them to carry out any ideas I may suggest,
so they do not fear any assumption of power or governance on my part.
Thus, so long as they keep secret from me both their ideas of high policy
and their immediate intentions, I am powerless to do them ill, and I
_may_ be of service should occasion arise.  Well, all told, this is much.
Already they accept me as an individual, not merely one of the mass.  I
am pretty sure that they are satisfied of my personal _bona fides_.  It
is policy and not mistrust that hedges me in.  Well, policy is a matter
of time.  They are a splendid people, but if they knew a little more than
they do they would understand that the wisest of all policies is
trust--when it can be given.  I must hold myself in check, and never be
betrayed into a harsh thought towards them.  Poor souls! with a thousand
years behind them of Turkish aggression, strenuously attempted by both
force and fraud, no wonder they are suspicious.  Likewise every other
nation with whom they have ever come in contact--except one, my own--has
deceived or betrayed them.  Anyhow, they are fine soldiers, and before
long we shall have an army that cannot be ignored.  If I can get so that
they trust me, I shall ask Sir Colin to come out here.  He would be a
splendid head for their army.  His great military knowledge and tactical
skill would come in well.  It makes me glow to think of what an army he
would turn out of this splendid material, and one especially adapted for
the style of fighting which would be necessary in this country.

If a mere amateur like myself, who has only had experience of organizing
the wildest kind of savages, has been able to advance or compact their
individual style of fighting into systematic effort, a great soldier like
MacKelpie will bring them to perfection as a fighting machine.  Our
Highlanders, when they come out, will foregather with them, as
mountaineers always do with each other.  Then we shall have a force which
can hold its own against any odds.  I only hope that Rooke will be
returning soon.  I want to see those Ingis-Malbron rifles either safely
stored in the Castle or, what is better, divided up amongst the
mountaineers--a thing which will be done at the very earliest moment that
I can accomplish it.  I have a conviction that when these men have
received their arms and ammunition from me they will understand me
better, and not keep any secrets from me.

All this fortnight when I was not drilling or going about amongst the
mountaineers, and teaching them the code which I have now got perfected,
I was exploring the side of the mountain nearest to here.  I could not
bear to be still.  It is torture to me to be idle in my present condition
of mind regarding my Lady of the Shroud . . . Strange I do not mind
mentioning the word to myself now.  I used to at first; but that
bitterness has all gone away.

                                                           _May_ 19, 1907.

I was so restless early this morning that before daylight I was out
exploring on the mountain-side.  By chance I came across a secret place
just as the day was breaking.  Indeed, it was by the change of light as
the first sun-rays seemed to fall down the mountain-side that my
attention was called to an opening shown by a light behind it.  It was,
indeed, a secret place--so secret that I thought at first I should keep
it to myself.  In such a place as this either to hide in or to be able to
prevent anyone else hiding in might on occasion be an asset of safety.

When, however, I saw indications rather than traces that someone had
already used it to camp in, I changed my mind, and thought that whenever
I should get an opportunity I would tell the Vladika of it, as he is a
man on whose discretion I can rely.  If we ever have a war here or any
sort of invasion, it is just such places that may be dangerous.  Even in
my own case it is much too near the Castle to be neglected.

The indications were meagre--only where a fire had been on a little shelf
of rock; and it was not possible, through the results of burning
vegetation or scorched grass, to tell how long before the fire had been
alight.  I could only guess.  Perhaps the mountaineers might be able to
tell or even to guess better than I could.  But I am not so sure of this.
I am a mountaineer myself, and with larger and more varied experience
than any of them.  For myself, though I could not be certain, I came to
the conclusion that whoever had used the place had done so not many days
before.  It could not have been quite recently; but it may not have been
very long ago.  Whoever had used it had covered up his tracks well.  Even
the ashes had been carefully removed, and the place where they had lain
was cleaned or swept in some way, so that there was no trace on the spot.
I applied some of my West African experience, and looked on the rough
bark of the trees to leeward, to where the agitated air, however
directed, must have come, unless it was wanted to call attention to the
place by the scattered wood-ashes, however fine.  I found traces of it,
but they were faint.  There had not been rain for several days; so the
dust must have been blown there since the rain had fallen, for it was
still dry.

The place was a tiny gorge, with but one entrance, which was hidden
behind a barren spur of rock--just a sort of long fissure, jagged and
curving, in the rock, like a fault in the stratification.  I could just
struggle through it with considerable effort, holding my breath here and
there, so as to reduce my depth of chest.  Within it was tree-clad, and
full of possibilities of concealment.

As I came away I marked well its direction and approaches, noting any
guiding mark which might aid in finding it by day or night.  I explored
every foot of ground around it--in front, on each side, and above.  But
from nowhere could I see an indication of its existence.  It was a
veritable secret chamber wrought by the hand of Nature itself.  I did not
return home till I was familiar with every detail near and around it.
This new knowledge added distinctly to my sense of security.

Later in the day I tried to find the Vladika or any mountaineer of
importance, for I thought that such a hiding-place which had been used so
recently might be dangerous, and especially at a time when, as I had
learned at the meeting where they did _not_ fire their guns that there
may have been spies about or a traitor in the land.

Even before I came to my own room to-night I had fully made up my mind to
go out early in the morning and find some proper person to whom to impart
the information, so that a watch might be kept on the place.  It is now
getting on for midnight, and when I have had my usual last look at the
garden I shall turn in.  Aunt Janet was uneasy all day, and especially so
this evening.  I think it must have been my absence at the usual
breakfast-hour which got on her nerves; and that unsatisfied mental or
psychical irritation increased as the day wore on.

                                                           _May_ 20, 1907.

The clock on the mantelpiece in my room, which chimes on the notes of the
clock at St. James's Palace, was striking midnight when I opened the
glass door on the terrace.  I had put out my lights before I drew the
curtain, as I wished to see the full effect of the moonlight.  Now that
the rainy season is over, the moon is quite as beautiful as it was in the
wet, and a great deal more comfortable.  I was in evening dress, with a
smoking-jacket in lieu of a coat, and I felt the air mild and mellow on
the warm side, as I stood on the terrace.

But even in that bright moonlight the further corners of the great garden
were full of mysterious shadows.  I peered into them as well as I
could--and my eyes are pretty good naturally, and are well trained.
There was not the least movement.  The air was as still as death, the
foliage as still as though wrought in stone.

I looked for quite a long time in the hope of seeing something of my
Lady.  The quarters chimed several times, but I stood on unheeding.  At
last I thought I saw far off in the very corner of the old defending wall
a flicker of white.  It was but momentary, and could hardly have
accounted in itself for the way my heart beat.  I controlled myself, and
stood as though I, too, were a graven image.  I was rewarded by seeing
presently another gleam of white.  And then an unspeakable rapture stole
over me as I realized that my Lady was coming as she had come before.  I
would have hurried out to meet her, but that I knew well that this would
not be in accord with her wishes.  So, thinking to please her, I drew
back into the room.  I was glad I had done so when, from the dark corner
where I stood, I saw her steal up the marble steps and stand timidly
looking in at the door.  Then, after a long pause, came a whisper as
faint and sweet as the music of a distant AEolian harp:

"Are you there?  May I come in?  Answer me!  I am lonely and in fear!"
For answer I emerged from my dim corner so swiftly that she was startled.
I could hear from the quivering intake of her breath that she was
striving--happily with success--to suppress a shriek.

"Come in," I said quietly.  "I was waiting for you, for I felt that you
would come.  I only came in from the terrace when I saw you coming, lest
you might fear that anyone might see us.  That is not possible, but I
thought you wished that I should be careful."

"I did--I do," she answered in a low, sweet voice, but very firmly.  "But
never avoid precaution.  There is nothing that may not happen here.
There may be eyes where we least expect--or suspect them."  As she spoke
the last words solemnly and in a low whisper, she was entering the room.
I closed the glass door and bolted it, rolled back the steel grille, and
pulled the heavy curtain.  Then, when I had lit a candle, I went over and
put a light to the fire.  In a few seconds the dry wood had caught, and
the flames were beginning to rise and crackle.  She had not objected to
my closing the window and drawing the curtain; neither did she make any
comment on my lighting the fire.  She simply acquiesced in it, as though
it was now a matter of course.  When I made the pile of cushions before
it as on the occasion of her last visit, she sank down on them, and held
out her white, trembling hands to the warmth.

She was different to-night from what she had been on either of the two
former visits.  From her present bearing I arrived at some gauge of her
self-concern, her self-respect.  Now that she was dry, and not
overmastered by wet and cold, a sweet and gracious dignity seemed to
shine from her, enwrapping her, as it were, with a luminous veil.  It was
not that she was by this made or shown as cold or distant, or in any way
harsh or forbidding.  On the contrary, protected by this dignity, she
seemed much more sweet and genial than before.  It was as though she felt
that she could afford to stoop now that her loftiness was realized--that
her position was recognized and secure.  If her inherent dignity made an
impenetrable nimbus round her, this was against others; she herself was
not bound by it, or to be bound.  So marked was this, so entirely and
sweetly womanly did she appear, that I caught myself wondering in flashes
of thought, which came as sharp periods of doubting judgment between
spells of unconscious fascination, how I had ever come to think she was
aught but perfect woman.  As she rested, half sitting and half lying on
the pile of cushions, she was all grace, and beauty, and charm, and
sweetness--the veritable perfect woman of the dreams of a man, be he
young or old.  To have such a woman sit by his hearth and hold her holy
of holies in his heart might well be a rapture to any man.  Even an hour
of such entrancing joy might be well won by a lifetime of pain, by the
balance of a long life sacrificed, by the extinction of life itself.
Quick behind the record of such thoughts came the answer to the doubt
they challenged: if it should turn out that she was not living at all,
but one of the doomed and pitiful Un-Dead, then so much more on account
of her very sweetness and beauty would be the winning of her back to Life
and Heaven--even were it that she might find happiness in the heart and
in the arms of another man.

Once, when I leaned over the hearth to put fresh logs on the fire, my
face was so close to hers that I felt her breath on my cheek.  It
thrilled me to feel even the suggestion of that ineffable contact.  Her
breath was sweet--sweet as the breath of a calf, sweet as the whiff of a
summer breeze across beds of mignonette.  How could anyone believe for a
moment that such sweet breath could come from the lips of the dead--the
dead _in esse_ or _in posse_--that corruption could send forth fragrance
so sweet and pure?  It was with satisfied happiness that, as I looked at
her from my stool, I saw the dancing of the flames from the beech-logs
reflected in her glorious black eyes, and the stars that were hidden in
them shine out with new colours and new lustre as they gleamed, rising
and falling like hopes and fears.  As the light leaped, so did smiles of
quiet happiness flit over her beautiful face, the merriment of the joyous
flames being reflected in ever-changing dimples.

At first I was a little disconcerted whenever my eyes took note of her
shroud, and there came a momentary regret that the weather had not been
again bad, so that there might have been compulsion for her putting on
another garment--anything lacking the loathsomeness of that pitiful
wrapping.  Little by little, however, this feeling disappeared, and I
found no matter for even dissatisfaction in her wrapping.  Indeed, my
thoughts found inward voice before the subject was dismissed from my
mind:

"One becomes accustomed to anything--even a shroud!"  But the thought was
followed by a submerging wave of pity that she should have had such a
dreadful experience.

By-and-by we seemed both to forget everything--I know I did--except that
we were man and woman, and close together.  The strangeness of the
situation and the circumstances did not seem of moment--not worth even a
passing thought.  We still sat apart and said little, if anything.  I
cannot recall a single word that either of us spoke whilst we sat before
the fire, but other language than speech came into play; the eyes told
their own story, as eyes can do, and more eloquently than lips whilst
exercising their function of speech.  Question and answer followed each
other in this satisfying language, and with an unspeakable rapture I
began to realize that my affection was returned.  Under these
circumstances it was unrealizable that there should be any incongruity in
the whole affair.  I was not myself in the mood of questioning.  I was
diffident with that diffidence which comes alone from true love, as
though it were a necessary emanation from that delightful and
overwhelming and commanding passion.  In her presence there seemed to
surge up within me that which forbade speech.  Speech under present
conditions would have seemed to me unnecessary, imperfect, and even
vulgarly overt.  She, too, was silent.  But now that I am alone, and
memory is alone with me, I am convinced that she also had been happy.
No, not that exactly.  "Happiness" is not the word to describe either her
feeling or my own.  Happiness is more active, a more conscious enjoyment.
We had been content.  That expresses our condition perfectly; and now
that I can analyze my own feeling, and understand what the word implies,
I am satisfied of its accuracy.  "Content" has both a positive and
negative meaning or antecedent condition.  It implies an absence of
disturbing conditions as well as of wants; also it implies something
positive which has been won or achieved, or which has accrued.  In our
state of mind--for though it may be presumption on my part, I am
satisfied that our ideas were mutual--it meant that we had reached an
understanding whence all that might come must be for good.  God grant
that it may be so!

As we sat silent, looking into each other's eyes, and whilst the stars in
hers were now full of latent fire, perhaps from the reflection of the
flames, she suddenly sprang to her feet, instinctively drawing the
horrible shroud round her as she rose to her full height in a voice full
of lingering emotion, as of one who is acting under spiritual compulsion
rather than personal will, she said in a whisper:

"I must go at once.  I feel the morning drawing nigh.  I must be in my
place when the light of day comes."

She was so earnest that I felt I must not oppose her wish; so I, too,
sprang to my feet and ran towards the window.  I pulled the curtain aside
sufficiently far for me to press back the grille and reach the glass
door, the latch of which I opened.  I passed behind the curtain again,
and held the edge of it back so that she could go through.  For an
instant she stopped as she broke the long silence:

"You are a true gentleman, and my friend.  You understand all I wish.
Out of the depth of my heart I thank you."  She held out her beautiful
high-bred hand.  I took it in both mine as I fell on my knees, and raised
it to my lips.  Its touch made me quiver.  She, too, trembled as she
looked down at me with a glance which seemed to search my very soul.  The
stars in her eyes, now that the firelight was no longer on them, had gone
back to their own mysterious silver.  Then she drew her hand from mine
very, very gently, as though it would fain linger; and she passed out
behind the curtain with a gentle, sweet, dignified little bow which left
me on my knees.

When I heard the glass door pulled-to gently behind her, I rose from my
knees and hurried without the curtain, just in time to watch her pass
down the steps.  I wanted to see her as long as I could.  The grey of
morning was just beginning to war with the night gloom, and by the faint
uncertain light I could see dimly the white figure flit between shrub and
statue till finally it merged in the far darkness.

I stood for a long time on the terrace, sometimes looking into the
darkness in front of me, in case I might be blessed with another glimpse
of her; sometimes with my eyes closed, so that I might recall and hold in
my mind her passage down the steps.  For the first time since I had met
her she had thrown back at me a glance as she stepped on the white path
below the terrace.  With the glamour over me of that look, which was all
love and enticement, I could have dared all the powers that be.

When the grey dawn was becoming apparent through the lightening of the
sky I returned to my room.  In a dazed condition--half hypnotized by
love--I went to bed, and in dreams continued to think, all happily, of my
Lady of the Shroud.

A whole week has gone since I saw my Love!  There it is; no doubt
whatever is left in my mind about it now!  Since I saw her my passion has
grown and grown by leaps and bounds, as novelists put it.  It has now
become so vast as to overwhelm me, to wipe out all thought of doubt or
difficulty.  I suppose it must be what men suffered--suffering need not
mean pain--under enchantments in old times.  I am but as a straw whirled
in the resistless eddies of a whirlpool.  I feel that I _must_ see her
again, even if it be but in her tomb in the crypt.  I must, I suppose,
prepare myself for the venture, for many things have to be thought of.
The visit must not be at night, for in such case I might miss her, did
she come to me again here . . .

The morning came and went, but my wish and intention still remained; and
so in the full tide of noon, with the sun in all its fiery force, I set
out for the old church of St. Sava.  I carried with me a lantern with
powerful lens.  I had wrapped it up secretly, for I had a feeling that I
should not like anyone to know that I had such a thing with me.

On this occasion I had no misgivings.  On the former visit I had for a
moment been overwhelmed at the unexpected sight of the body of the woman
I thought I loved--I knew it now--lying in her tomb.  But now I knew all,
and it was to see this woman, though in her tomb, that I came.

When I had lit my lantern, which I did as soon as I had pushed open the
great door, which was once again unlocked, I turned my steps to the steps
of the crypt, which lay behind the richly carven wood screen.  This I
could see, with the better light, was a noble piece of work of priceless
beauty and worth.  I tried to keep my heart in full courage with thoughts
of my Lady, and of the sweetness and dignity of our last meeting; but,
despite all, it sank down, down, and turned to water as I passed with
uncertain feet down the narrow, tortuous steps.  My concern, I am now
convinced, was not for myself, but that she whom I adored should have to
endure such a fearful place.  As anodyne to my own pain I thought what it
would be, and how I should feel, when I should have won for her a way out
of that horror, at any rate.  This thought reassured me somewhat, and
restored my courage.  It was in something of the same fashion which has
hitherto carried me out of tight places as well as into them that at last
I pushed open the low, narrow door at the foot of the rock-hewn staircase
and entered the crypt.

Without delay I made my way to the glass-covered tomb set beneath the
hanging chain.  I could see by the flashing of the light around me that
my hand which held the lantern trembled.  With a great effort I steadied
myself, and raising the lantern, turned its light down into the
sarcophagus.

Once again the fallen lantern rang on the tingling glass, and I stood
alone in the darkness, for an instant almost paralyzed with surprised
disappointment.

The tomb was empty!  Even the trappings of the dead had been removed.

I knew not what happened till I found myself groping my way up the
winding stair.  Here, in comparison with the solid darkness of the crypt,
it seemed almost light.  The dim expanse of the church sent a few
straggling rays down the vaulted steps, and as I could see, be it never
so dimly, I felt I was not in absolute darkness.  With the light came a
sense of power and fresh courage, and I groped my way back into the crypt
again.  There, by now and again lighting matches, I found my way to the
tomb and recovered my lantern.  Then I took my way slowly--for I wished
to prove, if not my own courage, at least such vestiges of self-respect
as the venture had left me--through the church, where I extinguished my
lantern, and out through the great door into the open sunlight.  I seemed
to have heard, both in the darkness of the crypt and through the dimness
of the church, mysterious sounds as of whispers and suppressed breathing;
but the memory of these did not count for much when once I was free.  I
was only satisfied of my own consciousness and identity when I found
myself on the broad rock terrace in front of the church, with the fierce
sunlight beating on my upturned face, and, looking downward, saw far
below me the rippled blue of the open sea.

                                                           _June_ 3, 1907.

Another week has elapsed--a week full of movement of many kinds and in
many ways--but as yet I have had no tale or tidings of my Lady of the
Shroud.  I have not had an opportunity of going again in daylight to St.
Sava's as I should have liked to have done.  I felt that I must not go at
night.  The night is her time of freedom, and it must be kept for her--or
else I may miss her, or perhaps never see her again.

The days have been full of national movement.  The mountaineers have
evidently been organizing themselves, for some reason which I cannot
quite understand, and which they have hesitated to make known to me.  I
have taken care not to manifest any curiosity, whatever I may have felt.
This would certainly arouse suspicion, and might ultimately cause
disaster to my hopes of aiding the nation in their struggle to preserve
their freedom.

These fierce mountaineers are strangely--almost unduly--suspicious, and
the only way to win their confidence is to begin the trusting.  A young
American attache of the Embassy at Vienna, who had made a journey through
the Land of the Blue Mountains, once put it to me in this form:

"Keep your head shut, and they'll open theirs.  If you don't, they'll
open it for you--down to the chine!"

It was quite apparent to me that they were completing some fresh
arrangements for signalling with a code of their own.  This was natural
enough, and in no way inconsistent with the measure of friendliness
already shown to me.  Where there are neither telegraphs, railways, nor
roads, any effective form of communication must--can only be purely
personal.  And so, if they wish to keep any secret amongst themselves,
they must preserve the secret of their code.  I should have dearly liked
to learn their new code and their manner of using it, but as I want to be
a helpful friend to them--and as this implies not only trust, but the
appearance of it--I had to school myself to patience.

This attitude so far won their confidence that before we parted at our
last meeting, after most solemn vows of faith and secrecy, they took me
into the secret.  This was, however, only to the extent of teaching me
the code and method; they still withheld from me rigidly the fact or
political secret, or whatever it was that was the mainspring of their
united action.

When I got home I wrote down, whilst it was fresh in my memory, all they
told me.  This script I studied until I had it so thoroughly by heart
that I _could_ not forget it.  Then I burned the paper.  However, there
is now one gain at least: with my semaphore I can send through the Blue
Mountains from side to side, with expedition, secrecy, and exactness, a
message comprehensible to all.

                                                           _June_ 6, 1907.

Last night I had a new experience of my Lady of the Shroud--in so far as
form was concerned, at any rate.  I was in bed, and just falling asleep,
when I heard a queer kind of scratching at the glass door of the terrace.
I listened acutely, my heart beating hard.  The sound seemed to come from
low down, close to the floor.  I jumped out of bed, ran to the window,
and, pulling aside the heavy curtains, looked out.

The garden looked, as usual, ghostly in the moonlight, but there was not
the faintest sign of movement anywhere, and no one was on or near the
terrace.  I looked eagerly down to where the sound had seemed to come
from.

There, just inside the glass door, as though it had been pushed under the
door, lay a paper closely folded in several laps.  I picked it up and
opened it.  I was all in a tumult, for my heart told me whence it came.
Inside was written in English, in a large, sprawling hand, such as might
be from an English child of seven or eight:

"Meet me at the Flagstaff on the Rock!"

I knew the place, of course.  On the farthermost point of the rock on
which the Castle stands is set a high flagstaff, whereon in old time the
banner of the Vissarion family flew.  At some far-off time, when the
Castle had been liable to attack, this point had been strongly fortified.
Indeed, in the days when the bow was a martial weapon it must have been
quite impregnable.

A covered gallery, with loopholes for arrows, had been cut in the solid
rock, running right round the point, quite surrounding the flagstaff and
the great boss of rock on whose centre it was reared.  A narrow
drawbridge of immense strength had connected--in peaceful times, and
still remained--the outer point of rock with an entrance formed in the
outer wall, and guarded with flanking towers and a portcullis.  Its use
was manifestly to guard against surprise.  From this point only could be
seen the line of the rocks all round the point.  Thus, any secret attack
by boats could be made impossible.

Having hurriedly dressed myself, and taking with me both hunting-knife
and revolver, I went out on the terrace, taking the precaution, unusual
to me, of drawing the grille behind me and locking it.  Matters around
the Castle are in far too disturbed a condition to allow the taking of
any foolish chances, either in the way of being unarmed or of leaving the
private entrance to the Castle open.  I found my way through the rocky
passage, and climbed by the Jacob's ladder fixed on the rock--a device of
convenience in time of peace--to the foot of the flagstaff.

I was all on fire with expectation, and the time of going seemed
exceeding long; so I was additionally disappointed by the contrast when I
did not see my Lady there when I arrived.  However, my heart beat freely
again--perhaps more freely than ever--when I saw her crouching in the
shadow of the Castle wall.  From where she was she could not be seen from
any point save that alone which I occupied; even from there it was only
her white shroud that was conspicuous through the deep gloom of the
shadow.  The moonlight was so bright that the shadows were almost
unnaturally black.

I rushed over towards her, and when close was about to say impulsively,
"Why did you leave your tomb?" when it suddenly struck me that the
question would be malapropos and embarrassing in many ways.  So, better
judgment prevailing, I said instead:

"It has been so long since I saw you!  It has seemed an eternity to me!"
Her answer came as quickly as even I could have wished; she spoke
impulsively and without thought:

"It has been long to me too!  Oh, so long! so long!  I have asked you to
come out here because I wanted to see you so much that I could not wait
any longer.  I have been heart-hungry for a sight of you!"

Her words, her eager attitude, the ineffable something which conveys the
messages of the heart, the longing expression in her eyes as the full
moonlight fell on her face, showing the stars as living gold--for in her
eagerness she had stepped out towards me from the shadow--all set me on
fire.  Without a thought or a word--for it was Nature speaking in the
language of Love, which is a silent tongue--I stepped towards her and
took her in my arms.  She yielded with that sweet unconsciousness which
is the perfection of Love, as if it was in obedience to some command
uttered before the beginning of the world.  Probably without any
conscious effort on either side--I know there was none on mine--our
mouths met in the first kiss of love.

At the time nothing in the meeting struck me as out of the common.  But
later in the night, when I was alone and in darkness, whenever I thought
of it all--its strangeness and its stranger rapture--I could not but be
sensible of the bizarre conditions for a love meeting.  The place lonely,
the time night, the man young and strong, and full of life and hope and
ambition; the woman, beautiful and ardent though she was, a woman
seemingly dead, clothed in the shroud in which she had been wrapped when
lying in her tomb in the crypt of the old church.

Whilst we were together, anyhow, there was little thought of the kind; no
reasoning of any kind on my part.  Love has its own laws and its own
logic.  Under the flagstaff, where the Vissarion banner was wont to flap
in the breeze, she was in my arms; her sweet breath was on my face; her
heart was beating against my own.  What need was there for reason at all?
_Inter arma silent leges_--the voice of reason is silent in the stress of
passion.  Dead she may be, or Un-dead--a Vampire with one foot in Hell
and one on earth.  But I love her; and come what may, here or hereafter,
she is mine.  As my mate, we shall fare along together, whatsoever the
end may be, or wheresoever our path may lead.  If she is indeed to be won
from the nethermost Hell, then be mine the task!

But to go back to the record.  When I had once started speaking to her in
words of passion I could not stop.  I did not want to--if I could; and
she did not appear to wish it either.  Can there be a woman--alive or
dead--who would not want to hear the rapture of her lover expressed to
her whilst she is enclosed in his arms?

There was no attempt at reticence on my part now; I took it for granted
that she knew all that I surmised, and, as she made neither protest nor
comment, that she accepted my belief as to her indeterminate existence.
Sometimes her eyes would be closed, but even then the rapture of her face
was almost beyond belief.  Then, when the beautiful eyes would open and
gaze on me, the stars that were in them would shine and scintillate as
though they were formed of living fire.  She said little, very little;
but though the words were few, every syllable was fraught with love, and
went straight to the very core of my heart.

By-and-by, when our transport had calmed to joy, I asked when I might
next see her, and how and where I might find her when I should want to.
She did not reply directly, but, holding me close in her arms, whispered
in my ear with that breathless softness which is a lover's rapture of
speech:

"I have come here under terrible difficulties, not only because I love
you--and that would be enough--but because, as well as the joy of seeing
you, I wanted to warn you."

"To warn me!  Why?" I queried.  Her reply came with a bashful hesitation,
with something of a struggle in it, as of one who for some ulterior
reason had to pick her words:

"There are difficulties and dangers ahead of you.  You are beset with
them; and they are all the greater because they are, of grim necessity,
hidden from you.  You cannot go anywhere, look in any direction, do
anything, say anything, but it may be a signal for danger.  My dear, it
lurks everywhere--in the light as well as in the darkness; in the open as
well as in the secret places; from friends as well as foes; when you are
least prepared; when you may least expect it.  Oh, I know it, and what it
is to endure; for I share it for you--for your dear sake!"

"My darling!" was all I could say, as I drew her again closer to me and
kissed her.  After a bit she was calmer; seeing this, I came back to the
subject that she had--in part, at all events--come to me to speak about:

"But if difficulty and danger hedge me in so everlastingly, and if I am
to have no indication whatever of its kind or purpose, what can I do?
God knows I would willingly guard myself--not on my own account, but for
your dear sake.  I have now a cause to live and be strong, and to keep
all my faculties, since it may mean much to you.  If you may not tell me
details, may you not indicate to me some line of conduct, of action, that
would be most in accord with your wishes--or, rather, with your idea of
what would be best?"

She looked at me fixedly before speaking--a long, purposeful, loving look
which no man born of woman could misunderstand.  Then she spoke slowly,
deliberately, emphatically:

"Be bold, and fear not.  Be true to yourself, to me--it is the same
thing.  These are the best guards you can use.  Your safety does not rest
with me.  Ah, I wish it did!  I wish to God it did!"  In my inner heart
it thrilled me not merely to hear the expression of her wish, but to hear
her use the name of God as she did.  I understand now, in the calm of
this place and with the sunlight before me, that my belief as to her
being all woman--living woman--was not quite dead: but though at the
moment my heart did not recognize the doubt, my brain did.  And I made up
my mind that we should not part this time until she knew that I had seen
her, and where; but, despite my own thoughts, my outer ears listened
greedily as she went on.

"As for me, you may not find _me_, but _I_ shall find _you_, be sure!
And now we must say 'Good-night,' my dear, my dear!  Tell me once again
that you love me, for it is a sweetness that one does not wish to
forego--even one who wears such a garment as this--and rests where I must
rest."  As she spoke she held up part of her cerements for me to see.
What could I do but take her once again in my arms and hold her close,
close.  God knows it was all in love; but it was passionate love which
surged through my every vein as I strained her dear body to mine.  But
yet this embrace was not selfish; it was not all an expression of my own
passion.  It was based on pity--the pity which is twin-born with true
love.  Breathless from our kisses, when presently we released each other,
she stood in a glorious rapture, like a white spirit in the moonlight,
and as her lovely, starlit eyes seemed to devour me, she spoke in a
languorous ecstasy:

"Oh, how you love me! how you love me!  It is worth all I have gone
through for this, even to wearing this terrible drapery."  And again she
pointed to her shroud.

Here was my chance to speak of what I knew, and I took it.  "I know, I
know.  Moreover, I know that awful resting-place."

I was interrupted, cut short in the midst of my sentence, not by any
word, but by the frightened look in her eyes and the fear-mastered way in
which she shrank away from me.  I suppose in reality she could not be
paler than she looked when the colour-absorbing moonlight fell on her;
but on the instant all semblance of living seemed to shrink and fall
away, and she looked with eyes of dread as if in I some awful way held in
thrall.  But for the movement of the pitiful glance, she would have
seemed of soulless marble, so deadly cold did she look.

The moments that dragged themselves out whilst I waited for her to speak
seemed endless.  At length her words came in an awed whisper, so faint
that even in that stilly night I could hardly hear it:

"You know--you know my resting-place!  How--when was that?"  There was
nothing to do now but to speak out the truth:

"I was in the crypt of St. Sava.  It was all by accident.  I was
exploring all around the Castle, and I went there in my course.  I found
the winding stair in the rock behind the screen, and went down.  Dear, I
loved you well before that awful moment, but then, even as the lantern
fell tingling on the glass, my love multiplied itself, with pity as a
factor."  She was silent for a few seconds.  When she spoke, there was a
new tone in her voice:

"But were you not shocked?"

"Of course I was," I answered on the spur of the moment, and I now think
wisely.  "Shocked is hardly the word.  I was horrified beyond anything
that words can convey that you--_you_ should have to so endure!  I did
not like to return, for I feared lest my doing so might set some barrier
between us.  But in due time I did return on another day."

"Well?"  Her voice was like sweet music.

"I had another shock that time, worse than before, for you were not
there.  Then indeed it was that I knew to myself how dear you were--how
dear you are to me.  Whilst I live, you--living or dead--shall always be
in my heart."  She breathed hard.  The elation in her eyes made them
outshine the moonlight, but she said no word.  I went on:

"My dear, I had come into the crypt full of courage and hope, though I
knew what dreadful sight should sear my eyes once again.  But we little
know what may be in store for us, no matter what we expect.  I went out
with a heart like water from that dreadful desolation."

"Oh, how you love me, dear!"  Cheered by her words, and even more by her
tone, I went on with renewed courage.  There was no halting, no faltering
in my intention now:

"You and I, my dear, were ordained for each other.  I cannot help it that
you had already suffered before I knew you.  It may be that there may be
for you still suffering that I may not prevent, endurance that I may not
shorten; but what a man can do is yours.  Not Hell itself will stop me,
if it be possible that I may win through its torments with you in my
arms!"

"Will nothing stop you, then?"  Her question was breathed as softly as
the strain of an AEolian harp.

"Nothing!" I said, and I heard my own teeth snap together.  There was
something speaking within me stronger than I had ever known myself to be.
Again came a query, trembling, quavering, quivering, as though the issue
was of more than life or death:

"Not this?"  She held up a corner of the shroud, and as she saw my face
and realized the answer before I spoke, went on: "With all it implies?"

"Not if it were wrought of the cerecloths of the damned!"  There was a
long pause.  Her voice was more resolute when she spoke again.  It rang.
Moreover, there was in it a joyous note, as of one who feels new hope:

"But do you know what men say?  Some of them, that I am dead and buried;
others, that I am not only dead and buried, but that I am one of those
unhappy beings that may not die the common death of man.  Who live on a
fearful life-in-death, whereby they are harmful to all.  Those unhappy
Un-dead whom men call Vampires--who live on the blood of the living, and
bring eternal damnation as well as death with the poison of their
dreadful kisses!

"I know what men say sometimes," I answered.  "But I know also what my
own heart says; and I rather choose to obey its calling than all the
voices of the living or the dead.  Come what may, I am pledged to you.
If it be that your old life has to be rewon for you out of the very jaws
of Death and Hell, I shall keep the faith I have pledged, and that here I
pledge again!"  As I finished speaking I sank on my knees at her feet,
and, putting my arms round her, drew her close to me.  Her tears rained
down on my face as she stroked my hair with her soft, strong hand and
whispered to me:

"This is indeed to be one.  What more holy marriage can God give to any
of His creatures?"  We were both silent for a time.

I think I was the first to recover my senses.  That I did so was manifest
by my asking her: "When may we meet again?"--a thing I had never
remembered doing at any of our former partings.  She answered with a
rising and falling of the voice that was just above a whisper, as soft
and cooing as the voice of a pigeon:

"That will be soon--as soon as I can manage it, be sure.  My dear, my
dear!"  The last four words of endearment she spoke in a low but
prolonged and piercing tone which made me thrill with delight.

"Give me some token," I said, "that I may have always close to me to ease
my aching heart till we meet again, and ever after, for love's sake!"
Her mind seemed to leap to understanding, and with a purpose all her own.
Stooping for an instant, she tore off with swift, strong fingers a
fragment of her shroud.  This, having kissed it, she handed to me,
whispering:

"It is time that we part.  You must leave me now.  Take this, and keep it
for ever.  I shall be less unhappy in my terrible loneliness whilst it
lasts if I know that this my gift, which for good or ill is a part of me
as you know me, is close to you.  It may be, my very dear, that some day
you may be glad and even proud of this hour, as I am."  She kissed me as
I took it.

"For life or death, I care not which, so long as I am with you!" I said,
as I moved off.  Descending the Jacob's ladder, I made my way down the
rock-hewn passage.

The last thing I saw was the beautiful face of my Lady of the Shroud as
she leaned over the edge of the opening.  Her eyes were like glowing
stars as her looks followed me.  That look shall never fade from my
memory.

After a few agitating moments of thought I half mechanically took my way
down to the garden.  Opening the grille, I entered my lonely room, which
looked all the more lonely for the memory of the rapturous moments under
the Flagstaff.  I went to bed as one in a dream.  There I lay till
sunrise--awake and thinking.




BOOK V: A RITUAL AT MIDNIGHT


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                          _June_ 20, 1907.

The time has gone as quickly as work can effect since I saw my Lady.  As
I told the mountaineers, Rooke, whom I had sent on the service, had made
a contract for fifty thousand Ingis-Malbron rifles, and as many tons of
ammunition as the French experts calculated to be a full supply for a
year of warfare.  I heard from him by our secret telegraph code that the
order had been completed, and that the goods were already on the way.
The morning after the meeting at the Flagstaff I had word that at night
the vessel--one chartered by Rooke for the purpose--would arrive at
Vissarion during the night.  We were all expectation.  I had always now
in the Castle a signalling party, the signals being renewed as fast as
the men were sufficiently expert to proceed with their practice alone or
in groups.  We hoped that every fighting-man in the country would in time
become an expert signaller.  Beyond these, again, we have always a few
priests.  The Church of the country is a militant Church; its priests are
soldiers, its Bishops commanders.  But they all serve wherever the battle
most needs them.  Naturally they, as men of brains, are quicker at
learning than the average mountaineers; with the result that they learnt
the code and the signalling almost by instinct.  We have now at least one
such expert in each community of them, and shortly the priests alone will
be able to signal, if need be, for the nation; thus releasing for active
service the merely fighting-man.  The men at present with me I took into
confidence as to the vessel's arrival, and we were all ready for work
when the man on the lookout at the Flagstaff sent word that a vessel
without lights was creeping in towards shore.  We all assembled on the
rocky edge of the creek, and saw her steal up the creek and gain the
shelter of the harbour.  When this had been effected, we ran out the boom
which protects the opening, and after that the great armoured
sliding-gates which Uncle Roger had himself had made so as to protect the
harbour in case of need.

We then came within and assisted in warping the steamer to the side of
the dock.

Rooke looked fit, and was full of fire and vigour.  His responsibility
and the mere thought of warlike action seemed to have renewed his youth.

When we had arranged for the unloading of the cases of arms and
ammunition, I took Rooke into the room which we call my "office," where
he gave me an account of his doings.  He had not only secured the rifles
and the ammunition for them, but he had purchased from one of the small
American Republics an armoured yacht which had been especially built for
war service.  He grew quite enthusiastic, even excited, as he told me of
her:

"She is the last word in naval construction--a torpedo yacht.  A small
cruiser, with turbines up to date, oil-fuelled, and fully armed with the
latest and most perfect weapons and explosives of all kinds.  The fastest
boat afloat to-day.  Built by Thorneycroft, engined by Parsons, armoured
by Armstrong, armed by Crupp.  If she ever comes into action, it will be
bad for her opponent, for she need not fear to tackle anything less than
a _Dreadnought_."

He also told me that from the same Government, whose nation had just
established an unlooked-for peace, he had also purchased a whole park of
artillery of the very latest patterns, and that for range and accuracy
the guns were held to be supreme.  These would follow before long, and
with them their proper ammunition, with a shipload of the same to follow
shortly after.

When he had told me all the rest of his news, and handed me the accounts,
we went out to the dock to see the debarkation of the war material.
Knowing that it was arriving, I had sent word in the afternoon to the
mountaineers to tell them to come and remove it.  They had answered the
call, and it really seemed to me that the whole of the land must that
night have been in motion.

They came as individuals, grouping themselves as they came within the
defences of the Castle; some had gathered at fixed points on the way.
They went secretly and in silence, stealing through the forests like
ghosts, each party when it grouped taking the place of that which had
gone on one of the routes radiating round Vissarion.  Their coming and
going was more than ghostly.  It was, indeed, the outward manifestation
of an inward spirit--a whole nation dominated by one common purpose.

The men in the steamer were nearly all engineers, mostly British, well
conducted, and to be depended upon.  Rooke had picked them separately,
and in the doing had used well his great experience of both men and
adventurous life.  These men were to form part of the armoured yacht's
crew when she should come into the Mediterranean waters.  They and the
priests and fighting-men in the Castle worked well together, and with a
zeal that was beyond praise.  The heavy cases seemed almost of their own
accord to leave the holds, so fast came the procession of them along the
gangways from deck to dock-wall.  It was a part of my design that the
arms should be placed in centres ready for local distribution.  In such a
country as this, without railways or even roads, the distribution of war
material in any quantity is a great labour, for it has to be done
individually, or at least from centres.

But of this work the great number of mountaineers who were arriving made
little account.  As fast as the ship's company, with the assistance of
the priests and fighting-men, placed the cases on the quay, the engineers
opened them and laid the contents ready for portage.  The mountaineers
seemed to come in a continuous stream; each in turn shouldered his burden
and passed out, the captain of his section giving him as he passed his
instruction where to go and in what route.  The method had been already
prepared in my office ready for such a distribution when the arms should
arrive, and descriptions and quantities had been noted by the captains.
The whole affair was treated by all as a matter of the utmost secrecy.
Hardly a word was spoken beyond the necessary directions, and these were
given in whispers.  All night long the stream of men went and came, and
towards dawn the bulk of the imported material was lessened by half.  On
the following night the remainder was removed, after my own men had
stored in the Castle the rifles and ammunition reserved for its defence
if necessary.  It was advisable to keep a reserve supply in case it
should ever be required.  The following night Rooke went away secretly in
the chartered vessel.  He had to bring back with him the purchased cannon
and heavy ammunition, which had been in the meantime stored on one of the
Greek islands.  The second morning, having had secret word that the
steamer was on the way, I had given the signal for the assembling of the
mountaineers.

A little after dark the vessel, showing no light, stole into the creek.
The barrier gates were once again closed, and when a sufficient number of
men had arrived to handle the guns, we began to unload.  The actual
deportation was easy enough, for the dock had all necessary appliances
quite up to date, including a pair of shears for gun-lifting which could
be raised into position in a very short time.

The guns were well furnished with tackle of all sorts, and before many
hours had passed a little procession of them disappeared into the woods
in ghostly silence.  A number of men surrounded each, and they moved as
well as if properly supplied with horses.

In the meantime, and for a week after the arrival of the guns, the
drilling went on without pause.  The gun-drill was wonderful.  In the
arduous work necessary for it the great strength and stamina of the
mountaineers showed out wonderfully.  They did not seem to know fatigue
any more than they knew fear.

For a week this went on, till a perfect discipline and management was
obtained.  They did not practise the shooting, for this would have made
secrecy impossible.  It was reported all along the Turkish frontier that
the Sultan's troops were being massed, and though this was not on a war
footing, the movement was more or less dangerous.  The reports of our own
spies, although vague as to the purpose and extent of the movement, were
definite as to something being on foot.  And Turkey does not do something
without a purpose that bodes ill to someone.  Certainly the sound of
cannon, which is a far-reaching sound, would have given them warning of
our preparations, and would so have sadly minimized their effectiveness.

When the cannon had all been disposed of--except, of course, those
destined for defence of the Castle or to be stored there--Rooke went away
with the ship and crew.  The ship he was to return to the owners; the men
would be shipped on the war-yacht, of whose crew they would form a part.
The rest of them had been carefully selected by Rooke himself, and were
kept in secrecy at Cattaro, ready for service the moment required.  They
were all good men, and quite capable of whatever work they might be set
to.  So Rooke told me, and he ought to know.  The experience of his young
days as a private made him an expert in such a job.

                                                          _June_ 24, 1907.

Last night I got from my Lady a similar message to the last, and
delivered in a similar way.  This time, however, our meeting was to be on
the leads of the Keep.

I dressed myself very carefully before going on this adventure, lest by
any chance of household concern, any of the servants should see me; for
if this should happen, Aunt Janet would be sure to hear of it, which
would give rise to endless surmises and questionings--a thing I was far
from desiring.

I confess that in thinking the matter over during the time I was making
my hurried preparations I was at a loss to understand how any human body,
even though it be of the dead, could go or be conveyed to such a place
without some sort of assistance, or, at least, collusion, on the part of
some of the inmates.  At the visit to the Flagstaff circumstances were
different.  This spot was actually outside the Castle, and in order to
reach it I myself had to leave the Castle privately, and from the garden
ascend to the ramparts.  But here was no such possibility.  The Keep was
an _imperium in imperio_.  It stood within the Castle, though separated
from it, and it had its own defences against intrusion.  The roof of it
was, so far as I knew, as little approachable as the magazine.

The difficulty did not, however, trouble me beyond a mere passing
thought.  In the joy of the coming meeting and the longing rapture at the
mere thought of it, all difficulties disappeared.  Love makes its own
faith, and I never doubted that my Lady would be waiting for me at the
place designated.  When I had passed through the little arched passages,
and up the doubly-grated stairways contrived in the massiveness of the
walls, I let myself out on the leads.  It was well that as yet the times
were sufficiently peaceful not to necessitate guards or sentries at all
such points.

There, in a dim corner where the moonlight and the passing clouds threw
deep shadows, I saw her, clothed as ever in her shroud.  Why, I know not.
I felt somehow that the situation was even more serious than ever.  But I
was steeled to whatever might come.  My mind had been already made up.
To carry out my resolve to win the woman I loved I was ready to face
death.  But now, after we had for a few brief moments held each other in
our arms, I was willing to accept death--or more than death.  Now, more
than before, was she sweet and dear to me.  Whatever qualms there might
have been at the beginning of our love-making, or during the progress of
it, did not now exist.  We had exchanged vows and confidences, and
acknowledged our loves.  What, then, could there be of distrust, or even
doubt, that the present might not set at naught?  But even had there been
such doubts or qualms, they must have disappeared in the ardour of our
mutual embrace.  I was by now mad for her, and was content to be so mad.
When she had breath to speak after the strictness of our embrace, she
said:

"I have come to warn you to be more than ever careful."  It was, I
confess, a pang to me, who thought only of love, to hear that anything
else should have been the initiative power of her coming, even though it
had been her concern for my own safety.  I could not but notice the
bitter note of chagrin in my voice as I answered:

"It was for love's sake that _I_ came."  She, too, evidently felt the
undercurrent of pain, for she said quickly:

"Ah, dearest, I, too, came for love's sake.  It is because I love you
that I am so anxious about you.  What would the world--ay, or heaven--be
to me without you?"

There was such earnest truth in her tone that the sense and realization
of my own harshness smote me.  In the presence of such love as this even
a lover's selfishness must become abashed.  I could not express myself in
words, so simply raised her slim hand in mine and kissed it.  As it lay
warm in my own I could not but notice, as well as its fineness, its
strength and the firmness of its clasp.  Its warmth and fervour struck
into my heart--and my brain.  Thereupon I poured out to her once more my
love for her, she listening all afire.  When passion had had its say, the
calmer emotions had opportunity of expression.  When I was satisfied
afresh of her affection, I began to value her care for my safety, and so
I went back to the subject.  Her very insistence, based on personal
affection, gave me more solid ground for fear.  In the moment of love
transports I had forgotten, or did not think, of what wonderful power or
knowledge she must have to be able to move in such strange ways as she
did.  Why, at this very moment she was within my own gates.  Locks and
bars, even the very seal of death itself, seemed unable to make for her a
prison-house.  With such freedom of action and movement, going when she
would into secret places, what might she not know that was known to
others?  How could anyone keep secret from such an one even an ill
intent?  Such thoughts, such surmises, had often flashed through my mind
in moments of excitement rather than of reflection, but never long enough
to become fixed into belief.  But yet the consequences, the convictions,
of them were with me, though unconsciously, though the thoughts
themselves were perhaps forgotten or withered before development.

"And you?" I asked her earnestly.  "What about danger to you?"  She
smiled, her little pearl-white teeth gleaming in the moonlight, as she
spoke:

"There is no danger for me.  I am safe.  I am the safest person, perhaps
the only safe person, in all this land."  The full significance of her
words did not seem to come to me all at once.  Some base for
understanding such an assertion seemed to be wanting.  It was not that I
did not trust or believe her, but that I thought she might be mistaken.
I wanted to reassure myself, so in my distress I asked unthinkingly:

"How the safest?  What is your protection?"  For several moments that
spun themselves out endlessly she looked me straight in the face, the
stars in her eyes seeming to glow like fire; then, lowering her head, she
took a fold of her shroud and held it up to me.

"This!"

The meaning was complete and understandable now.  I could not speak at
once for the wave of emotion which choked me.  I dropped on my knees, and
taking her in my arms, held her close to me.  She saw that I was moved,
and tenderly stroked my hair, and with delicate touch pressed down my
head on her bosom, as a mother might have done to comfort a frightened
child.

Presently we got back to the realities of life again.  I murmured:

"Your safety, your life, your happiness are all-in-all to me.  When will
you let them be my care?"  She trembled in my arms, nestling even closer
to me.  Her own arms seemed to quiver with delight as she said:

"Would you indeed like me to be always with you?  To me it would be a
happiness unspeakable; and to you, what would it be?"

I thought that she wished to hear me speak my love to her, and that,
woman-like, she had led me to the utterance, and so I spoke again of the
passion that now raged in me, she listening eagerly as we strained each
other tight in our arms.  At last there came a pause, a long, long pause,
and our hearts beat consciously in unison as we stood together.
Presently she said in a sweet, low, intense whisper, as soft as the
sighing of summer wind:

"It shall be as you wish; but oh, my dear, you will have to first go
through an ordeal which may try you terribly!  Do not ask me anything!
You must not ask, because I may not answer, and it would be pain to me to
deny you anything.  Marriage with such an one as I am has its own ritual,
which may not be foregone.  It may . . . "  I broke passionately into her
speaking:

"There is no ritual that I fear, so long as it be that it is for your
good, and your lasting happiness.  And if the end of it be that I may
call you mine, there is no horror in life or death that I shall not
gladly face.  Dear, I ask you nothing.  I am content to leave myself in
your hands.  You shall advise me when the time comes, and I shall be
satisfied, content to obey.  Content!  It is but a poor word to express
what I long for!  I shall shirk nothing which may come to me from this or
any other world, so long as it is to make you mine!"  Once again her
murmured happiness was music to my ears:

"Oh, how you love me! how you love me, dear, dear!"  She took me in her
arms, and for a few seconds we hung together.  Suddenly she tore herself
apart from me, and stood drawn up to the full height, with a dignity I
cannot describe or express.  Her voice had a new dominance, as with firm
utterance and in staccato manner she said:

"Rupert Sent Leger, before we go a step further I must say something to
you, ask you something, and I charge you, on your most sacred honour and
belief, to answer me truly.  Do you believe me to be one of those unhappy
beings who may not die, but have to live in shameful existence between
earth and the nether world, and whose hellish mission is to destroy, body
and soul, those who love them till they fall to their level?  You are a
gentleman, and a brave one.  I have found you fearless.  Answer me in
sternest truth, no matter what the issue may be!"

She stood there in the glamorous moonlight with a commanding dignity
which seemed more than human.  In that mystic light her white shroud
seemed diaphanous, and she appeared like a spirit of power.  What was I
to say?  How could I admit to such a being that I had actually had at
moments, if not a belief, a passing doubt?  It was a conviction with me
that if I spoke wrongly I should lose her for ever.  I was in a desperate
strait.  In such a case there is but one solid ground which one may rest
on--the Truth.

I really felt I was between the devil and the deep sea.  There was no
avoiding the issue, and so, out of this all-embracing, all-compelling
conviction of truth, I spoke.

For a fleeting moment I felt that my tone was truculent, and almost
hesitated; but as I saw no anger or indignation on my Lady's face, but
rather an eager approval, I was reassured.  A woman, after all, is glad
to see a man strong, for all belief in him must be based on that.

"I shall speak the truth.  Remember that I have no wish to hurt your
feelings, but as you conjure me by my honour, you must forgive me if I
pain.  It is true that I had at first--ay, and later, when I came to
think matters over after you had gone, when reason came to the aid of
impression--a passing belief that you are a Vampire.  How can I fail to
have, even now, though I love you with all my soul, though I have held
you in my arms and kissed you on the mouth, a doubt, when all the
evidences seem to point to one thing?  Remember that I have only seen you
at night, except that bitter moment when, in the broad noonday of the
upper world, I saw you, clad as ever in a shroud, lying seemingly dead in
a tomb in the crypt of St. Sava's Church . . . But let that pass.  Such
belief as I have is all in you.  Be you woman or Vampire, it is all the
same to me.  It is _you_ whom I love!  Should it be that you are--you are
not woman, which I cannot believe, then it will be my glory to break your
fetters, to open your prison, and set you free.  To that I consecrate my
life."  For a few seconds I stood silent, vibrating with the passion
which had been awakened in me.  She had by now lost the measure of her
haughty isolation, and had softened into womanhood again.  It was really
like a realization of the old theme of Pygmalion's statue.  It was with
rather a pleading than a commanding voice that she said:

"And shall you always be true to me?"

"Always--so help me, God!" I answered, and I felt that there could be no
lack of conviction in my voice.

Indeed, there was no cause for such lack.  She also stood for a little
while stone-still, and I was beginning to expand to the rapture which was
in store for me when she should take me again in her arms.

But there was no such moment of softness.  All at once she started as if
she had suddenly wakened from a dream, and on the spur of the moment
said:

"Now go, go!"  I felt the conviction of necessity to obey, and turned at
once.  As I moved towards the door by which I had entered, I asked:

"When shall I see you again?"

"Soon!" came her answer.  "I shall let you know soon--when and where.
Oh, go, go!"  She almost pushed me from her.

When I had passed through the low doorway and locked and barred it behind
me, I felt a pang that I should have had to shut her out like that; but I
feared lest there should arise some embarrassing suspicion if the door
should be found open.  Later came the comforting thought that, as she had
got to the roof though the door had been shut, she would be able to get
away by the same means.  She had evidently knowledge of some secret way
into the Castle.  The alternative was that she must have some
supernatural quality or faculty which gave her strange powers.  I did not
wish to pursue that train of thought, and so, after an effort, shut it
out from my mind.

When I got back to my room I locked the door behind me, and went to sleep
in the dark.  I did not want light just then--could not bear it.

This morning I woke, a little later than usual, with a kind of
apprehension which I could not at once understand.  Presently, however,
when my faculties became fully awake and in working order, I realized
that I feared, half expected, that Aunt Janet would come to me in a worse
state of alarm than ever apropos of some new Second-Sight experience of
more than usual ferocity.

But, strange to say, I had no such visit.  Later on in the morning, when,
after breakfast, we walked together through the garden, I asked her how
she had slept, and if she had dreamt.  She answered me that she had slept
without waking, and if she had had any dreams, they must have been
pleasant ones, for she did not remember them.  "And you know, Rupert,"
she added, "that if there be anything bad or fearsome or warning in
dreams, I always remember them."

Later still, when I was by myself on the cliff beyond the creek, I could
not help commenting on the absence of her power of Second Sight on the
occasion.  Surely, if ever there was a time when she might have had cause
of apprehension, it might well have been when I asked the Lady whom she
did not know to marry me--the Lady of whose identity I knew nothing, even
whose name I did not know--whom I loved with all my heart and soul--my
Lady of the Shroud.

I have lost faith in Second Sight.

                                                           _July_ 1, 1907.

Another week gone.  I have waited patiently, and I am at last rewarded by
another letter.  I was preparing for bed a little while ago, when I heard
the same mysterious sound at the door as on the last two occasions.  I
hurried to the glass door, and there found another close-folded letter.
But I could see no sign of my Lady, or of any other living being.  The
letter, which was without direction, ran as follows:

"If you are still of the same mind, and feel no misgivings, meet me at
the Church of St. Sava beyond the Creek to-morrow night at a quarter
before midnight.  If you come, come in secret, and, of course, alone.  Do
not come at all unless you are prepared for a terrible ordeal.  But if
you love me, and have neither doubts nor fears, come.  Come!"

Needless to say, I did not sleep last night.  I tried to, but without
success.  It was no morbid happiness that kept me awake, no doubting, no
fear.  I was simply overwhelmed with the idea of the coming rapture when
I should call my Lady my very, very own.  In this sea of happy
expectation all lesser things were submerged.  Even sleep, which is an
imperative force with me, failed in its usual effectiveness, and I lay
still, calm, content.

With the coming of the morning, however, restlessness began.  I did not
know what to do, how to restrain myself, where to look for an anodyne.
Happily the latter came in the shape of Rooke, who turned up shortly
after breakfast.  He had a satisfactory tale to tell me of the armoured
yacht, which had lain off Cattaro on the previous night, and to which he
had brought his contingent of crew which had waited for her coming.  He
did not like to take the risk of going into any port with such a vessel,
lest he might be detained or otherwise hampered by forms, and had gone
out upon the open sea before daylight.  There was on board the yacht a
tiny torpedo-boat, for which provision was made both for hoisting on deck
and housing there.  This last would run into the creek at ten o'clock
that evening, at which time it would be dark.  The yacht would then run
to near Otranto, to which she would send a boat to get any message I
might send.  This was to be in a code, which we arranged, and would
convey instructions as to what night and approximate hour the yacht would
come to the creek.

The day was well on before we had made certain arrangements for the
future; and not till then did I feel again the pressure of my personal
restlessness.  Rooke, like a wise commander, took rest whilst he could.
Well he knew that for a couple of days and nights at least there would be
little, if any, sleep for him.

For myself, the habit of self-control stood to me, and I managed to get
through the day somehow without exciting the attention of anyone else.
The arrival of the torpedo-boat and the departure of Rooke made for me a
welcome break in my uneasiness.  An hour ago I said good-night to Aunt
Janet, and shut myself up alone here.  My watch is on the table before
me, so that I may make sure of starting to the moment.  I have allowed
myself half an hour to reach St. Sava.  My skiff is waiting, moored at
the foot of the cliff on the hither side, where the zigzag comes close to
the water.  It is now ten minutes past eleven.

I shall add the odd five minutes to the time for my journey so as to make
safe.  I go unarmed and without a light.

I shall show no distrust of anyone or anything this night.

                                                           _July_ 2, 1907.

When I was outside the church, I looked at my watch in the bright
moonlight, and found I had one minute to wait.  So I stood in the shadow
of the doorway and looked out at the scene before me.  Not a sign of life
was visible around me, either on land or sea.  On the broad plateau on
which the church stands there was no movement of any kind.  The wind,
which had been pleasant in the noontide, had fallen completely, and not a
leaf was stirring.  I could see across the creek and note the hard line
where the battlements of the Castle cut the sky, and where the keep
towered above the line of black rock, which in the shadow of the land
made an ebon frame for the picture.  When I had seen the same view on
former occasions, the line where the rock rose from the sea was a fringe
of white foam.  But then, in the daylight, the sea was sapphire blue; now
it was an expanse of dark blue--so dark as to seem almost black.  It had
not even the relief of waves or ripples--simply a dark, cold, lifeless
expanse, with no gleam of light anywhere, of lighthouse or ship; neither
was there any special sound to be heard that one could
distinguish--nothing but the distant hum of the myriad voices of the dark
mingling in one ceaseless inarticulate sound.  It was well I had not time
to dwell on it, or I might have reached some spiritually-disturbing
melancholy.

Let me say here that ever since I had received my Lady's message
concerning this visit to St. Sava's I had been all on fire--not, perhaps,
at every moment consciously or actually so, but always, as it were,
prepared to break out into flame.  Did I want a simile, I might compare
myself to a well-banked furnace, whose present function it is to contain
heat rather than to create it; whose crust can at any moment be broken by
a force external to itself, and burst into raging, all-compelling heat.
No thought of fear really entered my mind.  Every other emotion there
was, coming and going as occasion excited or lulled, but not fear.  Well
I knew in the depths of my heart the purpose which that secret quest was
to serve.  I knew not only from my Lady's words, but from the teachings
of my own senses and experiences, that some dreadful ordeal must take
place before happiness of any kind could be won.  And that ordeal, though
method or detail was unknown to me, I was prepared to undertake.  This
was one of those occasions when a man must undertake, blindfold, ways
that may lead to torture or death, or unknown terrors beyond.  But, then,
a man--if, indeed, he have the heart of a man--can always undertake; he
can at least make the first step, though it may turn out that through the
weakness of mortality he may be unable to fulfil his own intent, or
justify his belief in his own powers.  Such, I take it, was the
intellectual attitude of the brave souls who of old faced the tortures of
the Inquisition.

But though there was no immediate fear, there was a certain doubt.  For
doubt is one of those mental conditions whose calling we cannot control.
The end of the doubting may not be a reality to us, or be accepted as a
possibility.  These things cannot forego the existence of the doubt.
"For even if a man," says Victor Cousin, "doubt everything else, at least
he cannot doubt that he doubts."  The doubt had at times been on me that
my Lady of the Shroud was a Vampire.  Much that had happened seemed to
point that way, and here, on the very threshold of the Unknown, when,
through the door which I was pushing open, my eyes met only an expanse of
absolute blackness, all doubts which had ever been seemed to surround me
in a legion.  I have heard that, when a man is drowning, there comes a
time when his whole life passes in review during the space of time which
cannot be computed as even a part of a second.  So it was to me in the
moment of my body passing into the church.  In that moment came to my
mind all that had been, which bore on the knowledge of my Lady; and the
general tendency was to prove or convince that she was indeed a Vampire.
Much that had happened, or become known to me, seemed to justify the
resolving of doubt into belief.  Even my own reading of the books in Aunt
Janet's little library, and the dear lady's comments on them, mingled
with her own uncanny beliefs, left little opening for doubt.  My having
to help my Lady over the threshold of my house on her first entry was in
accord with Vampire tradition; so, too, her flying at cock-crow from the
warmth in which she revelled on that strange first night of our meeting;
so, too, her swift departure at midnight on the second.  Into the same
category came the facts of her constant wearing of her Shroud, even her
pledging herself, and me also, on the fragment torn from it, which she
had given to me as a souvenir; her lying still in the glass-covered tomb;
her coming alone to the most secret places in a fortified Castle where
every aperture was secured by unopened locks and bolts; her very
movements, though all of grace, as she flitted noiselessly through the
gloom of night.

All these things, and a thousand others of lesser import, seemed, for the
moment, to have consolidated an initial belief.  But then came the
supreme recollections of how she had lain in my arms; of her kisses on my
lips; of the beating of her heart against my own; of her sweet words of
belief and faith breathed in my ear in intoxicating whispers; of . . . I
paused.  No!  I could not accept belief as to her being other than a
living woman of soul and sense, of flesh and blood, of all the sweet and
passionate instincts of true and perfect womanhood.

And so, in spite of all--in spite of all beliefs, fixed or transitory,
with a mind whirling amid contesting forces and compelling beliefs--I
stepped into the church overwhelmed with that most receptive of
atmospheres--doubt.

In one thing only was I fixed: here at least was no doubt or misgiving
whatever.  I intended to go through what I had undertaken.  Moreover, I
felt that I was strong enough to carry out my intention, whatever might
be of the Unknown--however horrible, however terrible.

When I had entered the church and closed the heavy door behind me, the
sense of darkness and loneliness in all their horror enfolded me round.
The great church seemed a living mystery, and served as an almost
terrible background to thoughts and remembrances of unutterable gloom.
My adventurous life has had its own schooling to endurance and upholding
one's courage in trying times; but it has its contra in fulness of
memory.

I felt my way forward with both hands and feet.  Every second seemed as
if it had brought me at last to a darkness which was actually tangible.
All at once, and with no heed of sequence or order, I was conscious of
all around me, the knowledge or perception of which--or even speculation
on the subject--had never entered my mind.  They furnished the darkness
with which I was encompassed with all the crowded phases of a dream.  I
knew that all around me were memorials of the dead--that in the Crypt
deep-wrought in the rock below my feet lay the dead themselves.  Some of
them, perhaps--one of them I knew--had even passed the grim portals of
time Unknown, and had, by some mysterious power or agency, come back
again to material earth.  There was no resting-place for thought when I
knew that the very air which I breathed might be full of denizens of the
spirit-world.  In that impenetrable blackness was a world of imagining
whose possibilities of horror were endless.

I almost fancied that I could see with mortal eyes down through that
rocky floor to where, in the lonely Crypt, lay, in her tomb of massive
stone and under that bewildering coverlet of glass, the woman whom I
love.  I could see her beautiful face, her long black lashes, her sweet
mouth--which I had kissed--relaxed in the sleep of death.  I could note
the voluminous shroud--a piece of which as a precious souvenir lay even
then so close to my heart--the snowy woollen coverlet wrought over in
gold with sprigs of pine, the soft dent in the cushion on which her head
must for so long have lain.  I could see myself--within my eyes the
memory of that first visit--coming once again with glad step to renew
that dear sight--dear, though it scorched my eyes and harrowed my
heart--and finding the greater sorrow, the greater desolation of the
empty tomb!

There!  I felt that I must think no more of that lest the thought should
unnerve me when I should most want all my courage.  That way madness lay!
The darkness had already sufficient terrors of its own without bringing
to it such grim remembrances and imaginings . . . And I had yet to go
through some ordeal which, even to her who had passed and repassed the
portals of death, was full of fear.

It was a merciful relief to me when, in groping my way forwards through
the darkness, I struck against some portion of the furnishing of the
church.  Fortunately I was all strung up to tension, else I should never
have been able to control instinctively, as I did, the shriek which was
rising to my lips.

I would have given anything to have been able to light even a match.  A
single second of light would, I felt, have made me my own man again.  But
I knew that this would be against the implied condition of my being there
at all, and might have had disastrous consequences to her whom I had come
to save.  It might even frustrate my scheme, and altogether destroy my
opportunity.  At that moment it was borne upon me more strongly than ever
that this was not a mere fight for myself or my own selfish purposes--not
merely an adventure or a struggle for only life and death against unknown
difficulties and dangers.  It was a fight on behalf of her I loved, not
merely for her life, but perhaps even for her soul.

And yet this very thinking--understanding--created a new form of terror.
For in that grim, shrouding darkness came memories of other moments of
terrible stress.

Of wild, mystic rites held in the deep gloom of African forests, when,
amid scenes of revolting horror, Obi and the devils of his kind seemed to
reveal themselves to reckless worshippers, surfeited with horror, whose
lives counted for naught; when even human sacrifice was an episode, and
the reek of old deviltries and recent carnage tainted the air, till even
I, who was, at the risk of my life, a privileged spectator who had come
through dangers without end to behold the scene, rose and fled in horror.

Of scenes of mystery enacted in rock-cut temples beyond the Himalayas,
whose fanatic priests, cold as death and as remorseless, in the reaction
of their phrenzy of passion, foamed at the mouth and then sank into
marble quiet, as with inner eyes they beheld the visions of the hellish
powers which they had invoked.

Of wild, fantastic dances of the Devil-worshippers of Madagascar, where
even the very semblance of humanity disappeared in the fantastic excesses
of their orgies.

Of strange doings of gloom and mystery in the rock-perched monasteries of
Thibet.

Of awful sacrifices, all to mystic ends, in the innermost recesses of
Cathay.

Of weird movements with masses of poisonous snakes by the medicine-men of
the Zuni and Mochi Indians in the far south-west of the Rockies, beyond
the great plains.

Of secret gatherings in vast temples of old Mexico, and by dim altars of
forgotten cities in the heart of great forests in South America.

Of rites of inconceivable horror in the fastnesses of Patagonia.

Of . . . Here I once more pulled myself up.  Such thoughts were no kind
of proper preparation for what I might have to endure.  My work that
night was to be based on love, on hope, on self-sacrifice for the woman
who in all the world was the closest to my heart, whose future I was to
share, whether that sharing might lead me to Hell or Heaven.  The hand
which undertook such a task must have no trembling.

Still, those horrible memories had, I am bound to say, a useful part in
my preparation for the ordeal.  They were of fact which I had seen, of
which I had myself been in part a sharer, and which I had survived.  With
such experiences behind me, could there be aught before me more dreadful?
. . .

Moreover, if the coming ordeal was of supernatural or superhuman order,
could it transcend in living horror the vilest and most desperate acts of
the basest men? . . .

With renewed courage I felt my way before me, till my sense of touch told
me that I was at the screen behind which lay the stair to the Crypt.

There I waited, silent, still.

My own part was done, so far as I knew how to do it.  Beyond this, what
was to come was, so far as I knew, beyond my own control.  I had done
what I could; the rest must come from others.  I had exactly obeyed my
instructions, fulfilled my warranty to the utmost in my knowledge and
power.  There was, therefore, left for me in the present nothing but to
wait.

It is a peculiarity of absolute darkness that it creates its own
reaction.  The eye, wearied of the blackness, begins to imagine forms of
light.  How far this is effected by imagination pure and simple I know
not.  It may be that nerves have their own senses that bring thought to
the depository common to all the human functions, but, whatever may be
the mechanism or the objective, the darkness seems to people itself with
luminous entities.

So was it with me as I stood lonely in the dark, silent church.  Here and
there seemed to flash tiny points of light.

In the same way the silence began to be broken now and again by strange
muffled sounds--the suggestion of sounds rather than actual vibrations.
These were all at first of the minor importance of movement--rustlings,
creakings, faint stirrings, fainter breathings.  Presently, when I had
somewhat recovered from the sort of hypnotic trance to which the darkness
and stillness had during the time of waiting reduced me, I looked around
in wonder.

The phantoms of light and sound seemed to have become real.  There were
most certainly actual little points of light in places--not enough to see
details by, but quite sufficient to relieve the utter gloom.  I
thought--though it may have been a mingling of recollection and
imagination--that I could distinguish the outlines of the church;
certainly the great altar-screen was dimly visible.  Instinctively I
looked up--and thrilled.  There, hung high above me, was, surely enough,
a great Greek Cross, outlined by tiny points of light.

I lost myself in wonder, and stood still, in a purely receptive mood,
unantagonistic to aught, willing for whatever might come, ready for all
things, in rather a negative than a positive mood--a mood which has an
aspect of spiritual meekness.  This is the true spirit of the neophyte,
and, though I did not think of it at the time, the proper attitude for
what is called by the Church in whose temple I stood a "neo-nymph."

As the light grew a little in power, though never increasing enough for
distinctness, I saw dimly before me a table on which rested a great open
book, whereon were laid two rings--one of sliver, the other of gold--and
two crowns wrought of flowers, bound at the joining of their stems with
tissue--one of gold, the other of silver.  I do not know much of the
ritual of the old Greek Church, which is the religion of the Blue
Mountains, but the things which I saw before me could be none other than
enlightening symbols.  Instinctively I knew that I had been brought
hither, though in this grim way, to be married.  The very idea of it
thrilled me to the heart's core.  I thought the best thing I could do
would be to stay quite still, and not show surprise at anything that
might happen; but be sure I was all eyes and ears.

I peered anxiously around me in every direction, but I could see no sign
of her whom I had come to meet.

Incidentally, however, I noticed that in the lighting, such as it was,
there was no flame, no "living" light.  Whatever light there was came
muffled, as though through some green translucent stone.  The whole
effect was terribly weird and disconcerting.

Presently I started, as, seemingly out of the darkness beside me, a man's
hand stretched out and took mine.  Turning, I found close to me a tall
man with shining black eyes and long black hair and beard.  He was clad
in some kind of gorgeous robe of cloth of gold, rich with variety of
adornment.  His head was covered with a high, over-hanging hat draped
closely with a black scarf, the ends of which formed a long, hanging veil
on either side.  These veils, falling over the magnificent robes of cloth
of gold, had an extraordinarily solemn effect.

I yielded myself to the guiding hand, and shortly found myself, so far as
I could see, at one side of the sanctuary.

In the floor close to my feet was a yawning chasm, into which, from so
high over my head that in the uncertain light I could not distinguish its
origin, hung a chain.  At the sight a strange wave of memory swept over
me.  I could not but remember the chain which hung over the glass-covered
tomb in the Crypt, and I had an instinctive feeling that the grim chasm
in the floor of the sanctuary was but the other side of the opening in
the roof of the crypt from which the chain over the sarcophagus depended.

There was a creaking sound--the groaning of a windlass and the clanking
of a chain.  There was heavy breathing close to me somewhere.  I was so
intent on what was going on that I did not see that one by one, seeming
to grow out of the surrounding darkness, several black figures in monkish
garb appeared with the silence of ghosts.  Their faces were shrouded in
black cowls, wherein were holes through which I could see dark gleaming
eyes.  My guide held me tightly by the hand.  This gave me a feeling of
security in the touch which helped to retain within my breast some
semblance of calm.

The strain of the creaking windlass and the clanking chain continued for
so long that the suspense became almost unendurable.  At last there came
into sight an iron ring, from which as a centre depended four lesser
chains spreading wide.  In a few seconds more I could see that these were
fixed to the corners of the great stone tomb with the covering of glass,
which was being dragged upward.  As it arose it filled closely the whole
aperture.  When its bottom had reached the level of the floor it stopped,
and remained rigid.  There was no room for oscillation.  It was at once
surrounded by a number of black figures, who raised the glass covering
and bore it away into the darkness.  Then there stepped forward a very
tall man, black-bearded, and with head-gear like my guide, but made in
triple tiers, he also was gorgeously arrayed in flowing robes of cloth of
gold richly embroidered.  He raised his hand, and forthwith eight other
black-clad figures stepped forward, and bending over the stone coffin,
raised from it the rigid form of my Lady, still clad in her Shroud, and
laid it gently on the floor of the sanctuary.

I felt it a grace that at that instant the dim lights seemed to grow
less, and finally to disappear--all save the tiny points that marked the
outline of the great Cross high overhead.  These only gave light enough
to accentuate the gloom.  The hand that held mine now released it, and
with a sigh I realized that I was alone.  After a few moments more of the
groaning of the winch and clanking of the chain there was a sharp sound
of stone meeting stone; then there was silence.  I listened acutely, but
could not hear near me the slightest sound.  Even the cautious,
restrained breathing around me, of which up to then I had been conscious,
had ceased.  Not knowing, in the helplessness of my ignorance, what I
should do, I remained as I was, still and silent, for a time that seemed
endless.  At last, overcome by some emotion which I could not at the
moment understand, I slowly sank to my knees and bowed my head.  Covering
my face with my hands, I tried to recall the prayers of my youth.  It was
not, I am certain, that fear in any form had come upon me, or that I
hesitated or faltered in my intention.  That much I know now; I knew it
even then.  It was, I believe, that the prolonged impressive gloom and
mystery had at last touched me to the quick.  The bending of the knees
was but symbolical of the bowing of the spirit to a higher Power.  When I
had realized that much, I felt more content than I had done since I had
entered the church, and with the renewed consciousness of courage, took
my hands from my face, and lifted again my bowed head.

Impulsively I sprang to my feet and stood erect--waiting.  All seemed to
have changed since I had dropped on my knees.  The points of light about
time church, which had been eclipsed, had come again, and were growing in
power to a partial revealing of the dim expanse.  Before me was the table
with the open book, on which were laid the gold and silver rings and the
two crowns of flowers.  There were also two tall candles, with tiniest
flames of blue--the only living light to be seen.

Out of the darkness stepped the same tall figure in the gorgeous robes
and the triple hat.  He led by the hand my Lady, still clad in her
Shroud; but over it, descending from the crown of her head, was a veil of
very old and magnificent lace of astonishing fineness.  Even in that dim
light I could note the exquisite beauty of the fabric.  The veil was
fastened with a bunch of tiny sprays of orange-blossom mingled with
cypress and laurel--a strange combination.  In her hand she carried a
great bouquet of the same.  Its sweet intoxicating odour floated up to my
nostrils.  It and the sentiment which its very presence evoked made me
quiver.

Yielding to the guiding of the hand which held hers, she stood at my left
side before the table.  Her guide then took his place behind her.  At
either end of the table, to right and left of us, stood a long-bearded
priest in splendid robes, and wearing the hat with depending veil of
black.  One of them, who seemed to be the more important of the two, and
took the initiative, signed to us to put our right hands on the open
book.  My Lady, of course, understood the ritual, and knew the words
which the priest was speaking, and of her own accord put out her hand.
My guide at the same moment directed my hand to the same end.  It
thrilled me to touch my Lady's hand, even under such mysterious
conditions.

After the priest had signed us each thrice on the forehead with the sign
of the Cross, he gave to each of us a tiny lighted taper brought to him
for the purpose.  The lights were welcome, not so much for the solace of
the added light, great as that was, but because it allowed us to see a
little more of each other's faces.  It was rapture to me to see the face
of my Bride; and from the expression of her face I was assured that she
felt as I did.  It gave me an inexpressible pleasure when, as her eyes
rested on me, there grew a faint blush over the grey pallor of her
cheeks.

The priest then put in solemn voice to each of us in turn, beginning with
me, the questions of consent which are common to all such rituals.  I
answered as well as I could, following the murmured words of my guide.
My Lady answered out proudly in a voice which, though given softly,
seemed to ring.  It was a concern--even a grief--to me that I could not,
in the priest's questioning, catch her name, of which, strangely
enough,--I was ignorant.  But, as I did not know the language, and as the
phrases were not in accord literally with our own ritual, I could not
make out which word was the name.

After some prayers and blessings, rhythmically spoken or sung by an
invisible choir, the priest took the rings from the open book, and, after
signing my forehead thrice with the gold one as he repeated the blessing
in each case, placed it on my right hand; then he gave my Lady the silver
one, with the same ritual thrice repeated.  I suppose it was the blessing
which is the effective point in making two into one.

After this, those who stood behind us exchanged our rings thrice, taking
them from one finger and placing them on the other, so that at the end my
wife wore the gold ring and I the silver one.

Then came a chant, during which the priest swung the censer himself, and
my wife and I held our tapers.  After that he blessed us, the responses
coming from the voices of the unseen singers in the darkness.

After a long ritual of prayer and blessing, sung in triplicate, the
priest took the crowns of flowers, and put one on the head of each,
crowning me first, and with the crown tied with gold.  Then he signed and
blessed us each thrice.  The guides, who stood behind us, exchanged our
crowns thrice, as they had exchanged the rings; so that at the last, as I
was glad to see, my wife wore the crown of gold, and I that of silver.

Then there came, if it is possible to describe such a thing, a hush over
even that stillness, as though some form of added solemnity were to be
gone through.  I was not surprised, therefore, when the priest took in
his hands the great golden chalice.  Kneeling, my wife and I partook
together thrice.

When we had risen from our knees and stood for a little while, the priest
took my left hand in his right, and I, by direction of my guide, gave my
right hand to my wife.  And so in a line, the priest leading, we circled
round the table in rhythmic measure.  Those who supported us moved behind
us, holding the crowns over our heads, and replacing them when we
stopped.

After a hymn, sung through the darkness, the priest took off our crowns.
This was evidently the conclusion of the ritual, for the priest placed us
in each other's arms to embrace each other.  Then he blessed us, who were
now man and wife!

The lights went out at once, some as if extinguished, others slowly
fading down to blackness.

Left in the dark, my wife and I sought each other's arms again, and stood
together for a few moments heart to heart, tightly clasping each other,
and kissed each other fervently.

Instinctively we turned to the door of the church, which was slightly
open, so that we could see the moonlight stealing in through the
aperture.  With even steps, she holding me tightly by the left arm--which
is the wife's arm, we passed through the old church and out into the free
air.

Despite all that the gloom had brought me, it was sweet to be in the open
air and together--this quite apart from our new relations to each other.
The moon rode high, and the full light, coming after the dimness or
darkness in the church, seemed as bright as day.  I could now, for the
first time, see my wife's face properly.  The glamour of the moonlight
may have served to enhance its ethereal beauty, but neither moonlight nor
sunlight could do justice to that beauty in its living human splendour.
As I gloried in her starry eyes I could think of nothing else; but when
for a moment my eyes, roving round for the purpose of protection, caught
sight of her whole figure, there was a pang to my heart.  The brilliant
moonlight showed every detail in terrible effect, and I could see that
she wore only her Shroud.  In the moment of darkness, after the last
benediction, before she returned to my arms, she must have removed her
bridal veil.  This may, of course, have been in accordance with the
established ritual of her church; but, all the same, my heart was sore.
The glamour of calling her my very own was somewhat obscured by the
bridal adornment being shorn.  But it made no difference in her sweetness
to me.  Together we went along the path through the wood, she keeping
equal step with me in wifely way.

When we had come through the trees near enough to see the roof of the
Castle, now gilded with the moonlight, she stopped, and looking at me
with eyes full of love, said:

"Here I must leave you!"

"What?"  I was all aghast, and I felt that my chagrin was expressed in
the tone of horrified surprise in my voice.  She went on quickly:

"Alas!  It is impossible that I should go farther--at present!"

"But what is to prevent you?" I queried.  "You are now my wife.  This is
our wedding-night; and surely your place is with me!"  The wail in her
voice as she answered touched me to the quick:

"Oh, I know, I know!  There is no dearer wish in my heart--there can be
none--than to share my husband's home.  Oh, my dear, my dear, if you only
knew what it would be to me to be with you always!  But indeed I may
not--not yet!  I am not free!  If you but knew how much that which has
happened to-night has cost me--or how much cost to others as well as to
myself may be yet to come--you would understand.  Rupert"--it was the
first time she had ever addressed me by name, and naturally it thrilled
me through and through--"Rupert, my husband, only that I trust you with
all the faith which is in perfect love--mutual love, I dare not have done
what I have done this night.  But, dear, I know that you will bear me
out; that your wife's honour is your honour, even as your honour is mine.
My honour is given to this; and you can help me--the only help I can have
at present--by trusting me.  Be patient, my beloved, be patient!  Oh, be
patient for a little longer!  It shall not be for long.  So soon as ever
my soul is freed I shall come to you, my husband; and we shall never part
again.  Be content for a while!  Believe me that I love you with my very
soul; and to keep away from your dear side is more bitter for me than
even it can be for you!  Think, my dear one, I am not as other women are,
as some day you shall clearly understand.  I am at the present, and shall
be for a little longer, constrained by duties and obligations put upon me
by others, and for others, and to which I am pledged by the most sacred
promises--given not only by myself, but by others--and which I must not
forgo.  These forbid me to do as I wish.  Oh, trust me, my beloved--my
husband!"

She held out her hands appealingly.  The moonlight, falling through the
thinning forest, showed her white cerements.  Then the recollection of
all she must have suffered--the awful loneliness in that grim tomb in the
Crypt, the despairing agony of one who is helpless against the
unknown--swept over me in a wave of pity.  What could I do but save her
from further pain?  And this could only be by showing her my faith and
trust.  If she was to go back to that dreadful charnel-house, she would
at least take with her the remembrance that one who loved her and whom
she loved--to whom she had been lately bound in the mystery of
marriage--trusted her to the full.  I loved her more than myself--more
than my own soul; and I was moved by pity so great that all possible
selfishness was merged in its depths.  I bowed my head before her--my
Lady and my Wife--as I said:

"So be it, my beloved.  I trust you to the full, even as you trust me.
And that has been proven this night, even to my own doubting heart.  I
shall wait; and as I know you wish it, I shall wait as patiently as I
can.  But till you come to me for good and all, let me see you or hear
from you when you can.  The time, dear wife, must go heavily with me as I
think of you suffering and lonely.  So be good to me, and let not too
long a time elapse between my glimpses of hope.  And, sweetheart, when
you _do_ come to me, it shall be for ever!"  There was something in the
intonation of the last sentence--I felt its sincerity myself--some
implied yearning for a promise, that made her beautiful eyes swim.  The
glorious stars in them were blurred as she answered with a fervour which
seemed to me as more than earthly:

"For ever!  I swear it!"

With one long kiss, and a straining in each others arms, which left me
tingling for long after we had lost sight of each other, we parted.  I
stood and watched her as her white figure, gliding through the deepening
gloom, faded as the forest thickened.  It surely was no optical delusion
or a phantom of the mind that her shrouded arm was raised as though in
blessing or farewell before the darkness swallowed her up.




BOOK VI: THE PURSUIT IN THE FOREST


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                           _July_ 3, 1907.

There is no anodyne but work to pain of the heart; and my pain is all of
the heart.  I sometimes feel that it is rather hard that with so much to
make me happy I cannot know happiness.  How can I be happy when my wife,
whom I fondly love, and who I know loves me, is suffering in horror and
loneliness of a kind which is almost beyond human belief?  However, what
is my loss is my country's gain, for the Land of the Blue Mountains is my
country now, despite the fact that I am still a loyal subject of good
King Edward.  Uncle Roger took care of that when he said I should have
the consent of the Privy Council before I might be naturalized anywhere
else.

When I got home yesterday morning I naturally could not sleep.  The
events of the night and the bitter disappointment that followed my
exciting joy made such a thing impossible.  When I drew the curtain over
the window, the reflection of the sunrise was just beginning to tinge the
high-sailing clouds in front of me.  I laid down and tried to rest, but
without avail.  However, I schooled myself to lie still, and at last, if
I did not sleep, was at least quiescent.

Disturbed by a gentle tap at the door, I sprang up at once and threw on a
dressing gown.  Outside, when I opened the door, was Aunt Janet.  She was
holding a lighted candle in her hand, for though it was getting light in
the open, the passages were still dark.  When she saw me she seemed to
breathe more freely, and asked if she might come in.

Whilst she sat on the edge of my bed, in her old-time way, she said in a
hushed voice:

"Oh, laddie, laddie, I trust yer burden is no too heavy to bear."

"My burden!  What on earth do you mean, Aunt Janet?" I said in reply.  I
did not wish to commit myself by a definite answer, for it was evident
that she had been dreaming or Second Sighting again.  She replied with
the grim seriousness usual to her when she touched on occult matters:

"I saw your hairt bleeding, laddie.  I kent it was yours, though how I
kent it I don't know.  It lay on a stone floor in the dark, save for a
dim blue light such as corpse-lights are.  On it was placed a great book,
and close around were scattered many strange things, amongst them two
crowns o' flowers--the one bound wi' silver, the other wi' gold.  There
was also a golden cup, like a chalice, o'erturned.  The red wine trickled
from it an' mingled wi' yer hairt's bluid; for on the great book was some
vast dim weight wrapped up in black, and on it stepped in turn many men
all swathed in black.  An' as the weight of each came on it the bluid
gushed out afresh.  And oh, yer puir hairt, my laddie, was quick and
leaping, so that at every beat it raised the black-clad weight!  An' yet
that was not all, for hard by stood a tall imperial shape o' a woman, all
arrayed in white, wi' a great veil o' finest lace worn o'er a shrood.
An' she was whiter than the snow, an' fairer than the morn for beauty;
though a dark woman she was, wi' hair like the raven, an' eyes black as
the sea at nicht, an' there was stars in them.  An' at each beat o' yer
puir bleeding hairt she wrung her white hands, an' the manin' o' her
sweet voice rent my hairt in twain.  Oh, laddie, laddie! what does it
mean?"

I managed to murmur: "I'm sure I don't know, Aunt Janet.  I suppose it
was all a dream!"

"A dream it was, my dear.  A dream or a veesion, whilka matters nane, for
a' such are warnin's sent frae God . . . "  Suddenly she said in a
different voice:

"Laddie, hae ye been fause to any lassie?  I'm no blamin' ye.  For ye men
are different frae us women, an' yer regard on recht and wrang differs
from oors.  But oh, laddie, a woman's tears fa' heavy when her hairt is
for sair wi' the yieldin' to fause words.  'Tis a heavy burden for ony
man to carry wi' him as he goes, an' may well cause pain to ithers that
he fain would spare."  She stopped, and in dead silence waited for me to
speak.  I thought it would be best to set her poor loving heart at rest,
and as I could not divulge my special secret, spoke in general terms:

"Aunt Janet, I am a man, and have led a man's life, such as it is.  But I
can tell you, who have always loved me and taught me to be true, that in
all the world there is no woman who must weep for any falsity of mine.
If close there be any who, sleeping or waking, in dreams or visions or in
reality, weeps because of me, it is surely not for my doing, but because
of something outside me.  It may be that her heart is sore because I must
suffer, as all men must in some degree; but she does not weep for or
through any act of mine."

She sighed happily at my assurance, and looked up through her tears, for
she was much moved; and after tenderly kissing my forehead and blessing
me, stole away.  She was more sweet and tender than I have words to say,
and the only regret that I have in all that is gone is that I have not
been able to bring my wife to her, and let her share in the love she has
for me.  But that, too, will come, please God!

In the morning I sent a message to Rooke at Otranto, instructing him by
code to bring the yacht to Vissarion in the coming night.

All day I spent in going about amongst the mountaineers, drilling them
and looking after their arms.  I _could_ not stay still.  My only chance
of peace was to work, my only chance of sleep to tire myself out.
Unhappily, I am very strong, so even when I came home at dark I was quite
fresh.  However, I found a cable message from Rooke that the yacht would
arrive at midnight.

There was no need to summon the mountaineers, as the men in the Castle
would be sufficient to make preparations for the yacht's coming.

                                                                  _Later_.

The yacht has come.  At half-past eleven the lookout signalled that a
steamer without lights was creeping in towards the Creek.  I ran out to
the Flagstaff, and saw her steal in like a ghost.  She is painted a
steely blue-grey, and it is almost impossible to see her at any distance.
She certainly goes wonderfully.  Although there was not enough throb from
the engines to mar the absolute stillness, she came on at a fine speed,
and within a few minutes was close to the boom.  I had only time to run
down to give orders to draw back the boom when she glided in and stopped
dead at the harbour wall.  Rooke steered her himself, and he says he
never was on a boat that so well or so quickly answered her helm.  She is
certainly a beauty, and so far as I can see at night perfect in every
detail.  I promise myself a few pleasant hours over her in the daylight.
The men seem a splendid lot.

But I do not feel sleepy; I despair of sleep to-night.  But work demands
that I be fit for whatever may come, and so I shall try to sleep--to
rest, at any rate.

                                                           _July_ 4, 1907.

I was up with the first ray of sunrise, so by the time I had my bath and
was dressed there was ample light.  I went down to the dock at once, and
spent the morning looking over the vessel, which fully justifies Rooke's
enthusiasm about her.  She is built on lovely lines, and I can quite
understand that she is enormously fast.  Her armour I can only take on
the specifications, but her armament is really wonderful.  And there are
not only all the very newest devices of aggressive warfare--indeed, she
has the newest up-to-date torpedoes and torpedo-guns--but also the
old-fashioned rocket-tubes, which in certain occasions are so useful.
She has electric guns and the latest Massillon water-guns, and Reinhardt
electro-pneumatic "deliverers" for pyroxiline shells.  She is even
equipped with war-balloons easy of expansion, and with compressible
Kitson aeroplanes.  I don't suppose that there is anything quite like her
in the world.

The crew are worthy of her.  I can't imagine where Rooke picked up such a
splendid lot of men.  They are nearly all man-of-warsmen; of various
nationalities, but mostly British.  All young men--the oldest of them
hasn't got into the forties--and, so far as I can learn, all experts of
one kind or another in some special subject of warfare.  It will go hard
with me, but I shall keep them together.

How I got through the rest of the day I know not.  I tried hard not to
create any domestic trouble by my manner, lest Aunt Janet should, after
her lurid dream or vision of last night, attach some new importance to
it.  I think I succeeded, for she did not, so far as I could tell, take
any special notice of me.  We parted as usual at half-past ten, and I
came here and made this entry in my journal.  I am more restless than
ever to-night, and no wonder.  I would give anything to be able to pay a
visit to St. Sava's, and see my wife again--if it were only sleeping in
her tomb.  But I dare not do even that, lest she should come to see me
here, and I should miss her.  So I have done what I can.  The glass door
to the Terrace is open, so that she can enter at once if she comes.  The
fire is lit, and the room is warm.  There is food ready in case she
should care for it.  I have plenty of light in the room, so that through
the aperture where I have not fully drawn the curtain there may be light
to guide her.

Oh, how the time drags!  The clock has struck midnight.  One, two!  Thank
goodness, it will shortly be dawn, and the activity of the day may begin!
Work may again prove, in a way, to be an anodyne.  In the meantime I must
write on, lest despair overwhelm me.

Once during the night I thought I heard a footstep outside.  I rushed to
the window and looked out, but there was nothing to see, no sound to
hear.  That was a little after one o'clock.  I feared to go outside, lest
that should alarm her; so I came back to my table.  I could not write,
but I sat as if writing for a while.  But I could not stand it, so rose
and walked about the room.  As I walked I felt that my Lady--it gives me
a pang every time I remember that I do not know even her name--was not
quite so far away from me.  It made my heart beat to think that it might
mean that she was coming to me.  Could not I as well as Aunt Janet have a
little Second Sight!  I went towards the window, and, standing behind the
curtain, listened.  Far away I thought I heard a cry, and ran out on the
Terrace; but there was no sound to be heard, and no sign of any living
thing anywhere; so I took it for granted that it was the cry of some
night bird, and came back to my room, and wrote at my journal till I was
calm.  I think my nerves must be getting out of order, when every sound
of the night seems to have a special meaning for me.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                            _July_ 7, 1907

When the grey of the morning came, I gave up hope of my wife appearing,
and made up my mind that, so soon as I could get away without exciting
Aunt Janet's attention, I would go to St. Sava's.  I always eat a good
breakfast, and did I forgo it altogether, it would be sure to excite her
curiosity--a thing I do not wish at present.  As there was still time to
wait, I lay down on my bed as I was, and--such is the way of
Fate--shortly fell asleep.

I was awakened by a terrific clattering at my door.  When I opened it I
found a little group of servants, very apologetic at awaking me without
instructions.  The chief of them explained that a young priest had come
from the Vladika with a message so urgent that he insisted on seeing me
immediately at all hazards.  I came out at once, and found him in the
hall of the Castle, standing before the great fire, which was always lit
in the early morning.  He had a letter in his hand, but before giving it
to me he said:

"I am sent by the Vladika, who pressed on me that I was not to lose a
single instant in seeing you; that time is of golden price--nay, beyond
price.  This letter, amongst other things, vouches for me.  A terrible
misfortune has occurred.  The daughter of our leader has disappeared
during last night--the same, he commanded me to remind you, that he spoke
of at the meeting when he would not let the mountaineers fire their guns.
No sign of her can be found, and it is believed that she has been carried
off by the emissaries of the Sultan of Turkey, who once before brought
our nations to the verge of war by demanding her as a wife.  I was also
to say that the Vladika Plamenac would have come himself, but that it was
necessary that he should at once consult with the Archbishop, Stevan
Palealogue, as to what step is best to take in this dire calamity.  He
has sent out a search-party under the Archimandrite of Spazac, Petrof
Vlastimir, who is to come on here with any news he can get, as you have
command of the signalling, and can best spread the news.  He knows that
you, Gospodar, are in your great heart one of our compatriots, and that
you have already proved your friendship by many efforts to strengthen our
hands for war.  And as a great compatriot, he calls on you to aid us in
our need."  He then handed me the letter, and stood by respectfully
whilst I broke the seal and read it.  It was written in great haste, and
signed by the Vladika.

"Come with us now in our nation's peril.  Help us to rescue what we most
adore, and henceforth we shall hold you in our hearts.  You shall learn
how the men of the Blue Mountains can love faith and valour.  Come!"

This was a task indeed--a duty worthy of any man.  It thrilled me to the
core to know that the men of the Blue Mountains had called on me in their
dire need.  It woke all the fighting instinct of my Viking forbears, and
I vowed in my heart that they should be satisfied with my work.  I called
to me the corps of signallers who were in the house, and led them to the
Castle roof, taking with me the young messenger-priest.

"Come with me," I said to him, "and see how I answer the Vladika's
command."

The National flag was run up--the established signal that the nation was
in need.  Instantly on every summit near and far was seen the flutter of
an answering flag.  Quickly followed the signal that commanded the call
to arms.

One by one I gave the signallers orders in quick succession, for the plan
of search unfolded itself to me as I went on.  The arms of the semaphore
whirled in a way that made the young priest stare.  One by one, as they
took their orders, the signallers seemed to catch fire.  Instinctively
they understood the plan, and worked like demigods.  They knew that so
widespread a movement had its best chance in rapidity and in unity of
action.

From the forest which lay in sight of the Castle came a wild cheering,
which seemed to interpret the former stillness of the hills.  It was good
to feel that those who saw the signals--types of many--were ready.  I saw
the look of expectation on the face of the messenger-priest, and rejoiced
at the glow that came as I turned to him to speak.  Of course, he wanted
to know something of what was going on.  I saw the flashing of my own
eyes reflected in his as I spoke:

"Tell the Vladika that within a minute of his message being read the Land
of the Blue Mountains was awake.  The mountaineers are already marching,
and before the sun is high there will be a line of guards within hail of
each other round the whole frontier--from Angusa to Ilsin; from Ilsin to
Bajana; from Bajana to Ispazar; from Ispazar to Volok; from Volok to
Tatra; from Tatra to Domitan; from Domitan to Gravaja; and from Gravaja
back to Angusa.  The line is double.  The old men keep guard on the line,
and the young men advance.  These will close in at the advancing line, so
that nothing can escape them.  They will cover mountain-top and forest
depth, and will close in finally on the Castle here, which they can
behold from afar.  My own yacht is here, and will sweep the coast from
end to end.  It is the fastest boat afloat, and armed against a squadron.
Here will all signals come.  In an hour where we stand will be a signal
bureau, where trained eyes will watch night and day till the lost one has
been found and the outrage has been avenged.  The robbers are even now
within a ring of steel, and cannot escape."

The young priest, all on fire, sprang on the battlements and shouted to
the crowd, which was massing round the Castle in the gardens far below.
The forest was giving up its units till they seemed like the nucleus of
an army.  The men cheered lustily, till the sound swung high up to us
like the roaring of a winter sea.  With bared heads they were crying:

"God and the Blue Mountains!  God and the Blue Mountains!"

I ran down to them as quickly as I could, and began to issue their
instructions.  Within a time to be computed by minutes the whole number,
organized by sections, had started to scour the neighbouring mountains.
At first they had only understood the call to arms for general safety.
But when they learned that the daughter of a chief had been captured,
they simply went mad.  From something which the messenger first said, but
which I could not catch or did not understand, the blow seemed to have
for them some sort of personal significance which wrought them to a
frenzy.

When the bulk of the men had disappeared, I took with me a few of my own
men and several of the mountaineers whom I had asked to remain, and
together we went to the hidden ravine which I knew.  We found the place
empty; but there were unmistakable signs that a party of men had been
encamped there for several days.  Some of our men, who were skilled in
woodcraft and in signs generally, agreed that there must have been some
twenty of them.  As they could not find any trail either coming to or
going from the place, they came to the conclusion that they must have
come separately from different directions and gathered there, and that
they must have departed in something of the same mysterious way.

However, this was, at any rate, some sort of a beginning, and the men
separated, having agreed amongst themselves to make a wide cast round the
place in the search for tracks.  Whoever should find a trail was to
follow with at least one comrade, and when there was any definite news,
it was to be signalled to the Castle.

I myself returned at once, and set the signallers to work to spread
amongst our own people such news as we had.

When presently such discoveries as had been made were signalled with
flags to the Castle, it was found that the marauders had, in their
flight, followed a strangely zigzag course.  It was evident that, in
trying to baffle pursuit, they had tried to avoid places which they
thought might be dangerous to them.  This may have been simply a method
to disconcert pursuit.  If so, it was, in a measure, excellent, for none
of those immediately following could possibly tell in what direction they
were heading.  It was only when we worked the course on the great map in
the signaller's room (which was the old guard room of the Castle) that we
could get an inkling of the general direction of their flight.  This gave
added trouble to the pursuit; for the men who followed, being ignorant of
their general intent, could not ever take chance to head them off, but
had to be ready to follow in any or every direction.  In this manner the
pursuit was altogether a stern chase, and therefore bound to be a long
one.

As at present we could not do anything till the intended route was more
marked, I left the signalling corps to the task of receiving and giving
information to the moving bands, so that, if occasion served, they might
head off the marauders.  I myself took Rooke, as captain of the yacht,
and swept out of the creek.  We ran up north to Dalairi, then down south
to Olesso, and came back to Vissarion.  We saw nothing suspicious except,
far off to the extreme southward, one warship which flew no flag.  Rooke,
however, who seemed to know ships by instinct, said she was a Turk; so on
our return we signalled along the whole shore to watch her.  Rooke held
The Lady--which was the name I had given the armoured yacht--in readiness
to dart out in case anything suspicious was reported.  He was not to
stand on any ceremony, but if necessary to attack.  We did not intend to
lose a point in this desperate struggle which we had undertaken.  We had
placed in different likely spots a couple of our own men to look after
the signalling.

When I got back I found that the route of the fugitives, who had now
joined into one party, had been definitely ascertained.  They had gone
south, but manifestly taking alarm from the advancing line of guards, had
headed up again to the north-east, where the country was broader and the
mountains wilder and less inhabited.

Forthwith, leaving the signalling altogether in the hands of the fighting
priests, I took a small chosen band of the mountaineers of our own
district, and made, with all the speed we could, to cut across the track
of the fugitives a little ahead of them.  The Archimandrite (Abbot) of
Spazac, who had just arrived, came with us.  He is a splendid man--a real
fighter as well as a holy cleric, as good with his handjar as with his
Bible, and a runner to beat the band.  The marauders were going at a
fearful pace, considering that they were all afoot; so we had to go fast
also!  Amongst these mountains there is no other means of progressing.
Our own men were so aflame with ardour that I could not but notice that
they, more than any of the others whom I had seen, had some special cause
for concern.

When I mentioned it to the Archimandrite, who moved by my side, he
answered:

"All natural enough; they are not only fighting for their country, but
for their own!"  I did not quite understand his answer, and so began to
ask him some questions, to the effect that I soon began to understand a
good deal more than he did.

_Letter from Archbishop Stevan Palealogue_, _Head of the Eastern Church
of the Blue Mountains_, _to the Lady Janet MacKelpie_, _Vissarion_.

                                                   _Written July_ 9, 1907.

    HONOURED LADY,

    As you wish for an understanding regarding the late lamentable
    occurrence in which so much danger was incurred to this our Land of
    the Blue Mountains, and one dear to us, I send these words by request
    of the Gospodar Rupert, beloved of our mountaineers.

    When the Voivode Peter Vissarion made his journey to the great nation
    to whom we looked in our hour of need, it was necessary that he
    should go in secret.  The Turk was at our gates, and full of the
    malice of baffled greed.  Already he had tried to arrange a marriage
    with the Voivodin, so that in time to come he, as her husband, might
    have established a claim to the inheritance of the land.  Well he
    knew, as do all men, that the Blue Mountaineers owe allegiance to
    none that they themselves do not appoint to rulership.  This has been
    the history in the past.  But now and again an individual has arisen
    or come to the front adapted personally for such government as this
    land requires.  And so the Lady Teuta, Voivodin of the Blue
    Mountains, was put for her proper guarding in the charge of myself as
    Head of the Eastern Church in the Land of the Blue Mountains, steps
    being taken in such wise that no capture of her could be effected by
    unscrupulous enemies of this our Land.  This task and guardianship
    was gladly held as an honour by all concerned.  For the Voivodin
    Teuta of Vissarion must be taken as representing in her own person
    the glory of the old Serb race, inasmuch as being the only child of
    the Voivode Vissarion, last male of his princely race--the race which
    ever, during the ten centuries of our history, unflinchingly gave
    life and all they held for the protection, safety, and well-being of
    the Land of the Blue Mountains.  Never during those centuries had any
    one of the race been known to fail in patriotism, or to draw back
    from any loss or hardship enjoined by high duty or stress of need.
    Moreover, this was the race of that first Voivode Vissarion, of whom,
    in legend, it was prophesied that he--once known as "The Sword of
    Freedom," a giant amongst men--would some day, when the nation had
    need of him, come forth from his water-tomb in the lost Lake of Reo,
    and lead once more the men of the Blue Mountains to lasting victory.
    This noble race, then, had come to be known as the last hope of the
    Land.  So that when the Voivode was away on his country's service,
    his daughter should be closely guarded.  Soon after the Voivode had
    gone, it was reported that he might be long delayed in his
    diplomacies, and also in studying the system of Constitutional
    Monarchy, for which it had been hoped to exchange our imperfect
    political system.  I may say _inter alia_ that he was mentioned as to
    be the first king when the new constitution should have been
    arranged.

    Then a great misfortune came on us; a terrible grief overshadowed the
    land.  After a short illness, the Voivodin Teuta Vissarion died
    mysteriously of a mysterious ailment.  The grief of the mountaineers
    was so great that it became necessary for the governing Council to
    warn them not to allow their sorrow to be seen.  It was imperatively
    necessary that the fact of her death should be kept secret.  For
    there were dangers and difficulties of several kinds.  In the first
    place it was advisable that even her father should be kept in
    ignorance of his terrible loss.  It was well known that he held her
    as the very core of his heart and that if he should hear of her
    death, he would be too much prostrated to be able to do the intricate
    and delicate work which he had undertaken.  Nay, more: he would never
    remain afar off, under the sad circumstances, but would straightway
    return, so as to be in the land where she lay.  Then suspicions would
    crop up, and the truth must shortly be known afield, with the
    inevitable result that the Land would become the very centre of a war
    of many nations.

    In the second place, if the Turks were to know that the race of
    Vissarion was becoming extinct, this would encourage them to further
    aggression, which would become immediate should they find out that
    the Voivode was himself away.  It was well known that they were
    already only suspending hostilities until a fitting opportunity
    should arise.  Their desire for aggression had become acute after the
    refusal of the nation, and of the girl herself, that she should
    become a wife of the Sultan.

    The dead girl had been buried in the Crypt of the church of St. Sava,
    and day after day and night after night, singly and in parties, the
    sorrowing mountaineers had come to pay devotion and reverence at her
    tomb.  So many had wished to have a last glimpse of her face that the
    Vladika had, with my own consent as Archbishop, arranged for a glass
    cover to be put over the stone coffin wherein her body lay.

    After a little time, however, there came a belief to all concerned in
    the guarding of the body--these, of course, being the priests of
    various degrees of dignity appointed to the task--that the Voivodin
    was not really dead, but only in a strangely-prolonged trance.
    Thereupon a new complication arose.  Our mountaineers are, as perhaps
    you know, by nature deeply suspicious--a characteristic of all brave
    and self-sacrificing people who are jealous of their noble heritage.
    Having, as they believed, seen the girl dead, they might not be
    willing to accept the fact of her being alive.  They might even
    imagine that there was on foot some deep, dark plot which was, or
    might be, a menace, now or hereafter, to their independence.  In any
    case, there would be certain to be two parties on the subject, a
    dangerous and deplorable thing in the present condition of affairs.

    As the trance, or catalepsy, whatever it was, continued for many
    days, there had been ample time for the leaders of the Council, the
    Vladika, the priesthood represented by the Archimandrite of Spazac,
    myself as Archbishop and guardian of the Voivodin in her father's
    absence, to consult as to a policy to be observed in case of the girl
    awaking.  For in such case the difficulty of the situation would be
    multiplied indefinitely.  In the secret chambers of St. Sava's we had
    many secret meetings, and were finally converging on agreement when
    the end of the trance came.

    The girl awoke!

    She was, of course, terribly frightened when she found herself in a
    tomb in the Crypt.  It was truly fortunate that the great candles
    around her tomb had been kept lighted, for their light mitigated the
    horror of the place.  Had she waked in darkness, her reason might
    have become unseated.

    She was, however, a very noble girl; brave, with extraordinary will,
    and resolution, and self-command, and power of endurance.  When she
    had been taken into one of the secret chambers of the church, where
    she was warmed and cared for, a hurried meeting was held by the
    Vladika, myself, and the chiefs of the National Council.  Word had
    been at once sent to me of the joyful news of her recovery; and with
    the utmost haste I came, arriving in time to take a part in the
    Council.

    At the meeting the Voivodin was herself present, and full confidence
    of the situation was made to her.  She herself proposed that the
    belief in her death should be allowed to prevail until the return of
    her father, when all could be effectively made clear.  To this end
    she undertook to submit to the terrific strain which such a
    proceeding would involve.  At first we men could not believe that any
    woman could go through with such a task, and some of us did not
    hesitate to voice our doubts--our disbelief.  But she stood to her
    guns, and actually down-faced us.  At the last we, remembering things
    that had been done, though long ages ago, by others of her race, came
    to believe not merely in her self-belief and intention, but even in
    the feasibility of her plan.  She took the most solemn oaths not to
    betray the secret under any possible stress.

    The priesthood undertook through the Vladika and myself to further a
    ghostly belief amongst the mountaineers which would tend to prevent a
    too close or too persistent observation.  The Vampire legend was
    spread as a protection against partial discovery by any mischance,
    and other weird beliefs were set afoot and fostered.  Arrangements
    were made that only on certain days were the mountaineers to be
    admitted to the Crypt, she agreeing that for these occasions she was
    to take opiates or carry out any other aid to the preservation of the
    secret.  She was willing, she impressed upon us, to make any personal
    sacrifice which might be deemed necessary for the carrying out her
    father's task for the good of the nation.

    Of course, she had at first terrible frights lying alone in the
    horror of the Crypt.  But after a time the terrors of the situation,
    if they did not cease, were mitigated.  There are secret caverns off
    the Crypt, wherein in troublous times the priests and others of high
    place have found safe retreat.  One of these was prepared for the
    Voivodin, and there she remained, except for such times as she was on
    show--and certain other times of which I shall tell you.  Provision
    was made for the possibility of any accidental visit to the church.
    At such times, warned by an automatic signal from the opening door,
    she was to take her place in the tomb.  The mechanism was so arranged
    that the means to replace the glass cover, and to take the opiate,
    were there ready to her hand.  There was to be always a watch of
    priests at night in the church, to guard her from ghostly fears as
    well as from more physical dangers; and if she was actually in her
    tomb, it was to be visited at certain intervals.  Even the draperies
    which covered her in the sarcophagus were rested on a bridge placed
    from side to side just above her, so as to hide the rising and
    falling of her bosom as she slept under the narcotic.

    After a while the prolonged strain began to tell so much on her that
    it was decided that she should take now and again exercise out of
    doors.  This was not difficult, for when the Vampire story which we
    had spread began to be widely known, her being seen would be accepted
    as a proof of its truth.  Still, as there was a certain danger in her
    being seen at all, we thought it necessary to exact from her a solemn
    oath that so long as her sad task lasted she should under no
    circumstances ever wear any dress but her shroud--this being the only
    way to insure secrecy and to prevail against accident.

    There is a secret way from the Crypt to a sea cavern, whose entrance
    is at high-tide under the water-line at the base of the cliff on
    which the church is built.  A boat, shaped like a coffin, was
    provided for her; and in this she was accustomed to pass across the
    creek whenever she wished to make excursion.  It was an excellent
    device, and most efficacious in disseminating the Vampire belief.

    This state of things had now lasted from before the time when the
    Gospodar Rupert came to Vissarion up to the day of the arrival of the
    armoured yacht.

    That night the priest on duty, on going his round of the Crypt just
    before dawn, found the tomb empty.  He called the others, and they
    made full search.  The boat was gone from the cavern, but on making
    search they found it on the farther side of the creek, close to the
    garden stairs.  Beyond this they could discover nothing.  She seemed
    to have disappeared without leaving a trace.

    Straightway they went to the Vladika, and signalled to me by the
    fire-signal at the monastery at Astrag, where I then was.  I took a
    band of mountaineers with me, and set out to scour the country.  But
    before going I sent an urgent message to the Gospodar Rupert, asking
    him, who showed so much interest and love to our Land, to help us in
    our trouble.  He, of course, knew nothing then of all have now told
    you.  Nevertheless, he devoted himself whole-heartedly to our
    needs--as doubtless you know.

    But the time had now come close when the Voivode Vissarion was about
    to return from his mission; and we of the council of his daughter's
    guardianship were beginning to arrange matters so that at his return
    the good news of her being still alive could be made public.  With
    her father present to vouch for her, no question as to truth could
    arise.

    But by some means the Turkish "Bureau of Spies" must have got
    knowledge of the fact already.  To steal a dead body for the purpose
    of later establishing a fictitious claim would have been an
    enterprise even more desperate than that already undertaken.  We
    inferred from many signs, made known to us in an investigation, that
    a daring party of the Sultan's emissaries had made a secret incursion
    with the object of kidnapping the Voivodin.  They must have been bold
    of heart and strong of resource to enter the Land of the Blue
    Mountains on any errand, let alone such a desperate one as this.  For
    centuries we have been teaching the Turk through bitter lessons that
    it is neither a safe task nor an easy one to make incursion here.

    How they did it we know not--at present; but enter they did, and,
    after waiting in some secret hiding-place for a favourable
    opportunity, secured their prey.  We know not even now whether they
    had found entrance to the Crypt and stole, as they thought, the dead
    body, or whether, by some dire mischance, they found her
    abroad--under her disguise as a ghost.  At any rate, they had
    captured her, and through devious ways amongst the mountains were
    bearing her back to Turkey.  It was manifest that when she was on
    Turkish soil the Sultan would force a marriage on her so as
    eventually to secure for himself or his successors as against all
    other nations a claim for the suzerainty or guardianship of the Blue
    Mountains.

    Such was the state of affairs when the Gospodar Rupert threw himself
    into the pursuit with fiery zeal and the Berserk passion which he
    inherited from Viking ancestors, whence of old came "The Sword of
    Freedom" himself.

    But at that very time was another possibility which the Gospodar was
    himself the first to realize.  Failing the getting the Voivodin safe
    to Turkish soil, the ravishers might kill her!  This would be
    entirely in accord with the base traditions and history of the
    Moslems.  So, too, it would accord with Turkish customs and the
    Sultan's present desires.  It would, in its way, benefit the ultimate
    strategetic ends of Turkey.  For were once the Vissarion race at an
    end, the subjection of the Land of the Blue Mountains might, in their
    view, be an easier task than it had yet been found to be.

    Such, illustrious lady, were the conditions of affairs when the
    Gospodar Rupert first drew his handjar for the Blue Mountains and
    what it held most dear.

                                                               PALEALOGUE,

RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.

I wonder if ever in the long, strange history of the world had there come
to any other such glad tidings as came to me--and even then rather
inferentially than directly--from the Archimandrite's answers to my
questioning.  Happily I was able to restrain myself, or I should have
created some strange confusion which might have evoked distrust, and
would certainly have hampered us in our pursuit.  For a little I could
hardly accept the truth which wove itself through my brain as the true
inwardness of each fact came home to me and took its place in the whole
fabric.  But even the most welcome truth has to be accepted some time by
even a doubting heart.  My heart, whatever it may have been, was not then
a doubting heart, but a very, very grateful one.  It was only the
splendid magnitude of the truth which forbade its immediate acceptance.
I could have shouted for joy, and only stilled myself by keeping my
thoughts fixed on the danger which my wife was in.  My wife!  My wife!
Not a Vampire; not a poor harassed creature doomed to terrible woe, but a
splendid woman, brave beyond belief, patriotic in a way which has but few
peers even in the wide history of bravery!  I began to understand the
true meaning of the strange occurrences that have come into my life.
Even the origin and purpose of that first strange visit to my room became
clear.  No wonder that the girl could move about the Castle in so
mysterious a manner.  She had lived there all her life, and was familiar
with the secret ways of entrance and exit.  I had always believed that
the place must have been honeycombed with secret passages.  No wonder
that she could find a way to the battlements, mysterious to everybody
else.  No wonder that she could meet me at the Flagstaff when she so
desired.

To say that I was in a tumult would be to but faintly express my
condition.  I was rapt into a heaven of delight which had no measure in
all my adventurous life--the lifting of the veil which showed that my
wife--mine--won in all sincerity in the very teeth of appalling
difficulties and dangers--was no Vampire, no corpse, no ghost or phantom,
but a real woman of flesh and blood, of affection, and love, and passion.
Now at last would my love be crowned indeed when, having rescued her from
the marauders, I should bear her to my own home, where she would live and
reign in peace and comfort and honour, and in love and wifely happiness
if I could achieve such a blessing for her--and for myself.

But here a dreadful thought flashed across me, which in an instant turned
my joy to despair, my throbbing heart to ice:

"As she is a real woman, she is in greater danger than ever in the hands
of Turkish ruffians.  To them a woman is in any case no more than a
sheep; and if they cannot bring her to the harem of the Sultan, they may
deem it the next wisest step to kill her.  In that way, too, they might
find a better chance of escape.  Once rid of her the party could
separate, and there might be a chance of some of them finding escape as
individuals that would not exist for a party.  But even if they did not
kill her, to escape with her would be to condemn her to the worst fate of
all the harem of the Turk!  Lifelong misery and despair--however long
that life might be--must be the lot of a Christian woman doomed to such a
lot.  And to her, just happily wedded, and after she had served her
country in such a noble way as she had done, that dreadful life of
shameful slavery would be a misery beyond belief.

"She must be rescued--and quickly!  The marauders must be caught soon,
and suddenly, so that they may have neither time nor opportunity to harm
her, as they would be certain to do if they have warning of immediate
danger.

"On! on!"

And "on" it was all through that terrible night as well as we could
through the forest.

It was a race between the mountaineers and myself as to who should be
first.  I understood now the feeling that animated them, and which
singled them out even from amongst their fiery comrades, when the danger
of the Voivodin became known.  These men were no mean contestants even in
such a race, and, strong as I am, it took my utmost effort to keep ahead
of them.  They were keen as leopards, and as swift.  Their lives had been
spent among the mountains, and their hearts and souls on were in the
chase.  I doubt not that if the death of any one of us could have through
any means effected my wife's release, we should, if necessary, have
fought amongst ourselves for the honour.

From the nature of the work before us our party had to keep to the top of
the hills.  We had not only to keep observation on the flying party whom
we followed, and to prevent them making discovery of us, but we had to be
always in a position to receive and answer signals made to us from the
Castle, or sent to us from other eminences.

_Letter from Petrof Vlastimir_, _Archimandrite of Spazac_, _to the Lady
Janet MacKelpie_, _of Vissarion_.

                                                   _Written July_ 8, 1907.

    GREAT LADY,

    I am asked to write by the Vladika, and have permission of the
    Archbishop.  I have the honour of transmitting to you the record of
    the pursuit of the Turkish spies who carried off the Voivodin Teuta,
    of the noble House of Vissarion.  The pursuit was undertaken by the
    Gospodar Rupert, who asked that I would come with his party, since
    what he was so good as to call my "great knowledge of the country and
    its people" might serve much.  It is true that I have had much
    knowledge of the Land of the Blue Mountains and its people, amongst
    which and whom my whole life has been passed.  But in such a cause no
    reason was required.  There was not a man in the Blue Mountains who
    would not have given his life for the Voivodin Teuta, and when they
    heard that she had not been dead, as they thought, but only in a
    trance, and that it was she whom the marauders had carried off, they
    were in a frenzy.  So why should I--to whom has been given the great
    trust of the Monastery of Spazac--hesitate at such a time?  For
    myself, I wanted to hurry on, and to come at once to the fight with
    my country's foes; and well I knew that the Gospodar Rupert, with a
    lion's heart meet for his giant body, would press on with a matchless
    speed.  We of the Blue Mountains do not lag when our foes are in
    front of us; most of all do we of the Eastern Church press on when
    the Crescent wars against the Cross!

    We took with us no gear or hamper of any kind; no coverings except
    what we stood in; no food--nothing but our handjars and our rifles,
    with a sufficiency of ammunition.  Before starting, the Gospodar gave
    hurried orders by signal from the Castle to have food and ammunition
    sent to us (as we might signal) by the nearest hamlet.

    It was high noon when we started, only ten strong--for our leader
    would take none but approved runners who could shoot straight and use
    the handjar as it should be used.  So as we went light, we expected
    to go fast.  By this time we knew from the reports signalled to
    Vissarion that the enemies were chosen men of no despicable prowess.

    The Keeper of the Green Flag of Islam is well served, and as though
    the Turk is an infidel and a dog, he is sometimes brave and strong.
    Indeed, except when he passes the confines of the Blue Mountains, he
    has been known to do stirring deeds.  But as none who have dared to
    wander in amongst our hills ever return to their own land, we may not
    know of how they speak at home of their battles here.  Still, these
    men were evidently not to be despised; and our Gospodar, who is a
    wise man as well as a valiant, warned us to be prudent, and not to
    despise our foes over much.  We did as he counselled, and in proof we
    only took ten men, as we had only twenty against us.  But then there
    was at stake much beyond life, and we took no risks.  So, as the
    great clock at Vissarion clanged of noon, the eight fastest runners
    of the Blue Mountains, together with the Gospodar Rupert and myself,
    swept out on our journey.  It had been signalled to us that the
    course which the marauders had as yet taken in their flight was a
    zigzag one, running eccentrically at all sorts of angles in all sorts
    of directions.  But our leader had marked out a course where we might
    intercept our foes across the main line of their flight; and till we
    had reached that region we paused not a second, but went as fast as
    we could all night long.  Indeed, it was amongst us a race as was the
    Olympic race of old Greece, each one vying with his fellows, though
    not in jealous emulation, but in high spirit, to best serve his
    country and the Voivodin Teuta.  Foremost amongst us went the
    Gospodar, bearing himself as a Paladin of old, his mighty form
    pausing for no obstacle.  Perpetually did he urge us on.  He would
    not stop or pause for a moment, but often as he and I ran
    together--for, lady, in my youth I was the fleetest of all in the
    race, and even that now can head a battalion when duty calls--he
    would ask me certain questions as to the Lady Teuta and of the
    strange manner of her reputed death, as it was gradually unfolded in
    my answers to his questioning.  And as each new phase of knowledge
    came to him, he would rush on as one possessed of fiends: whereat our
    mountaineers, who seem to respect even fiends for their thoroughness,
    would strive to keep pace with him till they too seemed worked into
    diabolic possession.  And I myself, left alone in the calmness of
    sacerdotal office, forgot even that.  With surging ears and eyes that
    saw blood, I rushed along with best of them.

    Then truly the spirit of a great captain showed itself in the
    Gospodar, for when others were charged with fury he began to force
    himself into calm, so that out of his present self-command and the
    memory of his exalted position came a worthy strategy and thought for
    every contingency that might arise.  So that when some new direction
    was required for our guidance, there was no hesitation in its coming.
    We, nine men of varying kinds, all felt that we had a master; and so,
    being willing to limit ourselves to strict obedience, we were free to
    use such thoughts as well as such powers as we had to the best
    advantage of the doing.

    We came across the trail of the flying marauders on the second
    morning after the abduction, a little before noon.  It was easy
    enough to see, for by this time the miscreants were all together, and
    our people, who were woodlanders, were able to tell much of the party
    that passed.  These were evidently in a terrified hurry, for they had
    taken no precautions such as are necessary baffle pursuit, and all of
    which take time.  Our foresters said that two went ahead and two
    behind.  In the centre went the mass, moving close together, as
    though surrounding their prisoner.  We caught not even a single
    glimpse her--could not have, they encompassed her so closely.  But
    our foresters saw other than the mass; the ground that had been
    passed was before them.  They knew that the prisoner had gone
    unwillingly--nay, more: one of them said as he rose from his knees,
    where he had been examining of the ground:

    "The misbegotten dogs have been urging her on with their yataghans!
    There are drops of blood, though there are no blood-marks on her
    feet."

    Whereupon the Gospodar flamed with passion.  His teeth ground
    together, and with a deep-breathed "On, on!" he sprang off again,
    handjar in hand, on the track.

    Before long we saw the party in the distance.  They this were far
    below us in a deep valley, although the track of their going passed
    away to the right hand.  They were making for the base of the great
    cliff, which rose before us all.  Their reason was twofold, as we
    soon knew.  Far off down the valley which they were crossing we saw
    signs of persons coming in haste, who must be of the search party
    coming from the north.  Though the trees hid them, we could not
    mistake the signs.  I was myself forester enough to have no doubt.
    Again, it was evident that the young Voivodin could travel no longer
    at the dreadful pace at which they had been going.  Those blood-marks
    told their own tale!  They meant to make a last stand here in case
    they should be discovered.

    Then it was that he, who amongst us all had been most fierce and most
    bent on rapid pursuit, became the most the calm.  Raising his hand
    for silence--though, God knows, we were and had been silent enough
    during that long rush through the forest--he said, in a low, keen
    whisper which cut the silence like a knife:

    "My friends, the time is come for action.  God be thanked, who has
    now brought us face to face with our foes!  But we must be careful
    here--not on our own account, for we wish nothing more than to rush
    on and conquer or die--but for the sake of her whom you love, and
    whom I, too, love.  She is in danger from anything which may give
    warning to those fiends.  If they know or even suspect for an instant
    that we are near, they will murder her . . . "

    Here his voice broke for an instant with the extremity of his passion
    or the depth of his feeling--I hardly know which; I think both acted
    on him.

    "We know from those blood-marks what they can do--even to her."  His
    teeth ground together again, but he went on without stopping further:

    "Let us arrange the battle.  Though we are but little distance from
    them as the crow flies, the way is far to travel.  There is, I can
    see, but one path down to the valley from this side.  That they have
    gone by, and that they will sure to guard--to watch, at any rate.
    Let us divide, as to surround them.  The cliff towards which they
    make runs far to the left without a break.  That to the right we
    cannot see from this spot; but from the nature of the ground it is
    not unlikely that it turns round in this direction, making the hither
    end of the valley like a vast pocket or amphitheatre.  As they have
    studied the ground in other places, they may have done so in this,
    and have come hither as to a known refuge.  Let one man, a marksman,
    stay here."

    As he spoke a man stepped to the front.  He was, I knew, an excellent
    shot.

    "Let two others go to the left and try to find a way down the cliff
    before us.  When they have descended to the level of the valley--path
    or no path--let them advance cautiously and secretly, keeping their
    guns in readiness.  But they must not fire till need.  Remember, my
    brothers," said, turning to those who stepped out a pace or two to
    the left, "that the first shot gives the warning which will be the
    signal for the Voivodin's death.  These men will not hesitate.  You
    must judge yourselves of the time to shoot.  The others of us will
    move to the right and try to find a path on that side.  If the valley
    be indeed a pocket between the cliffs, we must find a way down that
    is not a path!"

    As he spoke thus there was a blaze in his eyes that betokened no good
    to aught that might stand in his way.  I ran by his side as we moved
    to the right.

    It was as he surmised about the cliff.  When we got a little on our
    way we saw how the rocky formation trended to our right, till,
    finally, with a wide curve, it came round to the other side.

    It was a fearful valley that, with its narrow girth and its towering
    walls that seemed to topple over.  On the farther side from us the
    great trees that clothed the slope of the mountain over it grew down
    to the very edge of the rock, so that their spreading branches hung
    far over the chasm.  And, so far as we could understand, the same
    condition existed on our own side.  Below us the valley was dark even
    in the daylight.  We could best tell the movement of the flying
    marauders by the flashes of the white shroud of their captive in the
    midst of them.

    From where we were grouped, amid the great tree-trunks on the very
    brow of the cliff, we could, when our eyes were accustomed to the
    shadow, see them quite well.  In great haste, and half dragging, half
    carrying the Voivodin, they crossed the open space and took refuge in
    a little grassy alcove surrounded, save for its tortuous entrance, by
    undergrowth.  From the valley level it was manifestly impossible to
    see them, though we from our altitude could see over the stunted
    undergrowth.  When within the glade, they took their hands from her.
    She, shuddering instinctively, withdrew to a remote corner of the
    dell.

    And then, oh, shame on their manhood!--Turks and heathens though they
    were--we could see that they had submitted her to the indignity of
    gagging her and binding her hands!

    Our Voivodin Teuta bound!  To one and all of us it was like lashing
    us across the face.  I heard the Gospodar's teeth grind again.  But
    once more he schooled himself to calmness ere he said:

    "It is, perhaps, as well, great though the indignity be.  They are
    seeking their own doom, which is coming quickly . . . Moreover, they
    are thwarting their own base plans.  Now that she is bound they will
    trust to their binding, so that they will delay their murderous
    alternative to the very last moment.  Such is our chance of rescuing
    her alive!"

    For a few moments he stood as still as a stone, as though revolving
    something in his mind whilst he watched.  I could see that some grim
    resolution was forming in his mind, for his eyes ranged to the top of
    the trees above cliff, and down again, very slowly this time, as
    though measuring and studying the detail of what was in front of him.
    Then he spoke:

    "They are in hopes that the other pursuing party may not come across
    them.  To know that, they are waiting.  If those others do not come
    up the valley, they will proceed on their way.  They will return up
    the path the way they came.  There we can wait them, charge into the
    middle of them when she is opposite, and cut down those around her.
    Then the others will open fire, and we shall be rid of them!

    Whilst he was speaking, two of the men of our party, who I knew to be
    good sharpshooters, and who had just before lain on their faces and
    had steadied their rifles to shoot, rose to their feet.

    "Command us, Gospodar!" they said simply, as they stood to attention.
    "Shall we go to the head of the ravine road and there take hiding?"
    He thought for perhaps a minute, whilst we all stood as silent as
    images.  I could hear our hearts beating.  Then he said:

    "No, not yet.  There is time for that yet.  They will not--cannot
    stir or make plans in any way till they know whether the other party
    is coming towards them or not.  From our height here we can see what
    course the others are taking long before those villains do.  Then we
    can make our plans and be ready in time."

    We waited many minutes, but could see no further signs the other
    pursuing party.  These had evidently adopted greater caution in their
    movements as they came closer to where they expected to find the
    enemy.  The marauders began to grow anxious.  Even at our distance we
    could gather as much from their attitude and movements.

    Presently, when the suspense of their ignorance grew too much for
    them, they drew to the entrance of the glade, which was the farthest
    place to which, without exposing themselves to anyone who might come
    to the valley, they could withdraw from their captive.  Here they
    consulted together.  We could follow from their gestures what they
    were saying, for as they did not wish their prisoner to hear, their
    gesticulation was enlightening to us as to each other.  Our people,
    like all mountaineers, have good eyes, and the Gospodar is himself an
    eagle in this as in other ways.  Three men stood back from the rest.
    They stacked their rifles so that they could seize them easily.  Then
    they drew their scimitars, and stood ready, as though on guard.

    These were evidently the appointed murderers.  Well they knew their
    work; for though they stood in a desert place with none within long
    distance except the pursuing party, of whose approach they would have
    good notice, they stood so close to their prisoner that no marksman
    in the world--now or that ever had been; not William Tell
    himself--could have harmed any of them without at least endangering
    her.  Two of them turned the Voivodin round so that her face was
    towards the precipice--in which position she could not see what was
    going on--whilst he who was evidently leader of the gang explained,
    in gesture, that the others were going to spy upon the pursuing
    party.  When they had located them he, or one of his men, would come
    out of the opening of the wood wherein they had had evidence of them,
    and hold up his hand.

    That was to be the signal for the cutting of the victim's
    throat--such being the chosen method (villainous even for heathen
    murderers) of her death.  There was not one of our men who did not
    grind his teeth when we witnessed the grim action, only too
    expressive, of the Turk as he drew his right hand, clenched as though
    he held a yataghan in it, across his throat.

    At the opening of the glade all the spying party halted whilst the
    leader appointed to each his place of entry of the wood, the front of
    which extended in an almost straight across the valley from cliff to
    cliff.

    The men, stooping low when in the open, and taking instant advantage
    of every little obstacle on the ground, seemed to fade like spectres
    with incredible swiftness across the level mead, and were swallowed
    up in the wood.

    When they had disappeared the Gospodar Rupert revealed to us the
    details of the plan of action which he had revolving in his mind.  He
    motioned us to follow him: we threaded a way between the tree-trunks,
    keeping all the while on the very edge of the cliff, so that the
    space below was all visible to us.  When we had got round the curve
    sufficiently to see the whole of the wood on the valley level,
    without losing sight of the Voivodin and her appointed assassins, we
    halted under his direction.  There was an added advantage of this
    point over the other, for we could see directly the rising of the
    hill-road, up which farther side ran the continuation of the mountain
    path which the marauders had followed.  It was somewhere on that path
    that the other pursuing party had hoped to intercept the fugitives.
    The Gospodar spoke quickly, though in a voice of command which true
    soldiers love to hear:

    "Brothers, the time has come when we can strike a blow for Teuta and
    the Land.  Do you two, marksmen, take position here facing the wood."
    The two men here lay down and got their rifles ready.  "Divide the
    frontage of the wood between you; arrange between yourselves the
    limits of your positions.  The very instant one of the marauders
    appears, cover him; drop him before he emerges from the wood.  Even
    then still watch and treat similarly whoever else may take his place.
    Do this if they come singly till not a man is left.  Remember,
    brothers, that brave hearts alone will not suffice at this grim
    crisis.  In this hour the best safety of the Voivodin is in the calm
    spirit and the steady eye!"  Then he turned to the rest of us, and
    spoke to me:

    "Archimandrite of Plazac, you who are interpreter to God of the
    prayers of so many souls, my own hour has come.  If I do not return,
    convey my love to my Aunt Janet--Miss MacKelpie, at Vissarion.  There
    is but one thing left to us if we wish to save the Voivodin.  Do you,
    when the time comes, take these men and join the watcher at the top
    of the ravine road.  When the shots are fired, do you out handjar,
    and rush the ravine and across the valley.  Brothers, you may be in
    time to avenge the Voivodin, if you cannot save her.  For me there
    must be a quicker way, and to it I go.  As there is not, and will not
    be, time to traverse the path, I must take a quicker way.  Nature
    finds me a path that man has made it necessary for me to travel.  See
    that giant beech-tree that towers above the glade where the Voivodin
    is held?  There is my path!  When you from here have marked the
    return of the spies, give me a signal with your hat--do not use a
    handkerchief, as others might see its white, and take warning.  Then
    rush that ravine.  I shall take that as the signal for my descent by
    the leafy road.  If I can do naught else, I can crush the murderers
    with my falling weight, even if I have to kill her too.  At least we
    shall die together--and free.  Lay us together in the tomb at St.
    Sava's.  Farewell, if it be the last!"

    He threw down the scabbard in which he carried his handjar, adjusted
    the naked weapon in his belt behind his back, and was gone!

    We who were not watching the wood kept our eyes fixed on the great
    beech-tree, and with new interest noticed the long trailing branches
    which hung low, and swayed even in the gentle breeze.  For a few
    minutes, which seemed amazingly long, we saw no sign of him.  Then,
    high up on one of the great branches which stood clear of obscuring
    leaves, we saw something crawling flat against the bark.  He was well
    out on the branch, hanging far over the precipice.  He was looking
    over at us, and I waved my hand so that he should know we saw him.
    He was clad in green--his usual forest dress--so that there was not
    any likelihood of any other eyes noticing him.  I took off my hat,
    and held it ready to signal with when the time should come.  I
    glanced down at the glade and saw the Voivodin standing, still safe,
    with her guards so close to her as to touch.  Then I, too, fixed my
    eyes on the wood.

    Suddenly the man standing beside me seized my arm and pointed.  I
    could just see through the trees, which were lower than elsewhere in
    the front of the wood, a Turk moving stealthily; so I waved my hat.
    At the same time a rifle underneath me cracked.  A second or two
    later the spy pitched forward on his face and lay still.  At the same
    instant my eyes sought the beech-tree, and I saw the close-lying
    figure raise itself and slide forward to a joint of the branch.  Then
    the Gospodar, as he rose, hurled himself forward amid the mass of the
    trailing branches.  He dropped like a stone, and my heart sank.

    But an instant later he seemed in poise.  He had clutched the thin,
    trailing branches as he fell; and as he sank a number of leaves which
    his motion had torn off floated out round him.

    Again the rifle below me cracked, and then again, and again, and
    again.  The marauders had taken warning, and were coming out in mass.
    But my own eyes were fixed on the tree.  Almost as a thunderbolt
    falls fell the giant body of the Gospodar, his size lost in the
    immensity of his surroundings.  He fell in a series of jerks, as he
    kept clutching the trailing beech-branches whilst they lasted, and
    then other lesser verdure growing out from the fissures in the rock
    after the lengthening branches had with all their elasticity reached
    their last point.

    At length--for though this all took place in a very few seconds the
    gravity of the crisis prolonged them immeasurably--there came a large
    space of rock some three times his own length.  He did not pause, but
    swung himself to one side, so that he should fall close to the
    Voivodin and her guards.  These men did not seem to notice, for their
    attention was fixed on the wood whence they expected their messenger
    to signal.  But they raised their yataghans in readiness.  The shots
    had alarmed them; and they meant to do the murder now--messenger or
    no messenger

    But though the men did not see the danger from above, the Voivodin
    did.  She raised her eyes quickly at the first sound, and even from
    where we were, before we began to run towards the ravine path, I
    could see the triumphant look in her glorious eyes when she
    recognized the identity of the man who was seemingly coming straight
    down from Heaven itself to help her--as, indeed, she, and we too, can
    very well imagine that he did; for if ever heaven had a hand in a
    rescue on earth, it was now.

    Even during the last drop from the rocky foliage the Gospodar kept
    his head.  As he fell he pulled his handjar free, and almost as he
    was falling its sweep took off the head of one of the assassins.  As
    he touched ground he stumbled for an instant, but it was towards his
    enemies.  Twice with lightning rapidity the handjar swept the air,
    and at each sweep a head rolled on the sward.

    The Voivodin held up her tied hands.  Again the handjar flashed, this
    time downwards, and the lady was free.  Without an instant's pause
    the Gospodar tore off the gag, and with his left arm round her and
    handjar in right hand, stood face toward his living foes.  The
    Voivodin stooped suddenly, and then, raising the yataghan which had
    fallen from the hand of one of the dead marauders, stood armed beside
    him.

    The rifles were now cracking fast, as the marauders--those that were
    left of them--came rushing out into the open.  But well the marksmen
    knew their work.  Well they bore in mind the Gospodar's command
    regarding calmness.  They kept picking off the foremost men only, so
    that the onward rush never seemed to get more forward.

    As we rushed down the ravine we could see clearly all before us.  But
    now, just as we were beginning to fear lest some mischance might
    allow some of them to reach the glade, there was another cause of
    surprise--of rejoicing.

    From the face of the wood seemed to burst all at once a body of men,
    all wearing the national cap, so we knew them as our own.  They were
    all armed with the handjar only, and they came like tigers.  They
    swept on the rushing Turks as though, for all their swiftness, they
    were standing still--literally wiping them out as a child wipes a
    lesson from its slate.

    A few seconds later these were followed by a tall figure with long
    hair and beard of black mingled with grey.  Instinctively we all, as
    did those in the valley, shouted with joy.  For this was the Vladika
    Milosh Plamenac himself.

    I confess that, knowing what I knew, I was for a short space of time
    anxious lest, in the terrific excitement in which we were all lapped,
    someone might say or do something which might make for trouble later
    on.  The Gospodar's splendid achievement, which was worthy of any
    hero of old romance, had set us all on fire.  He himself must have
    been wrought to a high pitch of excitement to dare such an act; and
    it is not at such a time that discretion must be expected from any
    man.  Most of all did I fear danger from the womanhood of the
    Voivodin.  Had I not assisted at her marriage, I might not have
    understood then what it must have been to her to be saved from such a
    doom at such a time by such a man, who was so much to her, and in
    such a way.  It would have been only natural if at such a moment of
    gratitude and triumph she had proclaimed the secret which we of the
    Council of the Nation and her father's Commissioners had so
    religiously kept.  But none of us knew then either the Voivodin or
    the Gospodar Rupert as we do now.  It was well that they were as they
    are, for the jealousy and suspicion of our mountaineers might, even
    at such a moment, and even whilst they throbbed at such a deed, have
    so manifested themselves as to have left a legacy of distrust.  The
    Vladika and I, who of all (save the two immediately concerned) alone
    knew, looked at each other apprehensively.  But at that instant the
    Voivodin, with a swift glance at her husband, laid a finger on her
    lip; and he, with quick understanding, gave assurance by a similar
    sign.  Then she sank before him on one knee, and, raising his hand to
    her lips, kissed it, and spoke:

    "Gospodar Rupert, I owe you all that a woman may owe, except to God.
    You have given me life and honour!  I cannot thank you adequately for
    what you have done; my father will try to do so when he returns.  But
    I am right sure that the men of the Blue Mountains, who so value
    honour, and freedom, and liberty, and bravery, will hold you in their
    hearts for ever!"

    This was so sweetly spoken, with lips that trembled and eyes that
    swam in tears, so truly womanly and so in accord with the custom of
    our nation regarding the reverence that women owe to men, that the
    hearts of our mountaineers were touched to the quick.  Their noble
    simplicity found expression in tears.  But if the gallant Gospodar
    could have for a moment thought that so to weep was unmanly, his
    error would have had instant correction.  When the Voivodin had risen
    to her feet, which she did with queenly dignity, the men around
    closed in on the Gospodar like a wave of the sea, and in a second
    held him above their heads, tossing on their lifted hands as if on
    stormy breakers.  It was as though the old Vikings of whom we have
    heard, and whose blood flows in Rupert's veins, were choosing a chief
    in old fashion.  I was myself glad that the men were so taken up with
    the Gospodar that they did not see the glory of the moment in the
    Voivodin's starry eyes; for else they might have guessed the secret.
    I knew from the Vladika's look that he shared my own satisfaction,
    even as he had shared my anxiety.

    As the Gospodar Rupert was tossed high on the lifted hands of the
    mountaineers, their shouts rose to such a sudden volume that around
    us, as far as I could see, the frightened birds rose from the forest,
    and their noisy alarm swelled the tumult.

    The Gospodar, ever thoughtful for others, was the first to calm
    himself.

    "Come, brothers," he said, "let us gain the hilltop, where we can
    signal to the Castle.  It is right that the whole nation should share
    in the glad tidings that the Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion is free.
    But before we go, let us remove the arms and clothing of these
    carrion marauders.  We may have use for them later on."

    The mountaineers set him down, gently enough.  And he, taking the
    Voivodin by the hand, and calling the Vladika and myself close to
    them, led the way up the ravine path which the marauders had
    descended, and thence through the forest to the top of the hill that
    dominated the valley.  Here we could, from an opening amongst the
    trees, catch a glimpse far off of the battlements of Vissarion.
    Forthwith the Gospodar signalled; and on the moment a reply of their
    awaiting was given.  Then the Gospodar signalled the glad news.  It
    was received with manifest rejoicing.  We could not hear any sound so
    far away, but we could see the movement of lifted faces and waving
    hands, and knew that it was well.  But an instant after came a calm
    so dread that we knew before the semaphore had begun to work that
    there was bad news in store for us.  When the news did come, a bitter
    wailing arose amongst us; for the news that was signalled ran:

    "The Voivode has been captured by the Turks on his return, and is
    held by them at Ilsin."

    In an instant the temper of the mountaineers changed.  It was as
    though by a flash summer had changed to winter, as though the yellow
    glory of the standing corn had been obliterated by the dreary waste
    of snow.  Nay, more: it was as when one beholds the track of the
    whirlwind when the giants of the forest are levelled with the sward.
    For a few seconds there was silence; and then, with an angry roar, as
    when God speaks in the thunder, came the fierce determination of the
    men of the Blue Mountains:

    "To Ilsin!  To Ilsin!" and a stampede in the direction of the south
    began.  For, Illustrious Lady, you, perhaps, who have been for so
    short a time at Vissarion, may not know that at the extreme southern
    point of the Land of the Blue Mountains lies the little port of
    Ilsin, which long ago we wrested from the Turk.

    The stampede was checked by the command, "Halt!" spoken in a
    thunderous voice by the Gospodar.  Instinctively all stopped.  The
    Gospodar Rupert spoke again:

    "Had we not better know a little more before we start on our journey?
    I shall get by semaphore what details are known.  Do you all proceed
    in silence and as swiftly as possible.  The Vladika and I will wait
    here till we have received the news and have sent some instructions,
    when we shall follow, and, if we can, overtake you.  One thing: be
    absolutely silent on what has been.  Be secret of every detail--even
    as to the rescue of the Voivodin--except what I send."

    Without a word--thus showing immeasurable trust--the whole body--not
    a very large one, it is true--moved on, and the Gospodar began
    signalling.  As I was myself expert in the code, I did not require
    any explanation, but followed question and answer on either side.
    The first words the Gospodar Rupert signalled were:

    "Silence, absolute and profound, as to everything which has been."
    Then he asked for details of the capture of the Voivode.  The answer
    ran:

    "He was followed from Flushing, and his enemies advised by the spies
    all along the route.  At Ragusa quite a number of
    strangers--travellers seemingly--went on board the packet.  When he
    got out, the strangers debarked too, and evidently followed him,
    though, as yet, we have no details.  He disappeared at Ilsin from the
    Hotel Reo, whither he had gone.  All possible steps are being taken
    to trace his movements, and strictest silence and secrecy are
    observed."

    His answer was:

    "Good!  Keep silent and secret.  Am hurrying back.  Signal request to
    Archbishop and all members of National Council to come to Gadaar with
    all speed.  There the yacht will meet him.  Tell Rooke take yacht all
    speed to Gadaar; there meet Archbishop and Council--give him list of
    names--and return full speed.  Have ready plenty arms, six flying
    artillery.  Two hundred men, provisions three days.  Silence,
    silence.  All depends on that.  All to go on as usual at Castle,
    except to those in secret."

    When the receipt of his message had been signalled, we three--for, of
    course, the Voivodin was with us; she had refused to leave the
    Gospodar--set out hot-foot after our comrades.  But by the time we
    had descended the hill it was evident that the Voivodin could not
    keep up the terrific pace at which we were going.  She struggled
    heroically, but the long journey she had already taken, and the
    hardship and anxiety she had suffered, had told on her.  The Gospodar
    stopped, and said that it would be better that he should press on--it
    was, perhaps, her father's life--and said he would carry her.

    "No, no!" she answered.  "Go on!  I shall follow with the Vladika.
    And then you can have things ready to get on soon after the
    Archbishop and Council arrive."  They kissed each other after, on her
    part, a shy glance at me; and he went on the track of our comrades at
    a great pace.  I could see him shortly after catch them up,--though
    they, too, were going fast.  For a few minutes they ran together, he
    speaking--I could note it from the way they kept turning their heads
    towards him.  Then he broke away from them hurriedly.  He went like a
    stag breaking covert, and was soon out of sight.  They halted a
    moment or two.  Then some few ran on, and all the rest came back
    towards us.  Quickly they improvised a litter with cords and
    branches, and insisted that the Voivodin should use it.  In an
    incredibly short time we were under way again, and proceeding with
    great rapidity towards Vissarion.  The men took it in turns to help
    with the litter; I had the honour of taking a hand in the work
    myself.

    About a third of the way out from Vissarion a number of our people
    met us.  They were fresh, and as they carried the litter, we who were
    relieved were free for speed.  So we soon arrived at the Castle.

    Here we found all humming like a hive of bees.  The yacht, which
    Captain Rooke had kept fired ever since the pursuing party under the
    Gospodar had left Vissarion, was already away, and tearing up the
    coast at a fearful rate.  The rifles and ammunition were stacked on
    the quay.  The field-guns, too, were equipped, and the cases of
    ammunition ready to ship.  The men, two hundred of them, were paraded
    in full kit, ready to start at a moment's notice.  The provision for
    three days was all ready to put aboard, and barrels of fresh water to
    trundle aboard when the yacht should return.  At one end of the quay,
    ready to lift on board, stood also the Gospodar's aeroplane, fully
    equipped, and ready, if need were, for immediate flight.

    I was glad to see that the Voivodin seemed none the worse for her
    terrible experience.  She still wore her shroud; but no one seemed to
    notice it as anything strange.  The whisper had evidently gone round
    of what had been.  But discretion ruled the day.  She and the
    Gospodar met as two who had served and suffered in common; but I was
    glad to notice that both kept themselves under such control that none
    of those not already in the secret even suspected that there was any
    love between them, let alone marriage.

    We all waited with what patience we could till word was signalled
    from the Castle tower that the yacht had appeared over the northern
    horizon, and was coming down fast, keeping inshore as she came.

    When she arrived, we heard to our joy that all concerned had done
    their work well.  The Archbishop was aboard, and of the National
    Council not one was missing.  The Gospodar hurried them all into the
    great hall of the Castle, which had in the meantime been got ready.
    I, too, went with him, but the Voivodin remained without.

    When all were seated, he rose and said:

    "My Lord Archbishop, Vladika, and Lords of the Council all, I have
    dared to summon you in this way because time presses, and the life of
    one you all love--the Voivode Vissarion--is at stake.  This audacious
    attempt of the Turk is the old aggression under a new form.  It is a
    new and more daring step than ever to try to capture your chief and
    his daughter, the Voivodin, whom you love.  Happily, the latter part
    of the scheme is frustrated.  The Voivodin is safe and amongst us.
    But the Voivode is held prisoner--if, indeed, he be still alive.  He
    must be somewhere near Ilsin--but where exactly we know not as yet.
    We have an expedition ready to start the moment we receive your
    sanction--your commands.  We shall obey your wishes with our lives.
    But as the matter is instant, I would venture to ask one question,
    and one only: 'Shall we rescue the Voivode at any cost that may
    present itself?'  I ask this, for the matter has now become an
    international one, and, if our enemies are as earnest as we are, the
    issue is war!"

    Having so spoken, and with a dignity and force which is
    inexpressible, he withdrew; and the Council, having appointed a
    scribe--the monk Cristoferos, whom I had suggested--began its work.

    The Archbishop spoke:

    "Lords of the Council of the Blue Mountains, I venture to ask you
    that the answer to the Gospodar Rupert be an instant 'Yes!' together
    with thanks and honour to that gallant Englisher, who has made our
    cause his own, and who has so valiantly rescued our beloved Voivodin
    from the ruthless hands of our enemies."  Forthwith the oldest member
    of the Council--Nicolos of Volok--rose, and, after throwing a
    searching look round the faces of all, and seeing grave nods of
    assent--for not a word was spoken--said to him who held the door:
    "Summon the Gospodar Rupert forthwith!"  When Rupert entered, he
    spoke to him:

    "Gospodar Rupert, the Council of the Blue Mountains has only one
    answer to give: Proceed!  Rescue the Voivode Vissarion, whatever the
    cost may be!  You hold henceforth in your hand the handjar of our
    nation, as already, for what you have done in your valiant rescue of
    our beloved Voivodin, your breast holds the heart of our people.
    Proceed at once!  We give you, I fear, little time; but we know that
    such is your own wish.  Later, we shall issue formal authorization,
    so that if war may ensue, our allies may understand that you have
    acted for the nation, and also such letters credential as may be
    required by you in this exceptional service.  These shall follow you
    within an hour.  For our enemies we take no account.  See, we draw
    the handjar that we offer you."  As one man all in the hall drew
    their handjars, which flashed as a blaze of lightning.

    There did not seem to be an instant's delay.  The Council broke up,
    and its members, mingling with the people without, took active part
    in the preparations.  Not many minutes had elapsed when the yacht,
    manned and armed and stored as arranged, was rushing out of the
    creek.  On the bridge, beside Captain Rooke, stood the Gospodar
    Rupert and the still-shrouded form of the Voivodin Teuta.  I myself
    was on the lower deck with the soldiers, explaining to certain of
    them the special duties which they might be called on to fulfil.  I
    held the list which the Gospodar Rupert had prepared whilst we were
    waiting for the yacht to arrive from Gadaar.

                                                         PETROF VLASTIMIR.



FROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                           _July_ 9, 1907.

We went at a terrific pace down the coast, keeping well inshore so as to
avoid, if possible, being seen from the south.  Just north of Ilsin a
rocky headland juts out, and that was our cover.  On the north of the
peninsula is a small land-locked bay, with deep water.  It is large
enough to take the yacht, though a much larger vessel could not safely
enter.  We ran in, and anchored close to the shore, which has a rocky
frontage--a natural shelf of rock, which is practically the same as a
quay.  Here we met the men who had come from Ilsin and the neighbourhood
in answer to our signalling earlier in the day.  They gave us the latest
information regarding the kidnapping of the Voivode, and informed us that
every man in that section of the country was simply aflame about it.
They assured us that we could rely on them, not merely to fight to the
death, but to keep silence absolutely.  Whilst the seamen, under the
direction of Rooke, took the aeroplane on shore and found a suitable
place for it, where it was hidden from casual view, but from which it
could be easily launched, the Vladika and I--and, of course, my
wife--were hearing such details as were known of the disappearance of her
father.

It seems that he travelled secretly in order to avoid just such a
possibility as has happened.  No one knew of his coming till he came to
Fiume, whence he sent a guarded message to the Archbishop, which the
latter alone would understand.  But this Turkish agents were evidently on
his track all the time, and doubtless the Bureau of Spies was kept well
advised.  He landed at Ilsin from a coasting steamer from Ragusa to the
Levant.

For two days before his coming there had been quite an unusual number of
arrivals at the little port, at which arrivals are rare.  And it turned
out that the little hotel--the only fairly good one in Ilsin--was almost
filled up.  Indeed, only one room was left, which the Voivode took for
the night.  The innkeeper did not know the Voivode in his disguise, but
suspected who it was from the description.  He dined quietly, and went to
bed.  His room was at the back, on the ground-floor, looking out on the
bank of the little River Silva, which here runs into the harbour.  No
disturbance was heard in the night.  Late in the morning, when the
elderly stranger had not made his appearance, inquiry was made at his
door.  He did not answer, so presently the landlord forced the door, and
found the room empty.  His luggage was seemingly intact, only the clothes
which he had worn were gone.  A strange thing was that, though the bed
had been slept in and his clothes were gone, his night-clothes were not
to be found, from which it was argued by the local authorities, when they
came to make inquiry, that he had gone or been taken from the room in his
night-gear, and that his clothes had been taken with him.  There was
evidently some grim suspicion on the part of the authorities, for they
had commanded absolute silence on all in the house.  When they came to
make inquiry as to the other guests, it was found that one and all had
gone in the course of the morning, after paying their bills.  None of
them had any heavy luggage, and there was nothing remaining by which they
might be traced or which would afford any clue to their identity.  The
authorities, having sent a confidential report to the seat of government,
continued their inquiries, and even now all available hands were at work
on the investigation.  When I had signalled to Vissarion, before my
arrival there, word had been sent through the priesthood to enlist in the
investigation the services of all good men, so that every foot of ground
in that section of the Blue Mountains was being investigated.  The
port-master was assured by his watchmen that no vessel, large or small,
had heft the harbour during the night.  The inference, therefore, was
that the Voivode's captors had made inland with him--if, indeed, they
were not already secreted in or near the town.

Whilst we were receiving the various reports, a hurried message came that
it was now believed that the whole party were in the Silent Tower.  This
was a well-chosen place for such an enterprise.  It was a massive tower
of immense strength, built as a memorial--and also as a "keep"--after one
of the massacres of the invading Turks.

It stood on the summit of a rocky knoll some ten miles inland from the
Port of Ilsin.  It was a place shunned as a rule, and the country all
around it was so arid and desolate that there were no residents near it.
As it was kept for state use, and might be serviceable in time of war, it
was closed with massive iron doors, which were kept locked except upon
certain occasions.  The keys were at the seat of government at Plazac.
If, therefore, it had been possible to the Turkish marauders to gain
entrance and exit, it might be a difficult as well as a dangerous task to
try to cut the Voivode out.  His presence with them was a dangerous
menace to any force attacking them, for they would hold his life as a
threat.

I consulted with the Vladika at once as to what was best to be done.  And
we decided that, though we should put a cordon of guards around it at a
safe distance to prevent them receiving warning, we should at present
make no attack.

We made further inquiry as to whether there had been any vessel seen in
the neighbourhood during the past few days, and were informed that once
or twice a warship had been seen on the near side of the southern
horizon.  This was evidently the ship which Rooke had seen on his rush
down the coast after the abduction of the Voivodin, and which he had
identified as a Turkish vessel.  The glimpses of her which had been had
were all in full daylight--there was no proof that she had not stolen up
during the night-time without lights.  But the Vladika and I were
satisfied that the Turkish vessel was watching--was in league with both
parties of marauders--and was intended to take off any of the strangers,
or their prey, who might reach Ilsin undetected.  It was evidently with
this view that the kidnappers of Teuta had, in the first instance, made
with all speed for the south.  It was only when disappointed there that
they headed up north, seeking in desperation for some chance of crossing
the border.  That ring of steel had so far well served its purpose.

I sent for Rooke, and put the matter before him.  He had thought it out
for himself to the same end as we had.  His deduction was:

"Let us keep the cordon, and watch for any signal from the Silent Tower.
The Turks will tire before we shall.  I undertake to watch the Turkish
warship.  During the night I shall run down south, without lights, and
have a look at her, even if I have to wait till the grey of the dawn to
do so.  She may see us; but if she does I shall crawl away at such pace
that she shall not get any idea of our speed.  She will certainly come
nearer before a day is over, for be sure the bureau of spies is kept
advised, and they know that when the country is awake each day increases
the hazard of them and their plans being discovered.  From their caution
I gather that they do not court discovery; and from that that they do not
wish for an open declaration of war.  If this be so, why should we not
come out to them and force an issue if need be?"

When Teuta and I got a chance to be alone, we discussed the situation in
every phase.  The poor girl was in a dreadful state of anxiety regarding
her father's safety.  At first she was hardly able to speak, or even to
think, coherently.  Her utterance was choked, and her reasoning palsied
with indignation.  But presently the fighting blood of her race restored
her faculties, and then her woman's quick wit was worth the reasoning of
a camp full of men.  Seeing that she was all on fire with the subject, I
sat still and waited, taking care not to interrupt her.  For quite a long
time she sat still, whilst the coming night thickened.  When she spoke,
the whole plan of action, based on subtle thinking, had mapped itself out
in her mind:

"We must act quickly.  Every hour increases the risk to my father."  Here
her voice broke for an instant; but she recovered herself and went on:

"If you go to the ship, I must not go with you.  It would not do for me
to be seen.  The Captain doubtless knows of both attempts: that to carry
me off as well as that against my father.  As yet he is in ignorance of
what has happened.  You and your party of brave, loyal men did their work
so well that no news could go forth.  So long, therefore, as the naval
Captain is ignorant, he must delay till the last.  But if he saw me he
would know that _that_ branch of the venture had miscarried.  He would
gather from our being here that we had news of my father's capture, and
as he would know that the marauders would fail unless they were relieved
by force, he would order the captive to be slain."

"Yes, dear, to-morrow you had, perhaps, better see the Captain, but
to-night we must try to rescue my father.  Here I think I see a way.  You
have your aeroplane.  Please take me with you into the Silent Tower."

"Not for a world of chrysolite!" said I, horrified.  She took my hand and
held it tight whilst she went on:

"Dear, I know, I know!  Be satisfied.  But it is the only way.  You can,
I know, get there, and in the dark.  But if you were to go in it, it
would give warning to the enemies, and besides, my father would not
understand.  Remember, he does not know you; he has never seen you, and
does not, I suppose, even know as yet of your existence.  But he would
know me at once, and in any dress.  You can manage to lower me into the
Tower by a rope from the aeroplane.  The Turks as yet do not know of our
pursuit, and doubtless rely, at all events in part, on the strength and
security of the Tower.  Therefore their guard will be less active than it
would at first or later on.  I shall post father in all details, and we
shall be ready quickly.  Now, dear, let us think out the scheme together.
Let your man's wit and experience help my ignorance, and we shall save my
father!"

How could I have resisted such pleading--even had it not seemed wise?
But wise it was; and I, who knew what the aeroplane could do under my own
guidance, saw at once the practicalities of the scheme.  Of course there
was a dreadful risk in case anything should go wrong.  But we are at
present living in a world of risks--and her father's life was at stake.
So I took my dear wife in my arms, and told her that my mind was hers for
this, as my soul and body already were.  And I cheered her by saying that
I thought it might be done.

I sent for Rooke, and told him of the new adventure, and he quite agreed
with me in the wisdom of it.  I then told him that he would have to go
and interview the Captain of the Turkish warship in the morning, if I did
not turn up.  "I am going to see the Vladika," I said.  "He will lead our
own troops in the attack on the Silent Tower.  But it will rest with you
to deal with the warship.  Ask the Captain to whom or what nation the
ship belongs.  He is sure to refuse to tell.  In such case mention to him
that if he flies no nation's flag, his vessel is a pirate ship, and that
you, who are in command of the navy of the Blue Mountains, will deal with
him as a pirate is dealt with--no quarter, no mercy.  He will temporize,
and perhaps try a bluff; but when things get serious with him he will
land a force, or try to, and may even prepare to shell the town.  He will
threaten to, at any rate.  In such case deal with him as you think best,
or as near to it as you can."  He answered:

"I shall carry out your wishes with my life.  It is a righteous task.
Not that anything of that sort would ever stand in my way.  If he attacks
our nation, either as a Turk or a pirate, I shall wipe him out.  We shall
see what our own little packet can do.  Moreover, any of the marauders
who have entered the Blue Mountains, from sea or otherwise, shall never
get out by sea!  I take it that we of my contingent shall cover the
attacking party.  It will be a sorry time for us all if that happens
without our seeing you and the Voivodin; for in such case we shall
understand the worst!"  Iron as he was, the man trembled.

"That is so, Rooke," I said.  "We are taking a desperate chance, we know.
But the case is desperate!  But we all have our duty to do, whatever
happens.  Ours and yours is stern; but when we have done it, the result
will be that life will be easier for others--for those that are left."

Before he left, I asked him to send up to me three suits of the Masterman
bullet-proof clothes of which we had a supply on the yacht.

"Two are for the Voivodin and myself," I said; "the third is for the
Voivode to put on.  The Voivodin will take it with her when she descends
from the aeroplane into the Tower."

Whilst any daylight was left I went out to survey the ground.  My wife
wanted to come with me, but I would not let her.  "No," said I; "you will
have at the best a fearful tax on your strength and your nerves.  You
will want to be as fresh as is possible when you get on the aeroplane."
Like a good wife, she obeyed, and lay down to rest in the little tent
provided for her.

I took with me a local man who knew the ground, and who was trusted to be
silent.  We made a long detour when we had got as near the Silent Tower
as we could without being noticed.  I made notes from my compass as to
directions, and took good notice of anything that could possibly serve as
a landmark.  By the time we got home I was pretty well satisfied that if
all should go well I could easily sail over the Tower in the dark.  Then
I had a talk with my wife, and gave her full instructions:

"When we arrive over the Tower," I said, "I shall lower you with a long
rope.  You will have a parcel of food and spirit for your father in case
he is fatigued or faint; and, of course, the bullet-proof suit, which he
must put on at once.  You will also have a short rope with a belt at
either end--one for your father, the other for you.  When I turn the
aeroplane and come back again, you will have ready the ring which lies
midway between the belts.  This you will catch into the hook at the end
of the lowered rope.  When all is secure, and I have pulled you both up
by the windlass so as to clear the top, I shall throw out ballast which
we shall carry on purpose, and away we go!  I am sorry it must be so
uncomfortable for you both, but there is no other way.  When we get well
clear of the Tower, I shall take you both up on the platform.  If
necessary, I shall descend to do it--and then we shall steer for Ilsin."

"When all is safe, our men will attack the Tower.  We must let them do
it, for they expect it.  A few men in the clothes and arms which we took
from your captors will be pursued by some of ours.  It is all arranged.
They will ask the Turks to admit them, and if the latter have not learned
of your father's escape, perhaps they will do so.  Once in, our men will
try to open the gate.  The chances are against them, poor fellows! but
they are all volunteers, and will die fighting.  If they win out, great
glory will be theirs."

"The moon does not rise to-night till just before midnight, so we have
plenty of time.  We shall start from here at ten.  If all be well, I
shall place you in the Tower with your father in less than a quarter-hour
from that.  A few minutes will suffice to clothe him in bullet-proof and
get on his belt.  I shall not be away from the Tower more than a very few
minutes, and, please God, long before eleven we shall be safe.  Then the
Tower can be won in an attack by our mountaineers.  Perhaps, when the
guns are heard on the ship of war--for there is sure to be firing--the
Captain may try to land a shore party.  But Rooke will stand in the way,
and if I know the man and _The Lady_, we shall not be troubled with many
Turks to-night.  By midnight you and your father can be on the way to
Vissarion.  I can interview the naval Captain in the morning."

My wife's marvellous courage and self-possession stood to her.  At half
an hour before the time fixed she was ready for our adventure.  She had
improved the scheme in one detail.  She had put on her own belt and
coiled the rope round her waist, so the only delay would be in bringing
her father's belt.  She would keep the bullet-proof dress intended to be
his strapped in a packet on her back, so that if occasion should be
favourable he would not want to put it on till he and she should have
reached the platform of the aeroplane.  In such case, I should not steer
away from the Tower at all, but would pass slowly across it and take up
the captive and his brave daughter before leaving.  I had learned from
local sources that the Tower was in several stories.  Entrance was by the
foot, where the great iron-clad door was; then came living-rooms and
storage, and an open space at the top.  This would probably be thought
the best place for the prisoner, for it was deep-sunk within the massive
walls, wherein was no loophole of any kind.  This, if it should so
happen, would be the disposition of things best for our plan.  The guards
would at this time be all inside the Tower--probably resting, most of
them--so that it was possible that no one might notice the coming of the
airship.  I was afraid to think that all might turn out so well, for in
such case our task would be a simple enough one, and would in all human
probability be crowned with success.

At ten o'clock we started.  Teuta did not show the smallest sign of fear
or even uneasiness, though this was the first time she had even seen an
aeroplane at work.  She proved to be an admirable passenger for an
airship.  She stayed quite still, holding herself rigidly in the position
arranged, by the cords which I had fixed for her.

When I had trued my course by the landmarks and with the compass lit by
the Tiny my electric light in the dark box, I had time to look about me.
All seemed quite dark wherever I looked--to land, or sea, or sky.  But
darkness is relative, and though each quarter and spot looked dark in
turn, there was not such absolute darkness as a whole.  I could tell the
difference, for instance, between land and sea, no matter how far off we
might be from either.  Looking upward, the sky was dark; yet there was
light enough to see, and even distinguish broad effects.  I had no
difficulty in distinguishing the Tower towards which we were moving, and
that, after all, was the main thing.  We drifted slowly, very slowly, as
the air was still, and I only used the minimum pressure necessary for the
engine.  I think I now understood for the first time the extraordinary
value of the engine with which my Kitson was equipped.  It was noiseless,
it was practically of no weight, and it allowed the machine to progress
as easily as the old-fashioned balloon used to drift before a breeze.
Teuta, who had naturally very fine sight, seemed to see even better than
I did, for as we drew nearer to the Tower, and its round, open top began
to articulate itself, she commenced to prepare for her part of the task.
She it was who uncoiled the long drag-rope ready for her lowering.  We
were proceeding so gently that she as well as I had hopes that I might be
able to actually balance the machine on the top of the curving wall--a
thing manifestly impossible on a straight surface, though it might have
been possible on an angle.

On we crept--on, and on!  There was no sign of light about the Tower, and
not the faintest sound to be heard till we were almost close to the line
of the rising wall; then we heard a sound of something like mirth, but
muffled by distance and thick walls.  From it we took fresh heart, for it
told us that our enemies were gathered in the lower chambers.  If only
the Voivode should be on the upper stage, all would be well.

Slowly, almost inch by inch, and with a suspense that was agonizing, we
crossed some twenty or thirty feet above the top of the wall.  I could
see as we came near the jagged line of white patches where the heads of
the massacred Turks placed there on spikes in old days seemed to give
still their grim warning.  Seeing that they made in themselves a
difficulty of landing on the wall, I deflected the plane so that, as we
crept over the wall, we might, if they became displaced, brush them to
the outside of the wall.  A few seconds more, and I was able to bring the
machine to rest with the front of the platform jutting out beyond the
Tower wall.  Here I anchored her fore and aft with clamps which had been
already prepared.

Whilst I was doing so Teuta had leaned over the inner edge of the
platform, and whispered as softly as the sigh of a gentle breeze:

"Hist! hist!"  The answer came in a similar sound from some twenty feet
below us, and we knew that the prisoner was alone.  Forthwith, having
fixed the hook of the rope in the ring to which was attached her belt, I
lowered my wife.  Her father evidently knew her whisper, and was ready.
The hollow Tower--a smooth cylinder within--sent up the voices from it
faint as were the whispers:

"Father, it is I--Teuta!"

"My child, my brave daughter!"

"Quick, father; strap the belt round you.  See that it is secure.  We
have to be lifted into the air if necessary.  Hold together.  It will be
easier for Rupert to lift us to the airship."

"Rupert?"

"Yes; I shall explain later.  Quick, quick!  There is not a moment to
lose.  He is enormously strong, and can lift us together; but we must
help him by being still, so he won't have to use the windlass, which
might creak."  As she spoke she jerked slightly at the rope, which was
our preconcerted signal that I was to lift.  I was afraid the windlass
might creak, and her thoughtful hint decided me.  I bent my back to the
task, and in a few seconds they were on the platform on which they, at
Teuta's suggestion, lay flat, one at each side of my seat, so as to keep
the best balance possible.

I took off the clamps, lifted the bags of ballast to the top of the wall,
so that there should be no sound of falling, and started the engine.  The
machine moved forward a few inches, so that it tilted towards the outside
of the wall.  I threw my weight on the front part of the platform, and we
commenced our downward fall at a sharp angle.  A second enlarged the
angle, and without further ado we slid away into the darkness.  Then,
ascending as we went, when the engine began to work at its strength, we
turned, and presently made straight for Ilsin.

The journey was short--not many minutes.  It almost seemed as if no time
whatever had elapsed till we saw below us the gleam of lights, and by
them saw a great body of men gathered in military array.  We slackened
and descended.  The crowd kept deathly silence, but when we were amongst
them we needed no telling that it was not due to lack of heart or absence
of joy.  The pressure of their hands as they surrounded us, and the
devotion with which they kissed the hands and feet of both the Voivode
and his daughter, were evidence enough for me, even had I not had my own
share of their grateful rejoicing.

In the midst of it all the low, stern voice of Rooke, who had burst a way
to the front beside the Vladika, said:

"Now is the time to attack the Tower.  Forward, brothers, but in silence.
Let there not be a sound till you are near the gate; then play your
little comedy of the escaping marauders.  And 'twill be no comedy for
them in the Tower.  The yacht is all ready for the morning, Mr. Sent
Leger, in case I do not come out of the scrimmage if the bluejackets
arrive.  In such case you will have to handle her yourself.  God keep
you, my Lady; and you, too, Voivode!  Forward!"

In a ghostly silence the grim little army moved forwards.  Rooke and the
men with him disappeared into the darkness in the direction of the
harbour of Ilsin.



FROM THE SCRIPT OF THE VOIVODE, PETER VISSARION,


                                                           _July_ 7, 1907.

I had little idea, when I started on my homeward journey, that it would
have such a strange termination.  Even I, who ever since my boyhood have
lived in a whirl of adventure, intrigue, or diplomacy--whichever it may
be called--statecraft, and war, had reason to be surprised.  I certainly
thought that when I locked myself into my room in the hotel at Ilsin that
I would have at last a spell, however short, of quiet.  All the time of
my prolonged negotiations with the various nationalities I had to be at
tension; so, too, on my homeward journey, lest something at the last
moment should happen adversely to my mission.  But when I was safe on my
own Land of the Blue Mountains, and laid my head on my pillow, where only
friends could be around me, I thought I might forget care.

But to wake with a rude hand over my mouth, and to feel myself grasped
tight by so many hands that I could not move a limb, was a dreadful
shock.  All after that was like a dreadful dream.  I was rolled in a
great rug so tightly that I could hardly breathe, let alone cry out.
Lifted by many hands through the window, which I could hear was softly
opened and shut for the purpose, and carried to a boat.  Again lifted
into some sort of litter, on which I was borne a long distance, but with
considerable rapidity.  Again lifted out and dragged through a doorway
opened on purpose--I could hear the clang as it was shut behind me.  Then
the rug was removed, and I found myself, still in my night-gear, in the
midst of a ring of men.  There were two score of them, all Turks, all
strong-looking, resolute men, armed to the teeth.  My clothes, which had
been taken from my room, were thrown down beside me, and I was told to
dress.  As the Turks were going from the room--shaped like a vault--where
we then were, the last of them, who seemed to be some sort of officer,
said:

"If you cry out or make any noise whatever whilst you are in this Tower,
you shall die before your time!"  Presently some food and water were
brought me, and a couple of blankets.  I wrapped myself up and slept till
early in the morning.  Breakfast was brought, and the same men filed in.
In the presence of them all the same officer said:

"I have given instructions that if you make any noise or betray your
presence to anyone outside this Tower, the nearest man is to restore you
to immediate quiet with his yataghan.  It you promise me that you will
remain quiet whilst you are within the Tower, I can enlarge your
liberties somewhat.  Do you promise?"  I promised as he wished; there was
no need to make necessary any stricter measure of confinement.  Any
chance of escape lay in having the utmost freedom allowed to me.
Although I had been taken away with such secrecy, I knew that before long
there would be pursuit.  So I waited with what patience I could.  I was
allowed to go on the upper platform--a consideration due, I am convinced,
to my captors' wish for their own comfort rather than for mine.

It was not very cheering, for during the daytime I had satisfied myself
that it would be quite impossible for even a younger and more active man
than I am to climb the walls.  They were built for prison purposes, and a
cat could not find entry for its claws between the stones.  I resigned
myself to my fate as well as I could.  Wrapping my blanket round me, I
lay down and looked up at the sky.  I wished to see it whilst I could.  I
was just dropping to sleep--the unutterable silence of the place broken
only now and again by some remark by my captors in the rooms below
me--when there was a strange appearance just over me--an appearance so
strange that I sat up, and gazed with distended eyes.

Across the top of the tower, some height above, drifted, slowly and
silently, a great platform.  Although the night was dark, it was so much
darker where I was within the hollow of the Tower that I could actually
see what was above me.  I knew it was an aeroplane--one of which I had
seen in Washington.  A man was seated in the centre, steering; and beside
him was a silent figure of a woman all wrapped in white.  It made my
heart beat to see her, for she was figured something like my Teuta, but
broader, less shapely.  She leaned over, and a whispered "Ssh!" crept
down to me.  I answered in similar way.  Whereupon she rose, and the man
lowered her down into the Tower.  Then I saw that it was my dear daughter
who had come in this wonderful way to save me.  With infinite haste she
helped me to fasten round my waist a belt attached to a rope, which was
coiled round her; and then the man, who was a giant in strength as well
as stature, raised us both to the platform of the aeroplane, which he set
in motion without an instant's delay.

Within a few seconds, and without any discovery being made of my escape,
we were speeding towards the sea.  The lights of Ilsin were in front of
us.  Before reaching the town, however, we descended in the midst of a
little army of my own people, who were gathered ready to advance upon the
Silent Tower, there to effect, if necessary, my rescue by force.  Small
chance would there have been of my life in case of such a struggle.
Happily, however, the devotion and courage of my dear daughter and of her
gallant companion prevented such a necessity.  It was strange to me to
find such joyous reception amongst my friends expressed in such a
whispered silence.  There was no time for comment or understanding or the
asking of questions--I was fain to take things as they stood, and wait
for fuller explanation.

This came later, when my daughter and I were able to converse alone.

When the expedition went out against the Silent Tower, Teuta and I went
to her tent, and with us came her gigantic companion, who seemed not
wearied, but almost overcome with sleep.  When we came into the tent,
over which at a little distance a cordon of our mountaineers stood on
guard, he said to me:

"May I ask you, sir, to pardon me for a time, and allow the Voivodin to
explain matters to you?  She will, I know, so far assist me, for there is
so much work still to be done before we are free of the present peril.
For myself, I am almost overcome with sleep.  For three nights I have had
no sleep, but all during that time much labour and more anxiety.  I could
hold on longer; but at daybreak I must go out to the Turkish warship that
lies in the offing.  She is a Turk, though she does not confess to it;
and she it is who has brought hither the marauders who captured both your
daughter and yourself.  It is needful that I go, for I hold a personal
authority from the National Council to take whatever step may be
necessary for our protection.  And when I go I should be clear-headed,
for war may rest on that meeting.  I shall be in the adjoining tent, and
shall come at once if I am summoned, in case you wish for me before
dawn."  Here my daughter struck in:

"Father, ask him to remain here.  We shall not disturb him, I am sure, in
our talking.  And, moreover, if you knew how much I owe to him--to his
own bravery and his strength--you would understand how much safer I feel
when he is close to me, though we are surrounded by an army of our brave
mountaineers."

"But, my daughter," I said, for I was as yet all in ignorance, "there are
confidences between father and daughter which none other may share.  Some
of what has been I know, but I want to know all, and it might be better
that no stranger--however valiant he may be, or no matter in what measure
we are bound to him--should be present."  To my astonishment, she who had
always been amenable to my lightest wish actually argued with me:

"Father, there are other confidences which have to be respected in like
wise.  Bear with me, dear, till I have told you all, and I am right sure
that you will agree with me.  I ask it, father."

That settled the matter, and as I could see that the gallant gentleman
who had rescued me was swaying on his feet as he waited respectfully, I
said to him:

"Rest with us, sir.  We shall watch over your sleep."

Then I had to help him, for almost on the instant he sank down, and I had
to guide him to the rugs spread on the ground.  In a few seconds he was
in a deep sleep.  As I stood looking at him, till I had realized that he
vas really asleep, I could not help marvelling at the bounty of Nature
that could uphold even such a man as this to the last moment of work to
be done, and then allow so swift a collapse when all was over, and he
could rest peacefully.

He was certainly a splendid fellow.  I think I never saw so fine a man
physically in my life.  And if the lesson of his physiognomy be true, he
is as sterling inwardly as his external is fair.  "Now," said I to Teuta,
"we are to all intents quite alone.  Tell me all that has been, so that I
may understand."

Whereupon my daughter, making me sit down, knelt beside me, and told me
from end to end the most marvellous story I had ever heard or read of.
Something of it I had already known from the Archbishop Paleologue's
later letters, but of all else I was ignorant.  Far away in the great
West beyond the Atlantic, and again on the fringe of the Eastern seas, I
had been thrilled to my heart's core by the heroic devotion and fortitude
of my daughter in yielding herself for her country's sake to that fearful
ordeal of the Crypt; of the grief of the nation at her reported death,
news of which was so mercifully and wisely withheld from me as long as
possible; of the supernatural rumours that took root so deep; but no word
or hint had come to me of a man who had come across the orbit of her
life, much less of all that has resulted from it.  Neither had I known of
her being carried off, or of the thrice gallant rescue of her by Rupert.
Little wonder that I thought so highly of him even at the first moment I
had a clear view of him when he sank down to sleep before me.  Why, the
man must be a marvel.  Even our mountaineers could not match such
endurance as his.  In the course of her narrative my daughter told me of
how, being wearied with her long waiting in the tomb, and waking to find
herself alone when the floods were out, and even the Crypt submerged, she
sought safety and warmth elsewhere; and how she came to the Castle in the
night, and found the strange man alone.  I said: "That was dangerous,
daughter, if not wrong.  The man, brave and devoted as he is, must answer
me--your father."  At that she was greatly upset, and before going on
with her narrative, drew me close in her arms, and whispered to me:

"Be gentle to me, father, for I have had much to bear.  And be good to
him, for he holds my heart in his breast!"  I reassured her with a gentle
pressure--there was no need to speak.  She then went on to tell me about
her marriage, and how her husband, who had fallen into the belief that
she was a Vampire, had determined to give even his soul for her; and how
she had on the night of the marriage left him and gone back to the tomb
to play to the end the grim comedy which she had undertaken to perform
till my return; and how, on the second night after her marriage, as she
was in the garden of the Castle--going, as she shyly told me, to see if
all was well with her husband--she was seized secretly, muffled up,
bound, and carried off.  Here she made a pause and a digression.
Evidently some fear lest her husband and myself should quarrel assailed
her, for she said:

"Do understand, father, that Rupert's marriage to me was in all ways
regular, and quite in accord with our customs.  Before we were married I
told the Archbishop of my wish.  He, as your representative during your
absence, consented himself, and brought the matter to the notice of the
Vladika and the Archimandrites.  All these concurred, having exacted from
me--very properly, I think--a sacred promise to adhere to my
self-appointed task.  The marriage itself was orthodox in all
ways--though so far unusual that it was held at night, and in darkness,
save for the lights appointed by the ritual.  As to that, the Archbishop
himself, or the Archimandrite of Spazac, who assisted him, or the
Vladika, who acted as Paranymph, will, all or any of them, give you full
details.  Your representative made all inquiries as to Rupert Sent Leger,
who lived in Vissarion, though he did not know who I was, or from his
point of view who I had been.  But I must tell you of my rescue."

And so she went on to tell me of that unavailing journey south by her
captors; of their bafflement by the cordon which Rupert had established
at the first word of danger to "the daughter of our leader," though he
little knew who the "leader" was, or who was his "daughter"; of how the
brutal marauders tortured her to speed with their daggers; and how her
wounds left blood-marks on the ground as she passed along; then of the
halt in the valley, when the marauders came to know that their road north
was menaced, if not already blocked; of the choosing of the murderers,
and their keeping ward over her whilst their companions went to survey
the situation; and of her gallant rescue by that noble fellow, her
husband--my son I shall call him henceforth, and thank God that I may
have that happiness and that honour!

Then my daughter went on to tell me of the race back to Vissarion, when
Rupert went ahead of all--as a leader should do; of the summoning of the
Archbishop and the National Council; and of their placing the nation's
handjar in Rupert's hand; of the journey to Ilsin, and the flight of my
daughter--and my son--on the aeroplane.

The rest I knew.

As she finished, the sleeping man stirred and woke--broad awake in a
second--sure sign of a man accustomed to campaign and adventure.  At a
glance he recalled everything that had been, and sprang to his feet.  He
stood respectfully before me for a few seconds before speaking.  Then he
said, with an open, engaging smile:

"I see, sir, you know all.  Am I forgiven--for Teuta's sake as well as my
own?"  By this time I was also on my feet.  A man like that walks
straight into my heart.  My daughter, too, had risen, and stood by my
side.  I put out my hand and grasped his, which seemed to leap to meet
me--as only the hand of a swordsman can do.

"I am glad you are my son!" I said.  It was all I could say, and I meant
it and all it implied.  We shook hands warmly.  Teuta was pleased; she
kissed me, and then stood holding my arm with one hand, whilst she linked
her other hand in the arm of her husband.

He summoned one of the sentries without, and told him to ask Captain
Rooke to come to him.  The latter had been ready for a call, and came at
once.  When through the open flap of the tent we saw him coming,
Rupert--as I must call him now, because Teuta wishes it; and I like to do
it myself--said:

"I must be off to board the Turkish vessel before it comes inshore.
Good-bye, sir, in case we do not meet again."  He said the last few words
in so low a voice that I only could hear them.  Then he kissed his wife,
and told her he expected to be back in time for breakfast, and was gone.
He met Rooke--I am hardly accustomed to call him Captain as yet, though,
indeed, he well deserves it--at the edge of the cordon of sentries, and
they went quickly together towards the port, where the yacht was lying
with steam up.




BOOK VII: THE EMPIRE OF THE AIR


FROM THE REPORT OF CRISTOFEROS, WAR-SCRIBE TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.


                                                           _July_ 7, 1907.

When the Gospodar Rupert and Captain Rooke came within hailing distance
of the strange ship, the former hailed her, using one after another the
languages of England, Germany, France, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Spain,
Portugal, and another which I did not know; I think it must have been
American.  By this time the whole line of the bulwark was covered by a
row of Turkish faces.  When, in Turkish, the Gospodar asked for the
Captain, the latter came to the gangway, which had been opened, and stood
there.  His uniform was that of the Turkish navy--of that I am prepared
to swear--but he made signs of not understanding what had been said;
whereupon the Gospodar spoke again, but in French this time.  I append
the exact conversation which took place, none other joining in it.  I
took down in shorthand the words of both as they were spoken:

THE GOSPODAR.  "Are you the Captain of this ship?"

THE CAPTAIN.  "I am."

GOSPODAR.  "To what nationality do you belong?"

CAPTAIN.  "It matters not.  I am Captain of this ship."

GOSPODAR.  "I alluded to your ship.  What national flag is she under?"

CAPTAIN (_throwing his eye over the top-hamper_).  "I do not see that any
flag is flying."

GOSPODAR.  "I take it that, as commander, you can allow me on board with
my two companions?"

CAPTAIN.  "I can, upon proper request being made!"

GOSPODAR (_taking off his cap_).  "I ask your courtesy, Captain.  I am
the representative and accredited officer of the National Council of the
Land of the Blue Mountains, in whose waters you now are; and on their
account I ask for a formal interview on urgent matters."

The Turk, who was, I am bound to say, in manner most courteous as yet,
gave some command to his officers, whereupon the companion-ladders and
stage were lowered and the gangway manned, as is usual for the reception
on a ship of war of an honoured guest.

CAPTAIN.  "You are welcome, sir--you and your two companions--as you
request."

The Gospodar bowed.  Our companion-ladder was rigged on the instant, and
a launch lowered.  The Gospodar and Captain Rooke--taking me with
them--entered, and rowed to the warship, where we were all honourably
received.  There were an immense number of men on board, soldiers as well
as seamen.  It looked more like a warlike expedition than a fighting-ship
in time of peace.  As we stepped on the deck, the seamen and marines, who
were all armed as at drill, presented arms.  The Gospodar went first
towards the Captain, and Captain Rooke and I followed close behind him.
The Gospodar spoke:

"I am Rupert Sent Leger, a subject of his Britannic Majesty, presently
residing at Vissarion, in the Land of the Blue Mountains.  I am at
present empowered to act for the National Council in all matters.  Here
is my credential!"  As he spoke he handed to the Captain a letter.  It
was written in five different languages--Balkan, Turkish, Greek, English,
and French.  The Captain read it carefully all through, forgetful for the
moment that he had seemingly been unable to understand the Gospodar's
question spoken in the Turkish tongue.  Then he answered:

"I see the document is complete.  May I ask on what subject you wish to
see me?"

GOSPODAR.  "You are here in a ship of war in Blue Mountain waters, yet
you fly no flag of any nation.  You have sent armed men ashore in your
boats, thus committing an act of war.  The National Council of the Land
of the Blue Mountains requires to know what nation you serve, and why the
obligations of international law are thus broken."

The Captain seemed to wait for further speech, but the Gospodar remained
silent; whereupon the former spoke.

CAPTAIN.  "I am responsible to my own--chiefs.  I refuse to answer your
question."

The Gospodar spoke at once in reply.

GOSPODAR.  "Then, sir, you, as commander of a ship--and especially a ship
of war--must know that in thus violating national and maritime laws you,
and all on board this ship, are guilty of an act of piracy.  This is not
even piracy on the high seas.  You are not merely within territorial
waters, but you have invaded a national port.  As you refuse to disclose
the nationality of your ship, I accept, as you seem to do, your status as
that of a pirate, and shall in due season act accordingly."

CAPTAIN (_with manifest hostility_).  "I accept the responsibility of my
own acts.  Without admitting your contention, I tell you now that
whatever action you take shall be at your own peril and that of your
National Council.  Moreover, I have reason to believe that my men who
were sent ashore on special service have been beleaguered in a tower
which can be seen from the ship.  Before dawn this morning firing was
heard from that direction, from which I gather that attack was made on
them.  They, being only a small party, may have been murdered.  If such
be so, I tell you that you and your miserable little nation, as you call
it, shall pay such blood-money as you never thought of.  I am responsible
for this, and, by Allah! there shall be a great revenge.  You have not in
all your navy--if navy you have at all--power to cope with even one ship
like this, which is but one of many.  My guns shall be trained on Ilsin,
to which end I have come inshore.  You and your companions have free
conduct back to port; such is due to the white flag which you fly.
Fifteen minutes will bring you back whence you came.  Go!  And remember
that whatever you may do amongst your mountain defiles, at sea you cannot
even defend yourselves."

GOSPODAR (_slowly and in a ringing voice_).  "The Land of the Blue
Mountains has its own defences on sea and land.  Its people know how to
defend themselves."

CAPTAIN (_taking out his watch_).  "It is now close on five bells.  At
the first stroke of six bells our guns shall open fire."

GOSPODAR (_calmly_).  "It is my last duty to warn you, sir--and to warn
all on this ship--that much may happen before even the first stroke of
six bells.  Be warned in time, and give over this piratical attack, the
very threat of which may be the cause of much bloodshed."

CAPTAIN (_violently_).  "Do you dare to threaten me, and, moreover, my
ship's company?  We are one, I tell you, in this ship; and the last man
shall perish like the first ere this enterprise fail.  Go!"

With a bow, the Gospodar turned and went down the ladder, we following
him.  In a couple of minutes the yacht was on her way to the port.



FROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL.


                                                          _July_ 10, 1907.

When we turned shoreward after my stormy interview with the pirate
Captain--I can call him nothing else at present, Rooke gave orders to a
quartermaster on the bridge, and _The Lady_ began to make to a little
northward of Ilsin port.  Rooke himself went aft to the wheel-house,
taking several men with him.

When we were quite near the rocks--the water is so deep here that there
is no danger--we slowed down, merely drifting along southwards towards
the port.  I was myself on the bridge, and could see all over the decks.
I could also see preparations going on upon the warship.  Ports were
opened, and the great guns on the turrets were lowered for action.  When
we were starboard broadside on to the warship, I saw the port side of the
steering-house open, and Rooke's men sliding out what looked like a huge
grey crab, which by tackle from within the wheel-house was lowered softly
into the sea.  The position of the yacht hid the operation from sight of
the warship.   The doors were shut again, and the yacht's pace began to
quicken.  We ran into the port.  I had a vague idea that Rooke had some
desperate project on hand.  Not for nothing had he kept the wheel-house
locked on that mysterious crab.

All along the frontage was a great crowd of eager men.  But they had
considerately left the little mole at the southern entrance, whereon was
a little tower, on whose round top a signal-gun was placed, free for my
own use.  When I was landed on this pier I went along to the end, and,
climbing the narrow stair within, went out on the sloping roof.  I stood
up, for I was determined to show the Turks that I was not afraid for
myself, as they would understand when the bombardment should begin.  It
was now but a very few minutes before the fatal hour--six bells.  But all
the same I was almost in a state of despair.  It was terrible to think of
all those poor souls in the town who had done nothing wrong, and who were
to be wiped out in the coming blood-thirsty, wanton attack.  I raised my
glasses to see how preparations were going on upon the warship.

As I looked I had a momentary fear that my eyesight was giving way.  At
one moment I had the deck of the warship focussed with my glasses, and
could see every detail as the gunners waited for the word to begin the
bombardment with the great guns of the barbettes.  The next I saw nothing
but the empty sea.  Then in another instant there was the ship as before,
but the details were blurred.  I steadied myself against the signal-gun,
and looked again.  Not more than two, or at the most three, seconds had
elapsed.  The ship was, for the moment, full in view.  As I looked, she
gave a queer kind of quick shiver, prow and stern, and then sideways.  It
was for all the world like a rat shaken in the mouth of a skilled
terrier.  Then she remained still, the one placid thing to be seen, for
all around her the sea seemed to shiver in little independent eddies, as
when water is broken without a current to guide it.

I continued to look, and when the deck was, or seemed, quite still--for
the shivering water round the ship kept catching my eyes through the
outer rays of the lenses--I noticed that nothing was stirring.  The men
who had been at the guns were all lying down; the men in the
fighting-tops had leaned forward or backward, and their arms hung down
helplessly.  Everywhere was desolation--in so far as life was concerned.
Even a little brown bear, which had been seated on the cannon which was
being put into range position, had jumped or fallen on deck, and lay
there stretched out--and still.  It was evident that some terrible shock
had been given to the mighty war-vessel.  Without a doubt or a thought
why I did so, I turned my eyes towards where _The Lady_ lay, port
broadside now to the inside, in the harbour mouth.  I had the key now to
the mystery of Rooke's proceedings with the great grey crab.

As I looked I saw just outside the harbour a thin line of cleaving water.
This became more marked each instant, till a steel disc with glass eyes
that shone in the light of the sun rose above the water.  It was about
the size of a beehive, and was shaped like one.  It made a straight line
for the aft of the yacht.  At the same moment, in obedience to some
command, given so quietly that I did not hear it, the men went below--all
save some few, who began to open out doors in the port side of the
wheel-house.  The tackle was run out through an opened gangway on that
side, and a man stood on the great hook at the lower end, balancing
himself by hanging on the chain.  In a few seconds he came up again.  The
chain tightened and the great grey crab rose over the edge of the deck,
and was drawn into the wheel-house, the doors of which were closed,
shutting in a few only of the men.

I waited, quite quiet.  After a space of a few minutes, Captain Rooke in
his uniform walked out of the wheel-house.  He entered a small boat,
which had been in the meantime lowered for the purpose, and was rowed to
the steps on the mole.  Ascending these, he came directly towards the
signal-tower.  When he had ascended and stood beside me, he saluted.

"Well?" I asked.

"All well, sir," he answered.  "We shan't have any more trouble with that
lot, I think.  You warned that pirate--I wish he had been in truth a
clean, honest, straightforward pirate, instead of the measly Turkish swab
he was--that something might occur before the first stroke of six bells.
Well, something has occurred, and for him and all his crew that six bells
will never sound.  So the Lord fights for the Cross against the Crescent!
Bismillah.  Amen!"  He said this in a manifestly formal way, as though
declaiming a ritual.  The next instant he went on in the thoroughly
practical conventional way which was usual to him:

"May I ask a favour, Mr. Sent Leger?"

"A thousand, my dear Rooke," I said.  "You can't ask me anything which I
shall not freely grant.  And I speak within my brief from the National
Council.  You have saved Ilsin this day, and the Council will thank you
for it in due time."

"Me, sir?" he said, with a look of surprise on his face which seemed
quite genuine.  "If you think that, I am well out of it.  I was afraid,
when I woke, that you might court-martial me!"

"Court-martial you!  What for?" I asked, surprised in my turn.

"For going to sleep on duty, sir!  And the fact is, I was worn out in the
attack on the Silent Tower last night, and when you had your interview
with the pirate--all good pirates forgive me for the blasphemy!
Amen!--and I knew that everything was going smoothly, I went into the
wheel-house and took forty winks."  He said all this without moving so
much as an eyelid, from which I gathered that he wished absolute silence
to be observed on my part.  Whilst I was revolving this in my mind he
went on:

"Touching that request, sir.  When I have left you and the Voivode--and
the Voivodin, of course--at Vissarion, together with such others as you
may choose to bring there with you, may I bring the yacht back here for a
spell?  I rather think that there is a good deal of cleaning up to be
done, and the crew of _The Lady_ with myself are the men to do it.  We
shall be back by nightfall at the creek."

"Do as you think best, Admiral Rooke," I said.

"Admiral?"

"Yes, Admiral.  At present I can only say that tentatively, but by
to-morrow I am sure the National Council will have confirmed it.  I am
afraid, old friend, that your squadron will be only your flagship for the
present; but later we may do better."

"So long as I am Admiral, your honour, I shall have no other flagship
than _The Lady_.  I am not a young man, but, young or old, my pennon
shall float over no other deck.  Now, one other favour, Mr. Sent Leger?
It is a corollary of the first, so I do not hesitate to ask.  May I
appoint Lieutenant Desmond, my present First Officer, to the command of
the battleship?  Of course, he will at first only command the prize crew;
but in such case he will fairly expect the confirmation of his rank
later.  I had better, perhaps, tell you, sir, that he is a very capable
seaman, learned in all the sciences that pertain to a battleship, and
bred in the first navy in the world."

"By all means, Admiral.  Your nomination shall, I think I may promise
you, be confirmed."

Not another word we spoke.  I returned with him in his boat to _The
Lady_, which was brought to the dock wall, where we were received with
tumultuous cheering.

I hurried off to my Wife and the Voivode.  Rooke, calling Desmond to him,
went on the bridge of _The Lady_, which turned, and went out at terrific
speed to the battleship, which was already drifting up northward on the
tide.



FROM THE REPORT OF CRISTOFEROS, SCRIBE OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE
LAND OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.


                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.

The meeting of the National Council, July 6, was but a continuation of
that held before the rescue of the Voivodin Vissarion, the members of the
Council having been during the intervening night housed in the Castle of
Vissarion.   When, in the early morning, they met, all were jubilant; for
late at night the fire-signal had flamed up from Ilsin with the glad news
that the Voivode Peter Vissarion was safe, having been rescued with great
daring on an aeroplane by his daughter and the Gospodar Rupert, as the
people call him--Mister Rupert Sent Leger, as he is in his British name
and degree.

Whilst the Council was sitting, word came that a great peril to the town
of Ilsin had been averted.  A war-vessel acknowledging to no nationality,
and therefore to be deemed a pirate, had threatened to bombard the town;
but just before the time fixed for the fulfilment of her threat, she was
shaken to such an extent by some sub-aqueous means that, though she
herself was seemingly uninjured, nothing was left alive on board.  Thus
the Lord preserves His own!  The consideration of this, as well as the
other incident, was postponed until the coming Voivode and the Gospodar
Rupert, together with who were already on their way hither.



THE SAME (LATER IN THE SAME DAY).


The Council resumed its sitting at four o'clock.  The Voivode Peter
Vissarion and the Voivodin Teuta had arrived with the "Gospodar Rupert,"
as the mountaineers call him (Mr. Rupert Sent Leger) on the armoured
yacht he calls _The Lady_.  The National Council showed great pleasure
when the Voivode entered the hall in which the Council met.  He seemed
much gratified by the reception given to him.  Mr. Rupert Sent Leger, by
the express desire of the Council, was asked to be present at the
meeting.  He took a seat at the bottom of the hall, and seemed to prefer
to remain there, though asked by the President of the Council to sit at
the top of the table with himself and the Voivode.

When the formalities of such Councils had been completed, the Voivode
handed to the President a memorandum of his report on his secret mission
to foreign Courts on behalf of the National Council.  He then explained
at length, for the benefit of the various members of the Council, the
broad results of his mission.  The result was, he said, absolutely
satisfactory.  Everywhere he had been received with distinguished
courtesy, and given a sympathetic hearing.  Several of the Powers
consulted had made delay in giving final answers, but this, he explained,
was necessarily due to new considerations arising from the international
complications which were universally dealt with throughout the world as
"the Balkan Crisis."  In time, however (the Voivode went on), these
matters became so far declared as to allow the waiting Powers to form
definite judgment--which, of course, they did not declare to him--as to
their own ultimate action.  The final result--if at this initial stage
such tentative setting forth of their own attitude in each case can be so
named--was that he returned full of hope (founded, he might say, upon a
justifiable personal belief) that the Great Powers throughout the
world--North, South, East, and West--were in thorough sympathy with the
Land of the Blue Mountains in its aspirations for the continuance of its
freedom.  "I also am honoured," he continued, "to bring to you, the Great
Council of the nation, the assurance of protection against unworthy
aggression on the part of neighbouring nations of present greater
strength."

Whilst he was speaking, the Gospodar Rupert was writing a few words on a
strip of paper, which he sent up to the President.  When the Voivode had
finished speaking, there was a prolonged silence.  The President rose,
and in a hush said that the Council would like to hear Mr. Rupert Sent
Leger, who had a communication to make regarding certain recent events.

Mr. Rupert Sent Leger rose, and reported how, since he had been entrusted
by the Council with the rescue of the Voivode Peter of Vissarion, he had,
by aid of the Voivodin, effected the escape of the Voivode from the
Silent Tower; also that, following this happy event, the mountaineers,
who had made a great cordon round the Tower so soon as it was known that
the Voivode had been imprisoned within it, had stormed it in the night.
As a determined resistance was offered by the marauders, who had used it
as a place of refuge, none of these escaped.  He then went on to tell how
he sought interview with the Captain of the strange warship, which,
without flying any flag, invaded our waters.  He asked the President to
call on me to read the report of that meeting.  This, in obedience to his
direction, I did.  The acquiescent murmuring of the Council showed how
thoroughly they endorsed Mr. Sent Leger's words and acts.

When I resumed my seat, Mr. Sent Leger described how, just before the
time fixed by the "pirate Captain"--so he designated him, as did every
speaker thereafter--the warship met with some under-sea accident, which
had a destructive effect on all on board her.  Then he added certain
words, which I give verbatim, as I am sure that others will some time
wish to remember them in their exactness:

"By the way, President and Lords of the Council, I trust I may ask you to
confirm Captain Rooke, of the armoured yacht _The Lady_, to be Admiral of
the Squadron of the Land of the Blue Mountains, and also Captain
(tentatively) Desmond, late First-Lieutenant of _The Lady_, to the
command of the second warship of our fleet--the as yet unnamed vessel,
whose former Captain threatened to bombard Ilsin.  My Lords, Admiral
Rooke has done great service to the Land of the Blue Mountains, and
deserves well at your hands.  You will have in him, I am sure, a great
official.  One who will till his last breath give you good and loyal
service."

He had sat down, the President put to the Council resolutions, which were
passed by acclamation.  Admiral Rooke was given command of the navy, and
Captain Desmond confirmed in his appointment to the captaincy of the new
ship, which was, by a further resolution, named _The Gospodar Rupert_.

In thanking the Council for acceding to his request, and for the great
honour done him in the naming of the ship, Mr. Sent Leger said:

"May I ask that the armoured yacht _The Lady_ be accepted by you, the
National Council, on behalf of the nation, as a gift on behalf of the
cause of freedom from the Voivodin Teuta?"

In response to the mighty cheer of the Council with which the splendid
gift was accepted the Gospodar Rupert--Mr. Sent Leger--bowed, and went
quietly out of the room.

As no agenda of the meeting had been prepared, there was for a time, not
silence, but much individual conversation.  In the midst of it the
Voivode rose up, whereupon there was a strict silence.  All listened with
an intensity of eagerness whilst he spoke.

"President and Lords of the Council, Archbishop, and Vladika, I should
but ill show my respect did I hesitate to tell you at this the first
opportunity I have had of certain matters personal primarily to myself,
but which, in the progress of recent events, have come to impinge on the
affairs of the nation.  Until I have done so, I shall not feel that I
have done a duty, long due to you or your predecessors in office, and
which I hope you will allow me to say that I have only kept back for
purposes of statecraft.  May I ask that you will come back with me in
memory to the year 1890, when our struggle against Ottoman aggression,
later on so successfully brought to a close, was begun.  We were then in
a desperate condition.  Our finances had run so low that we could not
purchase even the bread which we required.  Nay, more, we could not
procure through the National Exchequer what we wanted more than
bread--arms of modern effectiveness; for men may endure hunger and yet
fight well, as the glorious past of our country has proved again and
again and again.  But when our foes are better armed than we are, the
penalty is dreadful to a nation small as our own is in number, no matter
how brave their hearts.  In this strait I myself had to secretly raise a
sufficient sum of money to procure the weapons we needed.  To this end I
sought the assistance of a great merchant-prince, to whom our nation as
well as myself was known.  He met me in the same generous spirit which he
had shown to other struggling nationalities throughout a long and
honourable career.  When I pledged to him as security my own estates, he
wished to tear up the bond, and only under pressure would he meet my
wishes in this respect.  Lords of the Council, it was his money, thus
generously advanced, which procured for us the arms with which we hewed
out our freedom.

"Not long ago that noble merchant--and here I trust you will pardon me
that I am so moved as to perhaps appear to suffer in want of respect to
this great Council--this noble merchant passed to his account--leaving to
a near kinsman of his own the royal fortune which he had amassed.  Only a
few hours ago that worthy kinsman of the benefactor of our nation made it
known to me that in his last will he had bequeathed to me, by secret
trust, the whole of those estates which long ago I had forfeited by
effluxion of time, inasmuch as I had been unable to fulfil the terms of
my voluntary bond.  It grieves me to think that I have had to keep you so
long in ignorance of the good thought and wishes and acts of this great
man.

"But it was by his wise counsel, fortified by my own judgment, that I was
silent; for, indeed, I feared, as he did, lest in our troublous times
some doubting spirit without our boundaries, or even within it, might
mistrust the honesty of my purposes for public good, because I was no
longer one whose whole fortune was invested within our confines.  This
prince-merchant, the great English Roger Melton--let his name be for ever
graven on the hearts of our people!--kept silent during his own life, and
enjoined on others to come after him to keep secret from the men of the
Blue Mountains that secret loan made to me on their behalf, lest in their
eyes I, who had striven to be their friend and helper, should suffer
wrong repute.  But, happily, he has left me free to clear myself in your
eyes.  Moreover, by arranging to have--under certain contingencies, which
have come to pass--the estates which were originally my own retransferred
to me, I have no longer the honour of having given what I could to the
national cause.  All such now belongs to him; for it was his money--and
his only--which purchased our national armament.

"His worthy kinsman you already know, for he has not only been amongst
you for many months, but has already done you good service in his own
person.  He it was who, as a mighty warrior, answered the summons of the
Vladika when misfortune came upon my house in the capture by enemies of
my dear daughter, the Voivodin Teuta, whom you hold in your hearts; who,
with a chosen band of our brothers, pursued the marauders, and himself,
by a deed of daring and prowess, of which poets shall hereafter sing,
saved her, when hope itself seemed to be dead, from their ruthless hands,
and brought her back to us; who administered condign punishment to the
miscreants who had dared to so wrong her.  He it was who later took me,
your servant, out of the prison wherein another band of Turkish
miscreants held me captive; rescued me, with the help of my dear
daughter, whom he had already freed, whilst I had on my person the
documents of international secrecy of which I have already advised
you--rescued me whilst I had been as yet unsubjected to the indignity of
search.

"Beyond this you know now that of which I was in partial ignorance: how
he had, through the skill and devotion of your new Admiral, wrought
destruction on a hecatomb of our malignant foes.  You who have received
for the nation the splendid gift of the little warship, which already
represents a new era in naval armament, can understand the great-souled
generosity of the man who has restored the vast possessions of my House.
On our way hither from Ilsin, Rupert Sent Leger made known to me the
terms of the trust of his noble uncle, Roger Melton, and--believe me that
he did so generously, with a joy that transcended my own--restored to the
last male of the Vissarion race the whole inheritance of a noble line.

"And now, my Lords of the Council, I come to another matter, in which I
find myself in something of a difficulty, for I am aware that in certain
ways you actually know more of it than even I myself do.  It is regarding
the marriage of my daughter to Rupert Sent Leger.  It is known to me that
the matter has been brought before you by the Archbishop, who, as
guardian of my daughter during my absence on the service of the nation,
wished to obtain your sanction, as till my return he held her safety in
trust.  This was so, not from any merit of mine, but because she, in her
own person, had undertaken for the service of our nation a task of almost
incredible difficulty.  My Lords, were she child of another father, I
should extol to the skies her bravery, her self-devotion, her loyalty to
the land she loves.  Why, then, should I hesitate to speak of her deeds
in fitting terms, since it is my duty, my glory, to hold them in higher
honour than can any in this land?  I shall not shame her--or even
myself--by being silent when such a duty urges me to speak, as Voivode,
as trusted envoy of our nation, as father.  Ages hence loyal men and
women of our Land of the Blue Mountains will sing her deeds in song and
tell them in story.  Her name, Teuta, already sacred in these regions,
where it was held by a great Queen, and honoured by all men, will
hereafter be held as a symbol and type of woman's devotion.  Oh, my
Lords, we pass along the path of life, the best of us but a little time
marching in the sunlight between gloom and gloom, and it is during that
march that we must be judged for the future.  This brave woman has won
knightly spurs as well as any Paladin of old.  So is it meet that ere she
might mate with one worthy of her you, who hold in your hands the safety
and honour of the State, should give your approval.  To you was it given
to sit in judgment on the worth of this gallant Englisher, now my son.
You judged him then, before you had seen his valour, his strength, and
skill exercised on behalf of a national cause.  You judged wisely, oh, my
brothers, and out of a grateful heart I thank you one and all for it.
Well has he justified your trust by his later acts.  When, in obedience
to the summons of the Vladika, he put the nation in a blaze and ranged
our boundaries with a ring of steel, he did so unknowing that what was
dearest to him in the world was at stake.  He saved my daughter's honour
and happiness, and won her safety by an act of valour that outvies any
told in history.  He took my daughter with him to bring me out from the
Silent Tower on the wings of the air, when earth had for me no
possibility of freedom--I, that had even then in my possession the
documents involving other nations which the Soldan would fain have
purchased with the half of his empire.

"Henceforth to me, Lords of the Council, this brave man must ever be as a
son of my heart, and I trust that in his name grandsons of my own may
keep in bright honour the name which in glorious days of old my fathers
made illustrious.  Did I know how adequately to thank you for your
interest in my child, I would yield up to you my very soul in thanks."

The speech of the Voivode was received with the honour of the Blue
Mountains--the drawing and raising of handjars.



FROM RUPERT'S JOURNAL.


                                                          _July_ 14, 1907.

For nearly a week we waited for some message from Constantinople, fully
expecting either a declaration of war, or else some inquiry so couched as
to make war an inevitable result.  The National Council remained on at
Vissarion as the guests of the Voivode, to whom, in accordance with my
uncle's will, I had prepared to re-transfer all his estates.  He was, by
the way, unwilling at first to accept, and it was only when I showed him
Uncle Roger's letter, and made him read the Deed of Transfer prepared in
anticipation by Mr. Trent, that he allowed me to persuade him.  Finally
he said:

"As you, my good friends, have so arranged, I must accept, be it only in
honour to the wishes of the dead.  But remember, I only do so but for the
present, reserving to myself the freedom to withdraw later if I so
desire."

But Constantinople was silent.  The whole nefarious scheme was one of the
"put-up jobs" which are part of the dirty work of a certain order of
statecraft--to be accepted if successful; to be denied in case of
failure.

The matter stood thus: Turkey had thrown the dice--and lost.  Her men
were dead; her ship was forfeit.  It was only some ten days after the
warship was left derelict with every living thing--that is, everything
that had been living--with its neck broken, as Rooke informed me, when he
brought the ship down the creek, and housed it in the dock behind the
armoured gates--that we saw an item in _The Roma_ copied from _The
Constantinople Journal_ of July 9:

    "LOSS OF AN OTTOMAN IRONCLAD WITH ALL HANDS.

    "News has been received at Constantinople of the total loss, with all
    hands, of one of the newest and finest warships in the Turkish
    fleet--_The Mahmoud_, Captain Ali Ali--which foundered in a storm on
    the night of July 5, some distance off Cabrera, in the Balearic
    Isles.  There were no survivors, and no wreckage was discovered by
    the ships which went in relief--the _Pera_ and the _Mustapha_--or
    reported from anywhere along the shores of the islands, of which
    exhaustive search was made.  _The Mahmoud_ was double-manned, as she
    carried a full extra crew sent on an educational cruise on the most
    perfectly scientifically equipped warship on service in the
    Mediterranean waters."

When the Voivode and I talked over the matter, he said:

"After all, Turkey is a shrewd Power.  She certainly seems to know when
she is beaten, and does not intend to make a bad thing seem worse in the
eyes of the world."

Well, 'tis a bad wind that blows good to nobody.  As _The Mahmoud_ was
lost off the Balearics, it cannot have been her that put the marauders on
shore and trained her big guns on Ilsin.  We take it, therefore, that the
latter must have been a pirate, and as we have taken her derelict in our
waters, she is now ours in all ways.  Anyhow, she is ours, and is the
first ship of her class in the navy of the Blue Mountains.  I am inclined
to think that even if she was--or is still--a Turkish ship, Admiral Rooke
would not be inclined to let her go.  As for Captain Desmond, I think he
would go straight out of his mind if such a thing was to be even
suggested to him.

It will be a pity if we have any more trouble, for life here is very
happy with us all now.  The Voivode is, I think, like a man in a dream.
Teuta is ideally happy, and the real affection which sprang up between
them when she and Aunt Janet met is a joy to think of.  I had posted
Teuta about her, so that when they should meet my wife might not, by any
inadvertence, receive or cause any pain.  But the moment Teuta saw her
she ran straight over to her and lifted her in her strong young arms,
and, raising her up as one would lift a child, kissed her.  Then, when
she had put her sitting in the chair from which she had arisen when we
entered the room, she knelt down before her, and put her face down in her
lap.  Aunt Janet's face was a study; I myself could hardly say whether at
the first moment surprise or joy predominated.  But there could be no
doubt about it the instant after.  She seemed to beam with happiness.
When Teuta knelt to her, she could only say:

"My dear, my dear, I am glad!  Rupert's wife, you and I must love each
other very much."  Seeing that they were laughing and crying in each
other's arms, I thought it best to come away and leave them alone.  And I
didn't feel a bit lonely either when I was out of sight of them.  I knew
that where those two dear women were there was a place for my own heart.

When I came back, Teuta was sitting on Aunt Janet's knee.  It seemed
rather stupendous for the old lady, for Teuta is such a splendid creature
that even when she sits on my own knee and I catch a glimpse of us in
some mirror, I cannot but notice what a nobly-built girl she is.

My wife was jumping up as soon as I was seen, but Aunt Janet held her
tight to her, and said:

"Don't stir, dear.  It is such happiness to me to have you there.  Rupert
has always been my 'little boy,' and, in spite of all his being such a
giant, he is so still.  And so you, that he loves, must be my little
girl--in spite of all your beauty and your strength--and sit on my knee,
till you can place there a little one that shall be dear to us all, and
that shall let me feel my youth again.  When first I saw you I was
surprised, for, somehow, though I had never seen you nor even heard of
you, I seemed to know your face.  Sit where you are, dear.  It is only
Rupert--and we both love him."

Teuta looked at me, flushing rosily; but she sat quiet, and drew the old
lady's white head on her young breast.



JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.


                                                           _July_ 8, 1907.

I used to think that whenever Rupert should get married or start on the
way to it by getting engaged--I would meet his future wife with something
of the same affection that I have always had for himself.  But I know now
that what was really in my mind was _jealousy_, and that I was really
fighting against my own instincts, and pretending to myself that I was
not jealous.  Had I ever had the faintest idea that she would be anything
the least like Teuta, that sort of feeling should never have had even a
foothold.  No wonder my dear boy is in love with her, for, truth to tell,
I am in love with her myself.  I don't think I ever met a creature--a
woman creature, of course, I mean--with so many splendid qualities.  I
almost fear to say it, lest it should seem to myself wrong; but I think
she is as good as a woman as Rupert is as a man.  And what more than that
can I say?  I thought I loved her and trusted her, and knew her all I
could, until this morning.

I was in my own room, as it is still called.  For, though Rupert tells me
in confidence that under his uncle's will the whole estate of Vissarion,
Castle and all, really belongs to the Voivode, and though the Voivode has
been persuaded to accept the position, he (the Voivode) will not allow
anything to be changed.  He will not even hear a word of my going, or
changing my room, or anything.  And Rupert backs him up in it, and Teuta
too.  So what am I to do but let the dears have their way?

Well, this morning, when Rupert was with the Voivode at a meeting of the
National Council in the Great Hall, Teuta came to me, and (after closing
the door and bolting it, which surprised me a little) came and knelt down
beside me, and put her face in my lap.  I stroked her beautiful black
hair, and said:

"What is it, Teuta darling?  Is there any trouble?  And why did you bolt
the door?  Has anything happened to Rupert?"  When she looked up I saw
that her beautiful black eyes, with the stars in them, were overflowing
with tears not yet shed.  But she smiled through them, and the tears did
not fall.  When I saw her smile my heart was eased, and I said without
thinking: "Thank God, darling, Rupert is all right."

"I thank God, too, dear Aunt Janet!" she said softly; and I took her in
my arms and laid her head on my breast.

"Go on, dear," I said; "tell me what it is that troubles you?"  This time
I saw the tears drop, as she lowered her head and hid her face from me.

"I'm afraid I have deceived you, Aunt Janet, and that you will
not--cannot--forgive me."

"Lord save you, child!" I said, "there's nothing that you could do that I
could not and would not forgive.  Not that you would ever do anything
base, for that is the only thing that is hard to forgive.  Tell me now
what troubles you."

She looked up in my eyes fearlessly, this time with only the signs of
tears that had been, and said proudly:

"Nothing base, Aunt Janet.  My father's daughter would not willingly be
base.  I do not think she could.  Moreover, had I ever done anything base
I should not be here, for--for--I should never have been Rupert's wife!"

"Then what is it?  Tell your old Aunt Janet, dearie."  She answered me
with another question:

"Aunt Janet, do you know who I am, and how I first met Rupert?"

"You are the Voivodin Teuta Vissarion--the daughter of the Voivode--Or,
rather, you were; you are now Mrs. Rupert Sent Leger.  For he is still an
Englishman, and a good subject of our noble King."

"Yes, Aunt Janet," she said, "I am that, and proud to be it--prouder than
I would be were I my namesake, who was Queen in the old days.  But how
and where did I see Rupert first?"  I did not know, and frankly told her
so.  So she answered her question herself:

"I saw him first in his own room at night."  I knew in my heart that in
whatever she did had been nothing wrong, so I sat silent waiting for her
to go on:

"I was in danger, and in deadly fear.  I was afraid I might die--not that
I fear death--and I wanted help and warmth.  I was not dressed as I am
now!"

On the instant it came to me how I knew her face, even the first time I
had seen it.  I wished to help her out of the embarrassing part of her
confidence, so I said:

"Dearie, I think I know.  Tell me, child, will you put on the frock . . .
the dress . . . costume you wore that night, and let me see you in it?
It is not mere idle curiosity, my child, but something far, far above
such idle folly."

"Wait for me a minute, Aunt Janet," she said, as she rose up; "I shall
not be long."  Then she left the room.

In a very few minutes she was back.  Her appearance might have frightened
some people, for she was clad only in a shroud.  Her feet were bare, and
she walked across the room with the gait of an empress, and stood before
me with her eyes modestly cast down.  But when presently she looked up
and caught my eyes, a smile rippled over her face.  She threw herself
once more before me on her knees, and embraced me as she said:

"I was afraid I might frighten you, dear."  I knew I could truthfully
reassure her as to that, so I proceeded to do so:

"Do not worry yourself, my dear.  I am not by nature timid.  I come of a
fighting stock which has sent out heroes, and I belong to a family
wherein is the gift of Second Sight.  Why should we fear?  We know!
Moreover, I saw you in that dress before.  Teuta, I saw you and Rupert
married!"  This time she herself it was that seemed disconcerted.

"Saw us married!  How on earth did you manage to be there?"

"I was not there.  My Seeing was long before!  Tell me, dear, what day,
or rather what night, was it that you first saw Rupert?"  She answered
sadly:

"I do not know.  Alas!  I lost count of the days as I lay in the tomb in
that dreary Crypt."

"Was your--your clothing wet that night?" I asked.

"Yes.  I had to leave the Crypt, for a great flood was out, and the
church was flooded.  I had to seek help--warmth--for I feared I might
die.  Oh, I was not, as I have told you, afraid of death.  But I had
undertaken a terrible task to which I had pledged myself.  It was for my
father's sake, and the sake of the Land, and I felt that it was a part of
my duty to live.  And so I lived on, when death would have been relief.
It was to tell you all about this that I came to your room to-day.  But
how did you see me--us--married?"

"Ah, my child!" I answered, "that was before the marriage took place.
The morn after the night that you came in the wet, when, having been
troubled in uncanny dreaming, I came to see if Rupert was a'richt, I lost
remembrance o' my dreaming, for the floor was all wet, and that took off
my attention.  But later, the morn after Rupert used his fire in his room
for the first time, I told him what I had dreamt; for, lassie, my dear, I
saw ye as bride at that weddin' in fine lace o'er yer shrood, and
orange-flowers and ithers in yer black hair; an' I saw the stars in yer
bonny een--the een I love.  But oh, my dear, when I saw the shrood, and
kent what it might mean, I expeckit to see the worms crawl round yer
feet.  But do ye ask yer man to tell ye what I tell't him that morn.
'Twill interest ye to know how the hairt o' men can learn by dreams.  Has
he ever tellt ye aught o' this?"

"No, dear," she said simply.  "I think that perhaps he was afraid that
one or other of us, if not both, might be upset by it if he did.  You
see, he did not tell you anything at all of our meeting, though I am sure
that he will be glad when he knows that we both know all about it, and
have told each other everything."

That was very sweet of her, and very thoughtful in all ways, so I said
that which I thought would please her best--that is, the truth:

"Ah, lassie, that is what a wife should be--what a wife should do.
Rupert is blessed and happy to have his heart in your keeping."

I knew from the added warmth of her kiss what I had said had pleased her.

    MY DEAR COUSIN RUPERT,

    We have heard such glowing accounts of Vissarion that I am coming out
    to see you.  As you are yourself now a landowner, you will understand
    that my coming is not altogether a pleasure.  Indeed, it is a duty
    first.  When my father dies I shall be head of the family--the family
    of which Uncle Roger, to whom we were related, was a member.  It is
    therefore meet and fitting that I should know something of our family
    branches and of their Seats.  I am not giving you time for much
    warning, so am coming on immediately--in fact, I shall arrive almost
    as soon as this letter.  But I want to catch you in the middle of
    your tricks.  I hear that the Blue Mountaineer girls are peaches, so
    don't send them _all_ away when you hear I'm coming!

    Do send a yacht up to Fiume to meet me.  I hear you have all sorts of
    craft at Vissarion.  The MacSkelpie, I hear, said you received her as
    a Queen; so I hope you will do the decent by one of your own flesh
    and blood, and the future Head of the House at that.  I shan't bring
    much of a retinue with me.  _I_ wasn't made a billionaire by old
    Roger, so can only take my modest "man Friday"--whose name is
    Jenkinson, and a Cockney at that.  So don't have too much gold lace
    and diamond-hilted scimitars about, like a good chap, or else he'll
    want the very worst--his wyges ryzed.  That old image Rooke that came
    over for Miss McS., and whom by chance I saw at the attorney man's,
    might pilot me down from Fiume.  The old
    gentleman-by-Act-of-Parliament Mr. Bingham Trent (I suppose he has
    hyphened it by this time) told me that Miss McS. said he "did her
    proud" when she went over under his charge.  I shall be at Fiume on
    the evening of Wednesday, and shall stay at the Europa, which is, I
    am told, the least indecent hotel in the place.  So you know where to
    find me, or any of your attendant demons can know, in case I am to
    suffer "substituted service."

                                                 Your affectionate Cousin,
                                              ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON.

    SIR,

    In obedience to your explicit direction that I should meet Mr. Ernest
    R. H. Melton at Fiume, and report to you exactly what occurred,
    "without keeping anything back,"--as you will remember you said, I
    beg to report.

    I brought the steam-yacht _Trent_ to Fiume, arriving there on the
    morning of Thursday.  At 11.30 p.m.  I went to meet the train from
    St. Peter, due 11.40.  It was something late, arriving just as the
    clock was beginning to strike midnight.  Mr. Melton was on board, and
    with him his valet Jenkinson.  I am bound to say that he did not seem
    very pleased with his journey, and expressed much disappointment at
    not seeing Your Honour awaiting him.  I explained, as you directed,
    that you had to attend with the Voivode Vissarion and the Vladika the
    National Council, which met at Plazac, or that otherwise you would
    have done yourself the pleasure of coming to meet him.  I had, of
    course, reserved rooms (the Prince of Wales's suite), for him at the
    Re d'Ungheria, and had waiting the carriage which the proprietor had
    provided for the Prince of Wales when he stayed there.  Mr. Melton
    took his valet with him (on the box-seat), and I followed in a
    _Stadtwagen_ with the luggage.  When I arrived, I found the _maitre
    d'hotel_ in a stupor of concern.  The English nobleman, he said, had
    found fault with everything, and used to him language to which he was
    not accustomed.  I quieted him, telling him that the stranger was
    probably unused to foreign ways, and assuring him that Your Honour
    had every faith in him.  He announced himself satisfied and happy at
    the assurance.  But I noticed that he promptly put everything in the
    hands of the headwaiter, telling him to satisfy the milor at any
    cost, and then went away to some urgent business in Vienna.  Clever
    man!

    I took Mr. Melton's orders for our journey in the morning, and asked
    if there was anything for which he wished.  He simply said to me:

    "Everything is rotten.  Go to hell, and shut the door after you!"
    His man, who seems a very decent little fellow, though he is as vain
    as a peacock, and speaks with a Cockney accent which is simply
    terrible, came down the passage after me, and explained "on his own,"
    as he expressed it, that his master, "Mr. Ernest," was upset by the
    long journey, and that I was not to mind.  I did not wish to make him
    uncomfortable, so I explained that I minded nothing except what Your
    Honour wished; that the steam-yacht would be ready at 7 a.m.; and
    that I should be waiting in the hotel from that time on till Mr.
    Melton cared to start, to bring him aboard.

    In the morning I waited till the man Jenkinson came and told me that
    Mr. Ernest would start at ten.  I asked if he would breakfast on
    board; he answered that he would take his _cafe-complet_ at the
    hotel, but breakfast on board.

    We left at ten, and took the electric pinnace out to the _Trent_,
    which lay, with steam up, in the roads.  Breakfast was served on
    board, by his orders, and presently he came up on the bridge, where I
    was in command.  He brought his man Jenkinson with him.  Seeing me
    there, and not (I suppose) understanding that I was in command, he
    unceremoniously ordered me to go on the deck.  Indeed, he named a
    place much lower.  I made a sign of silence to the quartermaster at
    the wheel, who had released the spokes, and was going, I feared, to
    make some impertinent remark.  Jenkinson joined me presently, and
    said, as some sort of explanation of his master's discourtesy (of
    which he was manifestly ashamed), if not as an amende:

    "The governor is in a hell of a wax this morning."

    When we got in sight of Meleda, Mr. Melton sent for me and asked me
    where we were to land.  I told him that, unless he wished to the
    contrary, we were to run to Vissarion; but that my instructions were
    to land at whatever port he wished.  Whereupon he told me that he
    wished to stay the night at some place where he might be able to see
    some "life."  He was pleased to add something, which I presume he
    thought jocular, about my being able to "coach" him in such matters,
    as doubtless even "an old has-been like you" had still some sort of
    an eye for a pretty girl.  I told him as respectfully as I could that
    I had no knowledge whatever on such subjects, which were possibly of
    some interest to younger men, but of none to me.  He said no more; so
    after waiting for further orders, but without receiving any, I said:

    "I suppose, sir, we shall run to Vissarion?"

    "Run to the devil, if you like!" was his reply, as he turned away.
    When we arrived in the creek at Vissarion, he seemed much
    milder--less aggressive in his manner; but when he heard that you
    were detained at Plazac, he got rather "fresh"--I use the American
    term--again.  I greatly feared there would be a serious misfortune
    before we got into the Castle, for on the dock was Julia, the wife of
    Michael, the Master of the Wine, who is, as you know, very beautiful.
    Mr. Melton seemed much taken with her; and she, being flattered by
    the attention of a strange gentleman and Your Honour's kinsman, put
    aside the stand-offishness of most of the Blue Mountain women.
    Whereupon Mr. Melton, forgetting himself, took her in his arms and
    kissed her.  Instantly there was a hubbub.  The mountaineers present
    drew their handjars, and almost on the instant sudden death appeared
    to be amongst us.  Happily the men waited as Michael, who had just
    arrived on the quay-wall as the outrage took place, ran forward,
    wheeling his handjar round his head, and manifestly intending to
    decapitate Mr. Melton.  On the instant--I am sorry to say it, for it
    created a terribly bad effect--Mr. Melton dropped on his knees in a
    state of panic.  There was just this good use in it--that there was a
    pause of a few seconds.  During that time the little Cockney valet,
    who has the heart of a man in him, literally burst his way forward,
    and stood in front of his master in boxing attitude, calling out:

    "'Ere, come on, the 'ole lot of ye! 'E ain't done no 'arm.  He honly
    kissed the gal, as any man would.  If ye want to cut off somebody's
    'ed, cut off mine.  I ain't afride!"  There was such genuine pluck in
    this, and it formed so fine a contrast to the other's craven attitude
    (forgive me, Your Honour; but you want the truth!), that I was glad
    he was an Englishman, too.  The mountaineers recognized his spirit,
    and saluted with their handjars, even Michael amongst the number.
    Half turning his head, the little man said in a fierce whisper:

    "Buck up, guv'nor!  Get up, or they'll slice ye!  'Ere's Mr. Rooke;
    'e'll see ye through it."

    By this time the men were amenable to reason, and when I reminded
    them that Mr. Melton was Your Honour's cousin, they put aside their
    handjars and went about their work.  I asked Mr. Melton to follow,
    and led the way to the Castle.

    When we got close to the great entrance within the walled courtyard,
    we found a large number of the servants gathered, and with them many
    of the mountaineers, who have kept an organized guard all round the
    Castle ever since the abducting of the Voivodin.  As both Your Honour
    and the Voivode were away at Plazac, the guard had for the time been
    doubled.  When the steward came and stood in the doorway, the
    servants stood off somewhat, and the mountaineers drew back to the
    farther sides and angles of the courtyard.  The Voivodin had, of
    course, been informed of the guest's (your cousin) coming, and came
    to meet him in the old custom of the Blue Mountains.  As Your Honour
    only came to the Blue Mountains recently, and as no occasion has been
    since then of illustrating the custom since the Voivode was away, and
    the Voivodin then believed to be dead, perhaps I, who have lived here
    so long, may explain:

    When to an old Blue Mountain house a guest comes whom it is wished to
    do honour, the Lady, as in the vernacular the mistress of the house
    is called, comes herself to meet the guest at the door--or, rather,
    _outside_ the door--so that she can herself conduct him within.  It
    is a pretty ceremony, and it is said that of old in kingly days the
    monarch always set much store by it.  The custom is that, when she
    approaches the honoured guest (he need not be royal), she bends--or
    more properly kneels--before him and kisses his hand.  It has been
    explained by historians that the symbolism is that the woman, showing
    obedience to her husband, as the married woman of the Blue Mountains
    always does, emphasizes that obedience to her husband's guest.  The
    custom is always observed in its largest formality when a young wife
    receives for the first time a guest, and especially one whom her
    husband wishes to honour.  The Voivodin was, of course, aware that
    Mr. Melton was your kinsman, and naturally wished to make the
    ceremony of honour as marked as possible, so as to show overtly her
    sense of her husband's worth.

    When we came into the courtyard, I held back, of course, for the
    honour is entirely individual, and is never extended to any other, no
    matter how worthy he may be.  Naturally Mr. Melton did not know the
    etiquette of the situation, and so for that is not to be blamed.  He
    took his valet with him when, seeing someone coming to the door, he
    went forward.  I thought he was going to rush to his welcomer.  Such,
    though not in the ritual, would have been natural in a young kinsman
    wishing to do honour to the bride of his host, and would to anyone
    have been both understandable and forgivable.  It did not occur to me
    at the time, but I have since thought that perhaps he had not then
    heard of Your Honour's marriage, which I trust you will, in justice
    to the young gentleman, bear in mind when considering the matter.
    Unhappily, however, he did not show any such eagerness.  On the
    contrary, he seemed to make a point of showing indifference.  It
    seemed to me myself that he, seeing somebody wishing to make much of
    him, took what he considered a safe opportunity of restoring to
    himself his own good opinion, which must have been considerably
    lowered in the episode of the Wine Master's wife.

    The Voivodin, thinking, doubtless, Your Honour, to add a fresh lustre
    to her welcome, had donned the costume which all her nation has now
    come to love and to accept as a dress of ceremonial honour.  She wore
    her shroud.  It moved the hearts of all of us who looked on to see
    it, and we appreciated its being worn for such a cause.  But Mr.
    Melton did not seem to care.  As he had been approaching she had
    begun to kneel, and was already on her knees whilst he was several
    yards away.  There he stopped and turned to speak to his valet, put a
    glass in his eye, and looked all round him and up and down--indeed,
    everywhere except at the Great Lady, who was on her knees before him,
    waiting to bid him welcome.  I could see in the eyes of such of the
    mountaineers as were within my range of vision a growing animosity;
    so, hoping to keep down any such expression, which I knew would cause
    harm to Your Honour and the Voivodin, I looked all round them
    straight in their faces with a fixed frown, which, indeed, they
    seemed to understand, for they regained, and for the time maintained,
    their usual dignified calm.  The Voivodin, may I say, bore the trial
    wonderfully.  No human being could see that she was in any degree
    pained or even surprised.  Mr. Melton stood looking round him so long
    that I had full time to regain my own attitude of calm.  At last he
    seemed to come back to the knowledge that someone was waiting for
    him, and sauntered leisurely forward.  There was so much
    insolence--mind you, not insolence that was intended to appear as
    such--in his movement that the mountaineers began to steal forward.
    When he was close up to the Voivodin, and she put out her hand to
    take his, he put forward _one finger_!  I could hear the intake of
    the breath of the men, now close around, for I had moved forward,
    too.  I thought it would be as well to be close to your guest, lest
    something should happen to him.  The Voivodin still kept her splendid
    self-control.  Raising the finger put forward by the guest with the
    same deference as though it had been the hand of a King, she bent her
    head down and kissed it.  Her duty of courtesy now done, she was
    preparing to rise, when he put his hand into his pocket, and, pulling
    out a sovereign, offered it to her.  His valet moved his hand
    forward, as if to pull back his arm, but it was too late.  I am sure,
    Your Honour, that no affront was intended.  He doubtless thought that
    he was doing a kindness of the sort usual in England when one "tips"
    a housekeeper.  But all the same, to one in her position, it was an
    affront, an insult, open and unmistakable.  So it was received by the
    mountaineers, whose handjars flashed out as one.  For a second it was
    so received even by the Voivodin, who, with face flushing scarlet,
    and the stars in her eves flaming red, sprang to her feet.  But in
    that second she had regained herself, and to all appearances her
    righteous anger passed away.  Stooping, she took the hand of her
    guest and raised it--you know how strong she is--and, holding it in
    hers, led him into the doorway, saying:

    "You are welcome, kinsman of my husband, to the house of my father,
    which is presently my husband's also.  Both are grieved that, duty
    having called them away for the time, they are unable to be here to
    help me to greet you."

    I tell you, Your Honour, that it was a lesson in self-respect which
    anyone who saw it can never forget.  As to me, it makes my flesh
    quiver, old as I am, with delight, and my heart leap.

    May I, as a faithful servant who has had many years of experience,
    suggest that Your Honour should seem--for the present, at any
    rate--not to know any of these things which I have reported, as you
    wished me to do.  Be sure that the Voivodin will tell you her
    gracious self aught that she would wish you to know.  And such
    reticence on your part must make for her happiness, even if it did
    not for your own.

    So that you may know all, as you desired, and that you may have time
    to school yourself to whatever attitude you think best to adopt, I
    send this off to you at once by fleet messenger.  Were the aeroplane
    here, I should take it myself.  I leave here shortly to await the
    arrival of Sir Colin at Otranto.

                                           Your Honour's faithful servant,
                                                                    ROOKE.



JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.


                                                         _August_ 9, 1907.

To me it seems very providential that Rupert was not at home when that
dreadful young man Ernest Melton arrived, though it is possible that if
Rupert had been present he would not have dared to conduct himself so
badly.  Of course, I heard all about it from the maids; Teuta never
opened her lips to me on the subject.  It was bad enough and stupid
enough for him to try to kiss a decent young woman like Julia, who is
really as good as gold and as modest as one of our own Highland lassies;
but to think of him insulting Teuta!  The little beast!  One would think
that a champion idiot out of an Equatorial asylum would know better!  If
Michael, the Wine Master, wanted to kill him, I wonder what my Rupert and
hers would have done?  I am truly thankful that he was not present.  And
I am thankful, too, that I was not present either, for I should have made
an exhibition of myself, and Rupert would not have liked that.  He--the
little beast! might have seen from the very dress that the dear girl wore
that there was something exceptional about her.  But on one account I
should have liked to see her.  They tell me that she was, in her true
dignity, like a Queen, and that her humility in receiving her husband's
kinsman was a lesson to every woman in the Land.  I must be careful not
to let Rupert know that I have heard of the incident.  Later on, when it
is all blown over and the young man has been got safely away, I shall
tell him of it.  Mr. Rooke--Lord High Admiral Rooke, I should say--must
be a really wonderful man to have so held himself in check; for, from
what I have heard of him, he must in his younger days have been worse
than Old Morgan of Panama.  Mr. Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, of Humcroft,
Salop, little knows how near he was to being "cleft to the chine" also.

Fortunately, I had heard of his meeting with Teuta before he came to see
me, for I did not get back from my walk till after he had arrived.
Teuta's noble example was before me, and I determined that I, too, would
show good manners under any circumstances.  But I didn't know how mean he
is.  Think of his saying to me that Rupert's position here must be a
great source of pride to me, who had been his nursery governess.  He said
"nursemaid" first, but then stumbled in his words, seeming to remember
something.  I did not turn a hair, I am glad to say.  It is a mercy Uncle
Colin was not here, for I honestly believe that, if he had been, he would
have done the "cleaving to the chine" himself.  It has been a narrow
escape for Master Ernest, for only this morning Rupert had a message,
sent on from Gibraltar, saying that he was arriving with his clansmen,
and that they would not be far behind his letter.  He would call at
Otranto in case someone should come across to pilot him to Vissarion.
Uncle told me all about that young cad having offered him one finger in
Mr. Trent's office, though, of course, he didn't let the cad see that he
noticed it.  I have no doubt that, when he does arrive, that young man,
if he is here still, will find that he will have to behave himself, if it
be only on Sir Colin's account alone.



THE SAME (LATER).


I had hardly finished writing when the lookout on the tower announced
that the _Teuta_, as Rupert calls his aeroplane, was sighted crossing the
mountains from Plazac.  I hurried up to see him arrive, for I had not as
yet seen him on his "aero."  Mr. Ernest Melton came up, too.  Teuta was,
of course, before any of us.  She seems to know by instinct when Rupert
is coming.

It was certainly a wonderful sight to see the little aeroplane, with
outspread wings like a bird in flight, come sailing high over the
mountains.  There was a head-wind, and they were beating against it;
otherwise we should not have had time to get to the tower before the
arrival.

When once the "aero" had begun to drop on the near side of the mountains,
however, and had got a measure of shelter from them, her pace was
extraordinary.  We could not tell, of course, what sort of pace she came
at from looking at herself.  But we gathered some idea from the rate at
which the mountains and hills seemed to slide away from under her.  When
she got over the foot-hills, which are about ten miles away, she came on
at a swift glide that seemed to throw the distance behind her.  When
quite close, she rose up a little till she was something higher than the
Tower, to which she came as straight as an arrow from the bow, and glided
to her moorings, stopping dead as Rupert pulled a lever, which seemed to
turn a barrier to the wind.  The Voivode sat beside Rupert, but I must
say that he seemed to hold on to the bar in front of him even more firmly
than Rupert held to his steering-gear.

When they had alighted, Rupert greeted his cousin with the utmost
kindness, and bade him welcome to Vissarion.

"I see," he said, "you have met Teuta.  Now you may congratulate me, if
you wish."

Mr. Melton made a long rodomontade about her beauty, but presently,
stumbling about in his speech, said something regarding it being unlucky
to appear in grave-clothes.  Rupert laughed, and clapped him on the
shoulder as he answered:

"That pattern of frock is likely to become a national dress for loyal
women of the Blue Mountains.  When you know something of what that dress
means to us all at present you will understand.  In the meantime, take it
that there is not a soul in the nation that does not love it and honour
her for wearing it."  To which the cad replied:

"Oh, indeed!  I thought it was some preparation for a fancy-dress ball."
Rupert's comment on this ill-natured speech was (for him) quite grumpily
given:

"I should not advise you to think such things whilst you are in this part
of the world, Ernest.  They bury men here for much less."

The cad seemed struck with something--either what Rupert had said or his
manner of saying it--for he was silent for several seconds before he
spoke.

"I'm very tired with that long journey, Rupert.  Would you and Mrs. Sent
Leger mind if I go to my own room and turn in?  My man can ask for a cup
of tea and a sandwich for me."



RUPERT'S JOURNAL.


                                                        _August_ 10, 1907.

When Ernest said he wished to retire it was about the wisest thing he
could have said or done, and it suited Teuta and me down to the ground.
I could see that the dear girl was agitated about something, so thought
it would be best for her to be quiet, and not worried with being civil to
the Bounder.  Though he is my cousin, I can't think of him as anything
else.  The Voivode and I had certain matters to attend to arising out of
the meeting of the Council, and when we were through the night was
closing in.  When I saw Teuta in our own rooms she said at once:

"Do you mind, dear, if I stay with Aunt Janet to-night?  She is very
upset and nervous, and when I offered to come to her she clung to me and
cried with relief."

So when I had had some supper, which I took with the Voivode, I came down
to my old quarters in the Garden Room, and turned in early.

I was awakened a little before dawn by the coming of the fighting monk
Theophrastos, a notable runner, who had an urgent message for me.  This
was the letter to me given to him by Rooke.  He had been cautioned to
give it into no other hand, but to find me wherever I might be, and
convey it personally.  When he had arrived at Plazac I had left on the
aeroplane, so he had turned back to Vissarion.

When I read Rooke's report of Ernest Melton's abominable conduct I was
more angry with him than I can say.  Indeed, I did not think before that
that I could be angry with him, for I have always despised him.  But this
was too much.  However, I realized the wisdom of Rooke's advice, and went
away by myself to get over my anger and reacquire my self-mastery.  The
aeroplane _Teuta_ was still housed on the tower, so I went up alone and
took it out.

When I had had a spin of about a hundred miles I felt better.  The
bracing of the wind and the quick, exhilarating motion restored me to
myself, and I felt able to cope with Master Ernest, or whatever else
chagrinable might come along, without giving myself away.  As Teuta had
thought it better to keep silence as to Ernest's affront, I felt I must
not acknowledge it; but, all the same, I determined to get rid of him
before the day was much older.

When I had had my breakfast I sent word to him by a servant that I was
coming to his rooms, and followed not long behind the messenger.

He was in a suit of silk pyjamas, such as not even Solomon in all his
glory was arrayed in.  I closed the door behind me before I began to
speak.  He listened, at first amazed, then disconcerted, then angry, and
then cowering down like a whipped hound.  I felt that it was a case for
speaking out.  A bumptious ass like him, who deliberately insulted
everyone he came across--for if all or any of his efforts in that way
were due to mere elemental ignorance he was not fit to live, but should
be silenced on sight as a modern Caliban--deserved neither pity nor
mercy.  To extend to him fine feeling, tolerance, and such-like
gentlenesses would be to deprive the world of them without benefit to
any.  So well as I can remember, what I said was something like this:

"Ernest, as you say, you've got to go, and to go quick, you understand.
I dare say you look on this as a land of barbarians, and think that any
of your high-toned refinements are thrown away on people here.  Well,
perhaps it is so.  Undoubtedly, the structure of the country is rough;
the mountains may only represent the glacial epoch; but so far as I can
gather from some of your exploits--for I have only learned a small part
as yet--you represent a period a good deal farther back.  You seem to
have given our folk here an exhibition of the playfulness of the hooligan
of the Saurian stage of development; but the Blue Mountains, rough as
they are, have come up out of the primeval slime, and even now the people
aim at better manners.  They may be rough, primitive, barbarian,
elemental, if you will, but they are not low down enough to tolerate
either your ethics or your taste.  My dear cousin, your life is not safe
here!  I am told that yesterday, only for the restraint exercised by
certain offended mountaineers on other grounds than your own worth, you
would have been abbreviated by the head.  Another day of your fascinating
presence would do away with this restraint, and then we should have a
scandal.  I am a new-comer here myself--too new a comer to be able to
afford a scandal of that kind--and so I shall not delay your going.
Believe me, my dear cousin, Ernest Roger Halbard Melton, of Humcroft,
Salop, that I am inconsolable about your resolution of immediate
departure, but I cannot shut my eyes to its wisdom.  At present the
matter is altogether amongst ourselves, and when you have gone--if it be
immediately--silence will be observed on all hands for the sake of the
house wherein you are a guest; but if there be time for scandal to
spread, you will be made, whether you be alive or dead, a European
laughing-stock.  Accordingly, I have anticipated your wishes, and have
ordered a fast steam yacht to take you to Ancona, or to whatever other
port you may desire.  The yacht will be under the command of Captain
Desmond, of one of our battleships--a most determined officer, who will
carry out any directions which may be given to him.  This will insure
your safety so far as Italian territory.  Some of his officials will
arrange a special carriage for you up to Flushing, and a cabin on the
steamer to Queenboro'.  A man of mine will travel on the train and
steamer with you, and will see that whatever you may wish in the way of
food or comfort will be provided.  Of course, you understand, my dear
cousin, that you are my guest until you arrive in London.  I have not
asked Rooke to accompany you, as when he went to meet you, it was a
mistake.  Indeed, there might have been a danger to you which I never
contemplated--a quite unnecessary danger, I assure you.  But happily
Admiral Rooke, though a man of strong passions, has wonderful
self-control."

"Admiral Rooke?" he queried.  "Admiral?"

"Admiral, certainly," I replied, "but not an ordinary Admiral--one of
many.  He is _the_ Admiral--the Lord High Admiral of the Land of the Blue
Mountains, with sole control of its expanding navy.  When such a man is
treated as a valet, there may be . . . But why go into this?  It is all
over.  I only mention it lest anything of a similar kind should occur
with Captain Desmond, who is a younger man, and therefore with probably
less self-repression."

I saw that he had learned his lesson, and so said no more on the subject.

There was another reason for his going which I did not speak of.  Sir
Colin MacKelpie was coming with his clansmen, and I knew he did not like
Ernest Melton.  I well remembered that episode of his offering one finger
to the old gentleman in Mr. Trent's office, and, moreover, I had my
suspicions that Aunt Janet's being upset was probably in some measure due
to some rudeness of his that she did not wish to speak about.  He is
really an impossible young man, and is far better out of this country
than in it.  If he remained here, there would be some sort of a tragedy
for certain.

I must say that it was with a feeling of considerable relief that I saw
the yacht steam out of the creek, with Captain Desmond on the bridge and
my cousin beside him.

Quite other were my feelings when, an hour after, _The Lady_ came flying
into the creek with the Lord High Admiral on the bridge, and beside him,
more splendid and soldier-like than ever, Sir Colin MacKelpie.  Mr.
Bingham Trent was also on the bridge.

The General was full of enthusiasm regarding his regiment, for in all,
those he brought with him and those finishing their training at home, the
force is near the number of a full regiment.  When we were alone he
explained to me that all was arranged regarding the non-commissioned
officers, but that he had held over the question of officers until we
should have had a suitable opportunity of talking the matter over
together.  He explained to me his reasons, which were certainly simple
and cogent.  Officers, according to him, are a different class, and
accustomed to a different standard altogether of life and living, of
duties and pleasures.  They are harder to deal with and more difficult to
obtain.  "There was no use," he said, "in getting a lot of failures, with
old-crusted ways of their own importance.  We must have young men for our
purpose--that is, men not old, but with some experience--men, of course,
who know how to behave themselves, or else, from what little I have seen
of the Blue Mountaineers, they wouldn't last long here if they went on as
some of them do elsewhere.  I shall start things here as you wish me to,
for I am here, my dear boy, to stay with you and Janet, and we shall, if
it be given to us by the Almighty, help to build up together a new
'nation'--an ally of Britain, who will stand at least as an outpost of
our own nation, and a guardian of our eastern road.  When things are
organized here on the military side, and are going strong, I shall, if
you can spare me, run back to London for a few weeks.  Whilst I am there
I shall pick up a lot of the sort of officers we want.  I know that there
are loads of them to be had.  I shall go slowly, however, and carefully,
too, and every man I bring back will be recommended to me by some old
soldier whom I know, and who knows the man he recommends, and has seen
him work.  We shall have, I dare say, an army for its size second to none
in the world, and the day may come when your old country will be proud of
your new one.  Now I'm off to see that all is ready for my people--your
people now."

I had had arrangements made for the comfort of the clansmen and the
women, but I knew that the good old soldier would see for himself that
his men were to be comfortable.  It was not for nothing that he
was--is--looked on as perhaps the General most beloved by his men in the
whole British Army.

When he had gone, and I was alone, Mr. Trent, who had evidently been
waiting for the opportunity, came to me.  When we had spoken of my
marriage and of Teuta, who seems to have made an immense impression on
him, he said suddenly:

"I suppose we are quite alone, and that we shall not be interrupted?"  I
summoned the man outside--there is always a sentry on guard outside my
door or near me, wherever I may be--and gave orders that I was not to be
disturbed until I gave fresh orders.  "If," I said, "there be anything
pressing or important, let the Voivodin or Miss MacKelpie know.  If
either of them brings anyone to me, it will be all right."

When we were quite alone Mr. Trent took a slip of paper and some
documents from the bag which was beside him.  He then read out items from
the slip, placing as he did so the documents so checked over before him.

1.  New Will made on marriage, to be signed presently.

2.  Copy of the Re-conveyance of Vissarion estates to Peter Vissarion, as
directed by Will of Roger Melton.

3.  Report of Correspondence with Privy Council, and proceedings
following.

Taking up the last named, he untied the red tape, and, holding the bundle
in his hand, went on:

"As you may, later on, wish to examine the details of the Proceedings, I
have copied out the various letters, the originals of which are put
safely away in my strong-room where, of course, they are always available
in case you may want them.  For your present information I shall give you
a rough synopsis of the Proceedings, referring where advisable to this
paper.

"On receipt of your letter of instructions regarding the Consent of the
Privy Council to your changing your nationality in accordance with the
terms of Roger Melton's Will, I put myself in communication with the
Clerk of the Privy Council, informing him of your wish to be naturalized
in due time to the Land of the Blue Mountains.  After some letters
between us, I got a summons to attend a meeting of the Council.

"I attended, as required, taking with me all necessary documents, and
such as I conceived might be advisable to produce, if wanted.

"The Lord President informed me that the present meeting of the Council
was specially summoned in obedience to the suggestion of the King, who
had been consulted as to his personal wishes on the subject--should he
have any.  The President then proceeded to inform me officially that all
Proceedings of the Privy Council were altogether confidential, and were
not to be made public under any circumstances.  He was gracious enough to
add:

"'The circumstances of this case, however, are unique; and as you act for
another, we have thought it advisable to enlarge your permission in the
matter, so as to allow you to communicate freely with your principal.  As
that gentleman is settling himself in a part of the world which has been
in the past, and may be again, united to this nation by some common
interest, His Majesty wishes Mr. Sent Leger to feel assured of the
good-will of Great Britain to the Land of the Blue Mountains, and even of
his own personal satisfaction that a gentleman of so distinguished a
lineage and such approved personal character is about to be--within his
own scope--a connecting-link between the nations.  To which end he has
graciously announced that, should the Privy Council acquiesce in the
request of Denaturalization, he will himself sign the Patent therefor.

"'The Privy Council has therefore held private session, at which the
matter has been discussed in its many bearings; and it is content that
the change can do no harm, but may be of some service to the two nations.
We have, therefore, agreed to grant the prayer of the Applicant; and the
officials of the Council have the matter of the form of Grant in hand.
So you, sir, may rest satisfied that as soon as the formalities--which
will, of course, require the formal signing of certain documents by the
Applicant--can be complied with, the Grant and Patent will obtain.'"

Having made this statement in formal style, my old friend went on in more
familiar way:

"And so, my dear Rupert, all is in hand; and before very long you will
have the freedom required under the Will, and will be at liberty to take
whatever steps may be necessary to be naturalized in your new country.

"I may tell you, by the way, that several members of the Council made
very complimentary remarks regarding you.  I am forbidden to give names,
but I may tell you facts.  One old Field-Marshal, whose name is familiar
to the whole world, said that he had served in many places with your
father, who was a very valiant soldier, and that he was glad that Great
Britain was to have in the future the benefit of your father's son in a
friendly land now beyond the outposts of our Empire, but which had been
one with her in the past, and might be again.

"So much for the Privy Council.  We can do no more at present until you
sign and have attested the documents which I have brought with me.

"We can now formally complete the settlement of the Vissarion estates,
which must be done whilst you are a British citizen.  So, too, with the
Will, the more formal and complete document, which is to take the place
of that short one which you forwarded to me the day after your marriage.
It may be, perhaps, necessary or advisable that, later on, when you are
naturalized here, you shall make a new Will in strictest accordance with
local law."



TEUTA SENT LEGER'S DIARY.


                                                        _August_ 19, 1907.

We had a journey to-day that was simply glorious.  We had been waiting to
take it for more than a week.  Rupert not only wanted the weather
suitable, but he had to wait till the new aeroplane came home.  It is
more than twice as big as our biggest up to now.  None of the others
could take all the party which Rupert wanted to go.  When he heard that
the aero was coming from Whitby, where it was sent from Leeds, he
directed by cable that it should be unshipped at Otranto, whence he took
it here all by himself.  I wanted to come with him, but he thought it
better not.  He says that Brindisi is too busy a place to keep anything
quiet--if not secret--and he wants to be very dark indeed about this, as
it is worked by the new radium engine.  Ever since they found radium in
our own hills he has been obsessed by the idea of an aerial navy for our
protection.  And after to-day's experiences I think he is right.  As he
wanted to survey the whole country at a glimpse, so that the general
scheme of defence might be put in hand, we had to have an aero big enough
to take the party as well as fast enough to do it rapidly, and all at
once.  We had, in addition to Rupert, my father, and myself, Sir Colin
and Lord High Admiral Rooke (I do like to give that splendid old fellow
his full title!).  The military and naval experts had with them
scientific apparatus of various kinds, also cameras and range-finders, so
that they could mark their maps as they required.  Rupert, of course,
drove, and I acted as his assistant.  Father, who has not yet become
accustomed to aerial travel, took a seat in the centre (which Rupert had
thoughtfully prepared for him), where there is very little motion.  I
must say I was amazed to see the way that splendid old soldier Sir Colin
bore himself.  He had never been on an aeroplane before, but, all the
same, he was as calm as if he was on a rock.  Height or motion did not
trouble him.  Indeed, he seemed to _enjoy_ himself all the time.  The
Admiral is himself almost an expert, but in any case I am sure he would
have been unconcerned, just as he was in the _Crab_ as Rupert has told
me.

We left just after daylight, and ran down south.  When we got to the east
of Ilsin, we kept slightly within the border-line, and went north or east
as it ran, making occasional loops inland over the mountains and back
again.  When we got up to our farthest point north, we began to go much
slower.  Sir Colin explained that for the rest all would be comparatively
plain-sailing in the way of defence; but that as any foreign Power other
than the Turk must attack from seaward, he would like to examine the
seaboard very carefully in conjunction with the Admiral, whose advice as
to sea defence would be invaluable.

Rupert was fine.  No one could help admiring him as he sat working his
lever and making the great machine obey every touch.  He was wrapped up
in his work.  I don't believe that whilst he was working he ever thought
of even me.  He _is_ splendid!

We got back just as the sun was dropping down over the Calabrian
Mountains.  It is quite wonderful how the horizon changes when you are
sailing away up high on an aeroplane.  Rupert is going to teach me how to
manage one all by myself, and when I am fit he will give me one, which he
is to have specially built for me.

I think I, too, have done some good work--at least, I have got some good
ideas--from our journey to-day.  Mine are not of war, but of peace, and I
think I see a way by which we shall be able to develop our country in a
wonderful way.  I shall talk the idea over with Rupert to-night, when we
are alone.  In the meantime Sir Colin and Admiral Rooke will think their
plans over individually, and to-morrow morning together.  Then the next
day they, too, are to go over their idea with Rupert and my father, and
something may be decided then.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                        _August_ 21, 1907.

Our meeting on the subject of National Defence, held this afternoon, went
off well.  We were five in all, for with permission of the Voivode and
the two fighting-men, naval and military, I brought Teuta with me.  She
sat beside me quite quietly, and never made a remark of any kind till the
Defence business had been gone through.  Both Sir Colin and Admiral Rooke
were in perfect agreement as to the immediate steps to be taken for
defence.  In the first instance, the seaboard was to be properly
fortified in the necessary places, and the navy largely strengthened.
When we had got thus far I asked Rooke to tell of the navy increase
already in hand.  Whereupon he explained that, as we had found the small
battleship _The Lady_ of an excellent type for coast defence, acting only
in home waters, and of a size to take cover where necessary at many
places on our own shores, we had ordered nine others of the same pattern.
Of these the first four were already in hand, and were proceeding with
the greatest expedition.  The General then supplemented this by saying
that big guns could be used from points judiciously chosen on the
seaboard, which was in all so short a length that no very great quantity
of armament would be required.

"We can have," he said, "the biggest guns of the most perfect kind yet
accomplished, and use them from land batteries of the most up-to-date
pattern.  The one serious proposition we have to deal with is the defence
of the harbour--as yet quite undeveloped--which is known as the 'Blue
Mouth.'  Since our aerial journey I have been to it by sea with Admiral
Rooke in _The Lady_, and then on land with the Vladika, who was born on
its shores, and who knows every inch of it.

"It is worth fortifying--and fortifying well, for as a port it is
peerless in Mediterranean seas.  The navies of the world might ride in
it, land-locked, and even hidden from view seawards.  The mountains which
enclose it are in themselves absolute protection.  In addition, these can
only be assailed from our own territory.  Of course, Voivode, you
understand when I say 'our' I mean the Land of the Blue Mountains, for
whose safety and well-being I am alone concerned.  Any ship anchoring in
the roads of the Blue Mouth would have only one need--sufficient length
of cable for its magnificent depth.

"When proper guns are properly placed on the steep cliffs to north and
south of the entrance, and when the rock islet between has been armoured
and armed as will be necessary, the Mouth will be impregnable.  But we
should not depend on the aiming of the entrance alone.  At certain
salient points--which I have marked upon this map--armour-plated sunken
forts within earthworks should be established.  There should be covering
forts on the hillsides, and, of course, the final summits protected.
Thus we could resist attack on any side or all sides--from sea or land.
That port will yet mean the wealth as well as the strength of this
nation, so it will be well to have it properly protected.  This should be
done soon, and the utmost secrecy observed in the doing of it, lest the
so doing should become a matter of international concern."

Here Rooke smote the table hard.

"By God, that is true!  It has been the dream of my own life for this
many a year."

In the silence which followed the sweet, gentle voice of Teuta came clear
as a bell:

"May I say a word?  I am emboldened to, as Sir Colin has spoken so
splendidly, and as the Lord High Admiral has not hesitated to mention his
dreaming.  I, too, have had a dream--a day-dream--which came in a flash,
but no less a dream, for all that.  It was when we hung on the aeroplane
over the Blue Mouth.  It seemed to me in an instant that I saw that
beautiful spot as it will some time be--typical, as Sir Colin said, of
the wealth as well as the strength of this nation; a mart for the world
whence will come for barter some of the great wealth of the Blue
Mountains.  That wealth is as yet undeveloped.  But the day is at hand
when we may begin to use it, and through that very port.  Our mountains
and their valleys are clad with trees of splendid growth, virgin forests
of priceless worth; hard woods of all kinds, which have no superior
throughout the world.  In the rocks, though hidden as yet, is vast
mineral wealth of many kinds.  I have been looking through the reports of
the geological exports of the Commission of Investigation which my
husband organized soon after he came to live here, and, according to
them, our whole mountain ranges simply teem with vast quantities of
minerals, almost more precious for industry than gold and silver are for
commerce--though, indeed, gold is not altogether lacking as a mineral.
When once our work on the harbour is done, and the place has been made
secure against any attempt at foreign aggression, we must try to find a
way to bring this wealth of woods and ores down to the sea.

"And then, perhaps, may begin the great prosperity of our Land, of which
we have all dreamt."

She stopped, all vibrating, almost choked with emotion.  We were all
moved.  For myself, I was thrilled to the core.  Her enthusiasm was
all-sweeping, and under its influence I found my own imagination
expanding.  Out of its experiences I spoke:

"And there is a way.  I can see it.  Whilst our dear Voivodin was
speaking, the way seemed to clear.  I saw at the back of the Blue Mouth,
where it goes deepest into the heart of the cliffs, the opening of a
great tunnel, which ran upward over a steep slope till it debouched on
the first plateau beyond the range of the encompassing cliffs.  Thither
came by various rails of steep gradient, by timber-shoots and
cable-rails, by aerial cables and precipitating tubes, wealth from over
ground and under it; for as our Land is all mountains, and as these tower
up to the clouds, transport to the sea shall be easy and of little cost
when once the machinery is established.  As everything of much weight
goes downward, the cars of the main tunnel of the port shall return
upward without cost.  We can have from the mountains a head of water
under good control, which will allow of endless hydraulic power, so that
the whole port and the mechanism of the town to which it will grow can be
worked by it.

"This work can be put in hand at once.  So soon as the place shall be
perfectly surveyed and the engineering plans got ready, we can start on
the main tunnel, working from the sea-level up, so that the cost of the
transport of material will be almost nil.  This work can go on whilst the
forts are building; no time need be lost.

"Moreover, may I add a word on National Defence?  We are, though old in
honour, a young nation as to our place amongst Great Powers.  And so we
must show the courage and energy of a young nation.  The Empire of the
Air is not yet won.  Why should not we make a bid for it?  As our
mountains are lofty, so shall we have initial power of attack or defence.
We can have, in chosen spots amongst the clouds, depots of war
aeroplanes, with which we can descend and smite our enemies quickly on
land or sea.  We shall hope to live for Peace; but woe to those who drive
us to War!"

There is no doubt that the Vissarions are a warlike race.  As I spoke,
Teuta took one of my hands and held it hard.  The old Voivode, his eyes
blazing, rose and stood beside me and took the other.  The two old
fighting-men of the land and the sea stood up and saluted.

This was the beginning of what ultimately became "The National Committee
of Defence and Development."

I had other, and perhaps greater, plans for the future in my mind; but
the time had not come for their utterance.

To me it seems not only advisable, but necessary, that the utmost
discretion be observed by all our little group, at all events for the
present.  There seems to be some new uneasiness in the Blue Mountains.
There are constant meetings of members of the Council, but no formal
meeting of the Council, as such, since the last one at which I was
present.  There is constant coming and going amongst the mountaineers,
always in groups, small or large.  Teuta and I, who have been about very
much on the aeroplane, have both noticed it.  But somehow we--that is,
the Voivode and myself--are left out of everything; but we have not said
as yet a word on the subject to any of the others.  The Voivode notices,
but he says nothing; so I am silent, and Teuta does whatever I ask.  Sir
Colin does not notice anything except the work he is engaged on--the
planning the defences of the Blue Mouth.  His old scientific training as
an engineer, and his enormous experience of wars and sieges--for he was
for nearly fifty years sent as military representative to all the great
wars--seem to have become directed on that point.  He is certainly
planning it all out in a wonderful way.  He consults Rooke almost hourly
on the maritime side of the question.  The Lord High Admiral has been a
watcher all his life, and very few important points have ever escaped
him, so that he can add greatly to the wisdom of the defensive
construction.  He notices, I think, that something is going on outside
ourselves; but he keeps a resolute silence.

What the movement going on is I cannot guess.  It is not like the
uneasiness that went before the abduction of Teuta and the Voivode, but
it is even more pronounced.  That was an uneasiness founded on some
suspicion.  This is a positive thing, and has definite meaning--of some
sort.  We shall, I suppose, know all about it in good time.  In the
meantime we go on with our work.  Happily the whole Blue Mouth and the
mountains round it are on my own property, the portion acquired long ago
by Uncle Roger, exclusive of the Vissarion estate.  I asked the Voivode
to allow me to transfer it to him, but he sternly refused and forbade me,
quite peremptorily, to ever open the subject to him again.  "You have
done enough already," he said.  "Were I to allow you to go further, I
should feel mean.  And I do not think you would like your wife's father
to suffer that feeling after a long life, which he has tried to live in
honour."

I bowed, and said no more.  So there the matter rests, and I have to take
my own course.  I have had a survey made, and on the head of it the
Tunnel to the harbour is begun.




BOOK VIII: THE FLASHING OF THE HANDJAR


PRIVATE MEMORANDUM OF THE MEETING OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL
COUNCIL, HELD AT THE STATE HOUSE OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS AT PLAZAC ON
MONDAY, AUGUST 26, 1907.


(_Written by Cristoferos_, _Scribe of the Council_, _by instruction of
those present_.)

When the private meeting of various Members of the National Council had
assembled in the Council Hall of the State House at Plazac, it was as a
preliminary decided unanimously that now or hereafter no names of those
present were to be mentioned, and that officials appointed for the
purposes of this meeting should be designated by office only, the names
of all being withheld.

The proceedings assumed the shape of a general conversation, quite
informal, and therefore not to be recorded.  The nett outcome was the
unanimous expression of an opinion that the time, long contemplated by
very many persons throughout the nation, had now come when the
Constitution and machinery of the State should be changed; that the
present form of ruling by an Irregular Council was not sufficient, and
that a method more in accord with the spirit of the times should be
adopted.  To this end Constitutional Monarchy, such as that holding in
Great Britain, seemed best adapted.  Finally, it was decided that each
Member of the Council should make a personal canvass of his district,
talk over the matter with his electors, and bring back to another
meeting--or, rather, as it was amended, to this meeting postponed for a
week, until September 2nd--the opinions and wishes received.  Before
separating, the individual to be appointed King, in case the new idea
should prove grateful to the nation, was discussed.  The consensus of
opinion was entirely to the effect that the Voivode Peter Vissarion
should, if he would accept the high office, be appointed.  It was urged
that, as his daughter, the Voivodin Teuta, was now married to the
Englishman, Rupert Sent Leger--called generally by the mountaineers "the
Gospodar Rupert"--a successor to follow the Voivode when God should call
him would be at hand--a successor worthy in every way to succeed to so
illustrious a post.  It was urged by several speakers, with general
acquiescence, that already Mr. Sent Leger's services to the State were
such that he would be in himself a worthy person to begin the new
Dynasty; but that, as he was now allied to the Voivode Peter Vissarion,
it was becoming that the elder, born of the nation, should receive the
first honour.



THE SAME--_Continued_.


The adjourned meeting of certain members of the National Council was
resumed in the Hall of the State House at Plazac on Monday, September
2nd, 1907.  By motion the same chairman was appointed, and the rule
regarding the record renewed.

Reports were made by the various members of the Council in turn,
according to the State Roll.  Every district was represented.  The
reports were unanimously in favour of the New Constitution, and it was
reported by each and all of the Councillors that the utmost enthusiasm
marked in every case the suggestion of the Voivode Peter Vissarion as the
first King to be crowned under the new Constitution, and that remainder
should be settled on the Gospodar Rupert (the mountaineers would only
receive his lawful name as an alternative; one and all said that he would
be "Rupert" to them and to the nation--for ever).

The above matter having been satisfactorily settled, it was decided that
a formal meeting of the National Council should be held at the State
House, Plazac, in one week from to-day, and that the Voivode Peter
Vissarion should be asked to be in the State House in readiness to
attend.  It was also decided that instruction should be given to the High
Court of National Law to prepare and have ready, in skeleton form, a
rescript of the New Constitution to be adopted, the same to be founded on
the Constitution and Procedure of Great Britain, so far as the same may
be applicable to the traditional ideas of free Government in the Land of
the Blue Mountains.

By unanimous vote this private and irregular meeting of "Various National
Councillors" was then dissolved.



RECORD OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE LAND OF THE
BLUE MOUNTAINS, HELD AT PLAZAC ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9TH, 1907, TO
CONSIDER THE ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION, AND TO GIVE PERMANENT EFFECT
TO THE SAME IF, AND WHEN, DECIDED UPON.


(_Kept by the Monk Cristoferos_, _Scribe to the National Council_.)

The adjourned meeting duly took place as arranged.  There was a full
attendance of Members of the Council, together with the Vladika, the
Archbishop, the Archimandrites of Spazac, of Ispazar, of Domitan, and
Astrag; the Chancellor; the Lord of the Exchequer; the President of the
High Court of National Law; the President of the Council of Justice; and
such other high officials as it is customary to summon to meetings of the
National Council on occasions of great importance.  The names of all
present will be found in the full report, wherein are given the ipsissima
verba of the various utterances made during the consideration of the
questions discussed, the same having been taken down in shorthand by the
humble scribe of this precis, which has been made for the convenience of
Members of the Council and others.

The Voivode Peter Vissarion, obedient to the request of the Council, was
in attendance at the State House, waiting in the "Chamber of the High
Officers" until such time as he should be asked to come before the
Council.

The President put before the National Council the matter of the new
Constitution, outlining the headings of it as drawn up by the High Court
of National Law, and the Constitution having been formally accepted _nem.
con._ by the National Council on behalf of the people, he proposed that
the Crown should be offered to the Voivode Peter Vissarion, with
remainder to the "Gospodar Rupert" (legally, Rupert Sent Leger), husband
of his only child, the Voivodin Teuta.  This also was received with
enthusiasm, and passed _nem. con._

Thereupon the President of Council, the Archbishop, and the Vladika,
acting together as a deputation, went to pray the attention of the
Voivode Peter Vassarion.

When the Voivode entered, the whole Council and officials stood up, and
for a few seconds waited in respectful silence with heads bowed down.
Then, as if by a common impulse--for no word was spoken nor any signal
given--they all drew their handjars, and stood to attention--with points
raised and edges of the handjars to the front.

The Voivode stood very still.  He seemed much moved, but controlled
himself admirably.  The only time when be seemed to lose his self-control
was when, once again with a strange simultaneity, all present raised
their handjars on high, and shouted: "Hail, Peter, King!"  Then lowering
their points till these almost touched the ground, they once again stood
with bowed heads.

When he had quite mastered himself, the Voivode Peter Vissarion spoke:

"How can I, my brothers, sufficiently thank you, and, through you, the
people of the Blue Mountains, for the honour done to me this day?  In
very truth it is not possible, and therefore I pray you to consider it as
done, measuring my gratitude in the greatness of your own hearts.  Such
honour as you offer to me is not contemplated by any man in whose mind a
wholesome sanity rules, nor is it even the dream of fervent imagination.
So great is it, that I pray you, men with hearts and minds like my own,
to extend to me, as a further measure of your generosity, a little time
to think it over.  I shall not want long, for even already, with the
blaze of honour fresh upon me, I see the cool shadow of Duty, though his
substance is yet hardly visible.  Give me but an hour of solitude--an
hour at most--if it do not prolong this your session unduly.  It may be
that a lesser time will serve, but in any case I promise you that, when I
can see a just and fitting issue to my thought, I shall at once return."

The President of the Council looked around him, and, seeing everywhere
the bowing heads of acquiescence, spoke with a reverent gravity:

"We shall wait in patience whatsoever time you will, and may the God who
rules all worthy hearts guide you to His Will!"

And so in silence the Voivode passed out of the hall.

From my seat near a window I could watch him go, as with measured steps
he passed up the hill which rises behind the State House, and disappeared
into the shadow of the forest.  Then my work claimed me, for I wished to
record the proceedings so far whilst all was fresh in my mind.  In
silence, as of the dead, the Council waited, no man challenging opinion
of his neighbour even by a glance.

Almost a full hour had elapsed when the Voivode came again to the
Council, moving with slow and stately gravity, as has always been his
wont since age began to hamper the movement which in youth had been so
notable.  The Members of the Council all stood up uncovered, and so
remained while he made announcement of his conclusion.  He spoke slowly;
and as his answer was to be a valued record of this Land and its Race, I
wrote down every word as uttered, leaving here and there space for
description or comment, which spaces I have since then filled in.

"Lords of the National Council, Archbishop, Vladika, Lords of the Council
of Justice and of National Law, Archimandrites, and my brothers all, I
have, since I left you, held in the solitude of the forest counsel with
myself--and with God; and He, in His gracious wisdom, has led my thinking
to that conclusion which was from the first moment of knowledge of your
intent presaged in my heart.  Brothers, you know--or else a long life has
been spent in vain--that my heart and mind are all for the nation--my
experience, my life, my handjar.  And when all is for her, why should I
shrink to exercise on her behalf my riper judgment though the same should
have to combat my own ambition?  For ten centuries my race has not failed
in its duty.  Ages ago the men of that time trusted in the hands of my
ancestors the Kingship, even as now you, their children, trust me.  But
to me it would be base to betray that trust, even by the smallest tittle.
That would I do were I to take the honour of the crown which you have
tendered to me, so long as there is another more worthy to wear it.  Were
there none other, I should place myself in your hands, and yield myself
over to blind obedience of your desires.  But such an one there is; dear
to you already by his own deeds, now doubly dear to me, since he is my
son by my daughter's love.  He is young, whereas I am old.  He is strong
and brave and true; but my days of the usefulness of strength and bravery
are over.  For myself, I have long contemplated as the crown of my later
years a quiet life in one of our monasteries, where I can still watch the
whirl of the world around us on your behalf, and be a counsellor of
younger men of more active minds.  Brothers, we are entering on stirring
times.  I can see the signs of their coming all around us.  North and
South--the Old Order and the New, are about to clash, and we lie between
the opposing forces.  True it is that the Turk, after warring for a
thousand years, is fading into insignificance.  But from the North where
conquests spring, have crept towards our Balkans the men of a mightier
composite Power.  Their march has been steady; and as they came, they
fortified every step of the way.  Now they are hard upon us, and are
already beginning to swallow up the regions that we have helped to win
from the dominion of Mahound.  The Austrian is at our very gates.  Beaten
back by the Irredentists of Italy, she has so enmeshed herself with the
Great Powers of Europe that she seems for the moment to be impregnable to
a foe of our stature.  There is but one hope for us--the uniting of the
Balkan forces to turn a masterly front to North and West as well as to
South and East.  Is that a task for old hands to undertake?  No; the
hands must be young and supple; and the brain subtle, as well as the
heart be strong, of whomsoever would dare such an accomplishment.  Should
I accept the crown, it would only postpone the doing of that which must
ultimately be done.  What avail would it be if, when the darkness closes
over me, my daughter should be Queen Consort to the first King of a new
dynasty?  You know this man, and from your record I learn that you are
already willing to have him as King to follow me.  Why not begin with
him?  He comes of a great nation, wherein the principle of freedom is a
vital principle that quickens all things.  That nation has more than once
shown to us its friendliness; and doubtless the very fact that an
Englishman would become our King, and could carry into our Government the
spirit and customs which have made his own country great, would do much
to restore the old friendship, and even to create a new one, which would
in times of trouble bring British fleets to our waters, and British
bayonets to support our own handjars.  It is within my own knowledge,
though as yet unannounced to you, that Rupert Sent Leger has already
obtained a patent, signed by the King of England himself, allowing him to
be denaturalized in England, so that he can at once apply for
naturalization here.  I know also that he has brought hither a vast
fortune, by aid of which he is beginning to strengthen our hands for war,
in case that sad eventuality should arise.  Witness his late ordering to
be built nine other warships of the class that has already done such
effective service in overthrowing the Turk--or the pirate, whichever he
may have been.  He has undertaken the defence of the Blue Mouth at his
own cost in a way which will make it stronger than Gibraltar, and secure
us against whatever use to which the Austrian may apply the vast forces
already gathered in the Bocche di Cattaro.  He is already founding aerial
stations on our highest peaks for use of the war aeroplanes which are
being built for him.  It is such a man as this who makes a nation great;
and right sure I am that in his hands this splendid land and our noble,
freedom-loving people will flourish and become a power in the world.
Then, brothers, let me, as one to whom this nation and its history and
its future are dear, ask you to give to the husband of my daughter the
honour which you would confer on me.  For her I can speak as well as for
myself.  She shall suffer nothing in dignity either.  Were I indeed King,
she, as my daughter, would be a Princess of the world.  As it will be,
she shall be companion and Queen of a great King, and her race, which is
mine, shall flourish in all the lustre of the new Dynasty.

"Therefore on all accounts, my brothers, for the sake of our dear Land of
the Blue Mountains, make the Gospodar Rupert, who has so proved himself,
your King.  And make me happy in my retirement to the cloister."

When the Voivode ceased to speak, all still remained silent and standing.
But there was no mistaking their acquiescence in his most generous
prayer.  The President of the Council well interpreted the general wish
when he said:

"Lords of the National Council, Archbishop, Vladika, Lords of the
Councils of Justice and National Law, Archimandrites, and all who are
present, is it agreed that we prepare at leisure a fitting reply to the
Voivode Peter of the historic House of Vissarion, stating our agreement
with his wish?"

To which there was a unanimous answer:

"It is."  He went on:

"Further.  Shall we ask the Gospodar Rupert of the House of Sent Leger,
allied through his marriage to the Voivodin Teuta, daughter and only
child of the Voivode Peter of Vissarion, to come hither to-morrow?  And
that, when he is amongst us, we confer on him the Crown and Kingship of
the Land of the Blue Mountains?"

Again came the answer: "It is."

But this time it rang out like the sound of a gigantic trumpet, and the
handjars flashed.

Whereupon the session was adjourned for the space of a day.



THE SAME--_Continued_.


                                                     _September_ 10, 1907.

When the National Council met to-day the Voivode Peter Vissarion sat with
them, but well back, so that at first his presence was hardly noticeable.
After the necessary preliminaries had been gone through, they requested
the presence of the Gospodar Rupert--Mr. Rupert Sent Leger--who was
reported as waiting in the "Chamber of the High Officers."  He at once
accompanied back to the Hall the deputation sent to conduct him.  As he
made his appearance in the doorway the Councillors stood up.  There was a
burst of enthusiasm, and the handjars flashed.  For an instant he stood
silent, with lifted hand, as though indicating that he wished to speak.
So soon as this was recognized, silence fell on the assembly, and he
spoke:

"I pray you, may the Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion, who has accompanied me
hither, appear with me to hear your wishes?"  There was an immediate and
enthusiastic acquiescence, and, after bowing his thanks, he retired to
conduct her.

Her appearance was received with an ovation similar to that given to
Gospodar Rupert, to which she bowed with dignified sweetness.  She, with
her husband, was conducted to the top of the Hall by the President, who
came down to escort them.  In the meantime another chair had been placed
beside that prepared for the Gospodar, and these two sat.

The President then made the formal statement conveying to the "Gospodar
Rupert" the wishes of the Council, on behalf of the nation, to offer to
him the Crown and Kingship of the Land of the Blue Mountains.  The
message was couched in almost the same words as had been used the
previous day in making the offer to the Voivode Peter Vissarion, only
differing to meet the special circumstances.  The Gospodar Rupert
listened in grave silence.  The whole thing was manifestly quite new to
him, but he preserved a self-control wonderful under the circumstances.
When, having been made aware of the previous offer to the Voivode and the
declared wish of the latter, he rose to speak, there was stillness in the
Hall.  He commenced with a few broken words of thanks; then he grew
suddenly and strangely calm as he went on:

"But before I can even attempt to make a fitting reply, I should know if
it is contemplated to join with me in this great honour my dear wife the
Voivodin Teuta of Vissarion, who has so splendidly proved her worthiness
to hold any place in the government of the Land.  I fain would . . . "

He was interrupted by the Voivodin, who, standing up beside him and
holding his left arm, said:

"Do not, President, and Lords all, think me wanting in that respect of a
wife for husband which in the Blue Mountains we hold so dear, if I
venture to interrupt my lord.  I am here, not merely as a wife, but as
Voivodin of Vissarion, and by the memory of all the noble women of that
noble line I feel constrained to a great duty.  We women of Vissarion, in
all the history of centuries, have never put ourselves forward in rivalry
of our lords.  Well I know that my own dear lord will forgive me as wife
if I err; but I speak to you, the Council of the nation, from another
ground and with another tongue.  My lord does not, I fear, know as you
do, and as I do too, that of old, in the history of this Land, when
Kingship was existent, that it was ruled by that law of masculine
supremacy which, centuries after, became known as the _Lex Salica_.
Lords of the Council of the Blue Mountains, I am a wife of the Blue
Mountains--as a wife young as yet, but with the blood of forty
generations of loyal women in my veins.  And it would ill become me, whom
my husband honours--wife to the man whom you would honour--to take a part
in changing the ancient custom which has been held in honour for all the
thousand years, which is the glory of Blue Mountain womanhood.  What an
example such would be in an age when self-seeking women of other nations
seek to forget their womanhood in the struggle to vie in equality with
men!  Men of the Blue Mountains, I speak for our women when I say that we
hold of greatest price the glory of our men.  To be their companions is
our happiness; to be their wives is the completion of our lives; to be
mothers of their children is our share of the glory that is theirs.

"Therefore, I pray you, men of the Blue Mountains, let me but be as any
other wife in our land, equal to them in domestic happiness, which is our
woman's sphere; and if that priceless honour may be vouchsafed to me, and
I be worthy and able to bear it, an exemplar of woman's rectitude."  With
a low, modest, graceful bow, she sat down.

There was no doubt as to the reception of her renunciation of Queenly
dignity.  There was more honour to her in the quick, fierce shout which
arose, and the unanimous upward swing of the handjars, than in the
wearing of any crown which could adorn the head of woman.

The spontaneous action of the Gospodar Rupert was another source of joy
to all--a fitting corollary to what had gone before.  He rose to his
feet, and, taking his wife in his arms, kissed her before all.  Then they
sat down, with their chairs close, bashfully holding hands like a pair of
lovers.

Then Rupert arose--he is Rupert now; no lesser name is on the lips of his
people henceforth.  With an intense earnestness which seemed to glow in
his face, he said simply:

"What can I say except that I am in all ways, now and for ever, obedient
to your wishes?"  Then, raising his handjar and holding it before him, he
kissed the hilt, saying:

"Hereby I swear to be honest and just--to be, God helping me, such a King
as you would wish--in so far as the strength is given me.  Amen."

This ended the business of the Session, and the Council showed unmeasured
delight.  Again and again the handjars flashed, as the cheers rose "three
times three" in British fashion.

When Rupert--I am told I must not write him down as "King Rupert" until
after the formal crowning, which is ordained for Wednesday, October
16th,--and Teuta had withdrawn, the Voivode Peter Vissarion, the
President and Council conferred in committee with the Presidents of the
High Courts of National Law and of Justice as to the formalities to be
observed in the crowning of the King, and of the formal notification to
be given to foreign Powers.  These proceedings kept them far into the
night.

CORONATION FESTIVITIES OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.

As I sat down to a poorly-equipped luncheon-table on board the
Austro-Orient liner _Franz Joseph_, I mourned in my heart (and I may say
incidentally in other portions of my internal economy) the comfort and
gastronomic luxury of the King and Emperor Hotel at Trieste.  A brief
comparison between the menus of to-day's lunch and yesterday's will
afford to the reader a striking object-lesson:
_Trieste_.                          _Steamer_.
Eggs a la cocotte.                  Scrambled eggs on toast.
Stewed chicken, with paprika.       Cold chicken.
Devilled slices of Westphalian      Cold ham.
ham  (boiled in wine).
Tunny fish, pickled.                Bismarck herrings.
Rice, burst in cream.               Stewed apples.
Guava jelly.                        Swiss cheese.
Consequence: Yesterday I was well and happy, and looked forward to a good
night's sleep, which came off.  To-day I am dull and heavy, also
restless, and I am convinced that at sleeping-time my liver will have it
all its own way.

The journey to Ragusa, and thence to Plazac, is writ large with a pigment
of misery on at least one human heart.  Let a silence fall upon it!  In
such wise only can Justice and Mercy join hands.

Plazac is a miserable place.  There is not a decent hotel in it.  It was
perhaps on this account that the new King, Rupert, had erected for the
alleged convenience of his guests of the Press a series of large
temporary hotels, such as were in evidence at the St. Louis Exposition.
Here each guest was given a room to himself, somewhat after the nature of
the cribs in a Rowton house.  From my first night in it I am able to
speak from experience of the sufferings of a prisoner of the third class.
I am, however, bound to say that the dining and reception rooms were,
though uncomfortably plain, adequate for temporary use.  Happily we shall
not have to endure many more meals here, as to-morrow we all dine with
the King in the State House; and as the cuisine is under the control of
that _cordon bleu_, Gaston de Faux Pas, who so long controlled the
gastronomic (we might almost say Gastonomic) destinies of the Rois des
Diamants in the Place Vendome, we may, I think, look forward to not going
to bed hungry.  Indeed, the anticipations formed from a survey of our
meagre sleeping accommodation were not realized at dinnertime to-night.
To our intense astonishment, an excellent dinner was served, though, to
be sure, the cold dishes predominated (a thing I always find bad for
one's liver).  Just as we were finishing, the King (nominated) came
amongst us in quite an informal way, and, having bidden us a hearty
welcome, asked that we should drink a glass of wine together.  This we
did in an excellent (if rather sweet) glass of Cliquot '93.  King Rupert
(nominated) then asked us to resume our seats.  He walked between the
tables, now and again recognizing some journalistic friend whom he had
met early in life in his days of adventure.  The men spoken to seemed
vastly pleased--with themselves probably.  Pretty bad form of them, I
call it!  For myself, I was glad I had not previously met him in the same
casual way, as it saved me from what I should have felt a
humiliation--the being patronized in that public way by a prospective
King who had not (in a Court sense) been born.  The writer, who is by
profession a barrister-at-law, is satisfied at being himself a county
gentleman and heir to an historic estate in the ancient county of Salop,
which can boast a larger population than the Land of the Blue Mountains.

EDITORIAL NOTE.--We must ask our readers to pardon the report in
yesterday's paper sent from Plazac.  The writer was not on our regular
staff, but asked to be allowed to write the report, as he was a kinsman
of King Rupert of the Blue Mountains, and would therefore be in a
position to obtain special information and facilities of description
"from inside," as he puts it.  On reading the paper, we cabled his
recall; we cabled also, in case he did not obey, to have his ejectment
effected forthwith.

We have also cabled Mr. Mordred Booth, the well-known correspondent, who
was, to our knowledge, in Plazac for his own purposes, to send us full
(and proper) details.  We take it our readers will prefer a graphic
account of the ceremony to a farrago of cheap menus, comments on his own
liver, and a belittling of an Englishman of such noble character and
achievements that a rising nation has chosen him for their King, and one
whom our own nation loves to honour.  We shall not, of course, mention
our abortive correspondent's name, unless compelled thereto by any future
utterance of his.



FROM "_The London Messenger_."


THE CORONATION OF KING RUPERT OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.

(_By our Special Correspondent_, _Mordred Booth_.)

                                                                   PLAZAC,
                                                       _October_ 17, 1907.

Plazac does not boast of a cathedral or any church of sufficient
dimensions for a coronation ceremony on an adequate scale.  It was
therefore decided by the National Council, with the consent of the King,
that it should be held at the old church of St. Sava at Vissarion--the
former home of the Queen.  Accordingly, arrangements had been made to
bring thither on the warships on the morning of the coronation the whole
of the nation's guests.  In St. Sava's the religious ceremony would take
place, after which there would be a banquet in the Castle of Vissarion.
The guests would then return on the warships to Plazac, where would be
held what is called here the "National Coronation."

In the Land of the Blue Mountains it was customary in the old days, when
there were Kings, to have two ceremonies--one carried out by the official
head of the national Church, the Greek Church; the other by the people in
a ritual adopted by themselves, on much the same basis as the Germanic
Folk-Moot.  The Blue Mountains is a nation of strangely loyal tendencies.
What was a thousand years ago is to be to-day--so far, of course, as is
possible under the altered condition of things.

The church of St. Sava is very old and very beautiful, built in the
manner of old Greek churches, full of monuments of bygone worthies of the
Blue Mountains.  But, of course, neither it nor the ceremony held in it
to-day can compare in splendour with certain other ceremonials--for
instance, the coronation of the penultimate Czar in Moscow, of Alfonso
XII. in Madrid, of Carlos I. in Lisbon.

The church was arranged much after the fashion of Westminster Abbey for
the coronation of King Edward VII., though, of course, not so many
persons present, nor so much individual splendour.  Indeed, the number of
those present, outside those officially concerned and the Press of the
world, was very few.

The most striking figure present--next to King Rupert, who is seven feet
high and a magnificent man--was the Queen Consort, Teuta.  She sat in
front of a small gallery erected for the purpose just opposite the
throne.  She is a strikingly beautiful woman, tall and finely-formed,
with jet-black hair and eyes like black diamonds, but with the unique
quality that there are stars in them which seem to take varied colour
according to each strong emotion.  But it was not even her beauty or the
stars in her eyes which drew the first glance of all.  These details
showed on scrutiny, but from afar off the attractive point was her dress.
Surely never before did woman, be she Queen or peasant, wear such a
costume on a festive occasion.

She was dressed in a white _Shroud_, and in that only.  I had heard
something of the story which goes behind that strange costume, and shall
later on send it to you. {2}

When the procession entered the church through the great western door,
the national song of the Blue Mountains, "Guide our feet through
darkness, O Jehovah," was sung by an unseen choir, in which the organ,
supplemented by martial instruments, joined.  The Archbishop was robed in
readiness before the altar, and close around him stood the Archimandrites
of the four great monasteries.  The Vladika stood in front of the Members
of the National Council.  A little to one side of this body was a group
of high officials, Presidents of the Councils of National Law and
Justice, the Chancellor, etc.--all in splendid robes of great
antiquity--the High Marshall of the Forces and the Lord high Admiral.

When all was ready for the ceremonial act of coronation, the Archbishop
raised his hand, whereupon the music ceased.  Turning around, so that he
faced the Queen, who thereon stood up, the King drew his handjar and
saluted her in Blue Mountain fashion--the point raised as high possible,
and then dropped down till it almost touches the ground.  Every man in
the church, ecclesiastics and all, wear the handjar, and, following the
King by the interval of a second, their weapons flashed out.  There was
something symbolic, as well as touching, in this truly royal salute, led
by the King.  His handjar is a mighty blade, and held high in the hands
of a man of his stature, it overtowered everything in the church.  It was
an inspiriting sight.  No one who saw will ever forget that noble
flashing of blades in the thousand-year-old salute . . .

The coronation was short, simple, and impressive.  Rupert knelt whilst
the Archbishop, after a short, fervent prayer, placed on his head the
bronze crown of the first King of the Blue Mountains, Peter.  This was
handed to him by the Vladika, to whom it was brought from the National
Treasury by a procession of the high officers.  A blessing of the new
King and his Queen Teuta concluded the ceremony.  Rupert's first act on
rising from his knees was to draw his handjar and salute his people.

After the ceremony in St. Sava, the procession was reformed, and took its
way to the Castle of Vissarion, which is some distance off across a
picturesque creek, bounded on either side by noble cliffs of vast height.
The King led the way, the Queen walking with him and holding his hand . .
. The Castle of Vissarion is of great antiquity, and picturesque beyond
belief.  I am sending later on, as a special article, a description of it
. . .

The "Coronation Feast," as it was called on the menu, was held in the
Great Hall, which is of noble proportions.  I enclose copy of the menu,
as our readers may wish to know something of the details of such a feast
in this part of the world.

One feature of the banquet was specially noticeable.  As the National
Officials were guests of the King and Queen, they were waited on and
served by the King and Queen in person.  The rest of the guests,
including us of the Press, were served by the King's household, not the
servants--none of that cult were visible--but by the ladies and gentlemen
of the Court.

There was only one toast, and that was given by the King, all standing:
"The Land of the Blue Mountains, and may we all do our duty to the Land
we love!"  Before drinking, his mighty handjar flashed out again, and in
an instant every table at which the Blue Mountaineers sat was ringed with
flashing steel.  I may add parenthetically that the handjar is
essentially the national weapon.  I do not know if the Blue Mountaineers
take it to bed with them, but they certainly wear it everywhere else.
Its drawing seems to emphasize everything in national life . . .

We embarked again on the warships--one a huge, steel-plated Dreadnought,
up to date in every particular, the other an armoured yacht most complete
in every way, and of unique speed.  The King and Queen, the Lords of the
Council, together with the various high ecclesiastics and great
officials, went on the yacht, which the Lord High Admiral, a man of
remarkably masterful physiognomy, himself steered.  The rest of those
present at the Coronation came on the warship.  The latter went fast, but
the yacht showed her heels all the way.  However, the King's party waited
in the dock in the Blue Mouth.  From this a new cable-line took us all to
the State House at Plazac.  Here the procession was reformed, and wound
its way to a bare hill in the immediate vicinity.  The King and
Queen--the King still wearing the ancient bronze crown with which the
Archbishop had invested him at St. Sava's--the Archbishop, the Vladika,
and the four Archimandrites stood together at the top of the hill, the
King and Queen being, of course, in the front.  A courteous young
gentleman, to whom I had been accredited at the beginning of the day--all
guests were so attended--explained to me that, as this was the national
as opposed to the religious ceremony, the Vladika, who is the official
representative of the laity, took command here.  The ecclesiastics were
put prominently forward, simply out of courtesy, in obedience to the wish
of the people, by whom they were all greatly beloved.

Then commenced another unique ceremony, which, indeed, might well find a
place in our Western countries.  As far as ever we could see were masses
of men roughly grouped, not in any uniform, but all in national costume,
and armed only with the handjar.  In the front of each of these groups or
bodies stood the National Councillor for that district, distinguishable
by his official robe and chain.  There were in all seventeen of these
bodies.  These were unequal in numbers, some of them predominating
enormously over others, as, indeed, might be expected in so mountainous a
country.  In all there were present, I was told, over a hundred thousand
men.  So far as I can judge from long experience of looking at great
bodies of men, the estimate was a just one.  I was a little surprised to
see so many, for the population of the Blue Mountains is never accredited
in books of geography as a large one.  When I made inquiry as to how the
frontier guard was being for the time maintained, I was told:

"By the women mainly.  But, all the same, we have also a male guard which
covers the whole frontier except that to seaward.  Each man has with him
six women, so that the whole line is unbroken.  Moreover, sir, you must
bear in mind that in the Blue Mountains our women are trained to arms as
well as our men--ay, and they could give a good account of themselves,
too, against any foe that should assail us.  Our history shows what women
can do in defence.  I tell you, the Turkish population would be bigger
to-day but for the women who on our frontier fought of old for defence of
their homes!"

"No wonder this nation has kept her freedom for a thousand years!" I
said.

At a signal given by the President of the National Council one of the
Divisions moved forwards.  It was not an ordinary movement, but an
intense rush made with all the _elan_ and vigour of hardy and
highly-trained men.  They came on, not merely at the double, but as if
delivering an attack.  Handjar in hand, they rushed forward.  I can only
compare their rush to an artillery charge or to an attack of massed
cavalry battalions.  It was my fortune to see the former at Magenta and
the latter at Sadowa, so that I know what such illustration means.  I may
also say that I saw the relief column which Roberts organized rush
through a town on its way to relieve Mafeking; and no one who had the
delight of seeing that inspiring progress of a flying army on their way
to relieve their comrades needs to be told what a rush of armed men can
be.  With speed which was simply desperate they ran up the hill, and,
circling to the left, made a ring round the topmost plateau, where stood
the King.  When the ring was complete, the stream went on lapping round
and round till the whole tally was exhausted.  In the meantime another
Division had followed, its leader joining close behind the end of the
first.  Then came another and another.  An unbroken line circled and
circled round the hill in seeming endless array, till the whole slopes
were massed with moving men, dark in colour, and with countless
glittering points everywhere.  When the whole of the Divisions had thus
surrounded the King, there was a moment's hush--a silence so still that
it almost seemed as if Nature stood still also.  We who looked on were
almost afraid to breathe.

Then suddenly, without, so far as I could see, any fugleman or word of
command, the handjars of all that mighty array of men flashed upward as
one, and like thunder pealed the National cry:

"The Blue Mountains and Duty!"

After the cry there was a strange subsidence which made the onlooker rub
his eyes.  It seemed as though the whole mass of fighting men had
partially sunk into the ground.  Then the splendid truth burst upon
us--the whole nation was kneeling at the feet of their chosen King, who
stood upright.

Another moment of silence, as King Rupert, taking off his crown, held it
up in his left hand, and, holding his great handjar high in his right,
cried in a voice so strong that it came ringing over that serried mass
like a trumpet:

"To Freedom of our Nation, and to Freedom within it, I dedicate these and
myself.  I swear!"

So saying, he, too, sank on his knees, whilst we all instinctively
uncovered.

The silence which followed lasted several seconds; then, without a sign,
as though one and all acted instinctively, the whole body stood up.
Thereupon was executed a movement which, with all my experience of
soldiers and war, I never saw equalled--not with the Russian Royal Guard
saluting the Czar at his Coronation, not with an impi of Cetewayo's Zulus
whirling through the opening of a kraal.

For a second or two the whole mass seemed to writhe or shudder, and then,
lo! the whole District Divisions were massed again in completeness, its
Councillors next the King, and the Divisions radiating outwards down the
hill like wedges.

This completed the ceremony, and everything broke up into units.  Later,
I was told by my official friend that the King's last movement--the oath
as he sank to his knees--was an innovation of his own.  All I can say is,
if, in the future, and for all time, it is not taken for a precedent, and
made an important part of the Patriotic Coronation ceremony, the Blue
Mountaineers will prove themselves to be a much more stupid people than
they seem at present to be.

The conclusion of the Coronation festivities was a time of unalloyed joy.
It was the banquet given to the King and Queen by the nation; the guests
of the nation were included in the royal party.  It was a unique
ceremony.  Fancy a picnic-party of a hundred thousand persons, nearly all
men.  There must have been made beforehand vast and elaborate
preparations, ramifying through the whole nation.  Each section had
brought provisions sufficient for their own consumption in addition to
several special dishes for the guest-tables; but the contribution of each
section was not consumed by its own members.

It was evidently a part of the scheme that all should derive from a
common stock, so that the feeling of brotherhood and common property
should be preserved in this monumental fashion.

The guest-tables were the only tables to be seen.  The bulk of the
feasters sat on the ground.  The tables were brought forward by the men
themselves--no such thing as domestic service was known on this day--from
a wood close at hand, where they and the chairs had been placed in
readiness.  The linen and crockery used had been sent for the purpose
from the households of every town and village.  The flowers were plucked
in the mountains early that morning by the children, and the gold and
silver plate used for adornment were supplied from the churches.  Each
dish at the guest-tables was served by the men of each section in turn.

Over the whole array seemed to be spread an atmosphere of joyousness, of
peace, of brotherhood.  It would be impossible to adequately describe
that amazing scene, a whole nation of splendid men surrounding their new
King and Queen, loving to honour and serve them.  Scattered about through
that vast crowd were groups of musicians, chosen from amongst themselves.
The space covered by this titanic picnic was so vast that there were few
spots from which you could hear music proceeding from different quarters.

After dinner we all sat and smoked; the music became rather vocal than
instrumental--indeed, presently we did not hear the sound of any
instrument at all.  Only knowing a few words of Balkan, I could not
follow the meanings of the songs, but I gathered that they were all
legendary or historical.  To those who could understand, as I was
informed by my tutelary young friend, who stayed beside me the whole of
this memorable day, we were listening to the history of the Land of the
Blue Mountains in ballad form.  Somewhere or other throughout that vast
concourse each notable record of ten centuries was being told to eager
ears.

It was now late in the day.  Slowly the sun had been dropping down over
the Calabrian Mountains, and the glamorous twilight was stealing over the
immediate scene.  No one seemed to notice the coming of the dark, which
stole down on us with an unspeakable mystery.  For long we sat still, the
clatter of many tongues becoming stilled into the witchery of the scene.
Lower the sun sank, till only the ruddiness of the afterglow lit the
expanse with rosy light; then this failed in turn, and the night shut
down quickly.

At last, when we could just discern the faces close to us, a simultaneous
movement began.  Lights began to flash out in places all over the
hillside.  At first these seemed as tiny as glow-worms seen in a summer
wood, but by degrees they grew till the space was set with little circles
of light.  These in turn grew and grew in both number and strength.
Flames began to leap out from piles of wood, torches were lighted and
held high.  Then the music began again, softly at first, but then louder
as the musicians began to gather to the centre, where sat the King and
Queen.  The music was wild and semi-barbaric, but full of sweet melody.
It somehow seemed to bring before us a distant past; one and all,
according to the strength of our imagination and the volume of our
knowledge, saw episodes and phases of bygone history come before us.
There was a wonderful rhythmic, almost choric, force in the time kept,
which made it almost impossible to sit still.  It was an invitation to
the dance such as I had never before heard in any nation or at any time.
Then the lights began to gather round.  Once more the mountaineers took
something of the same formation as at the crowning.  Where the royal
party sat was a level mead, with crisp, short grass, and round it what
one might well call the Ring of the Nation was formed.

The music grew louder.  Each mountaineer who had not a lit torch already
lighted one, and the whole rising hillside was a glory of light.  The
Queen rose, and the King an instant after.  As they rose men stepped
forward and carried away their chairs, or rather thrones.  The Queen gave
the King her hand--this is, it seems, the privilege of the wife as
distinguished from any other woman.  Their feet took the time of the
music, and they moved into the centre of the ring.

That dance was another thing to remember, won from the haunting memories
of that strange day.  At first the King and Queen danced all alone.  They
began with stately movement, but as the music quickened their feet kept
time, and the swing of their bodies with movements kept growing more and
more ecstatic at every beat till, in true Balkan fashion, the dance
became a very agony of passionate movement.

At this point the music slowed down again, and the mountaineers began to
join in the dance.  At first slowly, one by one, they joined in, the
Vladika and the higher priests leading; then everywhere the whole vast
crowd began to dance, till the earth around us seemed to shake.  The
lights quivered, flickered, blazed out again, and rose and fell as that
hundred thousand men, each holding a torch, rose and fell with the rhythm
of the dance.  Quicker, quicker grew the music, faster grew the rushing
and pounding of the feet, till the whole nation seemed now in an ecstasy.

I stood near the Vladika, and in the midst of this final wildness I saw
him draw from his belt a short, thin flute; then he put it to his lips
and blew a single note--a fierce, sharp note, which pierced the volume of
sound more surely than would the thunder of a cannon-shot.  On the
instant everywhere each man put his torch under his foot.

There was complete and immediate darkness, for the fires, which had by
now fallen low, had evidently been trodden out in the measure of the
dance.  The music still kept in its rhythmic beat, but slower than it had
yet been.  Little by little this beat was pointed and emphasized by the
clapping of hands--at first only a few, but spreading till everyone
present was beating hands to the slow music in the darkness.  This lasted
a little while, during which, looking round, I noticed a faint light
beginning to steal up behind the hills.  The moon was rising.

Again there came a note from the Vladika's flute--a single note, sweet
and subtle, which I can only compare with a note from a nightingale,
vastly increased in powers.  It, too, won through the thunder of the
hand-claps, and on the second the sound ceased.  The sudden stillness,
together with the darkness, was so impressive that we could almost hear
our hearts beating.  And then came through the darkness the most
beautiful and impressive sound heard yet.  That mighty concourse, without
fugleman of any sort, began, in low, fervent voice, to sing the National
Anthem.  At first it was of so low tone as to convey the idea of a mighty
assembly of violinists playing with the mutes on.  But it gradually rose
till the air above us seemed to throb and quiver.  Each syllable--each
word--spoken in unison by the vast throng was as clearly enunciated as
though spoken by a single voice:

"Guide our feet through darkness, O Jehovah."

This anthem, sung out of full hearts, remains on our minds as the last
perfection of a perfect day.  For myself, I am not ashamed to own that it
made me weep like a child.  Indeed, I cannot write of it now as I would;
it unmans me so!

                                * * * * *

In the early morning, whilst the mountains were still rather grey than
blue, the cable-line took us to the Blue Mouth, where we embarked in the
King's yacht, _The Lady_, which took us across the Adriatic at a pace
which I had hitherto considered impossible.  The King and Queen came to
the landing to see us off.  They stood together at the right-hand side of
the red-carpeted gangway, and shook hands with each guest as he went on
board.  The instant the last passenger had stepped on deck the gangway
was withdrawn.  The Lord High Admiral, who stood on the bridge, raised
his hand, and we swept towards the mouth of the gulf.  Of course, all
hats were off, and we cheered frantically.  I can truly say that if King
Rupert and Queen Teuta should ever wish to found in the Blue Mountains a
colony of diplomatists and journalists, those who were their guests on
this great occasion will volunteer to a man.  I think old Hempetch, who
is the doyen of English-speaking journalists, voiced our sentiments when
he said:

"May God bless them and theirs with every grace and happiness, and send
prosperity to the Land and the rule!"  I think the King and Queen heard
us cheer, they turned to look at our flying ship again.




BOOK IX: BALKA


RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_ (_Longe Intervallo_).


                                                      _February_ 10, 1908.

It is so long since I even thought of this journal that I hardly know
where to begin.  I always heard that a married man is a pretty busy man;
but since I became one, though it is a new life to me, and of a happiness
undreamt of, I _know_ what that life is.  But I had no idea that this
King business was anything like what it is.  Why, it never leaves me a
moment at all to myself--or, what is worse, to Teuta.  If people who
condemn Kings had only a single month of my life in that capacity, they
would form an opinion different from that which they hold.  It might be
useful to have a Professor of Kingship in the Anarchists'
College--whenever it is founded!

Everything has gone on well with us, I am glad to say.  Teuta is in
splendid health, though she has--but only very lately--practically given
up going on her own aeroplane.  It was, I know, a great sacrifice to
make, just as she had become an expert at it.  They say here that she is
one of the best drivers in the Blue Mountains--and that is in the world,
for we have made that form of movement our own.  Ever since we found the
pitch-blende pockets in the Great Tunnel, and discovered the simple
process of extracting the radium from it, we have gone on by leaps and
bounds.  When first Teuta told me she would "aero" no more for a while, I
thought she was wise, and backed her up in it: for driving an aeroplane
is trying work and hard on the nerves.  I only learned then the reason
for her caution--the usual one of a young wife.  That was three months
ago, and only this morning she told me she would not go sailing in the
air, even with me, till she could do so "without risk"--she did not mean
risk to herself.  Aunt Janet knew what she meant, and counselled her
strongly to stick to her resolution.  So for the next few months I am to
do my air-sailing alone.

The public works which we began immediately after the Coronation are
going strong.  We began at the very beginning on an elaborate system.
The first thing was to adequately fortify the Blue Mouth.  Whilst the
fortifications were being constructed we kept all the warships in the
gulf.  But when the point of safety was reached, we made the ships do
sentry-go along the coast, whilst we trained men for service at sea.  It
is our plan to take by degrees all the young men and teach them this
wise, so that at the end the whole population shall be trained for sea as
well as for land.  And as we are teaching them the airship service, too,
they will be at home in all the elements--except fire, of course, though
if that should become a necessity, we shall tackle it too!

We started the Great Tunnel at the farthest inland point of the Blue
Mouth, and ran it due east at an angle of 45 degrees, so that, when
complete, it would go right through the first line of hills, coming out
on the plateau Plazac.  The plateau is not very wide--half a mile at
most--and the second tunnel begins on the eastern side of it.  This new
tunnel is at a smaller angle, as it has to pierce the second hill--a
mountain this time.  When it comes out on the east side of that, it will
tap the real productive belt.  Here it is that our hardwood-trees are
finest, and where the greatest mineral deposits are found.  This plateau
is of enormous length, and runs north arid south round the great bulk of
the central mountain, so that in time, when we put up a circular railway,
we can bring, at a merely nominal cost, all sorts of material up or down.
It is on this level that we have built the great factories for war
material.  We are tunnelling into the mountains, where are the great
deposits of coal.  We run the trucks in and out on the level, and can get
perfect ventilation with little cost or labour.  Already we are mining
all the coal which we consume within our own confines, and we can, if we
wish, within a year export largely.  The great slopes of these tunnels
give us the necessary aid of specific gravity, and as we carry an endless
water-supply in great tubes that way also, we can do whatever we wish by
hydraulic power.  As one by one the European and Asiatic nations began to
reduce their war preparations, we took over their disbanded workmen
though our agents, so that already we have a productive staff of skilled
workmen larger than anywhere else in the world.  I think myself that we
were fortunate in being able to get ahead so fast with our preparations
for war manufacture, for if some of the "Great Powers," as they call
themselves, knew the measure of our present production, they would
immediately try to take active measures against us.  In such case we
should have to fight them, which would delay us.  But if we can have
another year untroubled, we shall, so far as war material is concerned,
be able to defy any nation in the world.  And if the time may only come
peacefully till we have our buildings and machinery complete, we can
prepare war-stores and implements for the whole Balkan nations.  And
then--But that is a dream.  We shall know in good time.

In the meantime all goes well.  The cannon foundries are built and
active.  We are already beginning to turn out finished work.  Of course,
our first guns are not very large, but they are good.  The big guns, and
especially siege-guns, will come later.  And when the great extensions
are complete, and the boring and wire-winding machines are in working
order, we can go merrily on.  I suppose that by that time the whole of
the upper plateau will be like a manufacturing town--at any rate, we have
plenty of raw material to hand.  The haematite mines seem to be
inexhaustible, and as the raising of the ore is cheap and easy by means
of our extraordinary water-power, and as coal comes down to the plateau
by its own gravity on the cable-line, we have natural advantages which
exist hardly anywhere else in the world--certainly not all together, as
here.  That bird's eye view of the Blue Mouth which we had from the
aeroplane when Teuta saw that vision of the future has not been in vain.
The aeroplane works are having a splendid output.  The aeroplane is a
large and visible product; there is no mistaking when it is there!  We
have already a large and respectable aerial fleet.  The factories for
explosives are, of course, far away in bare valleys, where accidental
effects are minimized.  So, too, are the radium works, wherein unknown
dangers may lurk.  The turbines in the tunnel give us all the power we
want at present, and, later on, when the new tunnel, which we call the
"water tunnel," which is already begun, is complete, the available power
will be immense.  All these works are bringing up our shipping, and we
are in great hopes for the future.

So much for our material prosperity.  But with it comes a larger life and
greater hopes.  The stress of organizing and founding these great works
is practically over.  As they are not only self-supporting, but largely
productive, all anxiety in the way of national expenditure is minimized.
And, more than all, I am able to give my unhampered attention to those
matters of even more than national importance on which the ultimate
development, if not the immediate strength, of our country must depend.

I am well into the subject of a great Balkan Federation.  This, it turns
out, has for long been the dream of Teuta's life, as also that of the
present Archimandrite of Plazac, her father, who, since I last touched
this journal, having taken on himself a Holy Life, was, by will of the
Church, the Monks, and the People, appointed to that great office on the
retirement of Petrof Vlastimir.

Such a Federation had long been in the air.  For myself, I had seen its
inevitableness from the first.  The modern aggressions of the Dual
Nation, interpreted by her past history with regard to Italy, pointed
towards the necessity of such a protective measure.  And now, when Servia
and Bulgaria were used as blinds to cover her real movements to
incorporate with herself as established the provinces, once Turkish,
which had been entrusted to her temporary protection by the Treaty of
Berlin; when it would seem that Montenegro was to be deprived for all
time of the hope of regaining the Bocche di Cattaro, which she had a
century ago won, and held at the point of the sword, until a Great Power
had, under a wrong conviction, handed it over to her neighbouring
Goliath; when the Sandjack of Novi-Bazar was threatened with the fate
which seemed to have already overtaken Bosnia and Herzegovina; when
gallant little Montenegro was already shut out from the sea by the
octopus-like grip of Dalmatia crouching along her western shore; when
Turkey was dwindling down to almost ineptitude; when Greece was almost a
byword, and when Albania as a nation--though still nominally subject--was
of such unimpaired virility that there were great possibilities of her
future, it was imperative that something must happen if the Balkan race
was not to be devoured piecemeal by her northern neighbours.  To the end
of ultimate protection I found most of them willing to make defensive
alliance.

And as the true defence consists in judicious attack, I have no doubt
that an alliance so based must ultimately become one for all purposes.
Albania was the most difficult to win to the scheme, as her own
complications with her suzerain, combined with the pride and
suspiciousness of her people, made approach a matter of extreme caution.
It was only possible when I could induce her rulers to see that, no
matter how great her pride and valour, the magnitude of northern advance,
if unchecked, must ultimately overwhelm her.

I own that this map-making was nervous work, for I could not shut my eyes
to the fact that German lust of enlargement lay behind Austria's advance.
At and before that time expansion was the dominant idea of the three
Great Powers of Central Europe.  Russia went eastward, hoping to gather
to herself the rich north-eastern provinces of China, till ultimately she
should dominate the whole of Northern Europe and Asia from the Gulf of
Finland to the Yellow Sea.  Germany wished to link the North Sea to the
Mediterranean by her own territory, and thus stand as a flawless barrier
across Europe from north to south.

When Nature should have terminated the headship of the Empire-Kingdom,
she, as natural heir, would creep southward through the German-speaking
provinces.  Thus Austria, of course kept in ignorance of her neighbour's
ultimate aims, had to extend towards the south.  She had been barred in
her western movement by the rise of the Irredentist party in Italy, and
consequently had to withdraw behind the frontiers of Carinthia, Carniola,
and Istria.

My own dream of the new map was to make "Balka"--the Balkan
Federation--take in ultimately all south of a line drawn from the Isle of
Serpents to Aquileia.  There would--must--be difficulties in the carrying
out of such a scheme.  Of course, it involved Austria giving up Dalmatia,
Istria, and Sclavonia, as well as a part of Croatia and the Hungarian
Banat.  On the contrary, she might look for centuries of peace in the
south.  But it would make for peace so strongly that each of the States
impinging on it would find it worth while to make a considerable
sacrifice to have it effected.  To its own integers it would offer a
lasting settlement of interests which at present conflicted, and a share
in a new world-power.  Each of these integers would be absolutely
self-governing and independent, being only united for purposes of mutual
good.  I did not despair that even Turkey and Greece, recognizing that
benefit and safety would ensue without the destruction or even minimizing
of individuality, would, sooner or later, come into the Federation.  The
matter is already so far advanced that within a month the various rulers
of the States involved are to have a secret and informal meeting.
Doubtless some larger plan and further action will be then evolved.  It
will be an anxious time for all in this zone--and outside it--till this
matter is all settled.  In any case, the manufacture of war material will
go on until it is settled, one way or another.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                          _March_ 6, 1908.

I breathe more freely.  The meeting has taken place here at Vissarion.
Nominal cause of meeting: a hunting-party in the Blue Mountains.  Not any
formal affair.  Not a Chancellor or Secretary of State or Diplomatist of
any sort present.  All headquarters.  It was, after all, a real
hunting-party.  Good sportsmen, plenty of game, lots of beaters,
everything organized properly, and an effective tally of results.  I
think we all enjoyed ourselves in the matter of sport; and as the
political result was absolute unanimity of purpose and intention, there
could be no possible cause of complaint.

So it is all decided.  Everything is pacific.  There is not a suggestion
even of war, revolt, or conflicting purpose of any kind.  We all go on
exactly as we are doing for another year, pursuing our own individual
objects, just as at present.  But we are all to see that in our own
households order prevails.  All that is supposed to be effective is to be
kept in good working order, and whatever is, at present, not adequate to
possibilities is to be made so.  This is all simply protective and
defensive.  We understand each other.  But if any hulking stranger should
undertake to interfere in our domestic concerns, we shall all unite on
the instant to keep things as we wish them to remain.  We shall be ready.
Alfred's maxim of Peace shall be once more exemplified.  In the meantime
the factories shall work overtime in our own mountains, and the output
shall be for the general good of our special community--the bill to be
settled afterwards amicably.  There can hardly be any difference of
opinion about that, as the others will be the consumers of our surplus
products.  We are the producers, who produce for ourselves first, and
then for the limited market of those within the Ring.  As we undertake to
guard our own frontiers--sea and land--and are able to do so, the goods
are to be warehoused in the Blue Mountains until required--if at all--for
participation in the markets of the world, and especially in the European
market.  If all goes well and the markets are inactive, the goods shall
be duly delivered to the purchasers as arranged.

So much for the purely mercantile aspect.

As Rupert began to neglect his Journal when he was made a King, so, too,
I find in myself a tendency to leave writing to other people.  But one
thing I shall not be content to leave to others--little Rupert.  The baby
of Rupert and Teuta is much too precious a thing to be spoken of except
with love, quite independent of the fact that he will be, in natural
course, a King!  So I have promised Teuta that whatever shall be put into
this record of the first King of the Sent Leger Dynasty relating to His
Royal Highness the Crown Prince shall only appear in either her hand or
my own.  And she has deputed the matter to me.

Our dear little Prince arrived punctually and in perfect condition.  The
angels that carried him evidently took the greatest care of him, and
before they left him they gave him dower of all their best.  He is a
dear!  Like both his father and his mother, and that says everything.  My
own private opinion is that he is a born King!  He does not know what
fear is, and he thinks more of everyone else than he does of his dear
little self.  And if those things do not show a truly royal nature, I do
not know what does . . .

Teuta has read this.  She held up a warning finger, and said:

"Aunt Janet dear, that is all true.  He is a dear, and a King, and an
angel!  But we mustn't have too much about him just yet.  This book is to
be about Rupert.  So our little man can only be what we shall call a
corollary."  And so it is.

I should mention here that the book is Teuta's idea.  Before little
Rupert came she controlled herself wonderfully, doing only what was
thought best for her under the circumstances.  As I could see that it
would be a help for her to have some quiet occupation which would
interest her without tiring her, I looked up (with his permission, of
course) all Rupert's old letters and diaries, and journals and
reports--all that I had kept for him during his absences on his
adventures.  At first I was a little afraid they might harm her, for at
times she got so excited over some things that I had to caution her.
Here again came in her wonderful self-control.  I think the most soothing
argument I used with her was to point out that the dear boy had come
through all the dangers safely, and was actually with us, stronger and
nobler than ever.

After we had read over together the whole matter several times--for it
was practically new to me too, and I got nearly as excited as she was,
though I have known him so much longer--we came to the conclusion that
this particular volume would have to be of selected matter.  There is
enough of Rupert's work to make a lot of volumes and we have an ambitious
literary project of some day publishing an _edition de luxe_ of his whole
collected works.  It will be a rare showing amongst the works of Kings.
But this is to be all about himself, so that in the future it may serve
as a sort of backbone of his personal history.

By-and-by we came to a part when we had to ask him questions; and he was
so interested in Teuta's work--he is really bound up body and soul in his
beautiful wife, and no wonder--that we had to take him into full
confidence.  He promised he would help us all he could by giving us the
use of his later journals, and such letters and papers as he had kept
privately.  He said he would make one condition--I use his own words: "As
you two dear women are to be my editors, you must promise to put in
everything exactly as I wrote it.  It will not do to have any fake about
this.  I do not wish anything foolish or egotistical toned down out of
affection for me.  It was all written in sincerity, and if I had faults,
they must not be hidden.  If it is to be history, it must be true
history, even if it gives you and me or any of us away."

So we promised.

He also said that, as Sir Edward Bingham Trent, Bart.--as he is now--was
sure to have some matter which we should like, he would write and ask him
to send such to us.  He also said that Mr. Ernest Roger Halbard Melton,
of Humcroft, Salop (he always gives this name and address in full, which
is his way of showing contempt), would be sure to have some relevant
matter, and that he would have him written to on the subject.  This he
did.  The Chancellor wrote him in his most grandiloquent style.   Mr. E.
R. H. Melton, of H., S., replied by return post.  His letter is a
document which speaks for itself:

                                                          HUMCROFT, SALOP,
                                                           _May_ 30, 1908.

    MY DEAR COUSIN KING RUPERT,

    I am honoured by the request made on your behalf by the Lord High
    Chancellor of your kingdom that I should make a literary contribution
    to the volume which my cousin, Queen Teuta, is, with the help of your
    former governess, Miss MacKelpie, compiling.  I am willing to do so,
    as you naturally wish to have in that work some contemporary record
    made by the Head of the House of Melton, with which you are
    connected, though only on the distaff side.  It is a natural ambition
    enough, even on the part of a barbarian--or perhaps
    semi-barbarian--King, and far be it from me, as Head of the House, to
    deny you such a coveted privilege.  Perhaps you may not know that I
    am now Head of the House; my father died three days ago.  I offered
    my mother the use of the Dower House--to the incumbency of which,
    indeed, she is entitled by her marriage settlement.  But she
    preferred to go to live at her seat, Carfax, in Kent.  She went this
    morning after the funeral.  In letting you have the use of my
    manuscript I make only one stipulation, but that I expect to be
    rigidly adhered to.  It is that all that I have written be put in the
    book _in extenso_.  I do not wish any record of mine to be garbled to
    suit other ends than those ostensible, or whatever may be to the
    honour of myself or my House to be burked.  I dare say you have
    noticed, my dear Rupert, that the compilers of family histories
    often, through jealousy, alter matter that they are allowed to use so
    as to suit their own purpose or minister to their own vanity.  I
    think it right to tell you that I have had a certified copy made by
    Petter and Galpin, the law stationers, so that I shall be able to
    verify whether my stipulation has been honourably observed.  I am
    having the book, which is naturally valuable, carefully packed, and
    shall have it forwarded to Sir Edward Bingham Trent, Baronet (which
    he now is--Heaven save the mark!), the Attorney.  Please see that he
    returns it to me, and in proper order.  He is not to publish for
    himself anything in it about him.  A man of that class is apt to
    advertise the fact of anyone of distinction taking any notice of him.
    I would bring out the MS. to you myself, and stay for a while with
    you for some sport, only your lot--subjects I suppose you call
    them!--are such bounders that a gentleman's life is hardly safe
    amongst them.  I never met anyone who had so poor an appreciation of
    a joke as they have.  By the way, how is Teuta?  She is one of them.
    I heard all about the hatching business.  I hope the kid is all
    right.  This is only a word in your ear, so don't get cocky, old son.
    I am open to a godfathership.  Think of that, Hedda!  Of course, if
    the other godfather and the godmother are up to the mark; I don't
    want to have to boost up the whole lot!  Savvy?  Kiss Teuta and the
    kid for me.  I must have the boy over here for a bit later on--when
    he is presentable, and has learned not to be a nuisance.  It will be
    good for him to see something of a real first-class English country
    house like Humcroft.  To a person only accustomed to rough ways and
    meagre living its luxury will make a memory which will serve in time
    as an example to be aimed at.  I shall write again soon.  Don't
    hesitate to ask any favour which I may be able to confer on you.  So
    long!

                                                 Your affectionate cousin,
                                              ERNEST ROGER HALBARD MELTON.

_Extract from Letter from E. Bingham Trent to Queen Teuta of the Blue
Mountains_.

    . . . So I thought the best way to serve that appalling cad would be
    to take him at his word, and put in his literary contribution in
    full.  I have had made and attested a copy of his "Record," as he
    calls it, so as to save you trouble.  But I send the book itself,
    because I am afraid that unless you see his words in his own writing,
    you will not believe that he or anyone else ever penned seriously a
    document so incriminating.  I am sure he must have forgotten what he
    had written, for even such a dull dog as he is could never have made
    public such a thing knowingly. . . Such a nature has its revenges on
    itself.  In this case the officers of revenge are his _ipsissima
    verba_.

All is now well in train.  When the Czar of Russia, on being asked by the
Sclavs (as was meet) to be the referee in the "Balkan Settlement,"
declined on the ground that he was himself by inference an interested
party, it was unanimously agreed by the Balkan rulers that the Western
King should be asked to arbitrate, as all concerned had perfect
confidence in his wisdom, as well as his justice.  To their wish he
graciously assented.  The matter has now been for more than six months in
his hands, and he has taken endless trouble to obtain full information.
He has now informed us through his Chancellor that his decision is almost
ready, and will be communicated as soon as possible.

We have another hunting-party at Vissarion next week.  Teuta is looking
forward to it with extraordinary interest.  She hopes then to present to
our brothers of the Balkans our little son, and she is eager to know if
they endorse her mother-approval of him.



RUPERT'S JOURNAL--_Continued_.


                                                         _April_ 15, 1909.

The arbitrator's decision has been communicated to us through the
Chancellor of the Western King, who brought it to us himself as a special
act of friendliness.  It met with the enthusiastic approval of all.  The
Premier remained with us during the progress of the hunting-party, which
was one of the most joyous occasions ever known.  We are all of good
heart, for the future of the Balkan races is now assured.  The
strife--internal and external--of a thousand years has ceased, and we
look with hope for a long and happy time.  The Chancellor brought
messages of grace and courtliness and friendliness to all.  And when I,
as spokesman of the party, asked him if we might convey a request of His
Majesty that he would honour us by attending the ceremony of making known
formally the Balkan Settlement, he answered that the King had authorized
him to say that he would, if such were wished by us, gladly come; and
that if he should come, he would attend with a fleet as an escort.  The
Chancellor also told me from himself that it might be possible to have
other nationalities represented on such a great occasion by Ambassadors
and even fleets, though the monarchs themselves might not be able to
attend.  He hinted that it might be well if I put the matter in train.
(He evidently took it for granted that, though I was only one of several,
the matter rested with me--possibly he chose me as the one to whom to
make the confidence, as I was born a stranger.)  As we talked it over, he
grew more enthusiastic, and finally said that, as the King was taking the
lead, doubtless all the nations of the earth friendly to him would like
to take a part in the ceremony.  So it is likely to turn out practically
an international ceremony of a unique kind.  Teuta will love it, and we
shall all do what we can.



JANET MACKELPIE'S NOTES.


                                                           _June_ 1, 1909.

Our dear Teuta is full of the forthcoming celebration of the Balkan
Federation, which is to take place this day month, although I must say,
for myself, that the ceremony is attaining to such dimensions that I am
beginning to have a sort of vague fear of some kind.  It almost seems
uncanny.  Rupert is working unceasingly--has been for some time.  For
weeks past he seems to have been out day and night on his aeroplane,
going through and round over the country arranging matters, and seeing
for himself that what has been arranged is being done.  Uncle Colin is
always about, too, and so is Admiral Rooke.  But now Teuta is beginning
to go with Rupert.  That girl is simply fearless--just like Rupert.  And
they both seem anxious that little Rupert shall be the same.  Indeed, he
is the same.  A few mornings ago Rupert and Teuta were about to start
just after dawn from the top of the Castle.  Little Rupert was there--he
is always awake early and as bright as a bee.  I was holding him in my
arms, and when his mother leant over to kiss him good-bye, he held out
his arms to her in a way that said as plainly as if he had spoken, "Take
me with you."

She looked appealingly at Rupert, who nodded, and said: "All right.  Take
him, darling.  He will have to learn some day, and the sooner the
better."  The baby, looking eagerly from one to the other with the same
questioning in his eyes as there is sometimes in the eyes of a kitten or
a puppy--but, of course, with an eager soul behind it--saw that he was
going, and almost leaped into his mother's arms.  I think she had
expected him to come, for she took a little leather dress from Margareta,
his nurse, and, flushing with pride, began to wrap him in it.  When
Teuta, holding him in her arms, stepped on the aeroplane, and took her
place in the centre behind Rupert, the young men of the Crown Prince's
Guard raised a cheer, amid which Rupert pulled the levers, and they
glided off into the dawn.

The Crown Prince's Guard was established by the mountaineers themselves
the day of his birth.  Ten of the biggest and most powerful and cleverest
young men of the nation were chosen, and were sworn in with a very
impressive ceremony to guard the young Prince.  They were to so arrange
and order themselves and matters generally that two at least of them
should always have him, or the place in which he was, within their sight.
They all vowed that the last of their lives should go before harm came to
him.  Of course, Teuta understood, and so did Rupert.  And these young
men are the persons most privileged in the whole Castle.  They are dear
boys, every one of them, and we are all fond of them and respect them.
They simply idolize the baby.

Ever since that morning little Rupert has, unless it is at a time
appointed for his sleeping, gone in his mother's arms.  I think in any
other place there would be some State remonstrance at the whole royal
family being at once and together in a dangerous position, but in the
Blue Mountains danger and fear are not thought of--indeed, they can
hardly be in their terminology.  And I really think the child enjoys it
even more than his parents.  He is just like a little bird that has found
the use of his wings.  Bless him!

I find that even I have to study Court ritual a little.  So many
nationalities are to be represented at the ceremony of the "Balkan
Settlement," and so many Kings and Princes and notabilities of all kinds
are coming, that we must all take care not to make any mistakes.  The
Press alone would drive anyone silly.  Rupert and Teuta come and sit with
me sometimes in the evening when we are all too tired to work, and they
rest themselves by talking matters over.  Rupert says that there will be
over five hundred reporters, and that the applications for permission are
coming in so fast that there may be a thousand when the day comes.  Last
night he stopped in the middle of speaking of it, and said:

"I have an inspiration!  Fancy a thousand journalists,--each wanting to
get ahead of the rest, and all willing to invoke the Powers of Evil for
exclusive information!  The only man to look after this department is
Rooke.  He knows how to deal with men, and as we have already a large
staff to look after the journalistic guests, he can be at the head, and
appoint his own deputies to act for him.  Somewhere and sometime the
keeping the peace will be a matter of nerve and resolution, and Rooke is
the man for the job."

We were all concerned about one thing, naturally important in the eyes of
a woman: What robes was Teuta to wear?  In the old days, when there were
Kings and Queens, they doubtless wore something gorgeous or impressive;
but whatever it was that they wore has gone to dust centuries ago, and
there were no illustrated papers in those primitive days.  Teuta was
talking to me eagerly, with her dear beautiful brows all wrinkled, when
Rupert who was reading a bulky document of some kind, looked up and said:

"Of course, darling, you will wear your Shroud?"

"Capital!" she said, clapping her hands like a joyous child.  "The very
thing, and our people will like it."

I own that for a moment I was dismayed.  It was a horrible test of a
woman's love and devotion.  At a time when she was entertaining Kings and
notabilities in her own house--and be sure they would all be decked in
their finery--to have to appear in such a garment!  A plain thing with
nothing even pretty, let alone gorgeous, about it!  I expressed my views
to Rupert, for I feared that Teuta might be disappointed, though she
might not care to say so; but before he could say a word Teuta answered:

"Oh, thank you so much, dear!  I should love that above everything, but I
did not like to suggest it, lest you should think me arrogant or
presuming; for, indeed, Rupert, I am very proud of it, and of the way our
people look on it."

"Why not?" said Rupert, in his direct way.  "It is a thing for us all to
be proud of; the nation has already adopted it as a national emblem--our
emblem of courage and devotion and patriotism, which will always, I hope,
be treasured beyond price by the men and women of our Dynasty, the
Nation, that is--of the Nation that is to be."

Later on in the evening we had a strange endorsement of the national
will.  A "People's Deputation" of mountaineers, without any official
notice or introduction, arrived at the Castle late in the evening in the
manner established by Rupert's "Proclamation of Freedom," wherein all
citizens were entitled to send a deputation to the King, at will and in
private, on any subject of State importance.  This deputation was
composed of seventeen men, one selected from each political section, so
that the body as a whole represented the entire nation.  They were of all
sorts of social rank and all degrees of fortune, but they were mainly "of
the people."  They spoke hesitatingly--possibly because Teuta, or even
because I, was present--but with a manifest earnestness.  They made but
one request--that the Queen should, on the great occasion of the Balkan
Federation, wear as robes of State the Shroud that they loved to see her
in.  The spokesman, addressing the Queen, said in tones of rugged
eloquence:

"This is a matter, Your Majesty, that the women naturally have a say in,
so we have, of course, consulted them.  They have discussed the matter by
themselves, and then with us, and they are agreed without a flaw that it
will be good for the Nation and for Womankind that you do this thing.
You have shown to them, and to the world at large, what women should do,
what they can do, and they want to make, in memory of your great act, the
Shroud a garment of pride and honour for women who have deserved well of
their country.  In the future it can be a garment to be worn only by
privileged women who have earned the right.  But they hope, and we hope
with them, that on this occasion of our Nation taking the lead before the
eyes of the world, all our women may wear it on that day as a means of
showing overtly their willingness to do their duty, even to the death.
And so"--here he turned to the King--"Rupert, we trust that Her Majesty
Queen Teuta will understand that in doing as the women of the Blue
Mountains wish, she will bind afresh to the Queen the loyal devotion
which she won from them as Voivodin.  Henceforth and for all time the
Shroud shall be a dress of honour in our Land."

Teuta looked all ablaze with love and pride and devotion.  Stars in her
eyes shone like white fire as she assured them of the granting of their
request.  She finished her little speech:

"I feared that if I carried out my own wish, it might look arrogant, but
Rupert has expressed the same wish, and now I feel that I am free to wear
that dress which brought me to you and to Rupert"--here she beamed on
him, and took his hand--"fortified as I am by your wishes and the command
of my lord the King."

Rupert took her in his arms and kissed her fondly before them all,
saying:

"Tell your wives, my brothers, and the rest of the Blue Mountain women,
that that is the answer of the husband who loves and honours his wife.
All the world shall see at the ceremony of the Federation of Balka that
we men love and honour the women who are loyal and can die for duty.
And, men of the Blue Mountains, some day before long we shall organize
that great idea, and make it a permanent thing--that the Order of the
Shroud is the highest guerdon that a noble-hearted woman can wear."

Teuta disappeared for a few moments, and came back with the Crown Prince
in her arms.  Everyone present asked to be allowed to kiss him, which
they did kneeling.



THE FEDERATION BALKA.


_By the Correspondents of_ "_Free America_."

The Editors of _Free America_ have thought it well to put in consecutive
order the reports and descriptions of their Special Correspondents, of
whom there were present no less than eight.  Not a word they wrote is
omitted, but the various parts of their reports are placed in different
order, so that, whilst nothing which any of them recorded is left out,
the reader may be able to follow the proceedings from the various points
of view of the writers who had the most favourable opportunity of moment.
In so large an assemblage of journalists--there were present over a
thousand--they could not all be present in one place; so our men, in
consultation amongst themselves, arranged to scatter, so as to cover the
whole proceeding from the various "coigns of vantage," using their skill
and experience in selecting these points.  One was situated on the summit
of the steel-clad tower in the entrance to the Blue Mouth; another on the
"Press-boat," which was moored alongside King Rupert's armoured yacht,
_The Lady_, whereon were gathered the various Kings and rulers of the
Balkan States, all of whom were in the Federation; another was in a swift
torpedo-boat, with a roving commission to cruise round the harbour as
desired; another took his place on the top of the great mountain which
overlooks Plazac, and so had a bird's-eye view of the whole scene of
operations; two others were on the forts to right and left of the Blue
Mouth; another was posted at the entrance to the Great Tunnel which runs
from the water level right up through the mountains to the plateau, where
the mines and factories are situate; another had the privilege of a place
on an aeroplane, which went everywhere and saw everything.  This
aeroplane was driven by an old Special Correspondent of _Free America_,
who had been a chum of our Special in the Japanese and Russian War, and
who has taken service on the Blue Mountain _Official Gazette_.

                                                                   PLAZAC,
                                                          _June_ 30, 1909.

Two days before the time appointed for the ceremony the guests of the
Land of the Blue Mountains began to arrive.  The earlier comers were
mostly the journalists who had come from almost over the whole inhabited
world.  King Rupert, who does things well, had made a camp for their
exclusive use.  There was a separate tent for each--of course, a small
one, as there were over a thousand journalists--but there were big tents
for general use scattered about--refectories, reading and writing rooms,
a library, idle rooms for rest, etc.  In the rooms for reading and
writing, which were the work-rooms for general use, were newspapers, the
latest attainable from all over the world, Blue-Books, guides,
directories, and all such aids to work as forethought could arrange.
There was for this special service a body of some hundreds of capable
servants in special dress and bearing identification numbers--in fact,
King Rupert "did us fine," to use a slang phrase of pregnant meaning.

There were other camps for special service, all of them well arranged,
and with plenty of facility for transport.  Each of the Federating
Monarchs had a camp of his own, in which he had erected a magnificent
pavilion.  For the Western King, who had acted as Arbitrator in the
matter of the Federation, a veritable palace had been built by King
Rupert--a sort of Aladdin's palace it must have been, for only a few
weeks ago the place it occupied was, I was told, only primeval
wilderness.  King Rupert and his Queen, Teuta, had a pavilion like the
rest of the Federators of Balka, but infinitely more modest, both in size
and adornments.

Everywhere were guards of the Blue Mountains, armed only with the
"handjar," which is the national weapon.  They wore the national dress,
but so arranged in colour and accoutrement that the general air of
uniformity took the place of a rigid uniform.  There must have been at
least seventy or eighty thousand of them.

The first day was one of investigation of details by the visitors.
During the second day the retinues of the great Federators came.  Some of
these retinues were vast.  For instance, the Soldan (though only just
become a Federator) sent of one kind or another more than a thousand men.
A brave show they made, for they are fine men, and drilled to perfection.
As they swaggered along, singly or in mass, with their gay jackets and
baggy trousers, their helmets surmounted by the golden crescent, they
looked a foe not to be despised.  Landreck Martin, the Nestor of
journalists, said to me, as we stood together looking at them:

"To-day we witness a new departure in Blue Mountain history.  This is the
first occasion for a thousand years that so large a Turkish body has
entered the Blue Mountains with a reasonable prospect of ever getting out
again."

                                                           _July_ 1, 1909.

To-day, the day appointed for the ceremony, was auspiciously fine, even
for the Blue Mountains, where at this time of year the weather is nearly
always fine.  They are early folk in the Blue Mountains, but to-day
things began to hum before daybreak.  There were bugle-calls all over the
place--everything here is arranged by calls of musical
instruments--trumpets, or bugles, or drums (if, indeed, the drum can be
called a musical instrument)--or by lights, if it be after dark.  We
journalists were all ready; coffee and bread-and-butter had been
thoughtfully served early in our sleeping-tents, and an elaborate
breakfast was going on all the time in the refectory pavilions.  We had a
preliminary look round, and then there was a sort of general pause for
breakfast.  We took advantage of it, and attacked the sumptuous--indeed,
memorable--meal which was served for us.

The ceremony was to commence at noon, but at ten o'clock the whole place
was astir--not merely beginning to move, but actually moving; everybody
taking their places for the great ceremony.  As noon drew near, the
excitement was intense and prolonged.  One by one the various signatories
to the Federation began to assemble.  They all came by sea; such of them
as had sea-boards of their own having their fleets around them.  Such as
had no fleets of their own were attended by at least one of the Blue
Mountain ironclads.  And I am bound to say that I never in my life saw
more dangerous craft than these little warships of King Rupert of the
Blue Mountains.  As they entered the Blue Mouth each ship took her
appointed station, those which carried the signatories being close
together in an isolated group in a little bay almost surrounded by high
cliffs in the farthest recesses of the mighty harbour.  King Rupert's
armoured yacht all the time lay close inshore, hard by the mouth of the
Great Tunnel which runs straight into the mountain from a wide plateau,
partly natural rock, partly built up with mighty blocks of stone.  Here
it is, I am told, that the inland products are brought down to the modern
town of Plazac.  Just as the clocks were chiming the half-hour before
noon this yacht glided out into the expanse of the "Mouth."  Behind her
came twelve great barges, royally decked, and draped each in the colour
of the signatory nation.  On each of these the ruler entered with his
guard, and was carried to Rupert's yacht, he going on the bridge, whilst
his suite remained on the lower deck.  In the meantime whole fleets had
been appearing on the southern horizon; the nations were sending their
maritime quota to the christening of "Balka"!  In such wonderful order as
can only be seen with squadrons of fighting ships, the mighty throng
swept into the Blue Mouth, and took up their stations in groups.  The
only armament of a Great Power now missing was that of the Western King.
But there was time.  Indeed, as the crowd everywhere began to look at
their watches a long line of ships began to spread up northward from the
Italian coast.  They came at great speed--nearly twenty knots.  It was a
really wonderful sight--fifty of the finest ships in the world; the very
latest expression of naval giants, each seemingly typical of its
class--Dreadnoughts, cruisers, destroyers.  They came in a wedge, with
the King's yacht flying the Royal Standard the apex.  Every ship of the
squadron bore a red ensign long enough to float from the masthead to the
water.  From the armoured tower in the waterway one could see the myriad
of faces--white stars on both land and sea--for the great harbour was now
alive with ships and each and all of them alive with men.

Suddenly, without any direct cause, the white masses became
eclipsed--everyone had turned round, and was looking the other way.  I
looked across the bay and up the mountain behind--a mighty mountain,
whose slopes run up to the very sky, ridge after ridge seeming like
itself a mountain.  Far away on the very top the standard of the Blue
Mountains was run up on a mighty Flagstaff which seemed like a shaft of
light.  It was two hundred feet high, and painted white, and as at the
distance the steel stays were invisible, it towered up in lonely
grandeur.  At its foot was a dark mass grouped behind a white space,
which I could not make out till I used my field-glasses.

Then I knew it was King Rupert and the Queen in the midst of a group of
mountaineers.  They were on the aero station behind the platform of the
aero, which seemed to shine--shine, not glitter--as though it were
overlaid with plates of gold.

Again the faces looked west.  The Western Squadron was drawing near to
the entrance of the Blue Mouth.  On the bridge of the yacht stood the
Western King in uniform of an Admiral, and by him his Queen in a dress of
royal purple, splendid with gold.  Another glance at the mountain-top
showed that it had seemed to become alive.  A whole park of artillery
seemed to have suddenly sprung to life, round each its crew ready for
action.  Amongst the group at the foot of the Flagstaff we could
distinguish King Rupert; his vast height and bulk stood out from and
above all round him.  Close to him was a patch of white, which we
understood to be Queen Teuta, whom the Blue Mountaineers simply adore.

By this time the armoured yacht, bearing all the signatories to "Balka"
(excepting King Rupert), had moved out towards the entrance, and lay
still and silent, waiting the coming of the Royal Arbitrator, whose whole
squadron simultaneously slowed down, and hardly drifted in the seething
water of their backing engines.

When the flag which was in the yacht's prow was almost opposite the
armoured fort, the Western King held up a roll of vellum handed to him by
one of his officers.  We onlookers held our breath, for in an instant was
such a scene as we can never hope to see again.

At the raising of the Western King's hand, a gun was fired away on the
top of the mountain where rose the mighty Flagstaff with the standard of
the Blue Mountains.  Then came the thunder of salute from the guns,
bright flashes and reports, which echoed down the hillsides in
never-ending sequence.  At the first gun, by some trick of signalling,
the flag of the Federated "Balka" floated out from the top of the
Flagstaff, which had been mysteriously raised, and flew above that of the
Blue Mountains.

At the same moment the figures of Rupert and Teuta sank; they were taking
their places on the aeroplane.  An instant after, like a great golden
bird, it seemed to shoot out into the air, and then, dipping its head,
dropped downward at an obtuse angle.  We could see the King and Queen
from time waist upwards--the King in Blue Mountain dress of green; the
Queen, wrapped in her white Shroud, holding her baby on her breast.  When
far out from the mountain-top and over the Blue Mouth, the wings and tail
of the great bird-like machine went up, and the aero dropped like a
stone, till it was only some few hundred feet over the water.  Then the
wings and tail went down, but with diminishing speed.  Below the expanse
of the plane the King and Queen were now seen seated together on the tiny
steering platform, which seemed to have been lowered; she sat behind her
husband, after the manner of matrons of the Blue Mountains.  That coming
of that aeroplane was the most striking episode of all this wonderful
day.

After floating for a few seconds, the engines began to work, whilst the
planes moved back to their normal with beautiful simultaneity.  There was
a golden aero finding its safety in gliding movement.  At the same time
the steering platform was rising, so that once more the occupants were
not far below, but above the plane.  They were now only about a hundred
feet above the water, moving from the far end of the Blue Mouth towards
the entrance in the open space between the two lines of the fighting
ships of the various nationalities, all of which had by now their yards
manned--a manoeuvre which had begun at the firing of the first gun on the
mountain-top.  As the aero passed along, all the seamen began to cheer--a
cheering which they kept up till the King and Queen had come so close to
the Western King's vessel that the two Kings and Queens could greet each
other.  The wind was now beginning to blow westward from the
mountain-top, and it took the sounds towards the armoured fort, so that
at moments we could distinguish the cheers of the various nationalities,
amongst which, more keen than the others, came the soft "Ban Zai!" of the
Japanese.

King Rupert, holding his steering levers, sat like a man of marble.
Behind him his beautiful wife, clad in her Shroud, and holding in her
arms the young Crown Prince, seemed like a veritable statue.

The aero, guided by Rupert's unerring hand, lit softly on the after-deck
of the Western King's yacht; and King Rupert, stepping on deck, lifted
from her seat Queen Teuta with her baby in her arms.  It was only when
the Blue Mountain King stood amongst other men that one could realize his
enormous stature.  He stood literally head and shoulders over every other
man present.

Whilst the aeroplane was giving up its burden, the Western King and his
Queen were descending from the bridge.  The host and hostess, hand in
hand--after their usual fashion, as it seems--hurried forward to greet
their guests.  The meeting was touching in its simplicity.  The two
monarchs shook hands, and their consorts, representatives of the foremost
types of national beauty of the North and South, instinctively drew close
and kissed each other.  Then the hostess Queen, moving towards the
Western King, kneeled before him with the gracious obeisance of a Blue
Mountain hostess, and kissed his hand.

Her words of greeting were:

"You are welcome, sire, to the Blue Mountains.  We are grateful to you
for all you have done for Balka, and to you and Her Majesty for giving us
the honour of your presence."

The King seemed moved.  Accustomed as he was to the ritual of great
occasions, the warmth and sincerity, together with the gracious humility
of this old Eastern custom, touched him, monarch though he was of a great
land and many races in the Far East.  Impulsively he broke through Court
ritual, and did a thing which, I have since been told, won for him for
ever a holy place in the warm hearts of the Blue Mountaineers.  Sinking
on his knee before the beautiful shroud-clad Queen, he raised her hand
and kissed it.  The act was seen by all in and around the Blue Mouth, and
a mighty cheering rose, which seemed to rise and swell as it ran far and
wide up the hillsides, till it faded away on the far-off mountain-top,
where rose majestically the mighty Flagstaff bearing the standard of the
Balkan Federation.

For myself, I can never forget that wonderful scene of a nation's
enthusiasm, and the core of it is engraven on my memory.  That spotless
deck, typical of all that is perfect in naval use; the King and Queen of
the greatest nation of the earth {3} received by the newest King and
Queen--a King and Queen who won empire for themselves, so that the former
subject of another King received him as a brother-monarch on a
history-making occasion, when a new world-power was, under his tutelage,
springing into existence.  The fair Northern Queen in the arms of the
dark Southern Queen with the starry eyes.  The simple splendour of
Northern dress arrayed against that of almost peasant plainness of the
giant King of the South.  But all were eclipsed--even the thousand years
of royal lineage of the Western King, Rupert's natural dower of stature,
and the other Queen's bearing of royal dignity and sweetness--by the
elemental simplicity of Teuta's Shroud.  Not one of all that mighty
throng but knew something of her wonderful story; and not one but felt
glad and proud that such a noble woman had won an empire through her own
bravery, even in the jaws of the grave.

The armoured yacht, with the remainder of the signatories to the Balkan
Federation, drew close, and the rulers stepped on board to greet the
Western King, the Arbitrator, Rupert leaving his task as personal host
and joining them.  He took his part modestly in the rear of the group,
and made a fresh obeisance in his new capacity.

Presently another warship, _The Balka_, drew close.  It contained the
ambassadors of Foreign Powers, and the Chancellors and high officials of
the Balkan nations.  It was followed by a fleet of warships, each one
representing a Balkan Power.  The great Western fleet lay at their
moorings, but with the exception of manning their yards, took no
immediate part in the proceedings.

On the deck of the new-comer the Balkan monarchs took their places, the
officials of each State grading themselves behind their monarch.  The
Ambassadors formed a foremost group by themselves.

Last came the Western King, quite alone (save for the two Queens),
bearing in his hand the vellum scroll, the record of his arbitration.
This he proceeded to read, a polyglot copy of it having been already
supplied to every Monarch, Ambassador, and official present.  It was a
long statement, but the occasion was so stupendous--so intense--that the
time flew by quickly.  The cheering had ceased the moment the Arbitrator
opened the scroll, and a veritable silence of the grave abounded.

When the reading was concluded Rupert raised his hand, and on the instant
came a terrific salvo of cannon-shots from not only the ships in the
port, but seemingly all up and over the hillsides away to the very
summit.

When the cheering which followed the salute had somewhat toned down,
those on board talked together, and presentations were made.  Then the
barges took the whole company to the armour-clad fort in the entrance-way
to the Blue Mouth.  Here, in front, had been arranged for the occasion,
platforms for the starting of aeroplanes.  Behind them were the various
thrones of state for the Western King and Queen, and the various rulers
of "Balka"--as the new and completed Balkan Federation had become--_de
jure_ as well as _de facto_.  Behind were seats for the rest of the
company.  All was a blaze of crimson and gold.  We of the Press were all
expectant, for some ceremony had manifestly been arranged, but of all
details of it we had been kept in ignorance.  So far as I could tell from
the faces, those present were at best but partially informed.  They were
certainly ignorant of all details, and even of the entire programme of
the day.  There is a certain kind of expectation which is not concerned
in the mere execution of fore-ordered things.

The aero on which the King and Queen had come down from the mountain now
arrived on the platform in the charge of a tall young mountaineer, who
stepped from the steering-platform at once.  King Rupert, having handed
his Queen (who still carried her baby) into her seat, took his place, and
pulled a lever.  The aero went forward, and seemed to fall head foremost
off the fort.  It was but a dip, however, such as a skilful diver takes
from a height into shallow water, for the plane made an upward curve, and
in a few seconds was skimming upwards towards the Flagstaff.  Despite the
wind, it arrived there in an incredibly short time.  Immediately after
his flight another aero, a big one this time, glided to the platform.  To
this immediately stepped a body of ten tall, fine-looking young men.  The
driver pulled his levers, and the plane glided out on the track of the
King.  The Western King, who was noticing, said to the Lord High Admiral,
who had been himself in command of the ship of war, and now stood close
behind him:

"Who are those men, Admiral?"

"The Guard of the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.  They are appointed by the
Nation."

"Tell me, Admiral, have they any special duties?"

"Yes, Your Majesty," came the answer: "to die, if need be, for the young
Prince!"

"Quite right!  That is fine service.  But how if any of them should die?"

"Your Majesty, if one of them should die, there are ten thousand eager to
take his place."

"Fine, fine!  It is good to have even one man eager to give his life for
duty.  But ten thousand!  That is what makes a nation!"

When King Rupert reached the platform by the Flagstaff, the Royal
Standard of the Blue Mountains was hauled up under it.  Rupert stood up
and raised his hand.  In a second a cannon beside him was fired; then,
quick as thought, others were fired in sequence, as though by one
prolonged lightning-flash.  The roar was incessant, but getting less in
detonating sound as the distance and the hills subdued it.  But in the
general silence which prevailed round us we could hear the sound as
though passing in a distant circle, till finally the line which had gone
northward came back by the south, stopping at the last gun to south'ard
of the Flagstaff.

"What was that wonderful circle?" asked the King of the Lord High
Admiral.

"That, Your Majesty, is the line of the frontier of the Blue Mountains.
Rupert has ten thousand cannon in line."

"And who fires them?  I thought all the army must be here."

"The women, Your Majesty.  They are on frontier duty to-day, so that the
men can come here."

Just at that moment one of the Crown Prince's Guards brought to the side
of the King's aero something like a rubber ball on the end of a string.
The Queen held it out to the baby in her arms, who grabbed at it.  The
guard drew back.  Pressing that ball must have given some signal, for on
the instant a cannon, elevated to perpendicular, was fired.  A shell went
straight up an enormous distance.  The shell burst, and sent out both a
light so bright that it could be seen in the daylight, and a red smoke,
which might have been seen from the heights of the Calabrian Mountains
over in Italy.

As the shell burst, the King's aero seemed once more to spring from the
platform out into mid-air, dipped as before, and glided out over the Blue
Mouth with a rapidity which, to look at, took one's breath away.

As it came, followed by the aero of the Crown Prince's Guard and a group
of other aeros, the whole mountain-sides seemed to become alive.  From
everywhere, right away up to the farthest visible mountain-tops, darted
aeroplanes, till a host of them were rushing with dreadful speed in the
wake of the King.  The King turned to Queen Teuta, and evidently said
something, for she beckoned to the Captain of the Crown Prince's Guard,
who was steering the plane.  He swerved away to the right, and instead of
following above the open track between the lines of warships, went high
over the outer line.  One of those on board began to drop something,
which, fluttering down, landed on every occasion on the bridge of the
ship high over which they then were.

The Western King said again to the Gospodar Rooke (the Lord High
Admiral):

"It must need some skill to drop a letter with such accuracy."

With imperturbable face the Admiral replied:

"It is easier to drop bombs, Your Majesty."

The flight of aeroplanes was a memorable sight.  It helped to make
history.  Henceforth no nation with an eye for either defence or attack
can hope for success without the mastery of the air.

In the meantime--and after that time, too--God help the nation that
attacks "Balka" or any part of it, so long as Rupert and Teuta live in
the hearts of that people, and bind them into an irresistible unity.

THE DREAMS THAT ARE ONLY DREAMS


"This to be Love, that your spirit to live in a natural holiness with
the Beloved, and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that
shall be never lost of a lovely mystery.... And shame to be unborn, and
all things to go wholesome and proper, out of an utter greatness of
understanding; and the Man to be an Hero and a Child before the Woman;
and the Woman to be an Holy Light of the Spirit and an Utter Companion
and in the same time a glad Possession unto the Man.... And this doth be
Human Love...."

"...for this to be the especial glory of Love, that it doth make unto
all Sweetness and Greatness, and doth be a fire burning all Littleness;
so that did all in this world to have met The Beloved, then did
Wantonness be dead, and there to grow Gladness and Charity, dancing in
the years."

MIRDATH THE BEAUTIFUL


    "And I cannot touch her face
    And I cannot touch her hair,
    And I kneel to empty shadows--
    Just memories of her grace;
    And her voice sings in the winds
    And in the sobs of dawn
    And among the flowers at night
    And from the brooks at sunrise
    And from the sea at sunset,
    And I answer with vain callings ..."

It was the Joy of the Sunset that brought us to speech. I was gone a
long way from my house, walking lonely-wise, and stopping often that I
view the piling upward of the Battlements of Evening, and to feel the
dear and strange gathering of the Dusk come over all the world about me.

The last time that I paused, I was truly lost in a solemn joy of the
Glory of the Coming Night; and maybe I laughed a little in my throat,
standing there alone in the midst of the Dusk upon the World. And, lo!
my content was answered out of the trees that bounded the country road
upon my right; and it was so as that some one had said: "And thou also!"
in glad understanding, that I laughed again a little in my throat; as
though I had only a half-believing that any true human did answer my
laugh; but rather some sweet Delusion or Spirit that was tuned to my
mood.

But she spoke and called me by my name; and when I had gone to the side
of the road, that I should see her somewhat, and discover whether I knew
her, I saw that she was surely that lady, who for her beauty was known
through all of that sweet County of Kent as Lady Mirdath the Beautiful;
and a near neighbour to me; for the Estates of her Guardian abounded
upon mine.

Yet, until that time, I had never met her; for I had been so oft and
long abroad; and so much given to my Studies and my Exercises when at
home, that I had no further Knowledge of her than Rumour gave to me odd
time; and for the rest, I was well content; for as I have given hint, my
books held me, and likewise my Exercises; for I was always an athlete,
and never met the man so quick or so strong as I did be; save in some
fiction of a tale or in the mouth of a boaster.

Now, I stood instantly with my hat in my hand; and answered her gentle
bantering so well as I might, the while that I peered intent and
wondering at her through the gloom; for truly Rumour had told no tale to
equal the beauty of this strange maid; who now stood jesting with so
sweet a spirit, and claiming kinship of Cousinhood with me, as was
truth, now that I did wake to think.

And, truly, she made no ado; but named me frank by my lad's name, and
gave laughter and right to me to name her Mirdath, and nothing less or
more--at that time. And she bid me then to come up through the hedge,
and make use of a gap that was her own especial secret, as she
confessed, when she took odd leave with her maid to some country frolic,
drest as village maids; but not to deceive many, as I dare believe.

And I came up through the gap in the hedge and stood beside her; and
tall she had seemed to me, when I looked up at her; and tall she was, in
truth; but indeed I was a great head taller. And she invited me then to
walk with her to the house, that I meet her Guardian and give word to my
sorrow that I had so long neglected to make call upon them; and truly
her eyes to shine with mischief and delight, as she named me so for my
amissness.

But, indeed, she grew sober in a moment, and she set up her finger to me
to hush, as that she heard somewhat in the wood that lay all the way
upon our right. And, indeed, something I heard too; for there was surely
a rustling of the leaves, and anon a dead twig crackt with a sound clear
and sharp in the stillness.

And immediately there came three men running out of the wood at me; and
I called to them sharply to keep off or beware of harm; and I put the
maid to my back with my left hand, and had my oak staff ready for my
use.

But the three men gave out no word of reply; but ran in at me; and I saw
somewhat of the gleam of knives; and at that, I moved very glad and
brisk to the attack; and behind me there went shrill and sweet, the call
of a silver whistle; for the Maid was whistling for her dogs; and maybe
the call was also a signal to the men-servants of her house.

Yet, truly, there was no use in help that was yet to come; for the need
did be then and instant; and I nowise loath to use my strength before
my sweet cousin. And I stepped forward, briskly, as I have told; and
the end of my staff I drove into the body of the left-ward man, so that
he dropped like a dead man. And I hit very sharply at the head of
another, and surely crackt it for him; for he made instantly upon the
earth; but the third man I met with my fist, and neither had he any
great need of a second blow; but went instant to join his companions,
and the fight thus to have ended before it was even proper begun, and I
laughing a little with a proper pride, to know the bewilderment that I
perceived in the way that the Lady Mirdath, my cousin, stood and
regarded me through the dusk of the hushed even.

But, indeed, there was no time left to us, before there came bounding
up, three great boar-hounds, that had been loosed to her whistle; and
she had some ado to keep the brutes off me; and I then to beat them off
the men upon the earth, lest they maul them as they lay. And directly,
there was a noise of men shouting, and the light of lanthorns in the
night, and the footmen of the house to come running with lanthorns and
cudgels; and knew not whether to deal with me, or not, in the first
moment, even as the dogs; but when they saw the men upon the ground, and
learned my name and saw me proper, they kept well their distance and had
no lack of respect; but, indeed, my sweet cousin to have the most of
any; only that she showed no intent to keep distance of me; but to have
a new and deeper feeling of kinship than she at first had shown.

And the men-servants asked what should be done with the foot-pads;
seeing that they were now recovering. But, indeed, I left the matter,
along with some silver, to the servants; and very sound justice they
dealt out to the men; for I heard their cries a good while after we had
gone away.

Now, when we were come up to the Hall, my cousin must take me in to her
Guardian, Sir Alfred Jarles, an old man and venerable that I knew a
little in passing and because our estates abounded. And she praised me
to my face, yet quaintly-wise; and the old man, her Guardian thanked me
most honourably and with a nice courtesy; so that I was a welcome
house-friend from that time onward.

And I stayed all that evening, and dined, and afterward went out again
into the home-grounds with the Lady Mirdath; and she more friendly to me
than ever any woman had been; and seemed to me as that she had known me
always. And, truly, I had the same feeling in my heart towards her; for
it was, somehow, as though we knew each the way and turn of the other,
and had a constant delight to find this thing and that thing to be in
common; but no surprise; save that so pleasant a truth had so natural a
discovery.

And one thing there was that I perceived held the Lady Mirdath all that
dear fore-night; and this was, indeed, the way that I had my pleasure so
easy with the three foot-pads. And she asked me plainly whether I was
not truly very strong; and when I laughed with young and natural pride,
she caught my arm suddenly to discover for herself how strong I might
be. And, surely, she loosed it even the more sudden, and with a little
gasping of astonishment, because it was so great and hard. And
afterward, she walked by me very silent, and seeming thoughtful; but she
went never any great way off from me.

And, truly, if the Lady Mirdath had a strange pleasure in my strength, I
had likewise a constant wonder and marvel in her beauty, that had shown
but the more lovely in the candle-light at dinner.

But there were further delights to me in the days that came; for I had
happiness in the way that she had pleasure of the Mystery of the
Evening, and the Glamour of Night, and the Joy of Dawn, and all
suchlike.

And one evening, that I ever remember, as we wandered in the park-lands,
she began to say--half unthinking--that it was truly an elves-night. And
she stopped herself immediately; as though she thought I should have no
understanding; but, indeed, I was upon mine own familiar ground of
inward delight; and I replied in a quiet and usual voice, that the
Towers of Sleep would grow that night, and I felt in my bones that it
was a night to find the Giant's Tomb, or the Tree with the Great Painted
Head, or--And surely I stopped very sudden; for she gripped me in that
moment, and her hand shook as she held me; but when I would ask her what
ailed, she bid me, very breathless, to say on, to say on. And, with a
half understanding, I told her that I had but meant to speak of the Moon
Garden, that was an olden and happy fancy of mine.

And, in verity, when I said that, the Lady Mirdath cried out something
in a strange low voice, and brought me to a halt, that she might face
me. And she questioned me very earnest; and I answered just so earnest
as she; for I was grown suddenly to an excitement, in that I perceived
she knew also. And, in verity, she told me that she had knowledge; but
had thought that she was alone in the world with her knowledge of that
strange land of her dreams; and now to find that I also had travelled in
those dear, strange dream lands. And truly the marvel of it--the marvel
of it! As she to say time and oft. And again, as we walked, she gave out
word that there was little wonder she had been urged to call to me that
night, as she saw me pause upon the road; though, indeed, she had
learned of our cousin-ship before, having seen me go by on my horse
pretty oft, and inquired concerning me; and mayhap daintily irked that I
had so little heed of Lady Mirdath the Beautiful. But, indeed, I had
thought of other matters; yet had been human enough, had I but met her
proper before I see her.

Now you must not think that I was not utter stirred by the wonder of
this thing, that we had both a dreamful knowledge of the same matters,
of which each had thought none other knew. Yet, when I questioned more,
there was much that had been in my fancies that was foreign to her, and
likewise much that had been familiar to her, that was of no meaning to
me. But though there was this, that brought a little regret to us, there
would be, time and again, some new thing that one told, that the other
knew and could finish the telling of, to the gladness and amazement of
both.

And so shall you picture us wandering and having constant speech, so
that, hour by hour, we grew gladly aged in dear knowledge and sweet
friendship of the other.

And truly, how the time passed, I know not; but there came presently a
hullabaloo, and the shouts of men's voices and the baying of dogs, and
the gleam of lanthorns, so that I knew not what to think; until, very
sudden, and with a sweet and strange little laughter, the Lady Mirdath
to perceive that we had missed the hours utter in our converse; so that
her Guardian (made uneasy because of the three foot-pads) had ordered a
search. And we all that time a-wander together in happy forgetfulness.

And we turned homeward, then, and came towards the lights; but indeed,
the dogs found us before we were come there; and they had grown to know
me now, and leaped about me, barking very friendly; and so in a minute
the men had discovered us, and were gone back to tell Sir Jarles that
all was well.

And this was the way of our meeting and the growing of our acquaintance,
and the beginning of my great love for Mirdath the Beautiful.

Now, from that time onward, evening by evening would I go a-wander along
the quiet and country road that led from my estate to the estate of Sir
Jarles. And always I went inward by the hedge-gap; and oft I should find
the Lady Mirdath walking in that part of the woods; but always with her
great boar-hounds about her; for I had begged that she do this thing for
her sweet safety; and she to seem wishful to pleasure me; but truly to
be just so oft utter perverse in diverse matters; and to strive to
plague me, as though she would discover how much I would endure and how
far she might go to anger me.

And, truly, well I remember how that one night, coming to the hedge-gap,
I saw two country-maids come thence out from the woods of Sir Jarles';
but they were naught to me, and I would have gone upward through the
gap, as ever; only that, as they passed me, they curtseyed somewhat
over-graceful for rough wenches. And I had a sudden thought, and came up
to them to see them more anigh; and truly I thought the taller was
surely the Lady Mirdath. But, indeed, I could not be sure; for when I
asked who she did be, she only to simper and to curtsey again; and so
was I very natural all in doubt; but yet sufficient in wonder (having
some knowledge of the Lady Mirdath) to follow the wenches, the which I
did.

And they then, very speedy and sedate, as though I were some rack-rape
that they did well to be feared of alone at night; and so came at last
to the village green, where a great dance was a-foot, with torches, and
a wandering fiddler to set the tune; and ale in plenty.

And the two to join the dance, and danced very hearty; but had only each
the other for a partner, and had a good care to avoid the torches. And
by this, I was pretty sure that they were truly the Lady Mirdath and her
maid; and so I took chance when they had danced somewhat my way, to step
over to them, and ask boldly for a dance. But, indeed, the tall one
answered, simpering, that she was promised; and immediately gave her
hand to a great hulking farmer-lout, and went round the green with him;
and well punished she was for her waywardness; for she had all her skill
to save her pretty feet from his loutish stampings; and very glad she
was to meet the end of the dance.

And I knew now for certainty that it was Mirdath the Beautiful, despite
her plan of disguise, and the darkness and the wench's dress and the
foot-gear that marred her step so great. And I walked across to her, and
named her, whispering, by name; and gave her plain word to be done of
this unwisdom, and I would take her home. But she to turn from me, and
she stamped her foot, and went again to the lout; and when she had
suffered another dance with him, she bid him be her escort a part of the
way; the which he was nothing loath of.

And another lad, that was mate to him, went likewise; and in a moment,
so soon as they were gone away from the light of the torches, the rough
hind-lads made to set their arms about the waists of the two wenches,
not wetting who they had for companions. And the Lady Mirdath was no
longer able to endure, and cried out in her sudden fear and disgust, and
struck the rough hind that embraced her, so hard that he loosed her a
moment, swearing great oaths. And directly he came back to her again,
and had her in a moment, to kiss her; and she, loathing him to the very
death, beat him madly in the face with her hands; but to no end, only
that I was close upon them. And, in that moment, she screamed my name
aloud; and I caught the poor lout and hit him once, but not to harm him
overmuch; yet to give him a long memory of me; and afterward I threw him
into the side of the road. But the second hind, having heard my name,
loosed from the tiring-maid, and ran for his life; and, indeed, my
strength was known all about that part.

And I caught Mirdath the Beautiful by her shoulders, and shook her very
soundly, in my anger. And afterward, I sent the maid onward; and she,
having no word from her Mistress to stay, went forward a little; and in
this fashion we came at last to the hedge-gap, with the Lady Mirdath
very hushed; but yet walking anigh to me, as that she had some secret
pleasure of my nearness. And I led her through the gap, and so homeward
to the Hall; and there bid her good-night at a side door that she held
the key of. And, truly, she bid me good-night in an utter quiet voice;
and was almost as that she had no haste to be gone from me that night.

Yet, when I met her on the morrow, she was full of a constant impudence
to me; so that, having her alone to myself, when the dusk was come, I
asked her why she would never be done of her waywardness; because that I
ached to have companionship of her; and, instead, she denied my need.
And, at that, she was at once very gentle; and full of a sweet and
winsome understanding; and surely knew that I wished to be rested; for
she brought out her harp, and played me dear olden melodies of our
childhood-days all that evening; and so had my love for her the more
intent and glad. And she saw me that night to the hedge-gap, having her
three great boar-hounds with her, to company her home again. But,
indeed, I followed her afterwards, very silent, until I saw her safe
into the Hall; for I would not have her alone in the night; though she
believed that I was then far away on the country road. And as she walked
with her dogs, one or another would run back to me, to nose against me
friendly-wise; but I sent them off again very quiet; and she had no
knowledge of aught; for she to go singing a love-song quietly all the
way home. But whether she loved me, I could not tell; though she had a
nice affection for me.

Now, on the following evening, I went somewhat early to the gap; and lo!
who should be standing in the gap, talking to the Lady Mirdath; but a
very clever-drest man, that had a look of the Court about him; and he,
when I approached, made no way for me through the gap; but stood firm,
and eyed me very insolent; so that I put out my hand, and lifted him
from my way.

And lo! the Lady Mirdath turned a bitterness of speech upon me that gave
me an utter pain and astonishment; so that I was assured in a moment
that she had no true love for me, or she had never striven so to put me
to shame before the stranger, and named me uncouth and brutal to a
smaller man. And, indeed, you shall perceive how I was in my heart in
that moment.

And I saw that there was some seeming of justice in what the Lady
Mirdath said; but yet might the man have shown a better spirit; and
moreover Mirdath the Beautiful had no true call to shame me, her true
friend and cousin, before this stranger. Yet did I not stop to argue;
but bowed very low to the Lady Mirdath; and afterward I bowed a little
to the man and made apology; for, indeed, he was neither great nor
strong-made; and I had been better man to have shown courtesy to him; at
least in the first.

And so, having done justice to my own respect, I turned and went on, and
left them to their happiness.

Now, I walked then, maybe twenty good miles, before I came to my own
home; for there was no rest in me all that night, or ever, because that
I was grown deadly in love of Mirdath the Beautiful; and all my spirit
and heart and body of me pained with the dreadful loss that I was come
so sudden upon.

And for a great week I had my walks in another direction; but in the end
of that week, I must take my walk along the olden way, that I might
chance to have but a sight of My Lady. And, truly, I had all sight that
ever man did need to put him in dread pain and jealousy; for, truly, as
I came in view of the gap, there was the Lady Mirdath walking just
without the borders of the great wood; and beside her there walked the
clever-drest man of the Court, and she suffered his arm around her, so
that I knew they were lovers; for the Lady Mirdath had no brothers nor
any youthful men kin.

Yet, when Mirdath saw me upon the road, she shamed in a moment to be so
caught; for she put her lover's arm from about her, and bowed to me, a
little changed of colour in the face; and I bowed very low--being but a
young man myself--; and so passed on, with my heart very dead in me. And
as I went, I saw that her lover came again to her, and had his arm once
more about her; and so, maybe, they looked after me, as I went very
stiff and desperate; but, indeed, I looked not back on them, as you may
think.

And for a great month then, I went not near to the gap; for my love
raged in me, and I was hurt in my pride; and, truly, neither had a true
justice been dealt to me by the Lady Mirdath. Yet in that month, my love
was a leaven in me, and made slowly a sweetness and a tenderness and an
understanding that were not in me before; and truly Love and Pain do
shape the Character of Man.

And in the end of that time, I saw a little way into Life, with an
understanding heart, and began presently to take my walks again past the
gap; but truly Mirdath the Beautiful was never to my sight; though one
evening I thought she might be not a great way off; for one of her great
boar-hounds came out of the wood, and down into the road to nose against
me, very friendly, as a dog oft doth with me.

Yet, though I waited a good time after the dog had left me, I had no
sight of Mirdath, and so passed on again, with my heart heavy in me; but
without bitterness, because of the understanding that was begun to grow
in my heart.

Now, there passed two weary and lonely weeks, in which I grew sick to
have knowledge of the beautiful maid. And, truly, in the end of that
time, I made a sudden resolving that I would go in through the gap, and
come to the home-grounds about the Hall, and so maybe have some sight of
her.

And this resolving I had one evening; and I went out immediately, and
came to the gap, and went in through the gap, and so by a long walking
to the gardens about the Hall. And, truly, when I was come there, I saw
a good light of lanthorns and torches, and a great company of people
dancing; and all drest in quaint dress; so that I knew they had a
festival for some cause. And there came suddenly a horrid dread into my
heart that this might be the marriage-dance of the Lady Mirdath; but,
indeed, this was foolishness; for I had surely heard of the marriage, if
there had been any. And, truly, in a moment, I remembered that she was
come one-and-twenty years of age on that day, and to the end of her
ward-ship; and this surely to be festival in honour of the same.

And a very bright and pretty matter it was to watch, save that I was so
heavy in the heart with loneliness and longing; for the company was
great and gay, and the lights plentiful and set all about from the
trees; and in leaf-made arbours about the great lawn. And a great table
spread with eating matters and silver and crystal, and great lamps of
bronze and silver went all a-down one end of the lawn; and the dance
constant upon the other part.

And surely, the Lady Mirdath to step out of the dance, very lovely
drest; yet seeming, to mine eyes, a little pale in the looming of the
lights. And she to wander to a seat to rest; and, indeed, in a moment,
there to be a dozen youths of the great families of the country-side, in
attendance about her, making talk and laughter, and each eager for her
favour; and she very lovely in the midst of them, but yet, as I did
think, lacking of somewhat, and a little pale-seeming, as I have told;
and her glance to go odd-wise beyond the groupt men about her; so that I
understood in a moment that her lover was not there, and she to be
a-lack in the heart for him. Yet, why he was not there, I could not
suppose, save that he might have been called back to the Court.

And, surely, as I watched the other young men about her, I burned with a
fierce and miserable jealousy of them; so that I could near have stept
forth and plucked her out from among them, and had her to walk with me
in the woods, as in the olden days, when she also had seemed near to
love. But, truly, what use to this? For it was not they who held her
heart, as I saw plain; for I watched her, with an eager and lonesome
heart, and knew that it was one small man of the Court that was lover to
her, as I have told.

And I went away again then, and came not near to the gap for three great
months, because that I could not bear the pain of my loss; but in the
end of that time, my very pain to urge me to go, and to be worse than
the pain of not going; so that I found myself one evening in the gap,
peering, very eager and shaken, across the sward that lay between the
gap and the woods; for this same place to be as an holy ground to me;
for there was it that first I saw Mirdath the Beautiful, and surely lost
my heart to her in that one night.

And a great time I stayed there in the gap, waiting and watching
hopelessly. And lo! sudden there came something against me, touching my
thigh very soft; and when I looked down, it was one of the boar-hounds,
so that my heart leaped, near frightened; for truly My Lady was come
somewhere nigh, as I did think.

And, as I waited, very hushed and watchful; yet with an utter beating
heart; surely I heard a faint and low singing among the trees, so utter
sad. And lo! it was Mirdath singing a broken love song, and a-wander
there in the dark alone, save for her great dogs.

And I harked, with strange pain in me, that she did be so in pain; and I
ached to bring her ease; yet moved not, but was very still there in the
gap; save that my being was all in turmoil.

And presently, as I harked, there came a slim white figure out from
among the trees; and the figure cried out something, and came to a quick
pause, as I could see in the half-dark. And lo! in that moment, there
came a sudden and unreasoned hope into me; and I came up out of the gap,
and was come to Mirdath in a moment, calling very low and passionate and
eager: "Mirdath! Mirdath! Mirdath!"

And this way I came to her; and her great dog that was with me, to bound
beside me, in thought, mayhap, that it was some game. And when I came to
the Lady Mirdath, I held out my hands to her, not knowing what I did;
but only the telling of my heart that needed her so utter, and craved to
ease her of her pain. And lo! she put out her arms to me, and came into
mine arms with a little run. And there she bode, weeping strangely; but
yet with rest upon her; even as rest was come sudden and wondrous upon
me.

And sudden, she moved in mine arms, and slipt her hands to me, very
dear, and held her lips up to me, like some sweet child, that I kiss
her; but, indeed, she was also a true woman, and in honest and dear love
of me.

And this to be the way of our betrothal; and simple and wordless it was;
yet sufficient, only that there is no sufficiency in Love.

Now, presently, she loosed herself out of mine arms, and we walked
homeward through the woods, very quiet, and holding hands, as children
do. And I then in a while to ask her about the man of the Court; and she
laughed very sweet into the silence of the wood; but gave me no answer,
save that I wait until we were come to the Hall.

And when we were come there, she took me into the great hall, and made a
very dainty and impudent bow, mocking me. And so made me known to
another lady, who sat there, upon her task of embroidering, which she
did very demure, and as that she had also a dainty Mischief lurking in
her.

And truly, the Lady Mirdath never to be done of naughty laughter, that
made her dearly breathless with delight, and to sway a little, and set
the trembling of pretty sounds in her throat; and surely she must pull
down two great pistols from an arm-rack, that I fight a duel to the
death with the lady of the embroidering, who held her face down over her
work, and shook likewise with the wickedness of her laughter that she
could not hide.

And in the end, the Lady of the Embroidering looked up sudden into my
face; and I then to see somewhat of the mischief in a moment; for she
had the face of the man of the Court suit, that had been lover to
Mirdath.

And the Lady Mirdath then to explain to me how that Mistress Alison
(which was her name) was a dear and bosom friend, and she it was that
had been drest in the Court suit to play a prank for a wager with a
certain young man who would be lover to her, an he might. And I then to
come along, and so speedy to offence that truly I never saw her face
plain, because that I was so utter jealous. And so the Lady Mirdath had
been more justly in anger than I supposed, because that I had put hands
upon her friend, as I have told.

And this to be all of it, save that they had planned to punish me, and
had met every evening at the gap, to play at lovers, perchance I should
pass, so that I should have greater cause for my jealousy, and truly
they to have a good revenge upon me; for I had suffered very great a
long while because of it.

Yet, as you do mind, when I came upon them, the Lady Mirdath had a
half-regret, that was very natural, because even then she was in love of
me, as I of her; and because of this, she drew away, as you shall
remember, being--as she confessed--suddenly and strangely troubled and
to want me; but afterwards as much set again to my punishment, because
that I bowed so cold and went away. And indeed well I might.

Yet, truly, all was safe ended now, and I utter thankful and with a mad
delight in the heart; so that I caught up Mirdath, and we danced very
slow and stately around the great hall, the while that Mistress Alison
whistled us a tune with her mouth, which she could very clever, as many
another thing, I wot.

And each day and all day after this Gladness, Mirdath and I could never
be apart; but must go a-wander always together, here and there, in an
unending joy of our togetherness.

And in a thousand things were we at one in delight; for we had both of
us that nature which doth love the blue of eternity which gathers beyond
the wings of the sunset; and the invisible sound of the starlight
falling upon the world; and the quiet of grey evenings when the Towers
of Sleep are builded unto the mystery of the Dusk; and the solemn green
of strange pastures in the moonlight; and the speech of the sycamore
unto the beech; and the slow way of the sea when it doth mood; and the
soft rustling of the night clouds. And likewise had we eyes to see the
Dancer of the Sunset, casting her mighty robes so strange; and ears to
know that there shakes a silent thunder over the Face of Dawn; and much
else that we knew and saw and understood together in our utter joy.

Now, there happened to us about this time a certain adventure that came
near to cause the death of Mirdath the Beautiful; for one day as we
wandered, as ever, like two children in our contentment, I made remark
to Mirdath that there went only two of the great boar-hounds with us;
and she then told me that the third was to the kennels, being sick.

Yet, scarce had she told me so much; ere she cried out something and
pointed; and lo! I saw that the third hound came towards us, at a run,
yet very strange-seeming in his going. And in a moment, Mirdath cried
out that the hound was mad; and truly, I saw then that the brute
slavered as he came running.

And in a moment he was upon us, and made never a sound; but leaped at me
in one instant of time; all before I had any thought of such intent. But
surely, My Beautiful One had a dreadful love for me, for she cast
herself at the dog, to save me, calling to the other hounds. And she was
bitten in a moment by the brute, as she strove to hold him off from me.
But I to have him instant by the neck and the body, and brake him, so
that he died at once; and I cast him to the earth, and gave help to
Mirdath, that I draw the poison from the wounds.

And this I did so well as I might, despite that she would have me stop.
And afterwards, I took her into mine arms, and ran very fierce all the
long and weary way to the Hall, and with hot skewers I burned the
wounds; so that when the doctor came, he to say I have saved her by my
care, if indeed she to be saved. But, truly, she had saved me in any
wise, as you shall think; so that I could never be done of honour to
her.

And she very pale; but yet to laugh at my fears, and to say that she
soon to have her health, and the wounds healed very speedy; but, indeed,
it was a long and bitter time before they were proper healed, and she so
well as ever. Yet, in time, so it was; and an utter weight off my heart.

And when Mirdath was grown full strong again, we set our wedding day.
And well do I mind how she stood there in her bridal dress, on that day,
so slender and lovely as may Love have stood in the Dawn of Life; and
the beauty of her eyes that had such sober sweetness in them, despite
the dear mischief of her nature; and the way of her little feet, and the
loveliness of her hair; and the dainty rogue-grace of her movements; and
her mouth an enticement, as that a child and a woman smiled out of the
one face. And this to be no more than but an hint of the loveliness of
My Beautiful One.

And so we were married.

Mirdath, My Beautiful One, lay dying, and I had no power to hold Death
backward from such dread intent. In another room, I heard the little
wail of the child; and the wail of the child waked my wife back into
this life, so that her hands fluttered white and desperately needful
upon the coverlid.

I kneeled beside My Beautiful One, and reached out and took her hands
very gentle into mine; but still they fluttered so needful; and she
looked at me, dumbly; but her eyes beseeching.

Then I went out of the room, and called gently to the Nurse; and the
Nurse brought in the child, wrapped very softly in a long, white robe.
And I saw the eyes of My Beautiful One grow clearer with a strange,
lovely light; and I beckoned to the Nurse to bring the babe near.

My wife moved her hands very weakly upon the coverlid, and I knew that
she craved to touch her child; and I signed to the Nurse, and took my
child in mine arms; and the Nurse went out from the room, and so we
three were alone together.

Then I sat very gentle upon the bed; and I held the babe near to My
Beautiful One, so that the wee cheek of the babe touched the white cheek
of my dying wife; but the weight of the child I kept off from her.

And presently, I knew that Mirdath, My Wife, strove dumbly to reach for
the hands of the babe; and I turned the child more towards her, and
slipped the hands of the child into the weak hands of My Beautiful One.
And I held the babe above my wife, with an utter care; so that the eyes
of my dying One, looked into the young eyes of the child. And presently,
in but a few moments of time; though it had been someways an eternity,
My Beautiful One closed her eyes and lay very quiet. And I took away the
child to the Nurse, who stood beyond the door. And I closed the door,
and came back to Mine Own, that we have those last instants alone
together.

And the hands of my wife lay very still and white; but presently they
began to move softly and weakly, searching for somewhat; and I put out
my great hands to her, and took her hands with an utter care; and so a
little time passed.

Then her eyes opened, quiet and grey, and a little dazed seeming; and
she rolled her head on the pillow and saw me; and the pain of
forgetfulness went out of her eyes, and she looked at me with a look
that grew in strength, unto a sweetness of tenderness and full
understanding.

And I bent a little to her; and her eyes told me to take her into mine
arms for those last minutes. Then I went very gentle upon the bed, and
lifted her with an utter and tender care, so that she lay suddenly
strangely restful against my breast; for Love gave me skill to hold her,
and Love gave My Beautiful One a sweetness of ease in that little time
that was left to us.

And so we twain were together; and Love seemed that it had made a truce
with Death in the air about us, that we be undisturbed; for there came a
drowse of rest even upon my tense heart, that had known nothing but a
dreadful pain through the weary hours.

And I whispered my love silently to My Beautiful One, and her eyes
answered; and the strangely beautiful and terrible moments passed by
into the hush of eternity.

And suddenly, Mirdath My Beautiful One, spoke,--whispering something.
And I stooped gently to hark; and Mine Own spoke again; and lo! it was
to call me by the olden Love Name that had been mine through all the
utter lovely months of our togetherness.

And I began again to tell her of my love, that should pass beyond death;
and lo! in that one moment of time, the light went out of her eyes; and
My Beautiful One lay dead in mine arms ... My Beautiful One....




II

THE LAST REDOUBT


Since Mirdath, My Beautiful One, died and left me lonely in this world,
I have suffered an anguish, and an utter and dreadful pain of longing,
such as truly no words shall ever tell; for, in truth, I that had all
the world through her sweet love and companionship, and knew all the joy
and gladness of Life, have known such lonesome misery as doth stun me to
think upon.

Yet am I to my pen again; for of late a wondrous hope has grown in me,
in that I have, at night in my sleep, waked into the future of this
world, and seen strange things and utter marvels, and known once more
the gladness of life; for I have learned the promise of the future, and
have visited in my dreams those places where in the womb of Time, she
and I shall come together, and part, and again come together--breaking
asunder most drearly in pain, and again reuniting after strange ages, in
a glad and mighty wonder.

And this is the utter strange story of that which I have seen, and
which, truly, I must set out, if the task be not too great; so that, in
the setting out thereof, I may gain a little ease of the heart; and
likewise, mayhap, give ease of hope to some other poor human, that doth
suffer, even as I have suffered so dreadful with longing for Mine Own
that is dead.

And some shall read and say that this thing was not, and some shall
dispute with them; but to them all I say naught, save "Read!" And having
read that which I set down, then shall one and all have looked towards
Eternity with me--unto its very portals. And so to my telling:

To me, in this last time of my visions, of which I would tell, it was
not as if I _dreamed_; but, as it were, that I _waked_ there into the
dark, _in the future of this world_. And the sun had died; and for me
thus newly waked into that Future, to look back upon this, our Present
Age, was to look back into dreams that my soul knew to be of reality;
but which to those newly-seeing eyes of mine, appeared but as a far
vision, strangely hallowed with peacefulness and light.

Always, it seemed to me when I awaked into the Future, into the
Everlasting Night that lapped this world, that I saw near to me, and
girdling me all about, a blurred greyness. And presently this, the
greyness, would clear and fade from about me, even as a dusky cloud, and
I would look out upon a world of darkness, lit here and there with
strange sights. And with my waking into that Future, I waked not to
ignorance; but to a full knowledge of those things which lit the Night
Land; even as a man wakes from sleep each morning, and knows immediately
he wakes, the names and knowledge of the Time which has bred him, and in
which he lives. And the same while, a knowledge I had, as it were
sub-conscious, of this Present--this early life, which now I live so
utterly alone.

In my earliest knowledge of _that_ place, I was a youth, seventeen years
grown, and my memory tells me that when first I waked, or came, as it
might be said, to myself, in that Future, I stood in one of the
embrasures of the Last Redoubt--that great Pyramid of grey metal which
held the last millions of this world from the Powers of the Slayers.

And so full am I of the knowledge of that Place, that scarce can I
believe that none here know; and because I have such difficulty, it may
be that I speak over familiarly of those things of which I know; and
heed not to explain much that it is needful that I should explain to
those who must read here, in this our present day. For there, as I stood
and looked out, I was less the man of years of _this_ age, than the
youth of _that_, with the natural knowledge of _that_ life which I had
gathered by living all my seventeen years of life there; though, until
that my first vision, I (of this Age) knew not of that other and Future
Existence; yet woke to it so naturally as may a man wake here in his bed
to the shining of the morning sun, and know it by name, and the meaning
of aught else. And yet, as I stood there in the vast embrasure, I had
also a knowledge, or memory, of this present life of ours, deep down
within me; but touched with a halo of dreams, and yet with a conscious
longing for One, known even there in a half memory as Mirdath.

As I have said, in my earliest memory, I mind that I stood in an
embrasure, high up in the side of the Pyramid, and looked outwards
through a queer spy-glass to the North-West. Aye, full of youth and with
an adventurous and yet half-fearful heart.

And in my brain was, as I have told, the knowledge that had come to me
in all the years of my life in the Redoubt; and yet until that moment,
this _Man of this Present Time_ had no knowledge of that future
existence; and now I stood and had suddenly the knowledge of a life
already spent in that strange land, and deeper within me the misty
knowings of this our present Age, and, maybe, also of some others.

To the North-West I looked through the queer spy-glass, and saw a
landscape that I had looked upon and pored upon through all the years of
that life, so that I knew how to name this thing and that thing, and
give the very distances of each and every one from the "Centre-Point" of
the Pyramid, which was that which had neither length nor breadth, and
was made of polished metal in the Room of Mathematics, where I went
daily to my studies.

To the North-West I looked, and in the wide field of my glass, saw plain
the bright glare of the fire from the Red Pit, shine upwards against the
underside of the vast chin of the North-West Watcher--The Watching Thing
of the North-West.... "That which hath Watched from the Beginning, and
until the opening of the Gateway of Eternity" came into my thoughts, as
I looked through the glass ... the words of Aesworpth, the _Ancient_
Poet (though incredibly _future_ to this our time). And suddenly they
seemed at fault; for I looked deep down into my being, and saw, as
dreams are seen, the sunlight and splendour of _this_ our Present Age.
And I was amazed.

And here I must make it clear to all that, even as I waked from _this_
Age, suddenly into _that_ life, so must I--_that_ youth there in the
embrasure--have awakened then to the knowledge of _this_ far-back life
of ours--seeming to him a vision of the very beginnings of eternity, in
the dawn of the world. Oh! I do but dread I make it not sufficient clear
that I and he were both _I_--the same soul. He of that far date seeing
vaguely the life that _was_ (that I do now live in this present Age);
and I of this time beholding the life that I yet shall live. How utterly
strange!

And yet, I do not know that I speak holy truth to say that I, in that
future time, had _no_ knowledge of _this_ life and Age, before that
awakening; for I woke to find that I was one who stood apart from the
other youths, in that I had a dim knowledge--visionary, as it were, of
the past, which confounded, whilst yet it angered, those who were the
men of learning of that age; though of this matter, more anon. But this
I do know, that from that time, onwards, my knowledge and assuredness of
the Past was tenfold; for this my memory of that life told me.

And so to further my telling. Yet before I pass onwards, one other thing
is there of which I shall speak--In the moment in which I waked out of
that youthfulness, into the assured awaredness of _this_ our Age, in
that moment the hunger of this my love flew to me across the ages; so
that what had been but a memory-dream, grew to the pain of _Reality_,
and I knew suddenly that I _lacked_; and from that time onwards, I went,
listening, as even now my life is spent.

And so it was that I (fresh-born in that future time) hungered strangely
for My Beautiful One with all the strength of that new life, knowing
that she had been mine, and might live again, even as I. And so, as I
have said, I hungered, and found that I listened.

And now, to go back from my digression, it was, as I have said, I had
amazement at perceiving, in memory, the unknowable sunshine and
splendour of this age breaking so clear through my hitherto most vague
and hazy visions; so that the ignorance of, Aesworpth was shouted to me
by the things which now I _knew_.

And from that time, onward, for a little space, I was stunned with all
that I knew and guessed and felt; and all of a long while the hunger
grew for that one I had lost in the early days--she who had sung to me
in those faery days of light, that _had been_ in verity. And the
especial thoughts of that age looked back with a keen, regretful wonder
into the gulf of forgetfulness.

But, presently, I turned from the haze and pain of my dream-memories,
once more to the inconceivable mystery of the Night Land, which I viewed
through the great embrasure. For on none did it ever come with weariness
to look out upon all the hideous mysteries; so that old and young
watched, from early years to death, the black monstrosity of the Night
Land, which this our last refuge of humanity held at bay.

To the right of the Red Pit there lay a long, sinuous glare, which I
knew as the Vale of Red Fire, and beyond that for many dreary miles the
blackness of the Night Land; across which came the coldness of the light
from the Plain of Blue Fire.

And then, on the very borders of the Unknown Lands, there lay a range of
low volcanoes, which lit up, far away in the outer darkness, the Black
Hills, where shone the Seven Lights, which neither twinkled nor moved
nor faltered through Eternity; and of which even the great spy-glass
could make no understanding; nor had any adventurer from the Pyramid
ever come back to tell us aught of them. And here let me say, that down
in the Great Library of the Redoubt, were the histories of all those,
with their discoveries, who had ventured out into the monstrousness of
the Night Land, risking not the life only, but the spirit of life.

And surely it is all so strange and wonderful to set out, that I could
almost despair with the contemplation of that which I must achieve; for
there is so much to tell, and so few words given to man by which he may
make clear that which lies beyond the sight and the present and general
knowings of Peoples.

How shall you ever know, as I know in verity, of the greatness and
reality and terror of the thing that I would tell plain to all; for we,
with our puny span of recorded life must have great histories to tell,
but the few bare details we know concerning years that are but a few
thousands in all; and I must set out to you in the short pages of this
my life there, a sufficiency of the life that had been, and the life
that was, both within and without that mighty Pyramid, to make clear to
those who may read, the truth of that which I would tell; and the
histories of that great Redoubt dealt not with odd thousands of years;
but with very millions; aye, away back into what they of that Age
conceived to be the early days of the earth, when the sun, maybe, still
gloomed dully in the night sky of the world. But of all that went
before, nothing, save as myths, and matters to be taken most cautiously,
and believed not by men of sanity and proved wisdom.

And I, ...how shall I make all this clear to you who may read? The thing
cannot be; and yet I must tell my history; for to be silent before so
much wonder would be to suffer of too full a heart; and I must even ease
my spirit by this my struggle to tell to all how it was with me, and how
it will be. Aye, even to the memories which were the possession of that
far future youth, who was indeed I, of his childhood's days, when his
nurse of that Age swung him, and crooned impossible lullabies of this
mythical sun which, according to those future fairy-tales, had once
passed across the blackness that now lay above the Pyramid.

Such is the monstrous futureness of this which I have seen through the
body of that far-off youth.

And so back to my telling. To my right, which was to the North, there
stood, very far away, the House of Silence, upon a low hill. And in that
House were many lights, and no sound. And so had it been through an
uncountable Eternity of Years. Always those steady lights, and no
whisper of sound--not even such as our distance-microphones could have
discovered. And the danger of this House was accounted the greatest
danger of all those Lands.

And round by the House of Silence, wound the Road Where The Silent Ones
Walk. And concerning this Road, which passed out of the Unknown Lands,
nigh by the Place of the Ab-humans, where was always the green, luminous
mist, nothing was known; save that it was held that, of all the works
about the Mighty Pyramid, it was, alone, the one that was bred, long
ages past, of healthy human toil and labour. And on this point alone,
had a thousand books, and more, been writ; and all contrary, and so to
no end, as is ever the way in such matters.

And as it was with the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, so it was with
all those other monstrous things ... whole libraries had there been made
upon this and upon that; and many a thousand million mouldered into the
forgotten dust of the earlier world.

I mind me now that presently I stepped upon the central
travelling-roadway which spanned the one thousandth plateau of the Great
Redoubt. And this lay six miles and thirty fathoms above the Plain of
the Night Land, and was somewhat of a great mile or more across. And so,
in a few minutes, I was at the South-Eastern wall, and looking out
through The Great Embrasure towards the Three Silver-fire Holes, that
shone before the Thing That Nods, away down, far in the South-East.
Southward of this, but nearer, there rose the vast bulk of the
South-East Watcher--The Watching Thing of the South-East. And to the
right and to the left of the squat monster burned the Torches; maybe
half-a-mile upon each side; yet sufficient light they threw to show the
lumbered-forward head of the never-sleeping Brute.

To the East, as I stood there in the quietness of the Sleeping-Time on
the One Thousandth Plateau, I heard a far, dreadful sound, down in the
lightless East; and, presently, again--a strange, dreadful laughter,
deep as a low thunder among the mountains. And because this sound came
odd whiles from the Unknown Lands beyond the Valley of The Hounds, we
had named that far and never-seen Place "The Country Whence Comes The
Great Laughter." And though I had heard the sound, many and oft a time,
yet did I never hear it without a most strange thrilling of my heart,
and a sense of my littleness, and of the utter terror which had beset
the last millions of the world.

Yet, because I had heard the Laughter oft, I paid not over-long
attention to my thoughts upon it; and when, in a little it died away
into that Eastern Darkness, I turned my spy-glass upon the Giants' Pit,
which lay to the South of the Giants' Kilns. And these same Kilns were
tended by the giants, and the light of the Kilns was red and fitful, and
threw wavering shadows and lights across the mouth of the pit; so that I
saw giants crawling up out of the pit; but not properly seen, by reason
of the dance of the shadows. And so, because ever there was so much to
behold, I looked away, presently, to that which was plainer to be
examined.

To the back of the Giants' Pit was a great, black Headland, that stood
vast, between the Valley of The Hounds (where lived the monstrous Night
Hounds) and the Giants. And the light of the Kilns struck the brow of
this black Headland; so that, constantly, I saw things peer over the
edge, coming forward a little into the light of the Kilns, and drawing
back swiftly into the shadows. And thus it had been ever, through the
uncounted ages; so that the Headland was known as The Headland From
Which Strange Things Peer; and thus was it marked in our maps and charts
of that grim world.

And so I could go on ever; but that I fear to weary; and yet, whether I
do weary, or not, I must tell of this country that I see, even now as I
set my thoughts down, so plainly that my memory wanders in a hushed and
secret fashion along its starkness, and amid its strange and dread
habitants, so that it is but by an effort I realise me that my body is
not there in this very moment that I write. And so to further tellings:

Before me ran the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk; and I searched it, as
many a time in my earlier youth had I, with the spy-glass; for my heart
was always stirred mightily by the sight of those Silent Ones.

And, presently, alone in all the miles of that night-grey road, I saw
one in the field of my glass--a quiet, cloaked figure, moving along,
shrouded, and looking neither to right nor left. And thus was it with
these beings ever. It was told about in the Redoubt that they would harm
no human, if but the human did keep a fair distance from them; but that
it were wise never to come close upon one. And this I can well believe.

And so, searching the road with my gaze, I passed beyond this Silent
One, and past the place where the road, sweeping vastly to the
South-East, was lit a space, strangely, by the light from the
Silver-fire Holes. And thus at last to where it swayed to the South of
the Dark Palace, and thence Southward still, until it passed round to
the Westward, beyond the mountain bulk of the Watching Thing in the
South--the hugest monster in all the visible Night Lands. My spy-glass
showed it to me with clearness--a living hill of watchfulness, known to
us as The Watcher Of The South. It brooded there, squat and tremendous,
hunched over the pale radiance of the Glowing Dome.

Much, I know, had been writ concerning this Odd, Vast Watcher; for it
had grown out of the blackness of the South Unknown Lands a million
years gone; and the steady growing nearness of it had been noted and set
out at length by the men they called Monstruwacans; so that it was
possible to search in our libraries, and learn of the very coming of
this Beast in the olden-time.

And, while I mind me, there were even then, and always, men named
Monstruwacans, whose duty it was to take heed of the great Forces, and
to watch the Monsters and the Beasts that beset the great Pyramid, and
measure and record, and have so full a knowledge of these same that, did
one but sway an head in the darkness, the same matter was set down with
particularness in the Records.

And, so to tell more about the South Watcher. A million years gone, as I
have told, came it out from the blackness of the South, and grew
steadily nearer through twenty thousand years; but so slow that in no
one year could a man perceive that it had moved.

Yet it had movement, and had come thus far upon its road to the Redoubt,
when the Glowing Dome rose out of the ground before it--growing slowly.
And this had stayed the way of the Monster; so that through an eternity
it had looked towards the Pyramid across the pale glare of the Dome, and
seeming to have no power to advance nearer.

And because of this, much had been writ to prove that there were other
forces than evil at work in the Night Lands, about the Last Redoubt. And
this I have always thought to be wisely said; and, indeed, there to be
no doubt to the matter, for there were many things in the time of which
I have knowledge, which seemed to make clear that, even as the Forces of
Darkness were loose upon the End of Man; so were there other Forces out
to do battle with the Terror; though in ways most strange and unthought
of by the human mind. And of this I shall have more to tell anon.

And here, before I go further with my telling, let me set out some of
that knowledge which yet remains so clear within my mind and heart. Of
the coming of these monstrosities and evil Forces, no man could say much
with verity; for the evil of it began before the Histories of the Great
Redoubt were shaped; aye, even before the sun had lost all power to
light; though, it must not be a thing of certainty, that even at this
far time the invisible, black heavens held no warmth for this world; but
of this I have no room to tell; and must pass on to that of which I have
a more certain knowledge.

The evil must surely have begun in the Days of the Darkening (which I
might liken to a story which was believed doubtfully, much as we of this
day believe the story of the Creation). A dim record there was of olden
sciences (that are yet far off in our future) which, disturbing the
unmeasurable Outward Powers, had allowed to pass the Barrier of Life
some of those Monsters and Ab-human creatures, which are so wondrously
cushioned from us at this normal present. And thus there had
materialized, and in other cases developed, grotesque and horrible
Creatures, which now beset the humans of this world. And where there was
no power to take on material form, there had been allowed to certain
dreadful Forces to have power to affect the life of the human spirit.
And this growing very dreadful, and the world full of lawlessness and
degeneracy, there had banded together the sound millions, and built the
Last Redoubt; there in the twilight of the world--so it seems to us, and
yet to them (bred at last to the peace of usage) as it were the
Beginning; and this I can make no clearer; and none hath right to expect
it; for my task is very great, and beyond the power of human skill.

And when the humans had built the great Pyramid, it had one thousand
three hundred and twenty floors; and the thickness of each floor was
according to the strength of its need. And the whole height of this
pyramid exceeded seven miles, by near a mile, and above it was a tower
from which the Watchmen looked (these being called the Monstruwacans).
But where the Redoubt was built, I know not; save that I believe in a
mighty valley, of which I may tell more in due time.

And when the Pyramid was built, the last millions, who were the Builders
thereof, went within, and made themselves a great house and city of this
Last Redoubt. And thus began the Second History of this world. And how
shall I set it all down in these little pages! For my task, even as I
see it, is too great for the power of a single life and a single pen.
Yet, to it!

And, later, through hundreds and thousands of years, there grew up in
the Outer Lands, beyond those which lay under the guard of the Redoubt,
mighty and lost races of terrible creatures, half men and half beast,
and evil and dreadful; and these made war upon the Redoubt; but were
beaten off from that grim, metal mountain, with a vast slaughter. Yet,
must there have been many such attacks, until the electric circle was
put about the Pyramid, and lit from the Earth-Current. And the lowest
half-mile of the Pyramid was sealed; and so at last there was a peace,
and the beginnings of that Eternity of quiet watching for the day when
the Earth-Current shall become exhausted.

And, at whiles, through the forgotten centuries, had the Creatures been
glutted time and again upon such odd bands of daring ones as had
adventured forth to explore through the mystery of the Night Lands; for
of those who went, scarce any did ever return; for there were eyes in
all that dark; and Powers and Forces abroad which had all knowledge; or
so we must fain believe.

And then, so it would seem, as that Eternal Night lengthened itself upon
the world, the power of terror grew and strengthened. And fresh and
greater monsters developed and bred out of all space and Outward
Dimensions, attracted, even as it might be Infernal sharks, by that
lonely and mighty hill of humanity, facing its end--so near to the
Eternal, and yet so far deferred in the minds and to the senses of those
humans. And thus hath it been ever.

And all this but by the way, and vague and ill told, and set out in
despair to make a little clear the beginnings of that State which is so
strange to our conceptions, and yet which had become a Condition of
Naturalness to Humanity in that stupendous future.

Thus had the giants come, fathered of bestial humans and mothered of
monsters. And many and diverse were the creatures which had some human
semblance; and intelligence, mechanical and cunning; so that certain of
these lesser Brutes had machinery and underground ways, having need to
secure to themselves warmth and air, even as healthy humans; only that
they were incredibly inured to hardship, as they might be wolves set in
comparison with tender children. And surely, do I make this thing clear?

And now to continue my telling concerning the Night Land. The Watcher of
the South was, as I have set to make known, a monster differing from
those other Watching Things, of which I have spoken, and of which there
were in all four. One to the North-West, and one to the South-East, and
of these I have told; and the other twain lay brooding, one to the
South-West, and the other to the North-East; and thus the four watchers
kept ward through the darkness, upon the Pyramid, and moved not, neither
gave they out any sound. Yet did we know them to be mountains of living
watchfulness and hideous and steadfast intelligence.

And so, in a while, having listened to the sorrowful sound which came
ever to us over the Grey Dunes, from the Country of Wailing, which lay
to the South, midway between the Redoubt and the Watcher of the South, I
passed upon one of the moving roadways over to the South-Western side of
the Pyramid, and looked from a narrow embrasure thence far down into the
Deep Valley, which was four miles deep, and in which was the Pit of the
Red Smoke.

And the mouth of this Pit was one full mile across, and the smoke of the
Pit filled the Valley at times, so that it seemed but as a glowing red
circle amid dull thunderous clouds of redness. Yet the red smoke rose
never much above the Valley; so that there was clear sight across to the
country beyond. And there, along the further edge of that great depth,
were the Towers, each, maybe, a mile high, grey and quiet; but with a
shimmer upon them.

Beyond these, South and West of them, was the enormous bulk of the
South-West Watcher, and from the ground rose what we named the Eye
Beam--a single ray of grey light, which came up out of the ground, and
lit the right eye of the monster. And because of this light, that eye
had been mightily examined through unknown thousands of years; and some
held that the eye looked through the light steadfastly at the Pyramid;
but others set out that the light blinded it, and was the work of those
Other Powers which were abroad to do combat with the Evil Forces. But
however this may be, as I stood there in the embrasure, and looked at
the thing through the spy-glass, it seemed to my soul that the Brute
looked straightly at me, unwinking and steadfast, and fully of a
knowledge that I spied upon it. And this is how I felt.

To the North of this, in the direction of the West, I saw The Place
Where The Silent Ones Kill; and this was so named, because there, maybe
ten thousand years gone, certain humans adventuring from the Pyramid,
came off the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, and into that place, and
were immediately destroyed. And this was told by one who escaped; though
he died also very quickly, for his heart was frozen. And this I cannot
explain; but so it was set out in the Records.

Far away beyond The Place Where The Silent Ones Kill, in the very mouth
of the Western Night was the Place of the Ab-humans, where was lost the
Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, in a dull green, luminous mist. And of
this place nothing was known; though much it held the thoughts and
attentions of our thinkers and imaginers; for some said that there was a
Place Of Safety, differing from the Redoubt (as we of this day suppose
Heaven to differ from the Earth), and that the Road led thence; but was
barred by the Ab-humans. And this I can only set down here; but with no
thought to justify or uphold it.

Later, I travelled over to the North-Eastern wall of the Redoubt, and
looked thence with my spy-glass at the Watcher of the North-East--the
Crowned Watcher it was called, in that within the air above its vast
head there hung always a blue, luminous ring, which shed a strange light
downwards over the monster--showing a vast, wrinkled brow (upon which an
whole library had been writ); but putting to the shadow all the lower
face; all save the ear, which came out from the back of the head, and
belled towards the Redoubt, and had been said by some observers in the
past to have been seen to quiver; but how that might be, I knew not; for
no man of our days had seen such a thing.

And beyond the Watching Thing was The Place Where The Silent Ones Are
Never, close by the great road; which was bounded upon the far side by
The Giant's Sea; and upon the far side of that, was a Road which was
always named The Road By The Quiet City; for it passed along that place
where burned forever the constant and never-moving lights of a strange
city; but no glass had ever shown life there; neither had any light ever
ceased to burn.

And beyond that again was the Black Mist. And here, let me say, that the
Valley of The Hounds ended towards the Lights of the Quiet City.

And so have I set out something of that land, and of those creatures and
circumstances which beset us about, waiting until the Day of Doom, when
our Earth-Current should cease, and leave us helpless to the Watchers
and the Abundant Terror.

And there I stood, and looked forth composedly, as may one who has been
born to know of such matters, and reared in the knowledge of them. And,
anon, I would look upward, and see the grey, metalled mountain going up
measureless into the gloom of the everlasting night; and from my feet
the sheer downward sweep of the grim, metal walls, six full miles, and
more, to the plain below.

And one thing (aye! and I fear me, many) have I missed to set out with
particularness:

There was, as you do know, all around the base of the Pyramid, which was
five and one-quarter miles every way, a great circle of light, which was
set up by the Earth-Current, and burned within a transparent tube; or
had that appearance. And it bounded the Pyramid for a clear mile upon
every side, and burned for ever; and none of the monsters had power ever
to pass across, because of what we did call The Air Clog that it did
make, as an invisible Wall of Safety. And it did give out also a more
subtile vibration, that did affect the weak Brain-Elements of the
monsters and the Lower Men-Brutes. And some did hold that there went
from it a further vibration of a greater subtileness that gave a
protecting against the Evil Forces. And some quality it had truly
thiswise; for the Evil Powers had no ability to cause harm to any
within. Yet were there some dangers against which it might not avail;
but these had no cunning to bring harm to any _within_ the Great Redoubt
who had wisdom to meddle with no dreadfulness. And so were those last
millions guarded until the Earth-Current should be used to its end. And
this circle is that which I have called the Electric Circle; though with
failure to explain. But there it was called only, The Circle.

And thus have I, with great effort, made a little clear that grim land
of night, where, presently, my listening heard one calling across the
dark. And how that this grew upon me, I will set out forthwith.




III

THE QUIET CALLING


Now, oft had I heard tell, not only in that great city which occupied
the thousandth floor, but in others of the one thousand, three hundred
and twenty cities of the Pyramid, that there was somewhere out in the
desolation of the Night Lands a second Place of Refuge, where had
gathered, in another part of this dead world, some last millions of the
human race, to fight unto the end.

And this story I heard everywhere in my travels through the cities of
the Great Redoubt, which travels began when I came upon my seventeenth
year, and continued for three years and two hundred and twenty five
days, being even then but one day in each city, as was the custom in the
training of every child.

And truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to
know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not
space enough; and each must to his duty to the security and well-being
of the Redoubt. Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much,
always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.

And, as I have said, everywhere I went there was the same story of this
other Place of Refuge; and in such of the Libraries of those cities as I
had time to search, there were great numbers of works upon the existence
of this other Refuge; and some, far back in the years, made assertion
with confidence that such a Place was in verity; and, indeed, no doubt
did there seem in those by-gone ages; but now these very Records were
read only by Scholars, who doubted, even whilst they read. And so is it
ever.

But of the reality of this Refuge, I had never a sound doubt, from the
day of my hearing concerning it from our Master Monstruwacan, who with
all his assistants occupied the Tower of Observation in the apex of the
Pyramid. And here let me tell that he and I had always an affinity and
close friendship one for the other; though he was full grown, and I but
a youth; yet so it was; and thus, when I had come to an age of
twenty-one years of life, he opened to me a post within the Tower of
Observation; and this was a most wondrous good fortune to me; for in all
the vast Redoubt, to be appointed to the Tower of Observation was the
most desired; for thereby, even as in these days doth Astronomy, was the
natural curiosity of Man eased somewhat, even while thwarted.

Now, let me tell here also, lest it be thought that I was unduly
favoured because of my friendship with the Master Monstruwacan, that
there was a sound justification for his choice, in that to me had been
given that strange gift of hearing, which we called Night-Hearing;
though this was but a fanciful name, and meant little. Yet the peculiar
gift was rare, and in all the millions of the Pyramid, there was none
with the gift to a great degree, saving only myself.

And I, because of this gift, could hear the "invisible vibrations" of
the aether; so that, without harking to the calling of our recording
instruments, I could take the messages which came continually through
the eternal darkness; aye, even better than they. And now, it may be the
better understood, how much was to be counted that I had grown to listen
for a voice that had not rung in mine ears for an eternity, and yet
which sang sweet and clear in my memory-dreams; so that it seemed to me
that Mirdath the Beautiful slept within my soul, and whispered to me out
of all the ages.

And then, one day, at the fifteenth hour, when began the Sleep-Time, I
had been pondering this love of mine that lived with me still; and
marvelling that my memory-dreams held the voice of a love that _had
been_ in so remote an age. And pondering and dreaming thus, as a young
man may, I could fancy this aeon-lost One were whispering beauty into
my ears, in verity; so clear had my memory grown, and so much had I
pondered.

And lo! as I stood there, harking and communing with my thoughts, I
thrilled suddenly, as if I had been smitten; for out of all the
everlasting night a whisper was thrilling and thrilling upon my more
subtile hearing.

Through four long years had I listened, since that awakening in the
embrasure, when but a youth of seventeen; and now out of the
world-darkness and all the eternal years of that lost life, which now I
live in this Present Age of ours, was the whisper come; for I knew it
upon that instant; and yet, because I was so taught to wisdom, I
answered by no name; but sent the Master-Word through the night--sending
it with my brain-elements, as I could, and as all may, much or little,
as may be, if they be not clods. And, moreover, I knew that she who
called quietly would have the power to hear without instruments, if
indeed it were she; and if it were but one of the false callings of the
Evil Forces, or more cunning monsters, or as was sometimes thought
concerning these callings, the House of Silence, meddling with our
souls, then would they have no power to say the Master-Word; for this
had been proven through all the Everlasting.

And lo! as I stood, trembling and striving not to be tense, which
destroys the receptivity, there came thrilling round and round my
spiritual essence the throb of the Master-Word, beating steadily in the
night, as doth that marvellous sound. And then, with all that was sweet
in my spirit, I called with my brain elements: "Mirdath! Mirdath!
Mirdath!" And at that instant the Master Monstruwacan entered that part
of the Tower of Observation, where I stood; and, seeing my face, stood
very quiet; for though he had not the power of Night-Hearing, he was
wise and thoughtful, and took much account of my gift; more-over, he had
but come from the Receiving Instrument, and thought vaguely to have
caught the throb of the Master-Word, though too faint to come proper
through the Instrument, so that he searched for me, in that I, who had
the Hearing, might listen for it, I being, as I have said, gifted in
that wise.

And to him I told something of my story and my thoughts and my memories,
and of that awakening; and thus up to this present happening, and he
hearkened with sympathy and a troubled and wondering heart; for in that
age a man might talk sanely upon that which, in this age of ours would
be accounted foolishness and maybe the breathings of insanity; for
there, by the refinement of arts of mentality and the results of strange
experiments and the accomplishment of learning, men were abled to
conceive of matters now closed to our conceptions, even as we of this
day may haply give a calm ear to talk, that in the days of our fathers
would have been surely set to the count of lunacy. And this is very
clear.

And all the while that I told my story, I listened with my spirit; but
save for a sense of faint, happy laughter that wrapped about me, I heard
naught. And nothing more all that day.

Here let me put down that, because of my memories and half memories, I
would time and again dispute with our learned men; they being in doubt
as to the verity of that olden story of the Days of Light, and the
existence of the Sun; though something of all this was set out, as of
_truth_, in our oldest records; but I, remembering, told them many tales
that seemed fairy-like to them, and entranced their hearts, even whilst
I angered their brains, which refused to take seriously and as verity
that which their hearts accepted gladly, even as we receive the wonder
of poetry into our souls. But the Master Monstruwacan would listen to
aught I had to tell; aye! though I spoke through hours; and so it would
be, odd times, that having talked long, drawing my stories from my
Memory-Dreams, I would come back again into the present of that Future;
and lo! all the Monstruwacans would have left their instruments and
observations and recording, and be gathered about me; and the Master so
sunken in interest that he not to have discovered them; neither had I
noticed, being so full of the things which had been.

But when the Master came back to knowledge of that present, he would
rouse and chide, and they, all those lesser ones, would fly swiftly and
guiltily to their various works; and yet, so I have thought since, each
with a muddled and bewildered and thoughtful air upon him; and hungry
they were for more, and ever wondering and setting questions about.

And so it was also with those others--those learned ones who were not of
the Tower of Observation, and who disbelieved even whilst they hungered.
Listen would they, though I talked from the first hour, which was the
"dawn," to the fifteenth hour, which was the beginning of the "night";
for the Sleep-Time was set thus, after other usage and experiment. And,
odd whiles, I found that there were among them, men of extraordinary
learning who upheld my tellings as tales of verity; and so there was a
faction; but, later, there grew more to believe; and whether they
believed, or not, all were ready to listen; so that I might have spended
my days in talk; only that I had my work to do.

But the Master Monstruwacan believed from the beginning, and was wise
always to understand; so that I loved him for this, as for many another
dear quality.

And so, as may be conceived, among all those millions I was singled out
to be known; for the stories that I told went downward through a
thousand cities; and, presently, in the lowest tier of the Underground
Fields, an hundred miles deep in the earth below the Redoubt, I found
that the very ploughboys knew something concerning my tellings; and
gathered about me one time and another when the Master Monstruwacan and
I had gone down, regarding some matter that dealt with the Earth-Current
and our Instruments.

And of the Underground Fields (though in that age we called them no more
than "The Fields") I should set down a little; for they were the
mightiest work of this world; so that even the Last Redoubt was but a
small thing beside them. An hundred miles deep lay the lowest of the
Underground Fields, and was an hundred miles from side to side, every
way; and above it there were three hundred and six fields, each one less
in area than that beneath; and in this wise they tapered, until the
topmost field which lay direct beneath the lowermost floor of the Great
Redoubt, was but four miles every way.

And thus it will be seen that these fields, lying one beneath the other,
formed a mighty and incredible Pyramid of Country Lands in the deep
earth, an hundred miles from the base unto the topmost field.

And the whole was sheathed-in at the sides with the grey metal of which
the Redoubt was builded; and each field was pillared, and floored
beneath the soil, with this same compound of wonder; and so was it
secure, and the monsters could not dig into that mighty garden from
without.

And all of that Underground Land was lit, where needed, by the
Earth-Current, and that same life-stream fructified the soil, and gave
life and blood to the plants and to the trees, and to every bush and
natural thing.

And the making of those Fields had taken maybe a million years, and the
"dump" thereof had been cast into the "Crack," whence came the
Earth-Current, and which had bottom beyond all soundings. And this
Underground Country had its own winds and air-currents; so that, to my
memory, it was in no ways connected to the monstrous air-shafts of the
Pyramid; but in this I may be mistaken; for it has not been given to me
to know all that is to be known concerning that vast Redoubt; nor by any
one man could so much knowledge be achieved.

Yet that there were wise and justly promoted winds in that Underground
Country, I do know; for healthful and sweet they were, and in the
corn-fields there was the sweet rustle of grain, and the glad, silken
laughter of poppies, all beneath a warm and happy light. And here, did
the millions walk and take excursion, and go orderly or not, even as in
these days.

And all this have I seen, and the talk of a thousand lovers in the
gardens of that place, comes back to me; and with it all the memory of
my dear one; and of a faint calling that would seem to whisper about me
at times; but so faint and attenuated, that even I, who had the
Night-Hearing, could not catch its import; and so went, listening ever
the more intently. And oft times calling.

Now there was a Law in the Pyramid, tried and healthful, which held that
no male should have freedom to adventure into the Night Land, before the
age of twenty-two; _and no female ever_. Yet that, after such age, if a
youth desired greatly to make the adventure, he should receive three
lectures upon the dangers of which we had knowledge, and a strict
account of the mutilatings and horrid deeds done to those who had so
adventured. And if, after this had passed over him, he still desired,
and if he were accounted healthful and sane; then should he be allowed
to make the adventure; and it was accounted honour to the youth who
should add to the knowledge of the Pyramid.

But to all such as went forth into the danger of the Night Land, there
was set beneath the skin of the inner side of the left forearm, a small
capsule, and when the wound had healed, then might the youth make the
adventure.

And the wherefore of this, was that the spirit of the youth might be
saved, if he were entrapped; for then, upon the honour of his soul, must
he bite forth the capsule, and immediately his spirit would have safety
in death. And by this shall you know somewhat the grim and horrid danger
of the Dark Land.

And this I have set down because later I was to make huge adventure into
those Lands; and even at this time, some thought of the same had come to
me; for always I went listening for that quiet calling; and twice I sent
the Master-Word throbbing solemnly through the everlasting night; yet
this I did no more, without certainty; for the Word must not be used
lightly. But often would I say with my brain-elements "Mirdath!
Mirdath!"--sending the name out into the darkness; and sometimes would I
seem to hear the faint thrilling of the aether around me; as though one
answered; but weakly, as it were with a weakened spirit, or by
instrument that lacked of its earth-force.

And thus, for a great while there was no certainty; but only a strange
anxiousness and no clear answer.

Then, one day as I stood by the instruments in the Tower of Observation,
at the thirteenth hour there came the thrilling of beaten aether all
about me, as it were that all the void was disturbed. And I made the
Sign for Silence; so that the men moved not in all the Tower; but bowed
over their breathing-bells, that all disturbance might cease.

And again came the gentle thrilling, and broke out into a clear, low
calling in my brain; and the calling was my name--the old-earth name of
this day, and not the name of that age. And the name smote me, with a
frightenedness of fresh awakening memories. And, immediately, I sent the
Master-Word into the night; and all the aether was full of movement. And
a silence came; and later a beat afar off in the void of night, which
only I in all that great Redoubt could hear, until the heavier
vibrations were come. And in a moment there was all about me the
throbbing of the Master-Word, beating in the night a sure answer. Yet,
before this I knew that Mirdath had called; but now had surety.

And immediately, I said "Mirdath," making use of the instruments; and
there came a swift and beautiful answer; for out of the dark there stole
an old love-name, that she only had ever used to me.

And, presently, I minded me of the men, and signed to them that they
should continue; for the Records must not be broken; and now I had the
communication full established.

And by me stood the Master Monstruwacan, quietly as any young
Monstruwacan, waiting with slips to make any notes that were needful;
and keeping a strict eye upon those others; but not unkindly. And so,
for a space of wonder, I had speech with that girl out in the darkness
of the world, who had knowledge of my name, and of the old-earth
love-name, and named herself Mirdath.

And much I questioned her, and presently to my sorrow; for it seemed
that her name was not truly Mirdath; but Naani; neither had she known my
name; but that in the library of that place where she abode, there had
been a story of one named by my name, and called by that sweet love-name
which she had sent out somewhat ruthless into the night; and the girl's
name had been Mirdath; and when first she, Naani had called, there had
come back to her a cry of Mirdath, Mirdath; and this had minded her so
strangely of that olden story which had stayed in her memory; that she
had answered as the maid in that book might have answered.

And thus did it seem that the utter Romance of my Memory-love had
vanished, and I stood strangely troubled for sorrow of a love of olden
times. Yet, even then I marvelled that any book should have story so
much like to mine; not heeding that the history of all love is writ with
one pen.

Yet, even then in that hour of my strange, and quaintly foolish pain,
there came a thing that set me thrilling; though more afterwards, when I
came to think afresh upon it. For the girl who spoke to me through the
night made some wonder that my voice were not deeper; yet in quiet
fashion, and as one who says a thing, scarce wotting what they say. But
even to me then, there came a sudden hope; for in the olden days of this
Present Age my voice had been very deep. And I said to her that maybe
the man in the book was said to have had a deep tone of speech; but she,
seeming puzzled, said nay; and at that I questioned her the more; but
only to the trouble of her memory and understanding.

And strange must it seem that we two should talk on so trivial a matter,
when there was so much else that we had need to exchange thought upon;
for were a man in this present day to have speech with those who may
live within that red planet of Mars within the sky, scarce could the
wonder of it exceed the wonder of a human voice coming through that
night unto the Great Redoubt, out of all that lost darkness. For,
indeed, this must have been the breaking of, maybe, a million years of
silence. And already, as I came to know later, was the news passing
downward from City to City through all the vast Pyramid; so that the
Hour-Slips were full of the news; and every City eager and excited, and
waiting. And I better known in that one moment, than in all my life
before. For that previous calling, had been but vaguely put about; and
then set to the count of a nature, blown upon over-easily by
spirit-winds of the half-memory of dreams. Though it is indeed true, as
I have set down before this, that my tales concerning the early days of
the world, when the sun was visible, and full of light, had gone down
through all the cities, and had much comment and setting forth in the
Hour-Slips, and were a cause for speech and argument.

Now concerning the voice of this girl coming to us through the darkness
of the world, I will set out that which she had to tell; and this,
indeed, but verified the tellings of our most ancient Records, which had
so long been treated over lightly: There was, it would seem, somewhere
out in the lonesome dark of the Outer Lands, but at what distance none
could ever discover, a second Redoubt; that was a three-sided Pyramid,
and moderate small; being no more than a mile in height, and scarce
three quarters of a mile along the bases.

When this Redoubt was first builded, it had been upon the far shore of a
sea, where now was no sea; and it had been raised by those wandering
humans who had grown weary of wandering, and weary of the danger of
night attacks by the tribes of half-human monsters which began to
inhabit the earth even so early as the days when the half-gloom was upon
the world. And he that had made the plan upon which it was builded, was
one who had seen the Great Redoubt, having lived there in the beginning,
but escaped because of a correction set upon him for his spirit of
irresponsibility, which had made him to cause disturbance among the
orderly ones in the lowest city of the Great Redoubt.

Yet, in time, he too had come to be tamed by the weight of fear of the
ever-growing hordes of monsters, and the Forces that were abroad. And so
he, being a master-spirit, planned and builded the smaller Redoubt,
being aided thereto by four millions, who also were weary of the harass
of the monsters; but until then had been wanderers, because of the
restlessness of their blood.

And they had chosen that place, because there they had discovered a sign
of the Earth-Current in a great valley which led to the shore; for
without the Earth-Current no Refuge could have existence. And whilst
many builded and guarded, and cared for the Great Camp in which all
lived, others worked within a great shaft; and in ten years had made
this to a distance of many miles, and therewith they tapt the
Earth-Current; but not a great stream; yet a sufficiency, as was
believed.

And, presently, after many years, they had builded the Pyramid, and
taken up their refuge there, and made them instruments, and ordained
Monstruwacans; so that they had speech daily with the Great Pyramid; and
thus for many long ages.

And the Earth-Current then to begin to fail; and though they laboured
through many thousands of years, they came to no better resource. And so
it was they ceased to have communication with the Great Redoubt; for the
current had a lack of power to work the instruments; and the recording
instruments ceased to be sensible of our messages.

And thereafter came a million years, maybe, of silence; with ever the
birthing and marrying and dying of those lonesome humans. And they grew
less; and some put this to the lack of the Earth-Current, which dwindled
slowly through the centuries of that Eternity.

And once in a thousand years, maybe, one among them would be Sensitive,
and abled to hear beyond ordinary; and to these, at times, there would
seem to come the thrilling of the aether; so that such an one would go
listening; and sometimes seem to catch half messages; and so awaken a
great interest in all the Pyramid; and there would be turning up of old
Records, and many words and writings, and attempts to send the
Master-Word through the night; in which, doubtless sometimes they
succeeded; for there was set down in the Records of the Great Redoubt
certain occasions on which there had come the call of the Master-Word,
which had been arranged and made holy between the two Redoubts in the
early days of that second life of this world.

Yet, now for an hundred thousand years, there had been none Sensitive;
and in that time the people of the Pyramid had become no more than ten
thousand; and the Earth-Current was weak and powerless to put the joy of
life into them; so that they went listlessly, but deemed it not strange,
because of so many aeons of usage.

And then, to the wonder of all, the Earth-Current had put forth a new
power; so that young people ceased to be old over-soon; and there was
happiness and a certain joy in the living; and a strange birthing of
children, such as had not been through half a million years.

And then came a new thing. Naani, the daughter of the Master
Monstruwacan of that Redoubt had shown to all that she was Sensitive;
for she had perceived odd vibrations afloat in the night; and concerning
these she told her father; and presently, because their blood moved
afresh in their bodies, they had heart to discover the plans of the
ancient instruments; for the instruments had long rusted, and been
forgotten.

And so they builded them a new instrument to send forth a message; for
they had no memory at that time that the brain-elements had power to do
thus; though, mayhap, their brain-elements were weakened, through so
many ages of starvation of the Earth-Current, and could not have obeyed,
even had their masters known all that we of the Great Redoubt knew.

And when the instrument was finished, to Naani was given the right to
call first across the dark to discover whether indeed, after that
million years of silence, they were yet companied upon this earth, or
whether they were in truth lonely--the last poor thousands of the
Humans.

And a great and painful excitement came upon the people of the lesser
pyramid; for the loneliness of the world pressed upon them; and it was
to them as though we in this age called to a star across the abyss of
space.

And because of the excitement and pain of the moment, Naani called only
vaguely with the instrument into the dark; and lo! in a moment, as it
seemed, there came all about her in the night the solemn throb of the
Master-Word, beating in the night. And Naani cried out that she was
answered, and, as may be thought, many of the people wept, and some
prayed, and some were silent; but others beseeched her that she call
again and quickly to have further speech with those of their kind.

And Naani spoke the Master-Word into the night, and directly there came
a calling all about her: "Mirdath! Mirdath!" and the strange wonder of
it made her silent a moment; but when she would have made reply, the
instrument had ceased to work, and she could have no further speech at
that time.

This, as may be thought, occasioned much distress; and constant work
they had between the instrument and the Earth-Current, to discover the
reason for this failing; but could not for a great while. And in that
time, oft did Naani hear the call of "Mirdath" thrilling about her; and
twice there came the solemn beat of the Master-Word in the night. Yet
never had she the power to answer. And all that while, as I learned in
time, was she stirred with a quaint ache at heart by the voice that
called "Mirdath!" as it might be the Spirit of Love, searching for its
mate; for this is how she put it.

And thus it chanced, that the constant thrilling of this name about her,
woke her to memory of a book she had read in early years, and but half
understood; for it was ancient, and writ in an olden fashion, and it set
out the love of a man and a maid, and the maid's name was Mirdath. And
so, because she was full of this great awakening of those ages of
silence, and the calling of that name, she found the book again, and
read it many times, and grew to a sound love of the beauty of that tale.

And, presently, when the instrument was made right, she called into the
night the name of that man within the book; and so it came about that I
had hoped too much; yet even now was I strangely unsure whether to cease
from hoping.

And one other thing there is which I would make clear. Many and oft a
time had I heard a thrilling of sweet, faint laughter about me, and the
stirring of the aether by words too gentle to come clearly; and these I
make no doubt came from Naani, using her brain-elements unwittingly and
in ignorance; but very eager to answer my callings; and having no
knowledge that, far off across the blackness of the world, they thrilled
about me, constantly.

And after Naani had made clear all that I have set out concerning the
Lesser Refuge, she told further how that food was not plentiful with
them; though, until the reawakening of the Earth-Current, they had gone
unknowing of this, being of small appetite, and caring little for aught;
but now wakened, and newly hungry, they savoured a lack of taste in all
that they ate; and this we could well conceive, from our reasonings and
theory; but happily not from our knowledge.

And we said unto them, that the soil had lost its life, and the crops
therefrom were not vital; and a great while it would take for the earth
within their pyramid to receive back the life-elements. And we told them
certain ways by which they might bring a more speedy life to the soil;
and this they were eager to do, being freshly alive after so long a time
of half-life.

And now, you must know that in all the great Redoubt the story went
downwards swiftly, and was published in all the Hour-Sheets, with many
comments; and the libraries were full of those who would look up the
olden Records, which for so long had been forgotten, or taken, as we of
this day would say, with a pinch of salt.

And all the time I was pestered with questions; so that, had I not been
determined, I should scarce have been allowed to sleep; moreover, so
much was writ about me, and my power to hear, and divers stories
concerning tales of love, that I had been like to have grown mazed to
take note of it all; yet some note I did take, and much I found
pleasant; but some displeasing.

And, for the rest, I was not spoiled, as the saying goes; for I had my
work to do; moreover, I was always busied Listening, and having speech
through the darkness. Though if any saw me so, they would question; and
because of this, I kept much to the Tower of Observation, where was the
Master Monstruwacan, and a greater discipline.

And then began a fresh matter; though but an old enough trick; for I
speak now of the days that followed that re-opening of the talk between
the Pyramids. Oft would speech come to us out of the night; and there
would be tales of the sore need of the Lesser Redoubt, and callings for
help. Yet, when I sent the Master-Word abroad, there would be no
answering. And so I feared that the Monsters and Forces of Evil _knew_.

Yet, at times, the Master-Word would answer to us, beating steadily in
the night; and when we questioned afresh, we knew that they in the
Lesser Redoubt had caught the beat of the Master-Word, and so made
reply; though it had not been they who had made the previous talk, which
we had sought to test by the Word. And then they would make
contradiction of all that had been spoken so cunningly; so that we knew
the Monsters and Forces had sought to tempt some from the safety of the
Redoubt. Yet, was this no new thing, as I have made to hint; saving that
it grew now to a greater persistence, and there was a loathsome cunning
in the using of this new knowledge to the making of wicked and false
messages by those evil things of the Night Land. And it told to us, as I
have made remark, how that those Monsters and Forces had a full
awaredness of the speech between the Pyramids; yet could they have no
power to say the Master-Word; so had we some test left, and a way to
sure knowledge of what made talk in the night.

And all that I have told should bring to those of this Age something of
the yet unbegotten terror of that; and a quiet and sound thankfulness to
God, that we suffer not as humanity shall yet suffer.

But, for all this, let it not be thought that they of that Age accounted
it as suffering; but as no more than the usual of human existence. And
by this may we know that we can meet all circumstances, and use
ourselves to them and live through them wisely, if we be but prudent and
consider means of invention.

And through all the Night Land there was an extraordinary awakening
among the Monsters and Forces; so that the instruments made constant
note of greater powers at work out there in the darkness; and the
Monstruwacans were busied recording, and keeping a very strict watch.
And so was there at all that time a sense of difference and awakening,
and of wonders about, and to come.

And from The Country Whence Comes The Great Laughter, the Laughter
sounded constant ... as it were an uncomfortable and heart-shaking
voice-thunder rolling thence over the Lands, out from the unknown East.
And the Pit of the Red Smoke filled all the Deep Valley with redness, so
that the smoke rose above the edge, and hid the bases of the Towers upon
the far side.

And the Giants could be seen plentiful around the Kilns to the East; and
from the Kilns great belches of fire; though the meaning of it, as of
all else, we could not say; but only the cause.

And from the Mountain Of The Voice, which rose to the South-East of the
South-East Watcher, and of which I have made no telling hitherto, in
this faulty setting-out, I heard for the first time in that life, the
calling of the Voice. And though the Records made mention of it; yet not
often was it heard. And the calling was shrill, and very peculiar and
distressful and horrible; as though a giant-woman, hungering strangely,
shouted unknown words across the night. And this was how it seemed to
me; and many thought this to describe the sound.

And, by all this, may you perceive how that Land was awakened.

And other tricks there were to entice us into the Night Land; and once a
call came thrilling in the aether, and told to us that certain humans
had escaped from the Lesser Redoubt, and drew nigh to us; but were faint
for food, and craved succour. Yet, when we sent the Master-Word into the
night, the creatures without could make no reply; which was a very happy
thing for our souls; for we had been all mightily exercised in our
hearts by this one message; and now had proof that it was but a trap.

And constantly, and at all hours, I would have speech with Naani of the
Lesser Redoubt; for I had taught her how she might send her thoughts
through the night, with her brain-elements; but not to over-use this
power; for it exhausts the body and the powers of the mind, if it be
abused by exceeding usage.

Yet, despite that I had taught her the use of her brain-elements, she
sent her message always without strength, save when she had use of the
instrument; and this I set to the cause that she had not the health
force needful; but, apart from this, she had the Night-Hearing very
keen; though less than mine.

And so, with many times of speech, and constant tellings of our doings
and thoughts, we drew near in the spirit to one another; and had always
a feeling in our hearts that we had been given previous acquaintance.

And this, as may be thought, thrilled my heart very strangely.




IV

THE HUSHING OF THE VOICE


    ("Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--
        Treading, as moon-flakes step across a dark--
      Kissing the very dew to holier light ...
        Thy Voice a song past mountains, which to hark
      Frightens my soul with an utter lost delight.")

Now, one night, towards the end of the sixteenth hour, as I made ready
to sleep, there came all about me the thrilling of the aether, as
happened oft in those days; but the thrilling had a strange power in it;
and in my soul the voice of Naani sounded plain, all within and about
me.

Yet, though I knew it to be the voice of Naani, I answered not
immediately; save to send the sure question of the Master-Word into the
night. And, directly, I heard the answer, the Master-Word beating
steadily in the night; and I questioned Naani why she had speech with me
by the Instrument at that time, when all were sleeping, and the watch
set among the Monstruwacans; for they in the little Pyramid had their
sleep-time to commence at the eleventh hour; so that by this it was five
hours advanced towards the time of waking; and Naani should have slept;
nor have been abroad to the Tower of Observation, apart from her father.
For I supposed that she spoke by the Instrument, her voice sounding very
clear in my brain. Yet, to this question, she made no answer in kind;
but gave a certain thing into my spirit, which set me trembling; for she
said certain words, that began:

"Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--"

And it well may be that she set me to tremble; for as the words grew
about me, there wakened a memory-dream how that I had made these same
words to Mirdath the Beautiful in the long-gone Eternity of this our
Age, when she had died and left me alone in all the world. And I was
weak a little with the tumult and force of my emotion; but in a moment I
called eagerly with my brain-elements to Naani to give some explaining
of this thing that she had spoken to the utter troubling of my heart.

Yet, once more she made no direct answer; but spoke the words again to
me across all the dark of the world. And it came to me suddenly, that it
was not Naani that spoke; but Mirdath the Beautiful, from out of all the
everlasting night. And I called: "Mirdath! Mirdath," with my
brain-elements, into the night; and lo! the far, faint voice spoke again
to my spirit through all the darkness of eternity, saying again those
words. Yet, though the voice was the voice of Mirdath the Beautiful, it
was also the voice of Naani; and I knew in all my heart that this thing
was in verity; and that it had been given to me to be birthed once more
into this world in the living-time of that Only One, with whom my spirit
and essence hath mated in all ages through the everlasting. And I called
with my brain-elements and all my strength to Naani; but there came no
answer; neither sign of hearing, though through hours I called.

And thus at last I came to an utter exhaustion; but neither could be
quiet, nor sleep. Yet, presently, I slept.

And when I waked, my first memory was of the wondrous thing which had
befallen in the sleep-time; for none in all this world could have known
those words; save it had been the spirit of Mirdath, my Beautiful One,
looking from above my shoulder in that utter-lost time, as I made those
words to her, out of an aching and a broken heart. And the voice had
been the voice of Mirdath; and the voice of Mirdath had been the voice
of Naani. And what shall any say to this, save that which I had in my
heart.

And immediately I called to Naani, once, and again twice; and in a
little moment there came all about me the throbbing of the Master-Word,
beating solemnly in the night; and I sent the Master-Word to give
assurance, and immediately the voice of Naani, a little weak as was it
always when she had not the Instrument, but sent the message with her
brain-elements.

And I answered her, and questioned her eagerly concerning her sayings of
the past time of sleep; but she disclaimed, and made clear to me that
she had no knowledge of having spoken; but had slept through all that
time of which I made to tell; and, indeed, had dreamed a very strange
dream.

And for a little while I was confused, and meditated, not knowing what
to think; but came suddenly again to a knowledge that Naani's far voice
was thrilling the aether all about; and that she would tell to me her
dream; which had set strong upon her mind.

And she told the dream to me, and in the dream she had seen a tall, dark
man, built very big, and dressed in unfamiliar clothing. And the man had
been in a little room, and very sorrowful, and lonesome; and in her
dream she had gone nigh to him.

And presently the man made to write, that he might ease him by giving
expression to his sorrow; and Naani had been able to read the words that
he wrote; though to her waking spirit the language in which they were
writ was strange and unknown. Yet she could not remember what he had
writ, save but one short line, and this she had mind of in that he had
writ the word Mirdath above. And she spoke of the strangeness of this
thing, that she should dream of this name; but supposed that I had fixed
it upon her, by my first callings.

And then did I, with something of a tremble in my spirit, ask Naani to
tell me what she remembered of the writing of that big, sorrowful
stranger. And, in a little moment, her far voice said these words all
about me:

    "Dearest, thine own feet tread the world at night--"

But no more had she memory of. Yet it was a sufficiency, and I, maybe
with a mad, strange triumph in my soul, said unto her with my
brain-elements that which remained of those words. And my spirit felt
them strike upon the spirit of Naani, and awake her memory, as with the
violence of a blow. And for a little while she stumbled, dumb before so
much newness and certainly. And her spirit then to waken, and she near
wept with the fright and the sudden, new wonder of this thing.

And immediately, all about me there came her voice thrilling, and the
voice was the voice of Mirdath, and the voice of Naani; and I heard the
tears of her spirit make pure and wonderful the bewildered and growing
gladness of her far voice. And she asked me, as one who had suddenly
opened the Gates of Memory, whether she might be truly Mirdath. And I,
utter weak and shaken strangely because of this splendour of fulfilment,
could make no instant answer. And she asked again, but using mine old
love-name, and with a sureness in her far voice. And still I was so
strangely dumb, and the blood to thud peculiar in mine ears; and this to
pass; and speech to come swift.

And this way to be that meeting of our spirits, across all the
everlasting night.

And you shall have for a memory-picture, how that Naani stood there in
the world in that far eternity, and, with her spirit having speech with
mine, looked back through the part-opened gates of her memory, into the
past of this our life and Age. Yet more than this she saw, and more than
was given to me in that Age; for she had memory now and sight of other
instances, and of other comings together, which had some confusion and
but half-meanings to me. Yet of this our present Age and life, we spoke
as of some yesterday; but very hallowed.

Now, as may be conceived, the wonder of this surety which had come into
my life stirred me fiercely to its completion; for all my heart and
spirit cried out to be with that one who was Mirdath, and now spoke with
the voice of Naani.

Yet, how should this be won; for none among all the learned men of that
Mighty Pyramid knew the position of the Lesser Redoubt; neither could
the Records and Histories of the World give us that knowledge; only that
there was a general thought among the Students and the Monstruwacans
that it lay between the North-West and the North-East. But no man had
any surety; neither could any conceive of the distance from us of that
Refuge.

And counting all this, there was yet the incredible danger and peril of
the Night Land, and the hunger and desolation of the Outer Lands, which
were sometimes named the Unknown Lands.

And I spoke much with Naani concerning this matter of their position;
yet neither she nor her father, the Master Monstruwacan of that Refuge,
had any knowing either of our position; only that the Builder of the
Lesser Redoubt had come out of the Southward World in the Beginning, as
they had knowledge of by the Records.

Also, the father of Naani set that ancient Compass to bear; for, as he
made explanation to us through the Instrument, so great a power of the
Earth-Current must be ours that, perchance it was our force which did
affect the pointer from steadfastness. For, indeed, the needle did swing
in an arc, as we heard, that held between the North and the South;
within the Westward arc; but this it had done ever with them, and so was
a very helpless guide; save that, maybe, as we had thought, the force of
the Earth-Current that was with us, had in truth some power to pull the
needle towards us. And if this were so of verity, we made a reckoning
that set the Lesser Redoubt to the North; and they did likewise, and put
us to the South; yet was it all built upon the sand of guess-work; and
nothing to adventure the life and soul upon.

Now we, of curiosity; though a million times had it been done in the
past ages, set the compass before us, having it from the Great Museum.
But, as ever in that age, it did spin if we but stirred the needle, and
would stop nowheres with surety, for the flow of the Earth-Current from
the "Crack" beneath the Pyramid had a power to affect it away from the
North, and to set it wandering. And this may seem very strange to this
present Age; yet to that, it was most true to the seeming nature of
things; and harder to believe that ever it did once point steadfastly,
to prove a guide of sureness, and unfailing.

For, be it known, we knew the positions of the Land by tradition, coming
from that ancient time when, in the Half-Gloom they had builded the
Pyramid; they having known the use of that ancient compass, and with
sight of the Sun had named the Positions; though we of that far future
day had forgotten the very beginnings of those Names of Direction; and
used them but because our fathers did a million years and more. And
likewise we did the same with the names of the day and the night and the
weeks and the months and the years; though of the visible markings of
these there was nothing but only and always the everlasting night; yet
the same seeming very natural to that people.

Now, Naani, having heed to my constant questions, craved with an utter
keen hunger that I might come to her; but yet forbade it, in that it
were better to live and commune in the spirit, than to risk my soul, and
mayhaps die, in the foolishness of trying to find her in all the
darkness of the dead world. Yet, no heed had I taken of her commands,
had I but known of a surety the _direction_ in which she might be
discovered; and gained some knowledge of the space between, for this
might be named by thousands of miles, or but by hundreds; though a great
distance it was surely.

Yet, one other thing there was, that has point in this place; for when I
sent my speech out into the night, using my brain-elements, I came to
know that, whether I had a knowledge of the North, or no knowledge at
the moment, yet did I turn oft with a sure instinction to that
Direction. And of this, the Master Monstruwacan took very great note,
and had me to experiment many a time and way, and so enclosed about with
screens, or with bandages across mine eyes, that I could not, save by
that inward Knowing, have any knowledge to point me the way. Yet would I
turn Northwards very frequent, by a certain feeling; and seemed unable
of speech, if I were turned otherwise by force.

But when we asked Naani whether she had an unusualness in this matter,
she could discover none; and we could but take note curiously of that
which affected my habits; and which truly I set to the attracting of her
spirit; for I had mind that she did be somewheres out that way in the
darkness of the world; but yet was this no more than to suppose, as you
perceive.

And the Master Monstruwacan wrote a study of this matter of the
Northwardness of my turning; and it was set out in the Hour-Slips of the
Tower of Observation; and so it came to be copied by the Hour-Slips of
the great cities, and made much comment, and much calling up to me
through the home instruments; so that with this, and the speech that
went about concerning my powers to hear, I was much in talk, and
diversely pleased and oft angered by overmuch attention and importunity.

And now, whilst I pondered this matter in all my spirit and being, how
that I should some way come to Naani, there befell a very terrible
thing. And in this wise must I tell it:

It was at the seventeenth hour, when all the millions of the Mighty
Pyramid slept, that I was with the Master Monstruwacan in the Tower of
Observation taking my due turn. And sudden, I heard the thrilling of the
aether all about me, and the voice of Naani in my soul, speaking. And I
sent the Master-Word into the darkness of the world, and presently, I
heard the solemn answer beating steadfastly in the night; and
immediately I called to Naani with my brain-elements, to know what thing
troubled her in her sleep.

And her voice came into my spirit, weak and far and faint, and so that
scarce I could make to hear the words. Yet, in a while I gathered that
all the peoples of the Lesser Redoubt were in very deadly trouble; for
that the Earth-Current had failed suddenly and mightily; and they had
called her from her sleep, that she might listen whether we answered
their callings by the Instrument; but, indeed, no calling had come to
us.

And they who had been of late so joyful, were now grown old with sorrow
in but an hour or two; for they feared that the fresh coming of the
Earth-Current had been but the final flicker and outburst before the
end. And, even in this short while of our speech, did it seem to me that
the voice of Naani grew further off from me; and I felt like to have
broken my heart with the trouble of this thing.

And through all that remained of that sleep-time, did I converse with
Naani, as might two lovers who shall presently part forever. And when
the cities awoke, the news went throughout them, and all our millions
were in sorrow and trouble.

And thus was it for, maybe, a little month; and in that time had the
voice of Naani grown so weak and far-off that even I that had the
Night-Hearing, could scarce make real its meaning. And every word was to
me a treasure and a touch upon my soul; and my grief and trouble before
this certain parting drove me that I could not eat, neither have rest;
and this did the Master Monstruwacan take upon him to chide and correct;
for that, if any were to help, how should it be done if I that had the
Night-Hearing, and heard even now that the recording Instruments were
dumb, came to ill-health.

And because of this, and such wisdom as was mine, I made to eat and
order my life that I might have my full powers. Yet was this beyond all
my strength; for, presently, I knew that the people of the Lesser
Pyramid were threatened by the monsters that beset them; and later I had
knowledge from faint, far words whispered in my brain, that there had
been a fight with an outside Force that had harmed many in their minds;
so that in madness they had opened the gate and had run from the Lesser
Pyramid, out into the darkness of the Lands about them; and there had
their physical bodies fallen to the monsters of those Lands; but of
their souls who may know?

And this, we set assuredly to the failure of the Earth-Current, which
had robbed them of all force and power; so that, in those few weeks all
life and joy of living had left them; and neither hunger nor thirst had
they, much, nor any great desire to live; but yet a new and mighty fear
of death. And this doth seem very strange.

And, as may be thought, all this made the Peoples of the Great Redoubt
think newly of the Earth-Current that issued from the "Crack" beneath
the Pyramid; and of their latter end; so that much was writ in the
Hour-Slips concerning this matter; yet in the main to assure us that we
ourselves might each be free from a disturbed heart; though some went
foolishly to the other event, and spoke of a speedy danger to us,
likewise; as is ever the way. But the truth of our own case lay, maybe,
somewhere between.

And all the Hour-Slips were full also of imaginings of the terror of
those poor humans out in the darkness of the world, facing that end
which must come upon all, even upon our mighty Pyramid; though, as most
would believe, so far away in some future eternity, that we have no
cause to trouble.

And there were sad poems writ to the peoples of that Lesser Redoubt, and
foolish plans set about to rescue them; but none to put them to effect;
and no way by which so great a thing might be done; and doth but show
how loosely people will speak out of an over-security. Yet to me, there
had come a certain knowledge that I must make the adventure, though I
achieved naught save mine own end. Yet, it were better to cease quickly,
than that I should feel, as now I did feel.

That same night, in the Eighteenth Hour, there was a great disturbance
in the aether about the Mighty Pyramid; and I was awakened suddenly by
the Master Monstruwacan; that I might use my gift of the Night-Hearing
to hearken for the throbbing of the Master-Word, which they had thought
to come vaguely through the Instruments; but no one of the Monstruwacans
was sensitive enough of soul to account truly whether this was so.

And lo! as I sat up in the bed, there came the sound of the Master-Word,
beating in the night about the Pyramid. And immediately there was a
crying in the aether all about me: "We are coming! We are coming!"

And mine inwards leaped and sickened me a moment, so shaken was I with a
sudden belief; for the message seemed some ways to come to me from very
near to the Great Redoubt; as that they who sent it were nigh to hand.

And, forthwith, I called the Master-Word into the night; but no answer
did there come for a while, and then a faint thrilling of the aether
about me, and the weak pulse of the Master-Word in the night, sent by a
far voice, strangely distant. And I knew that the voice was the voice of
Naani; and I put a question through all the darkness of the dead world,
whether she were within the Lesser Redoubt, and safe thus far.

And presently, there came a faint disturbance about me, and a small
voice in my soul, speaking weakly and out of an infinite distance; and I
knew that far away through the night Naani spoke feebly, with her
brain-elements; and that she abode within the Lesser Pyramid; but that
she too had heard that strange pulse of the Master-Word in the night,
and that message: "We are coming! We are coming!" And vastly had this
thing disturbed her, waking her within her sleep; so that she knew not
what to think; save that we were devising some method to come to them.
But this I removed from doubt, saying that she must not build on vain
hoping; for I would not have her doubly tortured by the vanity of such
believing. And, thereafter, having said such things as I might, though
few they were, to comfort her, I bade her, gently, to sleep; and turned
therewith to the Master Monstruwacan, who waited in quiet patience; and
had no knowledge of that which I had heard and sent; for his hearing was
but the normal; though his brain and heart were such as made me to love
him.

And I told the Master Monstruwacan many things as I put my clothing
about me; how that there had indeed been the calling of the Master-Word;
but not by any of that Lesser Redoubt; but that, to my belief, it had
come from nigh about the Great Pyramid. Moreover, it was sent by no
instrument; as I wotted that he did guess; but, as it seemed to me, by
the brain-elements of many, calling in unison.

And all this did I set out to the Master Monstruwacan; and with
something uncertain of fear and trouble in my heart; yet with a blind
expectation; as, indeed, who would not. Though, no longer was I shaken
by that first thought of Her nearness.

And I said to the Master Monstruwacan that we should go to the Tower of
Observation, and search the Night Lands with the great spy-glass.

And we did this, and lo! presently, we saw a great number of men pass
over the Electric Circle that went about the Pyramid; yet they came not
_to_ us; but went outwards towards the blackness and the strange fires
and hideous mysteries of the Night Land. And we ceased from spying, and
looked swiftly at one another, and knew in our hearts that some had left
the Mighty Pyramid in the Sleep-Time.

Then the Master Monstruwacan sent word to the Master Watchman that his
wardership had been outraged, and that people left the great Pyramid in
the Sleep-Time; for this was against the Law; and none ever went out
into the Night Land, save the Full Watch were posted to the Great Door;
and at a due time, when all were wakeful; for the Opening Of The Door
was made known to all the Millions of the Great Redoubt; so that all
might be aware; and know that no foolishness was done without their
wotting.

Moreover, ere any had power to leave the Pyramid, they must pass The
Examination, and Be Prepared; and some of this have I set out already.
And so stern was the framing of the Law, that there were yet the metal
pegs upon the inner side of the Great Gate, where had been stretched the
skin of one who disobeyed; and was flayed and his hide set there to be a
warning in the Early Days. Yet the tradition was remembered; for, as I
might say it, we lived very close about the place; and Memory had no
room whereby she might escape.

Now the Master Watchman, when he heard that which the Master
Monstruwacan had to tell, went hastily with some of the Central Watch
from the Watch-Dome, to the Great Gate; and he found the men of the
Sleep-Time Watch, with the Warder of the Gate, all bound, and stopt in
the mouth, so that none could make outcry.

And he freed them, and learned that nigh five hundred young men, from
the Upper Cities, by the bigness of their chests, had come upon them
suddenly, and bound them, and escaped into the night through the
Eye-Gate in the top of the Great Gate.

And the Master Watchman was angry, and demanded why that none had called
by the instruments of the Watch House; but lo! some had made to call
thus, and found them unable to wake the recorders which lay in the
central Watch-Dome; for there had been tampering.

Now, after this, they made certain new rules and Laws concerning the
order of Watching, and made tests of the lesser instruments of the
inward Pyramid, nightly, upon the coming of the Sleep-Time, which was,
even in that strange age, by tradition called the Night, as I have given
hint; though hitherto, until the way of my story was known, I have used
a word for the sleep hours that was yet not of that time; but somewhat
an invention to make this history free from the confusion of "night" and
"day," when, in truth, it was always night without upon the world. Yet,
after this, shall I keep to mine use the luxury of the true names of
that time; and yet, how strange is it that the truth should be of so
little to our thinking.

And so to go forward with my telling; for, though all this care were now
taken, it had no force until afterward; and at this moment were those
poor foolish youths out in all the danger of the Night Land, and no way
by which they might be succoured, or called back; save that Fear or
Wisdom should come to them quickly, that they cease from so wild an
attempt. For it was to make rescue of those in that other, unknown
Pyramid, out in all the darkness of the World's Night that was their
intent, as we had speedy knowledge from those boon friends that had been
in the secret of their plot, which had seemed to them great and heroic;
and was so, in verity, but that neither they who went, nor they who
stayed, had a true awaredness of the danger they had dealing with, being
all naught but raw and crude youths; yet, doubtless, with the makings of
many fine and great men among them.

And because some had thus abetted that which they knew to be against the
Law, which was framed to the well-being and safety of all, there were
certain floggings, which might the better help their memories in the
future as to the properness of their actions and wisdom.

Moreover, they who returned, if any, would be flogged, as seemed proper,
after due examination. And though the news of their beatings might help
all others to hesitation, ere they did foolishly, in like fashion, yet
was the principle of the flogging not on this base, which would be both
improper and unjust; but only that the one in question be corrected to
the best advantage for his own well-being; for it is not meet that any
principle of correction should shape to the making of human signposts of
pain for the benefit of others; for in verity, this were to make one pay
the cost of many's learning; and each should owe to pay only so much as
shall suffice for the teaching of his own body and spirit. And if others
profit thereby, this is but accident, however helpful. And this is
wisdom, and denoteth now that a sound Principle shall prevent Practice
from becoming monstrous.

Yet, now I must hasten that I set down how it fared with those five
hundred youths that had made so sad an adventure of their lives and
unprepared souls; and were beyond our aid to help them, who might not
so much as make any calling to them, to bid them to return; for to do
this would have been to tell to all the Monsters of the Land that humans
were abroad from the Mighty Pyramid.

And this would have been to cause the monsters to search the youths out
to their destruction, and maybe even to awaken the Forces to work them
some dread Spiritual harm, which was the chief Fear.

Now, presently, through all the cities of the Great Redoubt, the news
had gone how that five hundred foolish Youths had adventured out into
the despair of the Night Land; and the whole Pyramid waked to life, and
the Peoples of the South came to the Northern sides, for the Great Gate
lay in the North-West side; and the Youths had made from there, not
straightly outwards, but towards the North; and so were to be seen from
the North-East embrasures, and from those within the North-West wall.

And thus, in a while were they watched by all the mighty multitudes of
the Great Pyramid, through millions of spy-glasses; for each human had a
spying-glass, as may be thought; and some were an hundred years old, and
some, maybe ten thousand, and handed down through many generations; and
some but newly made, and very strange. But all those people had some
instrument by which they might spy out upon the wonder of the Night
Land; for so had it been ever through all the eternity of darkness, and
a great diversion and wonder of life was it to behold the monsters about
their work; and to know that they plotted always to our destruction; yet
were ever foiled.

And never did all that great and terrible Land grow stale upon the soul
of any, from birth until death; and by this you shall know the constant
wonder of it, and that _sense of enemies in the night about us,_ which
ever filled the heart and spirit of all Beholders; so that never were
the embrasures utterly empty.

Yet, many beheld not the Land from the embrasures; but sat about the
View-Tables, which were set properly in certain places throughout the
cities, and so beheld the Night Land, without undue cranings, or poising
of spy-glasses, though less plain-seen. And these same tables were some
form of that which we of this age name Camera Obscura; but made very
great, and with inventions, and low to the floor, so that ten thousand
people might sit about them in the raised galleries, and have
comfortable sight. Yet this attracted not the young people, save they
were lovers; and then, in truth, were they comfortable seats for
quietness and gentle whisperings.

Yet now, as may be supposed, with all the Peoples of the Mighty Pyramid
grown eager to look towards one part of the Night Land, the embrasures
were hid in the crowds; and such as could gain no view therethrough,
thronged about the View-Tables. And so was it in all the hours of
leisure; so that women had scarce patience to attend their children; but
must hasten to watch again, that lonesome band of foolish youths making
so blind and unshaped a trial to come upon that unknown Lesser Redoubt,
somewhere out in all the night of the world.

And in this wise passed three days and nights; yet both in the
sleep-time and the time of waking did great multitudes cease not to
watch; so that many went hungry for sleep, as in truth did I. And
sometimes we saw those Youths with plainness; but other times they were
lost to our sight in the utter shadows of the Night Land. Yet, by the
telling of our instruments, and the sense of my hearing, there was no
awaredness among the Monsters, and the Forces of Evil, that any were
abroad from the Pyramid; so that a little hope came into our hearts that
yet there might be no tragedy.

And times, would they cease from their way, and sit about in circles
among the shadows and the grey moss-bushes, which grew hardly here or
there about. And we knew that they had food with them to eat; for this
could we see with plainness, as some odd, grim flare of light from the
infernal fires struck upon one or another strangely, and passed, and
left them in the darkness.

And who of you shall conceive what was in the hearts of the fathers, and
the mothers that bore the youths, and who never ceased away from the
Northward embrasures; but spied out in terror and in tears, and maybe
oft with so good glasses as did show them the very features and look
upon the face of son and son.

And the kin of the watchers brought to them food, and tended them, so
that they had no need to cease from their watching; and beds were made
in the embrasures, rough and resourceful, that they might sleep quickly
a little; yet be ever ready, if those cruel Monsters without made
discovery of those their children.

Thrice in those three days of journeying to the Northward, did the
Youths sleep, and we perceived that some kept a watch, and so knew that
there was a kind of order and leadership among them; also, they had each
his weapon upon his hip, and this gave to us a further plea to hope.

And concerning this same carrying of weapons, I can but set out here
that no healthful male or female in all the Mighty Pyramid but possessed
such a weapon, and was trained to it from childhood; so that a ripe and
extraordinary skill in the use thereof was common to most. Yet some
breaking of Rule had there been, that the Youths had each achieved to be
armed; for the weapons were stored in every tenth house of the cities,
in the care of the charging-masters.

And here I must make known that these weapons did not shoot; but had a
disk of grey metal, sharp and wonderful, that spun in the end of a rod
of grey metal, and were someways charged by the Earth-Current, so that
were any but stricken thereby, they were cut in twain so easy as aught.
And the weapons were contrived to the repelling of any Army of Monsters
that might make to win entrance to the Redoubt. And to the eye they had
somewhat the look of strange battle-axes, and might be lengthened by the
pulling out of the handles.

Now, the Youths made, as I have told, to the Northward; but had first to
keep a long way to the North-East, that they might come clear of the
Vale of Red Fire. And this wise they journeyed, and kept the Vale about
seven miles to the North-West of them, and so were presently beyond the
Watcher of the North-East, and going with a greater freedom, and having
less care to hide.

And this way, it may be, certain of the giants, wandering, perceived
them, and went swiftly to make attack and destroy them. But some order
went about among the youths, and they made a long line, with a certain
space between each, because of the terror of their weapon, and
immediately, it seemed, the Giants were upon them, a score and seven
they were, and seeming to be haired like to mighty crabs, as I saw with
the Great Spy-Glass, when the great flares of far and mighty fires threw
their fierce light across the Dark Lands.

And there was a very great and horrid fight; for the Youths broke into
circles about each of the Giants, and many of those young men were torn
in pieces; but they smote the Monsters from behind and upon every side,
and we of the Mighty Pyramid could behold at times the grey, strange
gleam of their weapons; and the jether was stirred about me by the
passing of those that died; yet, by reason of the great miles, their
screams came not to us, neither heard we the roars of the Monsters; but
into our hearts, even from that great distance and safety, there stole
the terror of those awesome Brutes; and in the Great Spy-Glass I could
behold the great joints and limbs and e'en, I thought, the foul sweat of
them; and their size and brutishness was like to that of odd and
monstrous animals of the olden world; yet part human. And it must be
borne to mind that the Fathers and the Mothers of those Youths beheld
all this dread fight from the embrasures, and their other kin likewise
watched, and a very drear sight was it to their hearts and their human,
natural feelings, and like to breed old age, ere its due.

Then, in a time, the fight ceased; for of those seven and twenty Giant
Brutes there remained none; only that there cumbered the ground seven
and twenty lumbering hillocks, dreadful and grim. For the lesser dead we
could not see proper.

And we that were within the Pyramid saw the Youths sorted together by
their leaders, all in the dim twilight of that place; and with the Great
Spy-Glass I made a rough count, and found that there lived of them,
three hundred; and by this shall you know the power of those few
monstrous things, which had slain full two hundred, though each youth
was armed with so wondrous a weapon. And I set the word through the
Pyramid, that all might have some knowledge of the number that had
died; for it was better to know, than to be in doubt. And no spy-glass
had the power of The Great Spy-Glass.

After this fight, the youths spent a time having a care to their bodies
and wounds; and some were made separate from the others, and of these I
counted upon fifty; and whilst the others made to continue their march
towards the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, these were constrained by
one who was the Leader, to return to the Pyramid. And in a little, I saw
that they came towards us, wearily and with many a halt, as that they
suffered great wounds and harm of the fight.

But those others (maybe two hundred and fifty Youths) went onwards into
the Night Land; and though we sorrowed at this thing; yet was there come
a huge pride into our hearts that those raw ones, who yesterday were but
children, had so held themselves in the battle, and done a great deed
that day. And I wot that whilst their mothers wept, easeless, their
fathers' hearts swelled within them, and held somewhat of their Pain
away from them for a time.

And all this while, those wounded Youths came slowly, and rested, and
came on again, the better helping the worse; and a great excitement and
trouble there was in all the Mighty Pyramid, to learn which were they
that came, and they that went, and who lay out there quietly among the
slain. But none might say anything with surety; for, even with that
great spy-glass in the Tower of Observation, they were not overplain;
save when some light from the fires of the Land flared high, and lit
them. For they stood not up into the glare of the fires, as had the
Giants. And though I saw them with clearness, yet I knew them not; for
there was so mighty a multitude in that Vast Redoubt, that none might
ever know the half even of their rulers.

And about this time, there came a fresh matter of trouble to our minds;
for one of the Monstruwacans made report that the instruments were
recording an influence abroad in the night; so that we had knowledge
that one of the Evil Forces was Out. And to me there came an awaredness
that a strange unquiet stole over the Land; yet I knew it not with mine
ears; but my spirit heard, and it was as though trouble and an
expectation of horror did swarm about me.

And once, listening, I heard the Master-Word beating strangely low, and
I knew the aether to thrill about me, and a faint stirring was there in
my soul, as of a faint voice, speaking; and I knew that Naani called to
me some message across the night of the world; yet weak and coming
without clear meaning; so that I was tormented and could but send
comfort to her, with my brain-elements. And presently I knew that she
ceased to speak.

And, later, I heard that there was a new matter forward in the Redoubt;
for ten thousand men had assembled to attend the Room of Preparation
for the Short Preparation; and by this we knew that those poor Youths
who stumbled towards us through the dark, were presently to have help.

And through all that Sleep-Time, there went forward the Spiritual and
the Physical Preparation of the ten thousand; and upon the morrow they
slept, whilst an hundred thousand made ready their arms.

And in this space of time the two hundred and fifty Youths that went
towards the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, had come very nigh thereto;
having gone very warily and with some slowness, because, as may be, of
the lesson of the Giants.

And to us in the Pyramid, the instruments made known constantly that
Influence which was abroad, and which all those of the Tower of
Observation thought to proceed from the House of Silence. Yet, nothing
could we see with the Great Spy-Glass, and so could come to no sure
knowing; but only to fear and wonder.

And, presently, the Youths were upon the Great Road, and turned to the
Northward. And beyond them, a great way, stood the House of Silence,
upon a low hill at a certain distance to the right of the Road.

By now, they that were wounded had come to within, maybe, fifteen miles
of the Great Redoubt; and the news went through all the Cities, that the
ten thousand men that were Prepared, made to arm themselves. And I went
down by the Tower Lift, and saw them come down by thousands from the
Room of Preparation; and none might go nigh to them, or cause them to
speak; for they were made Ready, and were, as it might be, holy.

And all the millions of the Mighty Pyramid stood in their cities about
certain of the Main Lifts, and watched those thousands go downwards, all
in their armour of grey metal, and each one armed with the Diskos, which
was that same very terrible weapon, which all had training to.

And I doubt not but that the Young Men of the Pyramid looked, with
longing in their hearts, that they might have been among those that went
forth to succour. Yet, the older men had graver thoughts in their
hearts; for the blood ran more soberly in them, and they had knowledge
and memory of the Peril. And by this, I would make clear that I speak
less of the peril of the body, which is common to every state of life;
but of the peril of the spirit.

And it may be thought by those of this age, that it was most strange
that they of that, having all the knowledge of eternity to aid them, had
no weapon by which to shoot, and kill at a distance.

But, indeed, this had not been so in the past; as our Histories did
show; for some wondrous weapons there had been, that might slay without
sound or flash at a full score miles and more; and some we had whole
within the Great Museum; and of others but the parts in decay; for they
had been foolish things, and reckless to use; for we of that Great
Pyramid, wanted not to kill a few of the Monsters that lay at a great
distance; but only those which came nigh, to harm us.

And concerning those same weapons that killed silently at a great
distance, we had now little knowledge, save that they did waste the
Earth-Current; and no practice had we concerning their workings; for it
was, maybe, an hundred thousand years gone that they had been used, and
found to be of no great worth in a close attack, and harmful otherwise
to the peace, in that they angered, unneedful, the Forces of that land,
slaying wantonly those monsters which did no more than beset the Mighty
Redoubt at a great distance. For, as may be seen by a little thought, we
did very gladly keep a reasonable quietness, and refrained from aught
that should wake that Land; for we were born to the custom of that
strange life, and lived and died in peace, for the most part; and were
very content to have security, and to be neutral in all things that did
not overbear us; but, as it were, always armed, and ready.

But concerning the great and Evil Forces that were abroad in the Night
Land, these we had no power to harm; nor could we hope for more than
that we had security from them, which indeed we had; but the hugeness of
their power was about us, and we dared not to wake it; save through such
extremity as had come to pass by this folly of the Youths; though, even
now, we had no thought to attack aught; but only to succour those
wounded ones.

And concerning this simplicity of weapons, which excites somewhat even
my wonder in this our present age, it may be that the powers of
chemistry were someways quaintly limited by conditions in that age; and
there to be always a need to spare the Earth-Current; and hence, by this
cause and by that, we were brought, by the extreme, nigh to the
simplicity of the early world; yet with a strange and mighty difference,
as all may know who have read.

Now, presently, the Word was sent to every City throughout the Great
Redoubt--as was the Law--that the Great Gate should be opened; and each
city sent its Master, to form the Full Watch, as was the Law. And each
went clad in grey armour, and carrying the Diskos. And the Full Watch
numbered, two thousand; for there were also the Watchmen.

Then the lights in the Great Causeway were made dim; so that the opening
of the Gate should cast no great glare from within into the Night Land,
to tell the Watcher of the North-West, and all the Monsters, that
certain humans went out from the Mighty Pyramid. But whether the vast
and hidden Forces of Evil had knowledge, we knew not; and they who went
must but chance it, remembering that they were Prepared, and had the
Capsule.

And the ten thousand that were Prepared, went out through the Great
Gateway, into the night; and the Full Watch stood back from them, and
spoke no word, but saluted silently with the Diskos; and they that went,
raised each the Diskos a little, and passed out into the dark.

Then the Great Gate was shut; and we made to wait and to watch, with
trouble and expectation within our hearts. And at the embrasures many
did comfort the women of those men.

And I went back, upwards by miles, until I came to the Tower of
Observation; and I looked out from there into the Night Land, and saw
that the ten thousand halted at the Circle, and made arrangement of
themselves, and sent some before and upon either hand, and so went
forward into the Night Land.

And after that, I went to the Great Spy-Glass, and turned it towards the
two hundred and fifty Youths that were far off, upon the Road Where The
Silent Ones Walk; yet for awhile I could not perceive them, for all the
Road seemed empty. But afterward I saw them, and they were clambering
back into the Road, having gone aside, as I thought, because of the
passing of one of those Silent Ones, that I saw now at a distance to the
Southward of them.

There passed then, some three hours; and in that time I varied my
watching between those far-off Youths, and the Ten-thousand that went
forward to succour the wounded, that were now, maybe, scarce nine miles
distant from the Mighty Pyramid, and the Ten-thousand came very close to
them. And, in truth, in a little while, they spied one the other, and I
gathered, in spirit, something of the rejoicing of those youths; yet
weak and troubled were they, because of their wounds, and their
knowledge of failure, and their disobedience of the Law.

And, presently, they were surrounded by the Ten-thousand, and carried
upon slings; and all that body swung round towards the Pyramid, and came
back at a great pace.

And, in the same time, I heard the sound that made them so swift to
hasten; for there smote up through the night the Baying of the Hounds;
and we knew that they were discovered. And I swept the Great Spy-Glass
over the Land, towards the Valley Of The Hounds, that I might discover
them quickly; and I saw them come lumbering, at a strange gallop, and
great as horses, and it might be only ten miles to the East.

And I looked once upon the Watcher of the North-East, and I saw and
marvelled that the great bell-ear quivered constantly; and I knew that
it had knowledge, and gave signal to all the Land. Then did one of the
Monstruwacans report that a new and terrible Influence was abroad in the
Land; and by the instrument, we had knowledge that it approached; and
some of the Monstruwacans called foolishly with weak voices to the
Ten-thousand to haste; forgetting, and desiring only their safety from
that which came near.

Then, looking with the Great Spy-Glass, I saw that there moved across
the Land, from the direction of the Plain of Blue Fire, a mighty Hump,
seeming of Black Mist, and came with prodigious swiftness. And I called
to the Master Monstruwacan, that he come and look through one of the
eye-pieces that were about the Great Spy-Glass; and he came quickly, and
when he had looked a while, he called to the Monstruwacan that had made
report. And the Monstruwacan answered, and replied that the Influence
drew nearer, by the reading of the instrument; yet of the thing itself
the man had no sight.

And I ceased not to look, and in a little while, the Humped thing passed
downwards into the Vale of Red Fire, which lay across the Land that way.
But I watched steadfastly, and presently I saw the black Hump climb up
from the Vale of Red Fire upon this side, and come through the night, so
that in scarce a minute it had come halfway across that part of the
Night Land.

And my heart stood quiet with fear, and the utter terror of this
Monster, which I knew to be surely one of the Great Forces of Evil of
that Land, and had power, without doubt, to destroy the spirit. And the
Master Monstruwacan leapt towards the Home-Call, and sent the great
Sound down to the Ten-thousand, that they might attend, and immediately,
he signalled to them to Beware. Yet, already I perceived that they knew
of this Utter Danger that was upon them; for I saw them slay the Youths
quickly, that their spirits might not be lost; for they were Unprepared.
But the men, being Prepared, had the Capsule, and would die swiftly in
the last moment.

I looked again towards the Hump, and saw that it came like a Hill of
Blackness in the Land, and was almost anigh. Then there happened a
wonder; for in that moment when all had else gone quickly, that they
might save their souls, out of the earth there rose a little Light, like
to the crescent of the young moon of this early day. And the crescent
rose up into an arch of bright and cold fire, glowing but little; and it
spanned above the Ten-thousand and the dead; and the Hump stood still,
and went backwards and was presently lost.

And the men came swiftly towards the Mighty Pyramid. Yet, ere they were
come to safety, the Baying of the Hounds sounded close upon them, and
they faced to the danger; yet, as I could know, without despair, because
that they yet lived after so enormous a peril.

And the Hounds were very nigh, as now I beheld with the Great Spy-Glass;
and I counted five score, running with mighty heads low, and in a pack.
And lo! as the Hounds came at them, the Ten-thousand drew apart, and had
a space between the men, that they might have full use of that terrible
Diskos; and they fought with the handles at length, and I saw the disks
spin and glisten and send out fire.

Then was there a very great battle; for the Light that arched above
them, and held away The Power from their souls, made not to protect them
from this danger of the lesser monsters. And at an hundred thousand
embrasures within the Mighty Pyramid, the women cried and sobbed, and
looked again. And in the lower cities it was told, after, that the
Peoples could hear the crash and splinter of the armour, as the Hounds
ran to and fro, slaying; aye, even the sound of the armour between their
teeth.

Yet, the Ten-thousand ceased not to smite with the Diskos; and they
hewed the Hounds in pieces; but of the men that went forth, there were a
thousand and seven hundred slain by the Hounds, ere the men won to
victory.

Then came that wearied band of heroes back to the home shelter of the
Vast Redoubt; and they bore their dead with them, and the Youths that
they slew. And they were received with great honour, and with exceeding
grief, and in a great silence; for the thing admitted not of words,
until a time had passed. And in the cities of the Pyramid there was
mourning; for there had been no sorrow like unto this through, mayhap,
an hundred thousand years.

And they bore the Youths to their Mothers and to their Fathers; and the
Father of each made thanks to the men that they had saved the soul of
his son; but the women were silent. Yet, neither to the Father nor to
the Mother, was ever made known the name of the slayers; for this might
not be; as all shall see with a little thought.

And some did remember that, in verity, all was due to the unwisdom of
those Youths, who had heeded not the Law and their life-teachings. Yet
had they paid to the uttermost, and passed outwards; and the account of
their Deeds was closed.

And all this while did great numbers spy toward the Road Where The
Silent Ones Walk, that they might watch that band of Youths afar in the
Night Land, who went forward amid those horrid dangers. Yet, when the
dead Youths had been brought in, many had ceased to look out for a time
and had turned to questioning, and some had made inspection that they
might know which had come back, and which lay out there where the Giants
had slain them, or went forward to more dreadful matters.

But who of those that were abroad, were slain, or still went onward, we
had but indifferent knowledge; though the men of the Ten-thousand knew
somewhat, having had speech with the wounded Youths, ere they slew them.
And, as may be thought, these men were sorely questioned by the Mothers
and the Fathers of those Youths that were not accounted of; yet I doubt
that few had much knowledge wherewith to console them.

Now there was presently, in the Garden of Silence, which was the
lowermost of all the Underground Fields, the Ending of those seventeen
hundred heroes, and of the Youths that they saved and slew. And the
Garden was a great country, and an hundred miles every way, and the roof
thereof was three great miles above, and shaped to a mighty dome; as it
had been that the Builders and Makers thereof did remember in their
spirits the visible sky of this our present age.

And the making of that Country was all set out in a single History of
seven thousand and seventy Volumes. And there were likewise seven
thousand and seventy years spent to the making of that Country; so that
there had unremembered generations lived and laboured and died, and seen
not the end of their labour. And Love had shaped it and hallowed it; so
that of all the wonders of the world, there has been none that shall
ever come anigh to that Country of Silence--an hundred miles every way
of Silence to the Dead.

And there were in that roof seven moons set in a mighty circle, and lit
by the Earth-Current; and the circle was sixty miles across, so that all
that Country of Quiet was visible; yet to no great glare, but a sweet
and holy light; so that I did always feel in my heart that a man might
weep there, and be unashamed.

And in the midst of that silent Country, there was a great hill, and
upon the hill a vast Dome. And the Dome was full of a Light that might
be seen in all that Country, which was the Garden of Silence. And
beneath the Dome was the "Crack," and within it the glory of the
Earth-Current, from which all had life and light and safety. And in the
Dome, at the North, there was a gateway; and a narrow road went upward
to the gateway; and the Road was named The Last Road; and the Gateway
was named by no name, but known to all as The Gateway.

And there were in that mighty Country, long roadways, and hidden methods
to help travel; and constant temples of rest along the miles; and
groves; and the charm of water, falling. And everywhere the Statues of
Memory, and the Tablets of Memory; and the whole of that Great
Underground Country full of an echo of Eternity and of Memory and Love
and Greatness; so that to walk alone in that Land was to grow back to
the wonder and mystery of Childhood; and presently to go upwards again
to the Cities of the Mighty Pyramid, purified and sweetened of soul and
mind.

And in my boyhood, I have wandered oft a week of days in that Country of
Silence, and had my food with me, and slept quietly amid the memories;
and gone on again, wrapped about with the quiet of the Everlasting. And
the man-soul within would be drawn mightily to those places where the
Great Ones of the past Eternity of the World had their Memory named; but
there was that within me which ever drew me, in the ending, to the Hills
of the Babes; those little hills where might be heard amid the
lonesomeness of an utter quiet, a strange and wondrous echo, as of a
little child calling over the hills. But how this was I know not, save
by the sweet cunning of some dead Maker in the forgotten years.

And here, mayhaps by reason of this Voice of Pathos, were to be found
the countless Tokens of Memory to all the babes of the Mighty Pyramid,
through a thousand ages. And, odd whiles, would I come upon some
Mother, sitting there lonely, or mayhaps companied by others. And by
this little telling shall you know somewhat of the quietness and the
wonder and the holiness of that great Country hallowed to all Memory and
to Eternity and to our Dead.

And it was here, into the Country of Silence, that they brought down the
Dead to their Burial. And there came down into the Country of Silence,
maybe an Hundred Million, out of the Cities of the Pyramid, to be
present, and to do Honour.

Now they that had charge of the Dead, did lay them upon the road which
ran up unto The Gateway, even that same road which was named The Last
Road. And the Road moved upwards slowly with the Dead; and the Dead went
inward through The Gateway; first the poor Youths, and afterward they
that had given up life that they might save them.

And as the Dead went upwards, there was a very great Silence over all
the miles of the Country of Silence. But in a little while there came
from afar off, a sound as of a wind wailing; and it came onwards out of
the distance, and passed over the Hills of the Babes, which were a great
way off. And so came anigh to the place where I stood. Even as the
blowing of a sorrowful wind did it come; and I knew that all the great
multitudes did sing quietly; and the singing passed onwards, and left
behind it an utter silence; even as the wind doth rustle the corn, and
pass onwards, and all fall to a greater seeming quietness than before.
And the Dead passed inward through The Gateway, into the great light and
silence of the Dome; and came out no more.

And again from beyond the far Hills of the Babes there was that sound of
the millions singing; and there rose up out of the earth beneath, the
voices of the underground organs; and the noise of the sorrow passed
over me, and went again into the distance, and left all hushed.

And lo! as there passed inward to the silence of the Dome the last of
those dead Heroes, there came again the sound from beyond the Hills of
the Babes; and as it came more nigh, I knew that it was the Song of
Honour, loud and triumphant, and sung by countless multitudes. And the
Voices of the Organs rose up into thunder from the deep earth. And there
was a great Honour done to the glory of the Dead. And afterwards, once
more a silence.

Then did the Peoples of the Cities arrange themselves so that from every
city whence had come a Hero, were the People of that City gathered
together. And when they were so gathered, they set up Tokens of Memory
to the Dead of their City. But afterwards did charge Artists to the
making of sculpture great and beautiful to that same end; and now did
but place Tablets against that time.

And afterwards the People did wander over that Country of Silence, and
made visit and honour to their Ancestors, if such were deserving.

And presently, the mighty lifts did raise them all to the Cities of the
Pyramid; and thereafter there was something more of usualness; save that
ever the embrasures were full of those that watched the Youths afar upon
the Great Road. And in this place I to remember how that our spy-glasses
had surely some power of the Earth-Current to make greater the impulse
of the light upon the eye. And they were like no spy-glass that ever you
did see; but oddly shaped and to touch both the forehead and the eyes;
and gave wonderful sight of the Land. But the Great Spy-Glass to be
beyond all this; for it had the Eyes of it upon every side of The Mighty
Pyramid, and did be truly an Huge Machine.

And to me, as I went about my duties, or peered forth through the Great
Spy-Glass at the Youths upon the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, there
came at times a far faint thrilling of the aether; so that sometimes I
was aware that there was the beating of the Master-Word in the night;
but so strange and weak, that the Instruments had no wotting of it. And
when this came, then would I call back through all the everlasting night
to Naani, who was indeed Mirdath; and I would send the Master-Word with
my brain-elements; and afterwards such comfort as I might.

Yet hard and bitter was the truth of my helplessness and weakness, and
the utter terror and might of the Evil Forces and Monsters of the Night
Land. So that I was like to have brake my heart with pondering.

And the silence would come again; and anon the weak thrilling of the
Aether; but no more the far voice speaking in my soul.




V

INTO THE NIGHT LAND


Now, after that destruction which had come upon the Ten-thousand, and
the fresh assurance that was upon us of the terror of the Night Land, it
may be known that there could be no more thought to succour. Though, in
truth, those Youths that went now upon the Road Where The Silent Ones
Walk were far beyond our aid.

Yet might it be thought that we should have signalled to them, calling
by the Home-Call, which was that great Voice which went forth from the
Machine above the sealed base of the Mighty Pyramid. But this we might
not do; for then we gave signal to the Monsters of that Land, that some
were even now abroad from the Pyramid; yet we could no more than hope
that the Evil Forces had no wotting of them; for, in verity, none might
ever know the knowledge or the Ignorance which those Powers did possess.

Yet, it must be kept to the mind that we knew even then there was an
Influence abroad in the Land, strange and quiet; so that the Instruments
did not more than make record of it. And as I have surely set down ere
now, we had belief that it did come from that House of Silence, afar in
the Night Land, upon that low hill to the North of the Great Road. And
many among the Monstruwacans feared that it was directed upon the
Youths; but of this there could be no surety; and we could but wait and
watch.

Now, about this time those poor Youths did draw nigh to that part of the
Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, where it turned more swiftly to the
North; and they to be now at no mighty distance from that grim and
horrid House.

And presently we knew that the Influence had a greater Power in the
Land; and I had an assuredness that it came from the House; yet no
certain proof was this. But I set out my feelings to the Master
Monstruwacan; and he had trust in them and in my power; moreover, he
also had belief within himself that some secret Power came out from the
House of Silence.

And some talk there was at times that we send the Home-Call into the
night, to give warning to the Youths of our knowledge and our fear; and
to entreat them to make a safe endeavour to return swiftly. Yet was this
an error; and refused by the Master Monstruwacan; for it was not meet
that we put the souls of those Youths in peril, until such time as we
had certainty that they should be lost if we did not bestir ourselves.
For, indeed, this Home-Call was as a mighty Voice, calling over the
world, and did have so exceeding a noise, that it had immediately told
all that Land how that some were yet abroad from the Great Redoubt. And
here will I set down how that the Home-Call had no use in those ages;
but had been a Call in the olden time when yet the great flying-ships
went abroad over the world.

And there passed now a day and a night; and in all that time there
ceased not great multitudes to peer forth into the Night Land at the
Youths. For it was known concerning the Influence, and all felt that the
Youths did draw nigh very speedy to their fate; and much talk there was;
and many things said, and much foolish speech, and kind intent; but no
courage to go forth to make further attempt to rescue; which, in truth,
calls not for great astonishment, as I have surely writ or oft thought.

And in this place let me set down that the Land was, as it might be
said, waked, and unquiet, and a sense of things passing in the night,
and of horrid watchfulness; and there were, at this time and at that,
low roars that went across the Land. And if I have not told the same
before this time, it must be set to count against me and my telling;
for, indeed, I should have writ it down before this place. Yet is the
difficulty of my task great; and all must bear with me, and entreat for
me that I have courage, so that I may come at last to strength and
wisdom to tell all that I did see.

Now, in the space of this day and night, it was known that the Youths
had not slept, neither had they eaten, save once, as they who had the
watch through the Great Spy-Glass did affirm. But they to hasten alway
at a woeful speed towards the North, along that Great Dismal Road, so
that presently they must cease, or slay themselves with their endeavour.

And all this did give surety to our fears that they were under a spell
from that horrid House afar in the Land; and we had an assurance that
this thing was. For, presently, there came a Monstruwacan to the Master
Monstruwacan to report that there had come sudden a mighty Influence
into the Land; and in the same moment, as it might be, I spied through
the Great Spy-Glass, and did see those Youths break swiftly from the
Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, and begin to run very swift that they
might come quickly to the House of Silence.

Then did the Master Monstruwacan hesitate not; but did send the
Home-Call across the world, aye, even to those poor doomed ones that
hastened, unknowing, to the terror which did compel them. And
immediately upon the sound, the Master did send a message to the natural
eye, in set language, and made warning that they suffered themselves to
be drawn to their destruction by a Force that came from within the House
of Silence.

And he besought them to put forth the strength of their spirits, and do
battle for their souls; and if they could in no wise compass a victory
over _that which drew them onwards_, to slay themselves quickly, ere
they went into that House to the horror of utter destruction.

And in all the Pyramid was there a great silence; for the bellowing of
the Home-Call bred a quietness, because of that which it did portend;
and it was swiftly known by the millions that the Master Monstruwacan
did plead for the souls of the Youths; and there went forth,
unknowingly, a counter-force from the Mighty Pyramid, by reason of the
prayers and soul-wishings of the countless millions.

And the counter-force was plain to my inward hearing, and beat all the
aether of the world into a surge of supplication; so that it stunned my
spirit with the great power of it. And it seemed to me, as it were,
that there was a vast spiritual-noise in all the night; and I spied
tremblingly through the Great Spy-Glass, and lo! the Youths did cease
from their swift running, and were come together in a crowd, and had a
seeming to be confused; as might some who have waked suddenly from
sleep, to find that they walked in their sleep, and had come to a
strange place.

Then came there a great roar from all the millions that spied from the
embrasures--from nigh five hundred thousand embrasures they did look,
and I count not the great View-Tables. And the shouting rose up like to
the roaring of a mighty wind of triumph, yet was it over-early to sound
for victory. For the counter-force which came from the intensity of so
many wills blent to one intent, was brake, and the Evil Force which came
forth out of the House did draw the Youths again; so that they heeded
not their salvation; but turned once again to their running.

And the Mighty Pyramid was full of a shaken silence, and immediately of
lamentation and sorrow and horror at this thing. But in that moment
there did happen a fresh wonder; for there grew suddenly before those
poor Youths, billows of mist--as it had been of pure white fire, shining
very chill; yet giving no light upon them.

And the mist of cold fire stayed their way, so that we had knowledge
that there fought for the souls of them, one of those sweet Powers of
Goodness, which we had belief did strive to ward our spirits at all
times from those Forces of Evil and Destruction. And all the millions
saw the thing; but some with a great clearness, and many doubtful; yet
were all advanced more in spiritual sight and hearing than the normal
Peoples of this Age.

But of them all, none had the Night-Hearing, to know a soul having
speech in the aether half across the world. Yet, as I have said, some
there had been aforetime who were thus given the Hearing, even as was I.

And there came a Monstruwacan to the Master Monstruwacan to make report
that the Influence had ceased to work upon the Instruments; and by this
thing we knew that in verity the Force which proceeded out from the
House of Silence was cut off from us, and from those Youths; and we had
assurance that there fought a very mighty Power for the salvation of the
souls of the Youths.

And all the Peoples were silent, save for an underbreath of wonder and
talk; for all were utter stirred with hope and fear, perceiving that the
Youths had some chance given unto them to return.

And whilst the Youths yet wavered in their minds, as I perceived with
the Great Spy-Glass, and the knowledge of my soul, and of my natural
wit, lo! the Master Monstruwacan sent once more the great Voice of the
Home-Call abroad into the Land; and immediately besought those Youths
for the sake of their souls and the love which their Mothers had for
them, to come swiftly Homewards, whilst they had yet this great Power
to shield them, and allow them sweet sanity.

And I thought that some did look towards the Pyramid, as that they
answered to the mighty Voice of the Home-Call, and did read the message
which the Master Monstruwacan made to them. But in a moment they faced
about, seeming to have a good obedience to one who did always lead; and
of whom I had inquired, and found to be one named Aschoff, who was a
great athlete of the Nine-Hundredth-City. And this same Aschoff, out of
the boldness and bravery of his heart, did make, unwitting, to destroy
the souls of them all; for he went forward and leapt into the billows of
the bright shining fire that made a Barrier in the way of their
Destruction.

And immediately the fire ceased from its shining, and gave way and sank
and grew to a nothingness; and Aschoff of the Nine-Hundredth-City began
again to run towards the House of Silence; and all they that were with
him, did follow faithfully, and ceased not to run.

And they came presently to the low Hill whereon was that horrid House;
and they went up swiftly--and they were two hundred and fifty, and
wholesome of heart, and innocent; save for a natural waywardness of
spirit.

And they came to the great open doorway that "hath been open since the
Beginning," and through which the cold steadfast light and the
inscrutable silence of Evil "hath made for ever a silence that may be
felt in all the Land." And the great, uncased windows gave out the
silence and the light--aye, the utter silence of an unholy desolation.

And Aschoff ran in through the great doorway of silence, and they that
followed. And they nevermore came out or were seen by any human.

And it must be known that the Mothers and the Fathers of those Youths
looked out into the Night Land, and saw that thing which came to pass.

And all the people were silent; but some said presently that the Youths
would come forth again; yet the people knew in their hearts that the
young men had gone in to Destruction; for, in truth, there was that in
the night which spoke horror to the souls of all, and a sudden utter
quiet in all the Land.

But unto me (that had the Night-Hearing) there came a great Fear of that
which might be whispered into my spirit, out of the Quietness of the
night--of the agony of those young men. Yet there came no sound, to the
hearing of the soul; neither then nor in all the years that were to
come; for, in verity, had those Youths passed into a Silence of which
the heart cannot think.

And here will I tell how that the strange Quiet which did fill all the
Land, seeming to brood within the night, was horrid beyond all the
roarings which had passed over the darkness in the time that went
before; so that it had given my spirit some rest and assurance to hear
but the far-echoing, low thunder of the Great Laughter, or the whining
which was used at times to sound in the night from the South-East, where
were the Silver-fire Holes that opened before the Thing that Nods. Or
the Baying of the Hounds, or the Roaring of the Giants, or any of those
dreadful sounds that did often pass through the night. For they could
not have offended me as did that time of silence; and so shall you judge
how dreadful was that quiet, which did hold so much of horror.

And surely it will be known that none had thinkings now, even in idle
speech, that any should have power to succour the Peoples of the Lesser
Redoubt. Neither, as I have said, had any the knowledge of the place
where it did stand.

And so was it made plain that those Peoples must suffer and come
unhelped and alone to their end; which was a sad and dreadful thought to
any. Yet had those within the Great Pyramid come already to much sorrow
and calamity because that some had made attempt in this matter. And
there had been for gain, only failure, and the sorrow of Mothers, and
the loneliness of Wives, and of kin. And now this dread horror upon us,
which concerned those lost Youths.

Now, as may be conceived, this _sure knowledge_ that we might give no
succour to the People of the Lesser Redoubt, weighed heavy upon my
heart; for I had, maybe with foolishness, held vague hopes and wonders
concerning our power to make expedition secretly into the Night, to
discover that Lesser Pyramid, and rescue those poor thousands; and above
all, as may be thought, had I the thought of that sweet moment in which
I should step forward out of the night and all mystery and terror, and
put forth mine arms to Naani, saying: "I am That One." And knowing, in
my soul, that she that had been mine in that bygone Eternity, should
surely know me upon the instant; and call out swiftly, and come swiftly,
and be again unto me in that age, even as she had been in this.

And to think upon it, and to know that this thing should never be; but
that, even in that moment of thought, she that had been mine in these
olden days of sweetness, might be even then suffering horror in the
Power of some foul Monster, was like a kind of madness; so that nearly I
could seize the Diskos, and run forth unprepared into the evil and
terror of the Night Land, that I should make one attempt to come to that
Place where she abode, or else to cast off my life in the attempt.

And oft did I call to Naani; and always I sent the Master-Word beating
through the night, that she might have assurance that it was indeed I
that did speak unto her spirit, and no foul thing or Monster, spelling
evil and lies unto her.

And oft did I make to instruct her that never should she be tempted
forth from the shelter of that Redoubt in which she did live, by any
message out of the night; but always to await the Master-Word; and,
moreover, to have a sure knowledge that none that was her Friend would
ever seek to entice her into the night.

And this way and that way would I speak with Naani, sending my words
silently with my brain-elements; yet was it doleful and weariful and
dreadful always to have speech into the dark, and never to hear the
answering beat of the Master-Word, and the sweet, faint voice whispering
within my soul. Yet, once and again, would I have knowledge that the
aether did thrill about me, weakly, and to mine inward hearing it would
seem that the Master-Word did beat faintly in the night; and thereafter
would my heart have a little comfort, in that I had assurance, of a
kind, that the love-maid of my memory-dreams did still live.

And constant, I put forth my soul to hark; so that my health failed me,
with the effort of my harking; and I would chide my being, that I had
not a wiser control; and so make a fight to do sanely.

Yet, day by day, did my heart grow more weary and restless; for, indeed,
it did seem that life was but a very little matter, against so great a
loss as my heart did feel to suffer.

And oft, at this time and that, did there come a Voice speaking plainly
out of the night, and did purport to be the voice of Naani; but ever I
did say the Master-Word unto the Voice, and the Voice had no power by
which it could make the one answer. Yet I jeered not at the Voice, to
show contempt of its failing to bewit me; but let the matter bide; and
the Voice would be silent a time; and again would make a calling unto
me; but never did I make speech with it (for therein lies the danger to
the soul), but always did speak the Master-Word to its silencing; and
thereafter would shut the thing from my memory, and think only upon
sweet and holy matters, as it might be Truth and Courage, but more often
of Naani, which was both sweet and holy to my spirit and heart and
being.

And so it was as I have set down, there were Monsters without in the
Night that did torment me; having, it may be, intent to lure me unto
destruction; or indeed it doth chance that they had no hope but to
plague me with malice.

And, as may be thought, all this considering of my trouble, and the
giving of my strength unto Naani through the night of the world, that
she might have comfort and help, did work upon me; so that I grew thin,
plainly to the eye of those that loved me.

And the Master Monstruwacan, he that did love me, as I were his son,
chid me gently, and had wise speech with me; so that I but loved him the
more, yet without having gain of health; for my heart destroyed me, as
it doth if love be held back and made always to weep.

And it may be thought strange that my Mother and my Father did not talk
also with me; but I had neither Mother nor Father those many years; and
this thing I should have set down early; so that none should waste
thought pondering to no end. But the blame is to my telling.

Now, concerning my love-trouble, there did happen a certain thing which
gave me to decide; for one night I waked from a sore troubled sleep, and
it did seem that Naani did call my name, mine olden love name, and in a
voice of utter anguish and with beseeching. And I sat up in the bed, and
sent the Master-Word into the Night, with my brain-elements; and
presently all about me there was the solemn beat of the Master-Word,
answering; but weak, and gone faint, that scarce I might hear it.

And I called again with my brain-elements unto Naani, that was Mirdath;
and spoke to give her assurance, and to haste to tell unto me that which
was so wrong and pitiful with her. And who shall be amazed that I was
shaken with the eagerness of my spirit, in that it was so long since
Naani had spoken clear within my soul; and now behold, her voice.

Yet, though I did call many a time unto the everlasting night, there
came no more the voice of Naani, speaking strangely within my spirit;
but only at times a weak thrilling of the aether about me.

And, at the last I grew maddened with the sorrow of this thing, and the
sense and knowledge of harm about the maid; and I stood upright upon my
feet, and I raised my hands, and gave word and honour unto Naani through
all the blackness of the night, that I would no more abide within the
Mighty Pyramid to my safety, whilst she, that had been mine Own through
Eternity, came to horror and destruction by the Beasts and Evil Powers
of that Dark World. And I gave the word with my brain-elements, and bade
her to be of heart; for that until I died I would seek her. But out of
the Darkness there came naught but the silence.

Then I clothed me swiftly, and went up quickly to the Tower of
Observation, that I might speak instant with the Master Monstruwacan;
for my heart burned in me to intention, and to be doing speedily that
which I had set upon myself to do.

And I came to the Master Monstruwacan, and told all to him; and how that
I did mean no more to suffer in quiet and to no end; but to make
adventure into the Night Land, that I find Naani, or perchance find a
swift peace from this my long troubling.

Now, when the Master Monstruwacan heard that which I had to say, it sat
heavily upon him, and he besought me long and many times that I refrain
from this thing; for that none might achieve so great a task; but that I
should be lost in my Youth before many days were gone by. Yet to all his
speech I said naught, save that this thing was laid upon me, and even as
I had promised, so should I make to act.

And in the ending, the Master Monstruwacan perceived that I was set to
this thing, and not to be moved; and he did put it to me how that I had
grown to leanness, with so much troubling, and that I should have wisdom
to wait awhile, that I put on my full strength.

But even as I was, so would I go; and this I told to him, gently; and
showed how that the thing was meet and helpful to the safety of my soul;
for that my strength was still in me; yet was I sweeter in spirit
because that I stood lean and pure, and much poor dross and littleness
had been burned from me; so that fear was not in me. And all do I lay to
the count of my love, which doth purify and make sweet and fearless the
human heart.

And because I was even as I have said, so was I the less in trouble of
the Forces of Evil; for long and sore had been my Preparation of Spirit;
and I wot that none had ever gone forth into the Darkness, so long
withholden from that which doth weaken and taint the spirit.

And here let me set down how that the Three Days of Preparation, which
were Proper to those that willed to go forth into the Night Land, had
for their chief aim the cleansing of the spirit; so that the Powers of
Evil did have a less ableness to harm.

But also it was, as I have said, that none should go forth in ignorance
of the full dreadfulness of all that held the Night; for it was at the
Preparation that there was made known certain horrors that were not told
unto the young; and of horrid mutilations, and of abasements of the
soul, that did shake the heart with fear, if but they were whispered
into the hearing. And these things were not set down in any book that
might be lightly come by; but were warded and safe locked by the Master
of The Preparation, in the Room of Preparation.

And, indeed, when I did hear that which presently I was to hear, I had
wonder in my heart that ever any went out into the Night Land; or that
ever the Room of Preparation should have other than Students that meant
not to go forth, but only to achieve some knowledge of that which hath
been done, and mayhaps shall be once again.

Yet, in verity, is this but the way of the human heart; and hath always
been, and will be so in all the years, for ever. For to adventure is the
lust of Youth; and to leave Safety is the natural waywardness of the
spirit; and who shall reprove or regret; for it were sorrowful that this
Spirit of Man should cease. Yet must it not be thought that I do uphold
fightings to the death or to mutilation, _between man and man_; but
rather do sorrow upon this thought.

Now, when the morrow came, if thus I shall speak of that which was
outwardly even as the night, though changing alway within the Mighty
Pyramid, I went unto the Room of Preparation; and the Door was closed
upon me; and I underwent the Full Preparation; that I might have full
power and aid to come to success through all the terror of the Night
Land.

And three days and three nights did I abide within the Room of
Preparation; and upon the fourth day was mine armour brought unto me;
and the Master of the Preparation stood away from me, silent and with
sorrow upon his face; but touching me not, neither coming anigh to aid
me; nor having any speech with me; for none might crowd upon me, or
cause me to answer.

And, presently, was I clad with the grey armour; and below the armour a
close-knit suit of special shaping and texture, to have the shape of the
armour, and that I might not die by the cold of the Night Land. And I
placed upon me a scrip of food and drink, that might keep the life
within me for a great time, by reason of its preparation; and this lay
ready to me, with the armour, and was stitched about with the Mark of
Honour; so that I knew loving women thus to speed me.

And when all was done and made ready, I took up the Diskos, and bowed in
silence to the Master of the Preparation; and he went towards the door,
and opened it; and signalled that the People stand back; so that I might
go forth untouched. And the People stood back; for many had crowded to
the door of the Room of Preparation, so that I knew how that my story
must be to the heart of all, in all the Cities of the Great Redoubt; for
to come unbidden anigh that Door was against the Lesser Law, and that
any erred in this matter, betokened much.

And I went out through the Door; and there was a mighty lane of people
unto the Great Lift. And about the Great Lift, as I went downwards, did
the countless millions stand; and all in a great silence; but having
dear sympathy in their souls; yet loyal unto my safety, in that none in
all the Mighty Pyramid did make speech unto me, or call out aught. And
as I went downward through the miles, lo! all the aether of the world
seemed to be surged with the silent prayers and speedings of those quiet
multitudes.

And I came at last unto the Great Gate; and behold the dear Master
Monstruwacan did stand in full armour, and with the Diskos, to do me
honour, with the Full Watch, as I went forth. And I looked at him,
quietly, and he looked unto me, and I bent my head to show respect; and
he made silent salute with the Diskos; and afterwards I went onwards
towards the Great Gateway.

And they made dim the lights in the Great Causeway, that there should no
glare go forth into the Land, when the Gate was opened; and behold, they
opened not the lesser gate within the greater, for me; but did honour my
journey, in that they swung wide the Great Gate itself, through which a
monstrous army might pass. And there was an utter silence all about the
Gate; and in the hushed light the two thousand that made the Full Watch,
held up each the Diskos, silently, to make salute; and humbly, I held up
the Diskos reversed, and went forward into the Dark.




VI

THE WAY THAT I DID GO


Now I went forward for a space, and took heed not to look backwards; but
to be strong of heart and spirit; for that which did lie before me had
need of all my manhood and courage of soul, that I come to the succour
of that Maid afar in the darkness of the World, or meet my death proper,
as it might need to be.

And thus did I go forward steadfastly, and conscious in all my being of
the emotions of that parting from my mighty Home, and of the tenderness
and wiseness that did underlie so much curbed rule and guidance.

And my heart was warm towards the Master Monstruwacan for that great
honour, that he should come downward in armour to make one with the Full
Watch, that he might uphold me to a lofty spirit at the moment of my
going.

And all that time as I went forward, was the aether of the night about
me, in tumult with the thoughts and blind wishings of the great millions
I had but now left to my back.

And, presently, as I steadied somewhat upon my emotions, I was conscious
of the exceeding coldness of the night air, and of the different taste
of it upon my lungs and in the mouth; and it had, as it were, a wondrous
keen sharping upon my palate, and did fill the lips more in the
breathing; so that it may be supposed it had more body within it than
that air which did fill the plateau of the Thousandth City where was my
home; for the air of every City was of difference, and the greater
between one that was afar up and another nigh to the earth, as may be
thought; so that many Peoples did migrate unto that level which gave
them best healthfulness; but under rule, and with a guidance of
quantities. And not all that were lacking of health; for, some are ever
contrary.

And here let me set down that, within the deeps of the Fields, there was
air utter varied and wonderful, that might charm one here and likewise
sorrow another that were happier elsewhere; so that all might have
suiting, did they but wander, and have Reason to companion them.

And thus did I go forward, full of new thoughts and olden memories, and
fresh-breaking wonders; neither forgetting something of doubts and fears
more than a little. And again was it most cunning strange to be out
there in the Night Land--though not yet afar--where often had my fancies
and imaginings led me; yet until that time never had I touched foot, in
all that life, upon the outward earth. And this must be a wondrous
quaint seeming thought to those of this present day.

And so came I, at last, nigh to the Circle that did go about the
Redoubt; and presently I was come to it; and something astonished was I
that it had no great bigness; for I had looked for this by _reasoning_;
having always a mind to picture things as they might be truly, and hence
coming sometimes to the wonder of a great truth; but odd whiles to
errors that others had not made. And now, lo! I did find it but a small,
clear tube that had not two inches of thickness; yet sent out a very
bright and strong light, so that it seemed greater to the eye, did one
but behold from a distance.

And this is but a little thing to set to the telling; yet may it give
something of the newness of all; and, moreover, shall you have memory
with me in this place, how that oft had I seen Things and Beast-Monsters
peer over that same little tube of light, their faces coming forward out
of the night.

And this had I seen as child and man; for as children, we did use to
keep oft a watch by hours upon an holiday-time, through the great
glasses of the embrasures. And we did always hope each to be that one
that should first discover a monster looking inwards upon the Mighty
Pyramid, across the shining of the Circle. And these to come oft; yet
presently to slink away into the night; having, in verity, no liking for
that light.

And pride had we taken of ourselves to perceive those monsters which had
most of ugliness and horror to commend them; for, thereby did we stand
to have won the game of watching, until such time as a more fearsome
Brute be discovered. And so went the play; yet with ever, it doth seem
to me now, something of a half-known shudder to the heart, and a child's
rejoicing unknowingly in that safety which had power to make light the
seeming of such matters.

And this, also, is but a small matter; yet doth it bear upon the
inwardness of my feelings; for the memories of all my youth and of the
many Beasts that I had seen to peer across the Light, did come upwards
in my mind in that moment; so that I did give back a little, unthinking
of what I did; but having upon me the sudden imagining of that which
might come out of the Dark, beyond.

And I to stand a little moment, and presently had grown free in my heart
to have courage of farewell; and so did turn me at last to the viewing
of that wondrous Home of the Last Millions of this World. And the sight
was an astonishment and an uplifting, that indeed there was so mighty a
thing in all the earth.

And well might be that there were Monsters and Forces gathered together
about that Hill of Life, out of all the Darkness of the World; for the
thing was as a Mighty Mountain that went up measureless into the night;
and spread out upon the earth to the right and to the left of me, so
that it did seem to hold all the world with its might.

And in the nearer slope were there three hundred thousand great
embrasures, as well I did know; there being in all the four sides of the
Redoubt, twelve hundred thousand embrasures, as was set out in the books
of the schools, and upon the cover of Atlas-books as they still quaintly
to be called, and many another place, as might be supposed.

And half a mile upward was the lowest tier of those great window-places,
and above that, countless other tiers. And a great light came out from
them into the darkness; so that I looked up into the night many miles,
and yet did see them in shining rows; and did make separate each
embrasure from its fellow for a great way. But there grew yet more,
above in the mighty distance, so that they were lost in the upward space
of the night, and did seem to me presently but as a constant, glimmering
fire, that did shape a shining Peak into the blackness of the heavens,
dwindling into the utmost height. And thus was that Everlasting
Monument.

Then did it come to me that those little things, which I did see to
cluster against the embrasures, were in truth the countless millions of
the Mighty Redoubt; and this I could make out with some plainness in
those lower embrasures, which were the more near to me than they above;
for the Peoples were set against the light within, yet were as small
things like unto insects, in that distance, and within so Huge a Bulk.

And I knew that they looked out upon me, and did watch through their
spy-glasses. And I sent my gaze upwards again along that great Slope of
grey metal, aye! upward again to where it strode glimmering into the
Blackness, and so at last to the little star that did crown that Wonder
of the World in the eternal night. And, for a little, I did stare
towards that far light; for it came from within that Tower of
Observation, where so lately I had spended my life; and I had knowledge
within my heart that the dear Master Monstruwacan did bend the Great
Spy-Glass upon me, through which so oft had I spied. And I raised the
Diskos unto him, in salutation and farewell, though I saw him not at all
through that vast space.

And my heart was very full; yet my soul but the stronger for it. And
then, behold, I was aware of a murmur in the night, coming to me, dim
and from afar off; and I saw the little shapes of the Peoples in the
lower embrasures, in constant movement; and I knew upon the instant that
the Multitudes did take that salute unto themselves, and cried out and
waved to me their farewells, or to come back--as may be.

And, indeed, I was but a lonesome person looking up at that great
mountain of metal and Life. And I knew that I had danger to realise my
plight; and I stayed no more; but did raise the Diskos, reversed, as was
but meet from one young man unto all the Millions.

And I looked swiftly upward through those eight great miles of night,
unto that Final Light which did shine in the black heavens; so that my
friend should know that I thought of him that was beyond my sight, in
that last moment. And it may be that the invisible millions that were
far up in the night, in the Upper Cities, did take that also to be a
meaning of farewell to themselves; for there came down out of the
monstrous height, a far, faint murmur of sound, as of a vague wind up in
the night.

Then did I lower the Diskos, and turn me about. And I breasted strangely
against the Air Clog, and stept forward across the Circle, into the
lonesomeness of the Night Land. And I looked no more behind; for that
which was my Home did weaken my heart somewhat, to behold; so that I
made determination that I look not again to my back, for a great while.

Yet, about me as I went, there was constant surging in the aether of the
world; and it did tell unto me how that those, my people and kin, had
continual mind of me, both in prayer and wishings, and in a perpetual
watching. And the same gave to me a feeling as of being something
companied; yet, in a time, it came to me that this disturbance of the
aether should tell to some Evil Force how that I was there abroad in the
Land. But how to stop this thing, who should have power? For, of truth,
had I been among them to make a full explaining of the danger, they had
been yet powerless to cease; for but to have such great multitudes
a-think upon one matter, was to set a disturbance about, as should be
most clear to all.

Now, at the beginning, I did walk outwards into the Night Land, somewhat
blindly, and without sure direction; being intent only to put a good
space to my back, that I might cure somewhat the ache which did weaken
my heart at the first.

But, in awhile, I ceased somewhat from my overswiftness, and did put
thought to my going. And I came quickly to reason that I should try a
new way through the Land; for it might be that there was an
over-watchfulness in that part which had been trod by the Youths.

And I began therewith to set this thought to the practice; and went not
direct towards the North; but to the North and West; and so in the end
to mean to circle around to the back of the North-West Watcher, and
thence to the North of the Plain Of Blue Fire; and afterwards, as might
be, have a true and straightway to the North; and by this planning come
a long way clear of that House of Silence, which did put more fear upon
me than all else that was horrid in the Land.

Yet, as all will see, this made to me a greater journey; though, in
verity, it were better to go slowly and win to success, than to make a
greater haste towards Destruction; which was, indeed, surely to be mine
end, did I not go warily.

Now it may be thought upon with wonder, that I did go so assuredly to
the North; but I went thiswise, part by an inward Knowing, and part come
upon by much latter studying, within the Pyramid, of olden books; and by
reasoning upon all things that I did observe, that had seemings of
verity in them.

And because of this constant searching upon one matter, I had come, but
a while back, upon a little book of metal, very strange and ancient,
that had lain forgot in a hid place in the Great Library through ten
hundred thousand years, maybe, or less or more, for all that I had
knowing.

And much that was writ in the book was common knowledge, and set mostly
to the count of fairy-tales and suchlike, even as we of this our age
take not over-surely any belief in Myths of olden times. Yet had I
always much liking for such matters, perceiving behind that outer shell
which did win always so much unbelief, the kernel of ancient truths and
happenings.

And thus was it, concerning this little book which I had made discovery
of; for it told again, that which oft I had heard (even as we in this
age, read of the Deluge) how that once, in a time monstrous far back
from that, but utter future to this age of ours, the world did brake
upwards in a vast earth-quaking, that did rend the world for a thousand
miles.

And there came a mighty chasm, so deep that none might see the bottom
thereof; and there rushed therein an ocean, and the earth did burst
afresh with a sound that did shake all the cities of the world; and a
great mist lay upon the earth for many days, and there was a mighty
rain.

And, indeed, this was just so set in certain Histories of the Ancient
World. Also, there was made reference to it, within some olden Records.
Yet nowise to be taken with a serious mind, to the seeming of the
peoples of the Mighty Pyramid; but only as a quaint study for the
Students, and to be set out in little tales that did entertain the
nurseries; or, as it might be, wise men and the general.

Yet, there was this, about that small and peculiar book, that it did
speak of many of these things, as it were that it did quote from the
pens of those that did have actual witness; and set all out with a
strange gravity, that did cause one to consider it as meant to be indeed
the tellings of Truth, and to seem thiswise to have great difference
from all that I had read before concerning those matters.

And there was, further, a part in the ending of the book, that did seem
to be writ of a time that came afterwards, maybe an hundred thousand,
and maybe a million years; but who shall say.

And therein it did tell of an huge and mighty Valley that did come out
of the West, towards the South-East, and made turning thence Northwards,
and was a thousand miles both ways. And the sides thereof were an
hundred miles deep, and the Sun did stand in the Western end, and made a
red gloom for a thousand miles. And in the bottom there were great seas;
and beasts strange and awesome, and very plentiful.

Now this, as may be seen, was as the talk of Romance; yet did I turn my
wits to their natural end, and made thus plain of it. For, in truth, I
to have something of belief, and it to seem to me that in a bygone
Eternity, when the world was yet light, as in my heart I knew to have
been indeed a thing of verity, there was a great and wondrous
earthquake.

And the earthquake did burst the world up, along a certain great curve
where it had weakness; and there fell into the yawning furnace of the
world, one of the great oceans; and immediately made of itself steam,
and so brake upwards again, and tore the earth mightily in its swift
uprising.

And thereafter there was a mist and confusion and rain upon the world.
And, indeed, all very seemly put; and not to be taken as a light tale.

Then, in that ending of the book, there was one that did write, having
lived in a vast later age, when the Sun had come anigh to his dying, and
the upward earth was grown quiet and cold and not good to live upon. And
in that time the Mighty Chasm had been calmed by the weight of an
Eternity, so that it was now a most deep and wondrous Valley, that did
hold Seas and great Hills and Mountains; and in it were great forests of
kinds, and Lands that were good and healthful; and Places given over to
Fire, and to Steamings, and Sulphur Clouds; so that they held Poisons
that had ill for Man.

And Great Beasts were there down in that far depth, that none might see
ever, save by a strong spy-glass. And such there were in the Early
World, and had now been bred in the Ending by those inward forces of
Nature which did make the Valley a place of Good Warmth; so that there
was, as it were, once more the Primal World born to give new birth unto
such olden Monsters, and to others, new and Peculiar to that Age and
Circumstance.

And all this, indeed, did the book give also; but constrained and
difficult to take clearly to the heart, and not like to the wise plain
speech of the early tellings; so that I must even set it out here in
mine own speech.

And it did seem to me, by my reading, that Man had come at one time to a
great softness of Heart and Spirit through many ages of over-ease. But
that the World did come to coldness and unfriendliness, by reason of the
Sun's slow ceasing.

And there was presently, in naturalness, a Race upon the earth that were
hardy, and made to fight for their lives; and did perceive that the
Mighty Valley that cut the World in twain, was a place of Warmth and
Life; and so did make to adventure their bodies down that wondrous
Height; and were many Ages coming safe to the Bottom; but did find safe
places in the downward way where they built them Houses, and made to
live, and begot them children; and these grew up to that life of
constant and great climbings, and of hard workings upon The Road, which
was the One Intent of that People; so that the book did speak of them
always as The Road Makers.

And thus did they make downwards through the long years and the ages;
and many generations did live and die, and saw not the reaching of the
Road down into that Great Vale that lay so monstrous deep in the World.

But in the end they did come there with the Road; and they were very
Hardy; and they did fight with the Monsters and slay many; and they
built them many Cities, through great years in the Mighty Valley, and
did make the Road from City unto City along that Great Valley, even unto
the Bight of the Valley. And they found here a constant darkness and
Shadow; for that the Sun could not make a shining around that Great
Corner. Yet, even here they ceased not to make the Road; but took it
around, and a mighty way unto the North; passing it among strange Fires
and Pits that burned from out of the earth.

But there was presently, such a power and horror of Monsters and Evil
Things in that Valley of Shadow, that the Road Makers were made to go
Backwards into the Red Light which did fill the Westward Valley, and
came from that low Sun.

And they went back unto their Cities; and lived there mayhaps an hundred
thousand years; and grew wise and cunning in all matters; and their Wise
People did make dealings and had experiment with those Forces which are
Distasteful and Harmful unto Life; but they did this in Ignorance; for
all that they had much wisdom; thinking only to Experiment, that they
come to greater knowings. But they did open a way for those Forces; and
much harm and Pity did come thereby. And then had all People to have
Regret; yet too late.

Now, presently, when an hundred thousand years had gone, or it may be a
greater space; there came slowly the utter twilight of the world, as the
sun to die the more; so that presently it gave but an utter gloomy
light. And there grew upon many of the Peoples of the Cities of the
Valley, a strangeness and a wildness; so that strange things were done,
that had been shameful to all in the Light. And there were wanderings,
and consortings with strange outward beings, and presently, many Cities
were attacked by monsters that did come from the West; and there was a
Pandemonium.

Then was an Age of Sorrows and Fightings, and Hardenings of the Spirit
and of the Heart, for all that were of good Fibre; and this did breed a
Determined Generation; and there grew up into the World a Leader; and he
took all the sound Millions; and did make a mighty Battle upon all
Foulness and upon all that did harm and trouble them; and they drove
their Enemies down the Valley, and up the Valley, and did utterly
scatter and put them to flight.

Then did that Man call all his Peoples together; and did make it plain
how that the Darkness grew upon the World, and that the Foul and
dreadful Powers abroad, were like to be more Horrid when a greater Gloom
came.

And he put to them that they Build a Mighty Refuge; and the Peoples did
acclaim; and lo! there was built, presently, a Great House. But the
Great House was not Proper; and that Man did take all the Peoples to
Wander; and they came to the Bight; and there was built at last that
Great and Mighty Pyramid.

Now this is the sense and telling of that book; and but late had I read
it; and talked somewhat of it with my dear friend, the Master
Monstruwacan; but not overmuch; for I had taken so sudden a mind to GO,
that all else had dropped from about me. Yet, to us it did seem clear
that there was no life in all the invisible upper world; and that,
surely, that Great Road whereon the Silent Ones did walk, must be that
same Road which the hardy Peoples of that age did make.

And it did seem wise to the Master Monstruwacan, and unto me, that if
any should find the Lesser Redoubt, they must surely do so somewhere
within the mighty Valley; but whether The Road that led into the West,
where was the Place of the Ab-humans, should bring me to it, I had no
knowing; nor whether it might lie on the Northward way. And I, maybe, to
wander a thousand miles wrong; if, in truth, I were not into some
dreadful trouble before.

And, indeed, no reason of value was there to give me hope that the
Lesser Pyramid lay either to the West, or where the Road went
North-ward, beyond the House of Silence. Yet I did so feel it to be
somewhere to the North, that I had made a determination to search that
way for a great distance, the first; and if I could not come upon aught,
then I should have sober thought that it did lie Westward. But in the
Valley someways, I had feeling of assurance that it must be; for it was
plain that the telling of the book was sound in its bottom sense; as
might be seen; for how should any live in the utter bleak and deadly
chill of the silent upper world that lay an hundred miles up in the
night, hid and lost for ever.

And strange is it to think of those wondrous and mighty cliffs that
girt us about, and yet were fast held from us in the dark; so that I
had not known of them, save for the telling of that book; though, in
truth, it had been always supposed that we lived in a great deep of the
world; but, indeed, it was rather held in belief that we abode in the
bed of some ancient sea, that did surely slope gradual away from us, and
not go up abrupt and savage.

And here let me make so clear as I may that the general peoples had no
clear thought upon any such matters; though there was something of it
taught in the schools; yet rather this and that, of diverse conclusions,
as it might be thinkings of the Teachers, after much study, and some
ponderings. For one man, having a lack of imagining, would scoff, and
another, maybe, to take it very staidly, but some would build Fancy upon
the tellings of the Records, and make foolish and fantastic that which
had groundings in Truth; and thus is it ever. But to the most Peoples of
the Pyramid, there was no deep conviction nor thought of any great hid
World afar in the darkness. For they gave attention and belief only to
that which lay to their view; nor could a great lot come to imagine that
there had been ever any other Condition.

And to them, it did seem right and meet that there should be strange
things, and fires from the earth, and an ever-abiding night, and
monsters, and matters hid and tangled much in mystery.

And very content were the most of them; though some had in them the
yeast of imaginings, or the pimples of fancy upon them, and to these
there seemed many possibilities; though the first to read out to sanity;
and the second, to expect and have speech towards much that was foolish
or to no purpose.

And of these vague believings of the peoples, have I made hint before,
and need not have much trouble to it now. Save that, with the children,
as is ever the way, those olden tales had much believing; and the
simplicity of the Wise did mate with the beliefs of the Young; and
between them did lie the Truth.

And so did I make speed towards the North, having a strong surety in my
heart and mind that there were but two ways to my search; for without of
the Valley, afar up in the dead lonesomeness of the hidden world, was a
cold that was shapen ready to Death, and a lacking, as I must believe,
of the sweet, needful air that yet did lie in plenty in that deep place
of the earth. So that, surely, the mighty Valley somewheres to hold that
other Redoubt.

Yet, as I have said, I went not direct to my journey, but otherwise, for
those sound reasons which I did set down a time back.




VII

THE NIGHT LAND


Now, as I went towards the North and West, I steered me warily for a
great while, that I come safe of that Great Watcher of the North-West.
And as I made forward, I put thought to all matters which must concern
me; so far as I had imagining to see. And first I did consider the speed
that I should keep; and found presently that I did well to be moderate;
for that I had before me a great and mighty journey; and indeed, who
might speak knowingly of the end thereof?

And another matter, I did arrange; for I would make the times of my
goings forward, and the times of mine eatings and sleepings all to a
wise and regular fashion; that, thereby, I might go a great way, with
the less harm to my body; so that I should be strong when the need did
come for my strength. And I made in the end that I should eat and drink,
at every sixth hour, and at the eighteenth hour sleep me until the
twenty-fourth.

And by this means did I eat thrice in that time, and have six hours of
sleep. And this seemed very good to me, and I did strive always to
manage thus in all my great journeying in the Night Land. Yet, as may be
supposed, there were times oft and many when I must watch without
ceasing, and leave my slumber unto the future; for the Land was full of
grim and dreadful Perils.

And, as doth be human, I brake my rule straightway in the beginning; for
I ceased not to walk for one-and-twenty hours, hiding and creeping, as
the need did be in those places that were like to show me unto the
Watcher; and when I did think upon food, it did sicken me; so that I
would eat by and by, as I made it within my thoughts.

But when one-and-twenty hours had gone, I grew very weary and something
faint; and was forced that I look about for some place where I might
have rest. And, in a little while, I did see, away off, a small
fire-hole, the like of which I had passed odd times even so early. And I
made to come nigh to that part; for there would be warmth from the
chill of the Night Land, and mayhaps a place dry and convenient to my
slumber.

And when I came anigh, I saw that it was a cheerful place, as it might
be said, amid so much gloom; for the hole was but a few paces wide, and
full of a dull, glowing fire, that did bubble somewhat, and throw off a
small sulphur-smoke. And I sat me down, at no great way, and did place
the Diskos on the rock to my hand.

And I moved not, awhile; but was aweary, so that I had not the courage
to eat, neither to drink; but must turn me and look back to the Mighty
Pyramid; and, in truth, though I had come a very good space, yet was I
so anigh to it, that I was both cheered and put out of heart; for it did
seem close upon me, by reason of its greatness, so that I, who had
journeyed a hard and weariful way, was shaken with the greatness of the
task that was upon me.

Yet was this but one side of my heart; for it was good to feel the
nearness of my Mighty Home; and I knew that there did countless millions
make watch upon me, as I sat; yet did I make no sign; for it is not meet
to make a constant farewell; but to GO. Yet was it very strange to be
thus near, and to show such behaviour as were proper to one afar from
all humanity. But so it was that I ordered my ways; for it did seem
proper to me; yet was I happy to know that the dear Master Monstruwacan
must, time and oft, have spied upon me through the Great Spy-Glass; and
mayhaps did watch me in that moment.

And it grew in me that I did act weakly to hold off from mine Vittles,
and showed foolishness before my kind friend afar; and I did ope my
scrip, and take therefrom three tablets, the which I chewed and did eat;
for this was a strong food, treated that it had but small bulk. Yet were
they not filling to the belly; and I made that I would drink well, that
I might feel that something was therein.

And to this end, I shook from a strong and especial tube, a dust; and I
caught the dust within a little cup; and the air did make an action upon
that dust, as it were of chemistry; and the dust did boil and make a
fizzing in the cup, and rose up and filled it with a liquid that was of
simple water; yet very strange to see come that way; but ordinary after
a time.

And in this way, as might be seen, had I such food and drink in but a
little scrip, that might keep life within me for a great time. Yet was
it a way of discomfort, and lacking to the mouth and to the belly; but a
sufficient thing unto the need of the body, and good matter for a
thankful heart, in that dark and hungry Land.

Now, when I had eaten, I did go over in their order, those things which
I did carry; for there was, beside the Diskos and that scrip of food, a
pouch that did contain matters various. And these, I did look into; and
afterward did take out a small compass that I had been give by the
Master Monstruwacan, so that I might find of its workings without the
Great Redoubt; and, he had said unto me, that it might be that I should
pass far off into the Night Land, and lose the Mighty Pyramid amid so
great a Country and so plentiful a Darkness. Then, perchance, if that
ancient principle did still lurk within the machine, though turned no
more to the North, but unto the Pyramid, then should it guide my feet
Homeward out of the Everlasting Night, and thus have once more that
ancient use which, as I do know, is common unto this age.

And this was a very cunning thing to have with me, if but it held
service to the Earth-Current, and a rare thing, which the Master
Monstruwacan did make with his own hands and much skill and pains, from
an olden one that had place within the Great Museum, and concerning
which I have told somewhat, before this place.

And I set the thing upon the ground; but it had no certain way with it;
but did spin and waver constantly, and this I made to consider, and
remembered that I was yet above that part where, afar in the earth did
spread the greatness of the Underground Fields; and I was, haply, but a
little way off from the "Crack"; though a mighty way above.

And it pleasured me to wonder whether the dear Master Monstruwacan did
behold how that I made test with the compass; for the light was good
from the fire-hole; and the Great Spy-Glass had a great strength. Yet,
had I no certainty; for, as I did know, from much watchings, there was
no surety in the searching of the Land, by the Glass; for there was oft
plainness where you did think surely none should see, and anon a
dullness where might be thought that the sight went gaily. And this may
be plain to all; for the wavering of the lights from the strange fires
was not to be accounted to rule; but made a light here, and a darkness
there, and then did change about, oddly. Moreover, there were smokes and
mists that did come upwards from the earth, in this place and in that;
and had somewhiles a greatness; but oft were small, and did lurk low,
and had no power but to confuse the sight.

And, presently, I did put by the compass in my pouch, and made to
compose myself unto sleep. But here would I now set down how that, in
the end, after I had gone many days' journeyings outward from the Mighty
Pyramid, I did indeed find it to draw the Northward part of the needle
unto it; and this was a comfort and a pleasure to my spirit; moreover,
if ever I did get back, as I did think, it would be a matter for great
interest unto the Master Monstruwacan; yet, in verity, were there other
matters that should hold him more; for he was right human, as all should
know.

And, moreover, concerning this same compass, I did find a fresh thing;
for, after a yet greater time, as I shall set out in a due place, if I
do but remember, which doubt is ever my fear to fret me, I came a
mighty way from the Redoubt, and, lo! fearing that I might indeed lose
that, My Great Home, in the Darkness of the World, I did pull out that
strange wonder of the needle, that I might have comfort by its homeward
pointing. And I did discover a new power in the night; for the machine
did point no more directwards unto the Great Redoubt; but was a point
unto the Westwards; so that I had knowledge that some Great Power afar
in the Darkness of the World did sway upon it; and I had a childlike
wonder that this might be, in truth, that same Power of the North, of
which the books, and my Memory-Dreams did tell. And, indeed, no doubt
should there be upon this matter; yet who might not have doubt in that
time, that they should perceive after an eternity, that ancient
Northward Force swaying that small servant unto an olden obedience. And
it was, as it were, a revealing unto me, how that to know within the
brain is one matter; but to have knowledge within the heart is another;
for I had always known concerning this Northward Force; but yet had not
known with the true meaning of Knowledge.

And yet one other matter there was to cause doubt, at that moment of
this new knowing; for it came to me that maybe the power of that Lesser
Redoubt did begin to act upon the machine, even as the Earth-Current of
the Great Pyramid did hold yet a strong drawing upon the needle; and
were this so, then did I not surely begin to stand anigh unto my
Journey's end; for that less power of the Lesser Redoubt could have no
impudence to pull, save that I had come to a closeness with it.

Yet, in truth, as I do now have knowledge, it was the North that drew;
and I do seem to make a great telling about this little matter; but how
else shall I show to you mine inward mind, and the lack of knowledge and
likewise the peculiar knowings that did go to the making of that time,
and the Peoples thereof, which is but to say the same thing twice over.

And now, as I did say, I made to compose myself for sleep; and to this
end, I took a cloak-matter which did cross my shoulder and hip, and
wrapt it about me, and lay down there in the darkness of the Night, by
that strange fire-hole.

And I lay the Diskos beside me, within the cloak; for it was, indeed, my
companion and friend in bitter need; so that I had pleasure to feel the
strange thing anigh to me. And as I did lie there, in those moments that
do drowse the Soul, as it were that they do proceed as breath out of the
mouth of Sleep, I had a half-knowing that the aether did surge about me;
and I doubt not but that there had watched my every doing, many of the
Millions, and had been humanly stirred, at my commending of my spirit
unto sleep; and thus did shake the aether of the world about me, with
their unity of sympathy.

And, mayhaps, I had some little knowing of this thing, as I did pass,
drowsy, into slumber; and it is surely like that I slept the better for
it. Moreover, I was wondrous tired and worn, and thus did sleep very
strong and heavy; yet I mind me that my last dim thinkings were upon
that sweet maid I did go to find. And in slumber did I have speech with
her in dreams, and a strange happiness about me, and all seeming to be
touched by fairy-light, and freed from the sorrow of life.

And it was from a sweet and lovely sleeping, such as this, that I was
waked suddenly by a great and mighty sound; and I came instant to a
possessing of my senses; and I knew that the mighty Voice of the
Home-Call did go howling across the Night. And, swift and silent, I slid
the cloak from about me, and took the haft of that wondrous Diskos into
mine hand.

And I did look towards the Pyramid, quickly, for a message; for I had a
sure knowledge that there had a great Need arisen, and that some Terror
came towards me out of the Dark; else they had never waked all the Night
Land to a knowing that an human was abroad out of the Mighty Refuge.

And even as I did peer towards the Great Redoubt, I could not abide to
keep my gaze entire that way; but did take a large and fearful look all
about me; yet could make to see nothing; and so did stare, eager and
anxious, afar into the upper blackness of the Night, where did shine
that Final Light of the Tower of Observation; and the same while
crouched, and holding the Diskos, and making to glance across my
shoulders, and to watch for the message, and all in the same moment.

And then, afar upwards in the prodigious height, I did see the great,
and bright and quick darting flashes of a strange green fire, and did
know that they spelled to me in the Set-Speech a swift warning that a
grey monster, that was a Great Grey Man, had made scent of me in the
dark, and was even in that moment of time, crawling towards me through
the low moss-bushes that lay off beyond the fire-hole to my back. And
the message was sharp; and bade me to leap into the bushes unto my left;
and to hide there; so that I might chance to take the thing to an
advantage.

And, as may be thought, they had scarce flashed the tale unto me; but I
was gone in among the shadows of a clump of the moss-bush that did grow
anigh; and I sweat with a strange terror, and a cold and excited shaking
of the heart; yet was my spirit set strong to conquer.

And lo! as I did crouch there, hidden, I saw something come very quiet
out of the bushes that did grow beyond the fire-hole; and it was great,
and crept, and was noways coloured but by greyness in all its parts. And
the glare from the fire-hole did seem to trouble it; so that it looked,
laying its head to the ground, and spying along the earth, in a strange
and Brutish fashion; that it might oversee the glare of the fire-hole.
Yet, I doubt that it saw beyond the fire with plainness; for, in a
moment, it crept swift in among the bushes again, and came out towards
the edge of the fire-hole in another place; and this it did thrice unto
my left, and thrice unto my right; and every time did lay its head to
the earth, and spy along; and did hunch its shoulders, and thrust
forward the jaw horridly and turn the neck, as a very nasty beast might
go, wanton.

Now, as you may think, this manner of the Beast-Man did shake my courage
mightily; for I did think each time that it did go inward among the
moss-bushes, that it had made discovery of me, and would make to take me
in the back, from out of the dark of the bushes; and this was an
uncomfortable thing to consider, as others might think also, had any
been there in the bush with me. And then, in truth, did that same swift
sense of mine Hearing, prove helpful to my saving; for, behold, the
thing did go back into the moss-bushes, after that last coming out; and
did seem to make as it had made a failing to discover me, and had no
further intent, save to return unto the Night; and I had this thought
truly in mine heart, and for maybe a minute; and then, lo! within my
soul a voice did speak plain, and did warn me that the thing did make a
great compass among the moss-bushes about the fire-hole, having made
discovery of me; and it did go warily to take me in the back, from the
other side.

Now, when I heard this voice speak within my spirit, I had knowledge
that the dear Master Monstruwacan made watch from the Tower of
Observation, and did send the speech with his brain-elements, having in
mind that I had the Night-Hearing. And I trusted the speech; for in the
same moment of time there did beat all about me in the Night the solemn
throb of the Master-Word, as that it had been added with speed, to give
instant assurance. And I leapt quick from that clump of the moss-bush,
unto another, and crouched, and made a watch all about me; and kept the
ears of my spirit open, knowing that the Master Monstruwacan did also
watch all, for me.

And, suddenly, I saw a little moving of a bush that grew to the back of
those bushes in which I had been hid; and there came out of the bush
that moved, a great grey hand, and moved the moss of the clump where I
had been, as it were that something peered out of the moving bush. And
there followed the great grey head of the Grey Man, and the head went
into the clump of the moss-bush where I had been.

And I knew that I must strike now; and I leapt, and smote with the
Diskos; and the thing fell upon its side, and the great grey legs came
out of the hither bushes, and twitched and drew upwards; but the head
remained in the bush where I had been hid. And I stood away from the
thing whilst it died; and in mine hand the Diskos did spin and send
forth fire; as it were that it did live, and did know that it had slain
a great and horrid monster.

And presently the Grey Man was dead; and I went away from those bushes,
unto the far side of the fire-hole. And I stood with the Diskos held
high and spinning and sending out fire, that they within the Mighty
Pyramid might know that I had slain the Beast-Man; for it might be that
it lay too much in the shadow for them to look upon.

But the Master Monstruwacan spoke not again to me; for, indeed, it was
not meet to do so, except it might save me from a sure danger; for, as
you may know from my past tellings, there were Powers of the Night Land
that did hearken unto such matters; and it was like enough that there
had been overmuch done, even thus, for my further safety. Yet the thing
could not be helped.

And now that I was a little calmed, and eased from my fear, I could know
that all that the aether of the night was disturbed by the gladness of
the millions within the Great Redoubt; so that it was plain how great a
multitude had given note unto the fight; and their hearts to beat in
sweet sympathy and natural fear; so that I did feel companied and
befriended; though, as it may be thought, something shaken yet about the
heart.

Now, in a little time, I did gather unto me my wits and had myself to
order; and I looked to see how the hours did go, and I found that I had
surely slumbered through ten hours. And I reproached myself; for,
indeed, I had slept oversound by reason of my having lacked a regular
way and time, as I had with a proper wisdom made to be my rule. And I
resolved that I would obey the wit of my Reason in all the future time,
and make to eat and rest in due season, as you will wot that I did
before intend.

Then, with a self-reproachful heart, I went around the small fire-hole,
and caught up my cloak and other matters. And I turned me towards the
Mighty Pyramid, and did look once upwards along all the great slope,
where it did go measureless into the far blackness of the Everlasting
Night; and I made no salutation; for I had so resolved, as you will
know; moreover, I desired not to call forth any unneedful disturbance of
the aether of the world, which indeed must be, did I make to stir the
emotions of the Millions.

And I turned me then away, and went off into the night, going swift and
cautious, and bearing the Diskos cunningly and almost, as it were, with
a love for that strange and wondrous weapon that had so befriended me,
and slain the foul Grey Man with one stroke. And I had feeling that it
did know me, and had a comradeship for me; and I doubt none will
understand this; save, it might be, they of the olden days that did
carry one strong sword always. Yet was the Diskos more than the sword;
for it did in truth seem to live with the fire and the flame of the
Earth-Current that did beat within it.

And it was well acknowledged within the Great Redoubt, that none might
touch the Diskos of another; for that the thing went crustily, as it
might be said, in the hands of a stranger; and if any made foolishness
of this knowledge, and did persist much to such an handling, or making
to use, the same would presently act clumsy with the weapon, and come to
an hurt; and this was a sure thing, and had been known maybe an hundred
thousand years; or perchance a greater time.

And by this it doth seem wise to believe that there did grow always an
affinity between the nature of the man--which doth, as ever, include the
woman--and the Diskos that he did use in his Practice; and because of
this known thing, and that the place would elsewise be lumbered with
olden weapons of those that did die, it was a Law and Usage that there
was placed with the Dead, the Diskos of the Dead, there upon The Last
Road in the Country Of Silence, and was thus made to give back unto the
Earth-Current, the power that did lie in it. And this doth seem to a
careless thinker, as it were that I told once again those olden customs
of the Ancient Folk; but this is otherwise, and had a sound reason to
it; yet, if you do so believe, I doubt not but that a right human
sentiment was something at the bottom, which is proper; for it is meet
that Love should mate with Wisdom to mother Comfort in our sorrows; and
it is a warm thing to do aught for our dead; and none may say nay to
this.

Now, as I did go onwards into the Night Land, looking ever to this
shadow and to that, it may be conceived how my heart would stir with
swift fear, at this and that; and that my body would oft quiver to leap
aside; and as swift discover that naught assailed.

And so did I go forward, and always with imaginings and wonders
concerning what manner of uncouth Being or Brute might come out of the
darknesses all about. Yet, in all that time, there was a certain
proudness of the heart, that I did come safe out of the power of the
Grey Man, and did surely slay him. But, truly, it were well that the
praise be considered, and not overmuch given unto me; for I had died as
I slept, but that they of the Great Redoubt, had made a watch over me,
and waked me unto my saving.

Now, presently, as I walked, I grew something faint, and had knowledge
that I did foolishly; for, indeed, I should have eat after my fight; yet
may I be forgiven for this forgetting, in that I had been much shaked
and put about.

And I sat me down in a little clear place among the bushes, and did eat
three of the tablets, and did once more shake forth the dust that did
turn in the air to a natural water by a proper and natural chemistry of
these matters. And after I had eat, I sat a little while, and did think,
and did look upwards at the great slope of the Pyramid in the night; and
all the time did I listen with mine ears and with my spirit; and kept
the Diskos across my knees, and looked this way and that, very frequent;
but nothing came anigh.

And so I rose presently, and went onwards, and walked for six hours
towards the North and the West. And I made much to the West, for a
little, that I might come clear of the North-West Watcher. Yet, after a
space, I made to do foolishly; for I changed my mind about, and kept
something more towards the North, so that I should have a surer sight of
that Monster.

And this was, in truth, a rash and naughty thing to consider; for if I
were but seen, then should that grim Brute make a signal unto the Evil
Powers, and I be met swiftly with destruction. But surely the heart is a
strange and wayward thing, and given to quick fears, and immediately
unto great and uncountable rashnesses. And so I did go forward unwisely
to the Northward of a safe and proper going; and it may be that an
influence was upon me, and drew me thatwards; but who shall say.

Now, a great time I walked, and made a halt upon every sixth hour, and
did eat and drink, and look a little unto the monstrous towering of the
Great Redoubt; and afterwards make strong mine heart, and go forward
again. And always I did go warily, and chiefly among the low moss-bush;
but sometimes out upon stony ground, and oft across places where sulphur
did puff somewhat from the ground in a low smoke, very strong in the
nostrils and not liked inwardly.

And as I made onwards, I looked always to my right and to my left, and
anon to the rear; yet made a constant observation of the Mighty Watcher,
that I did begin to draw nigh unto. And oft did I stoop to crawl, and my
hands did bleed somewhat; but after I was troubled so, I put on the
great gloves that made complete the grey armour, and so was shod proper
to such journeying.

And, presently, when eighteen hours did have passed since that my sudden
awakening to the peril of the Grey Man, I did search about for a place
to slumber; for I would keep wisely unto my ruling, and go not over long
lacking of sleep; and by this planning I should be the less like to
sleep oversound, and so should set my spirit to listen whilst I did
sleep; and by so much as my spirit should serve me with faith, should I
have safety. And this thing is plain, and wants not more to the saying
thereof.

And I came presently unto a sudden place where the land did go downwards
brokenly, as that it had been burst a great while gone by the inward
fires; and I looked downwards over the edge of that place, and went
round about it, and did see presently a ledge upon the far side, that
was difficult to come upon; yet a place of some little safety to any
that might go down to it; for it was awkward to see, and did any monster
seek to come at me, I should have chance of warning; and might go
downwards a greater way in time to my salvation.

And by this determination, I abode; and came down to that place with
labour; but was cheerful of heart that I had found so sure a shelter.
And I eat my three tablets, and drank the water that I did get from the
powder. And so made to compose my body to sleep. Yet, at this time, a
thought did come to me, and I made calculation afresh; and laughed
somewhat at that my poor counting; for, indeed, I had thought to eat but
thrice in the twenty and four hours; yet by my arranging, I was made,
indeed, to eat four times, as you shall see immediately by a little
thought. And this thing came more strong upon my spirit than any might
think; for I did eat overmuch for the lasting of the food; though, in
verity, it was but little to my belly; as you must all think, and have
sympathy for my discomfort.

And I considered a little, and had determined that I should afterwards
in my journeying, eat but two of the tablets to my meal; and this was a
wise thought, and like much wisdom, a discomposing thing. But so it was,
and I set it down that you may know the arranging of my ways at that
time.

Now, in all this while of meditation, I had been setting my cloak about
me, and was fast set to my sleeping; for I had walked a weary way. And I
lay me down upon my left side, with my back to the rock, which did
overhang me something above; so that I was contented to feel hid from
things that might pass by in the Night. And I had the cloak about me,
and the Diskos close against my breast, within the cloak, and my head
upon my pouch and upon my scrip.

And as I lay thus a moment easeful, I could see that so mighty was the
uprising of the Great Pyramid that it was not hid from me even thus, but
did stand upward into the night, and did shine, and was plain to be seen
above the further edge of that deep place where I did lie.

And I fell upon sleep, looking upward at that Final Light, where, as
might be, the Master Monstruwacan did bend the Great Spy-Glass upon my
lonesomeness, as I lay there upon the ledge.

And this was a thought of sweet comfort upon which to slumber; the which
I did; but my spirit lay wakeful within my breast, and did listen
through the night; and harked for all evil matters and things that did
make to come anigh. But also my spirit did whisper unto Naani as I went
into sleep; and so passed I into dreams.

Now, it may be thought that I did act with a strange valiance, in that I
composed my body so properly to slumber, and with but a little trouble
of the heart concerning the coming of monsters. And in truth this hath
seemed somewhat so to me, thinking since that time; but I do but set the
thing that is truth; and make not to labour to an illusion of truth; and
so must tell much that doth seem improper to the Reality. Yet must all
bear with me, and have understanding of the hardness of setting forth
with true seeming the honesty of Truth, which, in verity, is better
served oft times by timely and cunning lies. And so shall you understand
this matter so well as I.

And presently my spirit waked me there in the half dark of the Night
Land; and I looked swift about me, and upwards, and saw nothing to
fear. Then did I peer at my dial; and made to discover that I had slept
full over six quiet hours; and by this I knew the reason of mine
awaking; for it was so great impressed upon me by mine inward sense and
being. And this you shall understand, someways, who have thought, ere
sleep, to wake to a certain time of the morning; and by understanding
shall you believe and give me all your kind harking and human sympathy.

And I made to have a smartness of going, which is ever hard to the newly
waked; and I eat two tablets, the while my belly did cry out for an
wholesome and proper filling; but I drank some of the water, and so did
ease somewhat of my hunger.

Then did I wind my cloak to its shape, and put upon me my gear, which
was the scrip and the pouch, and the Diskos to my hip; and I clomb out
from that place of rest. Yet, before I did come rightly up into the
open, I peered about, and made some surety that no evil Brute was anigh.
And then I gat me out, and stood upon my feet, and looked for a little
upwards at the mighty slope of the Great Redoubt, which did seem yet
very nigh unto me, by reason of it being so monstrous in bigness.

And I wondered whether in that moment the Master Monstruwacan did look
down upon me, with the Great Spy-Glass. And afterwards I turned away
swiftly, and went on into the Night Land; for it did always make me
shaken with lonesomeness to look upon my Great Home. And so I did go
forward with a strong and uncaring stride; but grew presently to
quietness, and to have back the proper caution of my going. Yet had I
not gone all foolishly, for I had taken the Diskos from my hip, ere
this; so that I possessed it handily.

Now there is one matter which shall seem but a small and natural
occurring unto you; yet was strong upon me in that time; and this thing
was that I did begin now to see the Night Land from the new outlooking
of my distance from the Mighty Pyramid. And it was as that a man of this
day did go from the earth to travel among the stars, and lo! should he
not find them to shift upon his vision; so that the Great Bear and this
and that shaping of the star clusterings, should make a new order, as he
did wander onwards; and so should he find that there was naught that was
truly fixed, as he did before then think; but all to alter according
unto the place whence the looking! And this thing shall be plain unto
you, though no thought be put to the matter; for it is of an evident
verity that doth need not argument to expound. And so shall you have
memory of me, there a-wander among those strange shapings and wonders of
that grim Land, the which I had never but supposed to seem but as my
memory did retain them, from the lookings of all my life within the
Great Redoubt. And so it was; and ever there did this thing and that
open out to a new view, and the Night Land take to itself a constant new
aspect to mine eyes which had never until that time had but the one
fixed vision of the same.

And you shall understand with me how that when, about the fourteenth
hour of that day's travel, I did draw very nigh unto the monstrous
Watcher of the North-West, it did seem so utter strange from this fresh
aspect that I had been like to think that I did see a new Monster. For,
in truth, when I did come at last to creep to within a mile of it, among
the low moss-bushes, I was confounded that the mighty chin did come
forward towards the Great Redoubt, even as the upward part of a vast
cliff, which the sea doth make hollow about the bottom; for it did hang
out into the air above the glare of the fire from the Red Pit, as it had
been a thing of Rock, all scored and be-weathered, and dull red and
seeming burned and blasted by reason of the bloody shine that beat
upward from the deep of the Red Pit.

And by the way in which I do tell upon it, you shall know that I did
surely view it something from the side at this immediate time; for, in
truth, it was then that I did draw the nearer; and, moreover, I was the
more astonished at this viewing, than I had been to the front; for it
was so utter strange, and shapen so different from the Brute that did
hang in my memory.

And a great time I did lie there upon my belly; and shaken by a fear of
the Beast; yet emboldened, as you may conceive, by having come to the
side; and being hopeful in my heart that I was very secure within so
great a shadow and the thick sheltering of the moss-bushes.

And surely it was that I did creep more nigh, the while that I did look;
for presently I had a very plain seeing of the Great Monster; and did
know where I had gotten to, and thereby did acknowledge unto myself that
this was an utter foolishness; and like, for all that any might say, to
lead unto destruction. Yet, as all must know, there was the first fear,
and the ceasing of this fear, as I did wot that I was so little a thing
to heed out there in the shadows. And presently a gaining of courage,
and the prick of my Being that did crave to see clear this exceeding
Wonder. And so was I come close, more or less, having gone far upon my
hands and knees; yet sometimes to pause; but afterwards on again.

Now by this nearness, I was the more truly able to perceive how that the
Bulk of the Watcher did rise up into the Night, like a Hill; and the
colour was mostly black, save and indeed where it did face to the red
shine of the Pit; and concerning this I have done telling.

And so did I lie there, and stare a great while, parting a small hole in
the moss-bushes that I might spy through the same. And the thing was
squat there, and might have root within the earth, so it did seem to
mine imaginings, as I did stare with a dumb wonder. And there were
monstrous warts upon the thing, and indents and a mighty ruggedness and
lumpings; as it were that it did be pimpled with great boulders that
were inbred within that monstrous hide. And where the shine from the
Pit of Red Fire did strike upon these, they did stand out into the
darkness away from the skin, as you of this Age shall see mountains of
the moon catch a bright fire from the Sun, and show plain upon the night
of the moon.

Now, as I have set down, I did lie there and look a great while; and it
came presently to me that there was unease within the Mighty Pyramid,
among the Millions; for I did feel the aether of the world to be
disturbed by their distress; and so had a knowing that they had a
cunning wareness concerning the place where I did hide among the
moss-bushes.

And the thrilling in the night did bring a wisdom into my head; for, in
verity, as I have said, this was a foolish matter that I was upon. And I
gat a thought that the Watcher might have an awaredness of the trouble
of the Multitudes; and, indeed, for all that I did know, it had a full
knowledge of all my wandering; though concerning this, I did think
otherwise truly in my heart; as is a most human and proper way to make
comfortable the spirit, where Doubt can have no ease from Reason.

And I made that I would go backwards to a good distance from the
Watcher, and go forward again upon my journeying, if but that I come
safe from so unwise an adventuring. And as I did begin to return, it was
to me as that all my senses were newly awake; for I had a sudden knowing
that I was within the atmosphere, should I not call it, of the Monster.

And I gat an abrupt and horrid shaking of the spirit; for I did feel in
verity that my soul had come too anigh; and that the Beast had a sure
knowledge concerning me; yet did make to my destruction with no haste;
but after that way and fashion that did seem proper unto it.

And this feeling you shall understand the better, maybe, when I do tell
that it was to me as that the air all about me was full of a quiet and
steadfast life and keen intelligence that I did believe to come forth
from the Watcher on every side; so that I did feel as one already within
the gaze of some Great and Evil Power.

Yet, though I had a great terror upon me, I made no foolish haste; but
commanded my soul to courage, and put a guard upon my way of going, and
so made a very quiet journey for maybe two full miles; and afterwards
did allow myself something more of haste; for I was now grown easier in
my spirit; and felt apart from the spirit of the Great Watcher.

And after a longer while, I did leave that hill of watchfulness to my
rear; and was gone onward into the night; yet, as may be known, with a
vague unease and trouble to my heart, and a swift and frequent turning
to learn surely that no Evil Thing came after me. For, as you may know,
I could nowise have forgetting, concerning that great quiet Life which
did seem to be living in all the air around that Mighty Bulk. For it had
been all about me in the night, as I have told, and I to feel that I had
been surely discovered! And thus shall you know how shaken was my
spirit, in verity.

Now, presently, at the eighteenth hour of that day's travel, I ceased
from my journeying, that I might eat and drink; and I did sit a little
while, and looked back upon the strange and monstrous thing which I had
come beyond. And the great humped back and vast shoulders of the
Watching-Thing rose up into the night, black and cumbrous against the
red shine of the Pit. And thus, as you shall think, had that Brute
looked always unto the Mighty Pyramid, through Eternity, and did cease
not from watching, and was steadfast and silent and alone; and none did
understand.

And after I had eat, and drunk some of the water, I went onward for a
full matter of six hours more; being minded to have no sleep until I had
put a great way between me and the Watcher. And in this part of my
journey did I come to The Place Where The Silent Ones Kill, as it was
named in the Maps. And I observed a very wondrous caution, and went away
from it a little, unto the North, where I did see at a distance the
shinings of fire-holes; the which did promise me warmth through my
slumber.

And here you must know that the Place Where The Silent Ones Kill was an
utter bare place, where all did seem of rock, and no bush did seem to
grow thereon; so that a man might not come to any hiding; though, in
truth, there might be some hole here or there; yet was none shown in any
map within the Pyramid; neither did there seem to be any such to me, as
I did creep there among the moss-bushes to the Northward of the Place,
and look constant and fearful towards it; so that I should see quickly
whether any Silent One did move across all the grey quiet of that rocky
plain.

And concerning this same Place Where The Silent Ones Kill, it were well
to make an explanation how that there was always a little and
far-spreaded light over all that lonesomeness; and the light was
something grey-seeming; as it were that a lichen might grow upon the
rocks, and send out a little uncomfortable glowing, even as certain
matters do in these times, if you do but know the place and the time to
seek them. Yet was the light exceeding weak, and very cold and dismal,
and did seem truly to show naught with a sureness; so that it did appear
to the eye, if one did look fixedly, that there were shadows that did
move here or there, as it were of silent beings; and none might know, in
truth, whether this shaping of the greyness was to the clouding of the
Reason, or that the eye did see of Reality. Yet, if one did look with
the Great Spy-Glass, then might there be some surety and plainness; and
likewise was it so, if one did have come sufficient anigh to that
uncomfortable Place, even as I then did be. And so you shall conceive
how that I did slide very quiet from bush unto bush; for I had alway in
all my life had a very dread fear of this place; and oft did I peer out
into the dim grey light of the lonesome plain unto my left; and would
think sometimes to perceive the shapes of the Silent Ones stood vague
and watchful; yet, on the instant, to see nothing.

And thus I did go onward, and came presently to a part where the grey
plain did stretch out a bareness into the Night Land to my front; so
that my way ended, unless I did make a long passing round about.

And I sat there among the moss-bushes, and did consider, and lookt out
cunningly through a spy-hole of the bush in which I did sit. And I
perceived that the part of the plain which did jut bareness into the
Land before me had no greatness of size; but might be passed swiftly in
but a little running. And this thing should save me a wearisome going
round; so that I made to consider it with a serious mind; and all the
time did I search the bare greyness before me, and saw presently that it
was surely empty.

And I made to adventure myself across, running very swift until I had
come to the far side. And lo! as I did go to rise up out of the bush,
mine eyes were opened, as it were, and I saw that there was something
amid the constant greyness; and I fell quickly into the bush; and did
sweat very chill; but yet did haste to look.

And I saw now that there were, in truth, matters that did show vague
upon that part of the plain that was before me. And I did peer very
constant and anxious, and, behold, I saw that there was facing me, a
great line of quiet and lofty figures, shrouded unto their feet; and
they moved not, neither made they any sound; but stood there amid the
greyness, and did seem to make an unending watch upon me; so that my
heart went unto weakness, and I did feel that there was no power of the
moss-bushes to hide me; for, in verity, they that stood so silent were
certain of the Silent Ones; and I was very nigh to the Place of
Destruction.

Now, I moved not for a time; but was made stiff by the greatness of my
fear. Yet I was presently aware that the Silent Ones came not towards
me; but stood quiet; as that they did mind not to slay me, if but I did
keep from that Place.

And there grew therefrom a little courage into mine heart, and I obeyed
my spirit, and took an hold of my strength and went slowly backward in
the bushes. And presently I was come a long way off. Yet troubled and
disturbed, and very strict to my going.

And I made a great circling about that place where the plain of the
Silent Ones did come outward; and so did gain to the North-West; and was
thence something the happier in my heart; and went easily, and oft upon
my feet; yet making a strong watching to every side.

And so I came at the last to a time when I had walked through
four-and-twenty weariful hours; and was eager that I should come to a
safe place for my sleep; yet did lack a happy belief of safety, in that
I had come twice anigh to so grim trouble; and unsure I was that I did
not be secretly pursued in the night. And this you shall believe to be a
very desperate feeling; and a plight to make the heart sick, and to long
with a great longing for the safety of that mine Home. Yet had I put
myself to the task; and truly I did never cease to the sorrowful
remembering of that utter despair that had sounded to me plain in the
last calling of mine own love, out of all the mystery of the night. And
but to think upon this was to grow strong in the spirit; yet to have a
fresh anxiousness that I did the more surely keep my life within me, and
so come to that maid's salvation.

Now, as you shall mind, I had spied the shine of certain fire-holes
somewhat to the Northward, and had thought to make thereabouts a place
for my sleep; for, in truth, there was a bitterness of cold in all the
air of night that did surround me; and I was warmed nigh to a slow
happiness, by thinking upon a fire to lie beside; and small wonder, as
you shall say.

And I made presently a strong walking unto that place where did glow in
the night the shine of the fire-holes, as I did well judge them to be;
and so was like to have come over-swiftly upon my death, as you shall
presently see; for, as I came anigh to the first, I perceived that the
light came upward out of a great hollow among the moss-bushes, and that
the fire-hole burned somewhere in the deep of the hollow; so that I did
but look upon the shine thereof.

Yet very eager was I to come to that warmth; and I made more of haste
than care, as I did hint; and so came very swift to the top of the
hollow; yet was still hidden by the kindness of the moss-bushes.

And as I made to thrust forward out of the bushes, that I might look and
go downward into the hollow, there rose up to me the sound of a very
large voice, and deep and husky. And the voice was a dreadful voice that
did speak as that it said ordinary things, and in a fashion so monstrous
as that it were that a house did speak, and, in verity, this is a
strange thing to say; yet shall it have the truth of my feelings and
terror in that moment.

And I drew back swiftly from discovering myself; and was then all feared
to move, or to make to go more backward, lest that I should give
knowledge that I was come anigh. And likewise did I shiver lest that I
was even then perceived. And so shall you have something of the utter
fear that did shake me. And I abode there, very quiet, and moved not for
a very great space; but did sweat and shake; for there was a monstrous
horridness in the voice that did speak.

And as I crouched there within the moss-bushes, there came again the
large voice, and it was answered by a second voice; and thereupon there
arose, as it did seem, the speech of Men that must have the bigness of
elephants, and that did have no kindness in all their thoughts; but were
utter monstrous. And the speech was slow, and it rose up out of the
hollow, brutish and hoarse and mighty. And I would that I could make you
to hear it, and that you could but borrow mine ears for a little moment,
and forthwith be shaken with that utter horror and an afraidness, even
as was I.

Now, presently, there was a very long quiet, and I ceased at last a
little from mine over-fear; and later I did calm somewhat; so that I
made to shift my position, which was grown very uneasy.

And there was still no sound from the hollow. Wherefore, having a little
boldness and much curiousness, and these despite my great fearfulness, I
put forth mine hand, very cautious, and did move the mossbush a little
from my face. And I went forward upon the earth, and did lie upon my
belly; and was by this so close upon the edge of that place, that I was
abled to look downwards.

And you shall know that I peered down into that great hollow, and did
see a very strange and horrid sight; for, in truth, there was a large
fire-hole in the centre of that place, and all about the sides there
were great holes into the slopes of the hollow, and there were great men
laid in the holes, so that I might see a great head that did show out to
my sight here, from one of those holes, and would seem to be that of a
monstrous man heavy with sleep. And there I would see but the buttocks
of another, as that he did curl himself inward to his brutish
slumbering. And so was it all about; and to my memory there were maybe a
score of these holes; yet had I not time to the counting, as you shall
see. For, after that I had made but a glance, as it were, at these
sleeping and utter monstrous men, I perceived that there sat beyond the
fire-hole, three great men, and they were each greater than elephants,
and covered a large part with a stiff and horrid hair, that did be of a
reddish seeming. And there were upon them great segs and warts, as that
their skin had been hides that had never known covering. And there was
between them the body of a mighty hound, so big as an horse, that they
did skin; and I judged that this beast was one of those fearsome brutes
which we did call the Night Hounds.

Yet, as I should set down, they did nothing in that time in which I
lookt at them; but did sit each with a sharp and monstrous bloody stone
in his fist, and did look to the ground, as that they heeded not the
earth or the food that they did prepare; but did listen to some outward
sound. And you shall know that this brought to me a very swift and
sudden terror; for I perceived now the why of their long silence; for,
in verity, they had an unease upon them, being subtly aware that one was
anigh, even as are the brute beasts in this manner and kind, as all do
know.

And I made to draw back, and win unto safety, if indeed this thing were
to be done. And as I moved me, it may be that I shook a little earth
into the hollow; for there was, indeed, a little sifting of dry dust
below me, as I did wot, being very keen to hear, by reason of my fright.
And immediately did those three monstrous men look upward, and did seem
to me to stare into mine eyes, as I did lie there hid amid the
moss-bushes. And I was so put in fear that I did clumsily, and sent
another siftering of dust downward, as I did strive to go backward swift
and quiet from the edge. And all the time I did look through the bushes
very fixedly into the eyes of the giants; and lo, their eyes did shine
red and green, like to the eyes of animals. And there rose up a roar
from them that did nigh slay my soul with the horridness of the noise.
And at that roaring, all the giants that did lie in the holes did awake,
and began to come outward into the hollow.

Now, I was surely lost, and given over to destruction; for they had
possessed me immediately, but that in that moment, as I went backward,
the earth gave behind me, and I fell into a hole among the moss-bushes
to my back, and I made first to come out very hurried, and all choked
with a dust of sand and ash; but in a moment I was sane to know that I
had come to a sudden hiding-place; and I lay very still and strove
neither to cough nor to breathe. And well for me, I came to so close a
hiding; for there were all about me the sounds of monstrous footsteps,
running, that seemed to shake the ground; though maybe this to be an
imagining bred of my fear.

And shoutings of great voices there were; and the thudding of huge feet
all about; and the noises of the bushes rustling; but presently the
search drew away to the Southward. And I perceived that there had surely
fought for me some power of good fortune. And I came up out of the hole,
very cautious, and shaken and a moment weak with the beating of my
heart; yet with a lovely thankfulness for my salvation. And I gat me
about, and went swift through the moss-bushes to the North and West for
three hours, and ceased not to run upon my hands and knees. And by that
time was I come a great way, and did have a surety in my heart of
present safety.

And I ceased to run, and lay quiet; for, in truth, I did near swoon away
with the hardness of my travel. And indeed as you shall know, I had
slept not for seven-and-twenty hours, and had scarce ceased to labour in
all that time. Moreover, I had eat not, neither drunk, for nine hours;
and so shall you conceive that I was truly a-weary.

And, presently I did slumber there as I lay, and all abroad to any
monstrous thing that should come along. Yet did I wake unharmed, and
found by my dial there had gone by a full ten hours, the while that I
did lie there and sleep unwotting. And I was sore perished with the cold
of the Night; for I had not the warmth of my cloak about me, and my
belly was very empty.

And I stood me up, and did peer about for any dread matter, but all
seemed proper, and I began to stamp my feet against the earth, as that
I would drive it from me, and this I do say as a whimsy, and I swung
mine arms, as often you shall do in the cold days; and so I was
presently something warmed. And I dismantled my cloak, and wrapped it
about me, and did feel that the Diskos was safe to my hip.

Then did I sit me down, and did glow a little with relish, in that I
should now eat four of the tablets; for, indeed, these were my proper
due, by reason of my shiftless fasting ere I came so wotless to my
slumbering. And the memory of that eating doth live with me now, so that
I could near to smile; for the eagerness of mine inwards was proper and
human; yet were even four tablets but a little matter to so great an
emptyness; and I drank a double portion of the water, that I might make
less the void. And this thing was seemly; for, indeed, there were two
portions due unto me.

And when I had eat and drunk, I did fold the cloak once more to shape
across my shoulder, as I did carry it; and afterwards I took the Diskos
into my hand, and went forward again to the North and West.

Yet, as you shall know, I did pause a little in the beginning, and peer
to every side for any close danger; and then did look more abroad of
that place; but could nowhere see any matter to have me to immediate
fear. And afterwards, I looked a little while at the monstrous humped
back of the Watcher of the North-West; and it did grow to me how
steadfast that thing did look toward the Mighty Pyramid; and this set me
to new hatred and horror of the Monster, as you shall conceive and
believe.

And presently, I looked beyond the Watcher, unto the vast Mountain of
the Great Redoubt; and I was still seeming close upon it; yet, in truth,
gone a long and weariful distance. But this you shall understand was by
the greatness and utter height and bulk of that shining Mountain of
Life.

And strange and wonderful it was to me to think that even in that one
moment, it might be that the dear Master Monstruwacan did look upon my
face, through the Great Spy-Glass. And I should not seem utter far to
him, by reason of the power of the big Glass. But to me, as I did look
upward through the Night, unto that far and utmost light in the upper
blackness of the everlasting gloom, it did seem doubly to me that I was
afar off and lost forever from mine Home. And this thinking did breed in
me such a great and lonesome feeling, and a weakness of the heart and
spirit, that forthwith I took my courage close unto me, and did turn
away quickly; and went onward to the North and West, as I have told.

Now I walked for twelve hours, and in that time, did eat and drink
twice; and made onward again very steadfast, and happy that all did go
so quiet with me; so that it was as if I had at last come to a part of
the Land that was given over to quietness, and lacking of monsters.
Yet, in truth was I come to a worse place than any, maybe; for as I went
forward, striding very strong, and making a good speed, I did hear
presently a little noise upward in the night, and someways unto my left,
that had seeming as that it were a strange low sound that did come down
to me out of an hidden doorway above; for, indeed, though the sound did
come from very nigh, as it did seem no more than a score feet above my
head, yet was it a noise that did come out of a great and mighty
distance, and out of a Foreign Place. And I did know the Sound; though
never, as you may suppose, could I have heard it in all my life. Yet had
I read in one of the Records, and again in a second and a third, how
that certain of all they that had adventured from the Pyramid into the
Night Land to seek for knowledge, had chanced to hear a queer and
improper noise above them in the Night; and the noise had been strange,
and did come from but a little way upward in the darkness; yet was also
from a great and monstrous distance; and did seem to moan and hum
quietly, and to have a different sounding from all noises of earth. And
in the Records it was set forth that these were those same Doorways In
The Night, which were told of in an ancient and half-doubted Tale of the
World, that was much in favour of the children of the Pyramid, and not
disdained by certain of our wiser men, and had been thus through all the
latter ages.

And I did seem to know the sound upon the moment; for my heart grew
swift to understand. And it was a very dread uncomfortable sound; and
you shall know how it did seem, if you will conceive of a strange noise
that doth happen far away in the Country, and the same noise to seem to
come to you through an opened door near by. And this is but a poor way
to put it; yet how shall I make the thing more known to you? So that I
must even trust unto your wit and true sympathy that you shall conceive
of the fullness of my meaning.

Now, in all the Histories of those that had adventured into the Night
Land, there were but three sure Records that did concern this Sound; and
each did tell of a Great Horror; and of them that did hear the Sound
there had died the most part, out in the Night Land. And the Records did
make always that they had come upon Destruction, and not simply unto
Death; but were destroyed by a strange and Invisible Evil Power from the
Night.

And of those that came alive unto the Pyramid, they had all one strange
tale to tell, how that there were secret and horrid Doorways In The
Night. Yet how this thing could be plain to them, who may know truly;
save it be that the eyes of their spirits did behold that which was hid
to the eyes of the flesh.

And there was afterwards writ a proper and careful treatise, and did set
out that there did be ruptures of the Aether, the which did constitute
doorways, as those more fanciful ones did name them; and through these
shatterings, which might be likened unto openings--there being no better
word to their naming--there did come into this Particular Condition Of
Life, those Monstrous Forces Of Evil, that did dominate the Night, and
which many did hold surely to have been given this improper entrance
through the foolish and unwise wisdom of those olden men of learning,
that did meddle overfar with matters that did reach in the end beyond
their understanding. And this thing have I told before, and it doth seem
proper unto my belief; for it is always thus, and I have that same taint
within me, as must all that have the zest of life.

Now, by this that I have set down swiftly, to make a little clear the
sure horridness of this Sound, you shall know, even with me, the great
horror that did come immediately upon my Spirit; and I did know that my
Search was surely like to have an end in that moment; and I bared mine
arm, for my teeth, where the Capsule did lie below the skin; and so was
ready to an instant Death, if that Destruction did come upon me. And in
the same moment, I did fall silent, inward among the moss-bushes, and
did begin to creep very quiet toward the right; for, as you will mind, I
had heard the Sound over beyond my left. And all that time, as I did
creep, there was a great sickness upon me, and it did seem that my mouth
had weakened unto water; so that I could scarce hold my teeth tightly
from unseemly clitterings.

And I crept always very silent, and did often stare quick and painful
over my shoulder, upwards, and this way and that; but did never see
anything; neither could I hear now the Sound.

And I went thiswise for a great hour, and was like to faint through the
effort of my care and the soreness of my going. But upon the end of that
long while, I grew something easier in the Spirit, and did perceive that
I was saved from the Destruction that I had come so dreadful anigh. And
this thing, it may be, was because that I did chance to hear it, whilst
yet it was beyond, and before I did come right unto it, to pass below.
Yet may I be wrong in this thought, and do but make a guessing. But, as
I shall here explain; after that time, I kept mine ears newly keen unto
hearing; and did chide my Spirit, for that it had not taken account of
that Sound a great while earlier. Yet, as I did presently conceive, the
spirit had no power to hear that thing; which was very strange; but
truly so.

Now, because that I went with a very wary hearing, I heard the Sound
once a far way off before me, and I hid upon the moment, and went
backward, and after a while, did judge myself to have come unto safety;
and so it was, in verity, for I heard no more that time. And so did I
come presently unto the eighteenth hour, and did eat and drink, and made
me a place of slumber in a little hollow of a rock that stood upward out
of the moss-bushes. And I slept for six hours, and afterwards waked,
and was come to no harm.

And after I had eat and drunk again, I did look outward over the Night
Land, and with particularness to that part that I did travel in, as it
might be called, the yesterday. And I did observe it to be a very bleak
and desolate Country, and not given over to fire, or other warmth, nor
to sulphur-vapours; but to be very quiet, and with but a little light in
all its breadth. And I could conceive that it was no place for anything
of life to desire; but rather to avoid; and that Country did seem to be
yet all about me; for I was by no means come clear from it at that time;
though, Northward, there was a glimmer, as of fire-holes; and beyond
those, the strange shining of the Plain of Blue Fire. And, after that I
had thought awhile, I did believe that I should meet no Monster of
Natural Life in all that Country of Desolation, until I did draw nigh,
once more unto fire. And I conceived that this Sound from out of the
invisible Doorways might yet trouble me; but whether the quietness of
that part was because all of natural life did fear the Sound, or because
that there was neither fire nor warmth, I do not say, having no knowing
in this matter; but may yet believe that it was to be laid to both
causes; and this doth seem of common reason, as you shall agree.

And when I had looked a while unto the Mighty Pyramid, which was now
truly a great way off; for I had walked so many weary hours; I turned me
once more to my journeying. And here let me observe that I had gone very
far; yet not so distant, as might be thought; for, oft, I did go less
than one mile in an hour or maybe two hours, having to be of great
caution, and oft to hide, and to go upon my belly, or to crawl, all as
might be. And, further, as you may have perceived, I made not a straight
forwardness; but did strike this way and that way, being very intent to
escape the Monsters and Evil Forces that were all about.

Now, because that I believed that I travelled in a Place where was
surely to be discovered those strange Doorways within the Night, I made
an especial care of my going; and did stop oft that I might listen, and
watch, and keep a very strict ward in all the Night about me. Yet, as
you shall see, this served not to prevent me from going forward into the
fearfulness of that which did haunt all the void; for, sudden, as I went
carefully, I heard a faint humming noise come downward from the night a
little unto my rear; and the humming noise did grow more plain, as that
a door were opened slowly above, and did let out that Sound ever more
loud. And surely, after I did hear that, I could not doubt that a door
were opened upward there; for the noise did grow in such wise as you
shall hear a distant sound come through, when a door truly is oped; for,
if the noise had been made just in that place, it had seemed to come
from there; but this Sound, though it did come _through_ there, was as
that it did come outward from some far lost and foreign Eternity. And
this I do struggle always to make plain; and you shall not blame me that
I think overmuch upon it; for, in truth there was an horror so wondrous
and drear about it, that I can forget not; but do strive always that
others should know with me that peculiar woe and terror that did haunt
the night.

Now, as you will see, I had in truth gone past the place where the
Doorway in the Night did open; yet had come to no harm; but rather it
did seem that it opened by chance, unwotting that I was anigh; or it may
be that my quiet passing did disturb an Evil Power, so that it did even
come to listen, or to make search. And all this doth pass through my
brain, as I do write, and it doth seem to me that my thoughts are but
the thoughts of a little child, before so great a mystery; and that I
touch not even the edge and fringe of the truth with my thinkings, and
so do cease upon them; and will but go forward so plain as I may with my
telling. Now, as you may truly believe, when I heard that Sound, and did
understand that I had, in verity, come past beneath that Place, I did
surely sicken to an utter weakness of body and heart, though it was but
for a moment; and then was I swift hid within the close shelter of the
low and thick moss-bushes.

And I shook in all my being, and crept, shaking, upon my hands and
knees, and did near totter to my face thrice, so weak gone was I in that
moment of terror; and I did have a wickedness of forgetting in that
time; for I bared not mine arm, to have the Capsule to a readiness for
my death, if that did need to be; and this was an abominable
foolishness, and I do shake now when I think upon it; for Death is but a
little matter by the side of Destruction; though, in truth, dreadful
enough for all. Yet, as it did chance, no harm came to me, and I gat
away, as that some wondrous power did cast a viewless cloak about me,
that I might be utter hid; and oft have I wondered whether this was
truly so; but have no knowing.

And, presently, I ceased from fleeing, and had some calmness, and did
eat and drink; and so came to the comfort of a firm spirit, the which
had been sore troubled, above all understanded causes, by that horrid
sounding upward in the Night. And after that I had eat and drunk, I did
rest a little; but afterward, went onward to the Northward, going
towards that place where the fire-holes did glimmer, the same being by
this time no great way off.

Then, as I did come anigh, I thought to hear once again the Sound in the
night, and I stopt very swift, and hid into the moss-bushes, and did
listen; but did hear naught; and so was hopeful that fancy did play upon
me. Yet, because of this matter, I went upon my hands and knees for a
good way; and so came at last nigh unto the shine of one of those
fire-holes, the which I did see for so long.

Now, as you shall suppose, I went very cautious through the bushes, unto
that red-shining fire; being careful, both that I did attract not any
Evil Force that might listen in the Night, and because that there might
be some Monster nigh to the fire-hole. But, presently, when I was come
so that I could peer through the bushes, I did see a little fire-hole
set in a small hollow, and there did no thing seem to lurk anigh; and
the sight of that warmth did cheer me; for it was long since I did have
the comfort of such a matter.

And when I had lain hid awhile, that I might watch all about, I saw the
place to be safe and quiet; and I went out from the moss-bushes, and sat
down a space from the fire, which did fill the pit in which it did lift
and bubble. And the noise that it sent out was strange and slow, and it
did seem to gruntle gently unto itself in that lonesome hollow, as that
it had made a long and quiet grumbling there, through Eternity. And oft
was it still, and made no sound; and again would give an odd bubbling in
the quietness, and send off, as it did seem, a little smoke of sulphur,
and afterward fall once more upon a quiet.

And so I did sit there very hushed and restful, and the loneliness did
lie all about me, and the red shine of the fire-hole did glow soft in
the hollow; and I was glad to be quiet, for my heart was weary.

And there was to my back a little rock that did jut upward so high as a
man; and the rock was warm and pleasant to lean upon, and moreover did
seem to guard me from behind. And there I ate and drunk, and kept very
still; and so was presently rested. And this I did need, as you have
perceived; for I was gone sudden weary of the heart, as I did say; and
this might be because that I did never cease to have Destruction over me
to companion my way, though as you will mind, I had been no more than
twelve hours afoot, since my last sleeping. Yet I doubt not you do
understand.

And presently my heart grew strong again within me, and I had a warmth
in my Spirit; and I got up from the earth, and stretched out mine arms;
and I saw that my gear was safe upon me, and afterward did grip the
Diskos, as it were newly.

Then I went away from the fire-hole, and climbed the far slope of the
hollow, and went Northward. And there were before me many of the
fire-holes; for I did perceive them to shine in the Night for a great
way; as it did seem that they were a path of red shinings that led me
onward to the North-West of the light of the Plain of Blue Fire.

Now, I had a believing that I had come out of the Country where did lurk
those horrid Doorways in the Night; and I went not with so utter a
weight upon my heart; and did feel that naught should come now upon the
back of my neck, which had been an odd and troublesome fancy whilst that
I did creep through that Country of Gloom. Yet, as you shall know, I
went with no foolish confidence; but with a great caution, and mine
hearing keen to hark, and a care to my steps, and did ever watch around
me as I journeyed.

And because that I went forward in this proper and sedate manner, I had
great cause for a thankful heart, as you may perceive; for I had come
after a long way to another of those hollows where did burn one of the
fire-holes; and I made a pause upon the edge of the hollow in which it
did lie, and looked downward, keeping guarded within the moss-bushes,
where they grew anigh to the top thereof. But there was no living thing
there to be seen, and I went downward, so that I should warm my body at
the fire. And lo! as I stood upon this side of the fire-hole, and turned
myself about, I looked presently more keenly to the other side; for the
yellowness of the earth did seem a little strange in one place. But I
could see with no plainness, because that there arose a glare from the
fire against mine eyes; and I went round, that I should look the better;
yet with no fear or thought of Evil in my heart. And, truly! when I was
come upon that far side of the fire-hole, lo! there was spread out in
the yellow sand of that place, a Curious Thing; and I went more nigh,
and stooped to look upon it; and behold it moved, and the sand all about
did move for a great space; so that I gave back very swift, and swung
upward with the Diskos.

And, strangely, I heard the sand to stir at my back, and I looked round
very quick, and the sand rose upward in parts, and sifted back, and
there came to my sight odd things that did move and curl about.

And immediately, before I knew which way to go, I knew that the sand did
shift under my feet, and did work and heave, so that I was tottered, and
was shaken also in the heart; for I knew not what to think in that
instant. Then did I perceive that I was all surrounded, and I ran swift
upon the heaving sand, unto the edge of the fire-hole, and I turned
there, and looked quickly; for I did not know what this new Terror
should be.

And I saw that a Yellow Thing did hump upward from out of the sand, as
it had been a low hillock that did live, and the sand shed downward from
it, and it did gather to itself strange and horrid arms from the sand
all about it. And it stretched two of the arms unto me; but I smote with
the Diskos, and I smote thrice; and afterward they did wriggle upon the
sand. But this was not the end, as I did hope; for the Yellow Thing
arose, and ran at me, as it might be that you should see a spider run.
And I did leap backward, this way and that; but the monster had a great
swiftness; so that I did seem surely lost.

Then made I a strong and instant resolve; for I perceived that I had no
hope to slay this thing; save that I should come at it in the body. And
I put everything to the chance, and made not to escape any more; but ran
straight in among the legs; and there were great hairs like to spines
upon the legs, and these had pricked me to the death, but that the
armour saved me.

Now, I had done this thing with a wondrous quickness; so that I was
under the mighty arching of the legs before the Yellow Thing did wot of
my intent. And the body was bristled with the great hairs, and poison
did seem to come from them, and to ooze from them strangely in great and
shining drops. And the Monster heaved itself up to one side, that it
might bring certain of the legs inward to grasp me; yet in that moment
did I smite utter fierce with the Diskos--thrusting. And the Diskos did
spin, and hum, and roar, and sent out a wondrous blaze of flame, as that
it had been a devouring Death; and it sundered the body of the Yellow
Thing, and did seem as that it screamed to rage amid the entrails
thereof; so wondrous was the fury and energy of that trusted Weapon.

And I was covered with the muck of the thing; and the claws upon the
legs seized me, so that the grey armour did bend and crack to the might
thereof, and I grew sick unto death with the pain within; but smote with
the shining Diskos, using my left hand weakly; for my right was gript
dreadful fast to my body. And lo! I was sudden free, and a great blow
did knock me far across the hollow, so that I was like to have fallen
into the fire-hole; but fell instead upon the edge, and came backward
unto safety.

And I turned me about, and the Yellow Thing did throw the sand all ways,
as it did die; but had lost power to come upon me. And for my part, I
lay weak upon the earth, and was no more able to fight; nor could I do
more than breathe for a great while; but yet came presently to health,
and made to examine my hurts.

Then I saw there was no great wound anywhere upon me; but only an utter
bruising; and I found upon my right leg that there was a sharp and hairy
claw clipt about it; but the armour had saved me from harm of the horrid
thing; so that I did but kick it free with my left foot, and thence into
the fire-hole.

Now, by this time, that Monstrous Creature was dead; but I held off from
it, and went upon the other side of the fire; for I was yet surely in
horror of it. And I sat for a time, and did think upon all matters that
did concern me; and I saw that I should have not comfort of heart, until
I was washed clean from the taint of the Monster.

And I gat me up wearily to go forth into the Night again, that I should
make a search for a hot spring, of which I had come past many. And I had
oft found them to be nigh unto the fire-holes; so that I was trustful
that I should see one ere long. And lo! there was a little hollow just
beyond, and scarce a hundred paces off; and in the hollow, there did
shine three small fire-holes, and there was a steaming puddle, as did
seem, beyond the third of the holes.

Now, before I adventured downward into this place, I went all about the
topmost edge, and made a search of the moss-bushes about; but found
naught that should scare me. And afterward, I went all across the
hollow; but did find no monstrous thing hid anywheres. Yet, there was
that in the place that discouraged me, and did keep me from stripping
mine armour, so that I should bathe in the hot puddle; for I stept upon
a small serpent, and the same did lap about my leg; but could do me no
hurt, for the armour, which was a very blessed protection. And I freed
myself from it with the handle of the Diskos.

And because that I could not go naked to my cleansing, I tried first the
hotness of the water, which was not over great, and afterward did take
off the scrip and the pouch, and the cloak, and laid them with the
Diskos upon the edge of the warm puddle.

Then I stept into the water, and was immediately gone downward a great
way; for, truly it was no puddle as I had supposed; but a deep well, as
you might call it, of hot and sulphury water. And this doth show how a
man may act foolishly, even when he doth believe that he hath a great
caution; and surely it is borne in upon me afresh that none should trust
over freely unto unproven matters, the which shall you heartily agree
with; but yet do as foolishly, according to your lights and characters.
And so shall you laugh not over hardly upon me.

Now I had gone over the head, and, surely I do not know what deepness
was there. Yet, as you shall think, I stayed not to consider upon this
matter; but made to climb out, and much shaken with my splutterings and
the smartings of mine eyes; for, truly, the water was strong with
sulphur matters. Yet, very cleansing was it, as I did presently see; for
there was no more any taint or horridness upon mine armour, or the flesh
of my face or hands. And I took the Diskos, and washed it clean, also;
and then the cloak, and afterward the scrip and the pouch, and the bands
of the same.

And after I had done this, I was minded to dry myself by the little
fire-holes; but when I was come there, lo! maybe a score small serpents
were about those places; and I was strongly pleased that I should keep
away. Yet that I must warm and dry me in that desolate and bitter Night
Land, you shall agree. And to this end, I put the scrip and the pouch
upon me, and afterwards took the Diskos readily into my hand, and ran
quietly unto the hollow where I did fight with the Yellow Thing. And the
cloak I bore in my left hand.

Now, when I was gat there, I was truly glad to think that there were no
serpents in that place; and because that I had slain the Monster of the
Place, how should it be that any harm might come unto me; for truly, was
it not like that a Creature of such Might should keep all that Hollow
unto itself, and slay any that did come therein, and thereby preserve
that place from all other horror; though, surely, until it did die and
cease to Be, there had been no call for any greater abomination.

Now, all this did go through my brain, as I did sit to dry mine armour
and my body and my gear, upon that side of the fire-hole which was away
from the slain Monster. And I made presently to think that this would
be a sure and proper refuge wherein to sleep; for, truly, it must have
gotten a place where none other Creature should be like to come to work
me harm. And it must be that you do all see with me in this matter, and
commend me that I thought with properness.

And so did I resolve that I put my disgust within my pocket, as we do
say, and stay safe and quiet within that Hollow. And this thing I did
surely, and did eat and drink; and presently I went over to the dead
Monster, and made very sure that it was truly slain; which indeed it
was. And after that I had seen to this matter, I returned unto the
fire-hole, and made a comfortable place in the sand, for my rest; for I
was well dry by this.

And I wrapped the cloak about me, and took the Diskos to my breast, for
a sure Companion, as it had truly proved in my need. And I could think
almost that it did nestle unto me, as that it knew and loved me; but
this thing can be no more than a fancy; and I do but set it down as
such, and that it doth show my feeling and mind at that time.

Then, ere I did compose myself to slumber, I looked about me, upward to
the edges of the Hollow, and I perceived that I was lost to the sight of
the Mighty Pyramid; for I was come so far off that it looked not down
from so wondrous a height, as you shall perceive; and moreover, the
Hollow was something deep.

And afterward, as I lay my head back upon the scrip and the pouch, which
were to me my pillow, I went to think a little upon Naani, as alway I
did in my constant journeying; yet, presently, I strove sometimes that I
put her from my mind, that I should sleep; for a bitter sorrow and
anxiousness was oft upon me when that I did think upon her; and this you
may know; for truly I knew not what terror was come to her, afar in the
silence of the Night. And did I think overmuch, I should feel that I
could have no calmness needful to sleep; but to need to walk for ever
until I died, which could not be long; and so should I make a
foolishness of mine anxious journeying to do her true service and to
save her from Destruction, if such did truly threaten.

And I was soon gone over to sleep, and waked not for seven hours, being
much wearied by the fight and the soreness of my body, the which did put
me into a great pain as I did rise upward from my slumber. But this was
presently something less, and I eat two of the tablets and drank some of
the water, and afterward did put my gear upon me, and went forward into
the Night, having the Diskos in my hand. And my heart was glad that I
had come safe through the time of my sleep.

Now I walked six hours, and did stop a little to eat and drink, and went
on again. And it was in this second Third of the day that I saw afar to
my right, two strange and wondrous men, and they did shine, as they had
been made of a pale mist. And they came anigh, going very swift, and did
seem as that they were maybe forty feet high, yet having no thickness;
and I hid downward into the moss-bushes. And they past me, so quiet as a
cloud of this day might go, and did appear to be, if I did guess, but an
hundred fathoms off; yet was this no sure thing; for their position had
no more surety than shall a rainbow have in this age. And so they were
gone onward into the Night, and did seem to come out of the North. And
they did appear not to wot of me; and whether they were harmful, I know
not, for they harmed not me.

And I lay there in the moss-bushes, until they were well gone away; and
I had belief that they must be those same mist-men that were told of in
certain of the olden Records; but were never seen anigh to the Pyramid;
though I had thought, odd times, to see men, as of mist, through the
Great Spy-Glass, when I was within the Tower of Observation. But they
were always a mighty way off; and some would say it was but a bright
vapour that did move; yet would others be in doubt, and so is it ever in
such matters.

And here let me take chance to say how that it is a hard thing to speak
of such happenings to men of this age, and to make the truth proper unto
them; and because of this, oft am I tempted to say no word upon many
things that I did see; yet must I tell my tale, or suffer from the
weight of it within me. And so shall you hark to me and give me your
sympathy and human understanding. And concerning these mist-men, I have
wondered oft whether they were the visible shape of some of those many
Forces that were abroad in the Night Land; for they did truly seem to me
as that a thing of Strange Life were half shown to my human eyes; yet I
do not know, and am but telling of my natural thoughts and ponderings.

Now, as I did say, those mist-men were never seen nigh unto the Pyramid,
and were, as I did hint, always so far off that they were half given
over to the fables of the olden days, in the beliefs of the Peoples of
the Mighty Redoubt; and set about with an halo of unrealness, for none
within the Great Pyramid had ever beheld them with surety.

And because that now I saw them anigh to me, it was borne in afresh upon
my spirit how greatly I had wandered away, and how that I stood afar in
the lonesomeness of that Land of Night; as it had been that a man of
this Age did wander amid the stars, and perceive a great comet to go by
him very close; for then he should know in his heart how that he was far
off in the Void. And this I do say to you, that you may know somewhat of
the emotions of my heart in that moment.

Yet, presently I shook free of my melancholy and lonesomeness and rose
up out of the moss-bushes, and went onward. And, as ever, I thought much
upon the Maid that I did search for; yet strove to think quietly
concerning her state; else should I have turned to running, and wrecked
my body before that I had gone any great way.

And that day, I passed seven large fire-holes, and two that were small;
and always I came softly unto them; for there were oft living things
about the warmth. And at the sixth fire-hole, I did see that which I did
think to be a great man, that did sit to the fire, with monstrous knees
drawn upward unto his chin. And the nose was great and bent downward;
and the eyes very large, and did shine with the light from the
fire-hole, and moved, watching, always this way and that, so that the
white parts did show, now this side and now that. But it was not
properly a man.

And I went away very quiet from that place, and looked oft backward,
until that I was sure of safety; for it was a very horrid Monster, and
had that place to be for a Lair, as I did judge from the smell thereof.

And when the eighteenth hour was come, I looked about for a safe place
to my sleep; and I kept away now from the fire-holes; for I did always
find the more life there. Yet, when I came to my rest, I was lacking of
warmth, by reason of this care; and could scarce sleep at all, because
that I was so cold. Yet managed something of slumber after a while; but
woke very stiff, and was glad to beat my hands and bestir myself that I
should come to some warmth of life.

And after that I had eat and drunk, I put my gear upon me, and took the
Diskos in my hand, and went forward again upon my journey. And here I
should tell that I was come soon unto the North-West border of the Plain
of Blue Fire. And presently, I was but a little way off from it, and did
go direct to the North; so that the Plain was always upon my right.

Now this Plain was a strange and fearsome place, as you shall see; for
it was as that a blue void did rise upward from the earth in all the
country of that Plain. For, surely, the Plain did not lumber with flame;
but was hid with a strange and inburning light, as of a shining
atmosphere of a cold blue colour. And it did throw no sure light upon
the Night Land, as had seemed proper; but was a very dreadful, cold
shining, as of a luminous and blue void. And the moss-bushes grew nigh
to the edge of the plain, and did show to me black and strange against
that horrid gloom of light.

And you shall know that I could not see into the plain; for it was as
that the cold blue light was a void that swallowed all within it; and
gave no power to the eye that aught should be perceived. And it stood
between me and the Mighty Pyramid, and I could nowise see across. And I
know not whether I do make all this matter clear unto you; for surely it
is no easy task.

And presently I had gone very quiet upon my hands and knees through the
moss-bushes; and I came near upon the edge of the Plain, and hid there
in a clump of the moss-bush, and peered forth and harked. And I heard
constant voices that did call to one another across the Plain; as it
were that strange peoples of Spirits did wander within that blue
Shining, and did make a calling one to the other, and were all hid and
held apart. And surely I could see naught, and did judge, as I have
writ, that they likewise went blindly. And truly is this a strange
matter to set out; and easy to think on with doubt. Yet as I did see, so
have I told; for, in verity, there were surely hidden Peoples of Spirits
scattered and lost afar upon that improper Plain.

And you shall judge that I kept safe hid; for whether this might have
any natural explaining, or whether it was a matter that did go utter
beyond knowledge of man, I did not know; for surely in that strange
Land, it did like to be an Horrid Danger in any case; and whether of
some Monstrous Creatures, or of the Evil Forces of the Land, I did
wisely to be away.

And for two days I did make a safe coasting of the Plain of Blue Fire;
and did keep well off, maybe two great miles, among the moss-bushes. And
I made a very good speed through the darkness. And at the eighteenth
hour of each journey, I made a place for my slumber; and the first I did
manage under a thick bush; but the second was high upon the ledge of a
rock that grew upward in the night amid the bushes. And, save that I was
bitter cold there did no harm come to me. And in all that time of
journeying, I had no sight of the Mighty Pyramid; for the blind shining
of the Plain of Blue Fire was ever between.

Now there had been certain little matters in my journey beside the Plain
of Blue Fire, which I have not set down; for they were of no account,
and do but repeat much that I have told before. And, indeed, there was
naught in that part of my journey, save that I did pass nineteen great
fire-holes, and four small; and did observe no life beside any, save
about one of the great holes that there was no hollow around, and here I
did happen to see some strange and ugly creatures so big as my head,
that did have a look of the scorpion of this Age; but proportioned more
squat and thick. Yet, though they were naught to remark upon in that
Land, they had been but woeful bedmates to any man; as you may think.

And you shall know how it gave a rest to my spirit, that I did go so
long with no trouble of the Monsters of the Night, or the Evil Forces
thereof. And I grew bolder to my journeying, and made ever a greater
speed of going; and it was like that I took presently a less heed for my
safety, which was a wrong and foolish state. Yet there came no harm unto
me, in all that part of my travel.

Then, it was in the sixteenth hour of the third day of my journey beside
the Plain, that I did come out beyond the end of it, and had fresh sight
of the Mighty Pyramid, afar in the night upon my Right. And I stopt
there in a bare place among the moss-bushes, and did in a weak moment
hold up the Diskos, so that I make a salute unto the Pyramid, Mine Home;
for truly was I so utter glad to behold it once more.

And in a little while was I aware that there was a disturbance of the
aether of the world all about me; so that it did seem that there had
been one at the Great Spy-Glass to watch for my coming into their sight
from behind the shining of the Plain of Blue Fire.

And it was like that news had gone downward through the Cities of the
Great Redoubt; so that they did print the word of it in the Hour-Slips;
and by this there would be many great Millions thinking upon me, and a
rushing unto the Embrasures, that they might spy out at me. Yet I doubt
that any glass might perceive me surely at so great a space, save the
power of the Great Spy-Glass in the Tower of Observation. But the
Emotion of the Millions to reach to me.

And you shall know that it did seem homely and sweet unto me to hear all
about me the shaking of the aether of the world, and to be ware that so
many did think humanly upon me, and had prayers unto my safety.

And it was a strange thing to stand so utter far off in the Night, and
to look back to that Everlasting Hill of Light, that was grown something
small by the distance, and to have surety that I was lookt upon through
the Great Spy-Glass, maybe by the kindly eye of my dear friend the
Master Monstruwacan, and so keenly that he could, it might be, make
almost to guess the look within mine eyes, as I did gaze backward unto
that Mine Home.

Yet, though this dear and homely sympathy was a sweet and companionable
thing to my heart, it came swift to my thought that I was in a sore
danger, if that they ceased not quickly to think so onely upon me; for
surely was I not come over-near unto that _dreadful_ House of Silence;
and well might so much Emotion of the Millions tell unto the Horrid
Power that dwelt within, how that I was even anigh. And so shall you see
the mixt feelings that came upon me everyway.

Yet, as it did chance, the aether was quieted in a little; for it did
need unity of the Millions (being that they were untrained to their
spiritual powers) to stir the aether. And so was I more easy of mind,
and went forward again upon my way.

Now, as it did chance, at the eighteenth hour, I was come to a place
where I heard a noise of water; and I went to my left, that I might come
upon it; and there boiled a hot fountain that went up out of the rock of
that place. And the water rose upward in a column, and was, maybe, so
thick as my body; and it fell unto the North, for the water came not up
straightly, but did shoot out from the earth unto that way. And I saw
the thing plain; for there were many fire-holes all about, as you shall
have wotted from my telling; and so was there a certain and constant
light in that part of the Land.

And I followed the water that ran from the fountain, and tried it with
mine hand; but found it to burn; and so did go further beside it; for
presently it should be no hotter than I did need. And it went onward,
winding among the moss-bushes, and sent up a constant steam, that hung
about it; and the steam made a red cloud about the way that it did go;
for the lights from the fire-holes made a shining upon it; and so was it
a wondrous pretty sight.

Now, presently, I tried the stream again, and found it to be nicely
warm; and I sat upon a little rock, and took off my foot-gear, that I
might bathe my feet, which were gone something tender; moreover, I did
ache to have the sweetness of water about me. And I made that I should
bathe my feet, and afterwards find a place among the moss-bushes, and so
eat and drink, and have my slumber.

Then, as I did sit there beside that warm stream, with my feet dabbled
therein, I heard sudden, afar off, the voice of a mighty Night-Hound,
baying in the night. And the sound came from the North-West of the Plain
of Blue Fire. And there was afterward a quiet; and you shall see me
sitting there upon the rock by the side of that smoking river, and the
steam all about me, and my feet within the lovely warmth of the water;
and I very still and frozen with a sudden fear; for, it did seem to me,
in an instant, that the Night-Hound might surely be upon the track of my
goings.

And after that there had passed a little time, the while that I did
listen very keen, lo! there burst out in the night, as it did seem
scarce a mile off, the monstrous deep baying of the giant Hound. And I
knew surely that the Brute did track me, and a sick and utter horror did
fall upon me; so that I could scarce get my foot-gear upon me, once
more. Yet, in truth, I was not long to the matter, and was to my feet,
and did hold the Diskos ready; and very desperate I was to the heart;
for it is ever a fearsome thing to be put in chase, and the worse an
hundred times when there is a sure knowledge that a deathly Monster doth
be the pursuer.

Now, I did stand there but a moment it did seem, to make an anxious
considering how that I might best assure me some chance to live through
this swift coming Danger. And then did I think upon the stream, to use
it, and I leapt quick therein, and did run very strong down the middle
part, which was nowheres so much as thigh-deep, and oft not above mine
ankles. And as I did run, there came again the bellow of that dire
Brute, following, and was now, as mine ears did say, scarce the half of
a mile to my rear.

And I did run but the stronger, for the dread of the sound; and so,
maybe, for a little minute; and after that time, I stopt from mine heavy
running, and went very wary, that I made no loud splashing; for by now
the Monster-Brute should be something anigh to that place where I did
enter the stream. And I looked round, with a constant looking; but did
see no surely visible thing; though my fear did shape me an Hound from
every shadow of the moss-bushes about me.

Then, in a moment, I did hear the Great Beast; for it bayed but a
little way up the stream, as that it had overshot the place where the
scent did end. And immediately, I sank swiftly into the water, which was
there so deep as my knee, and turned upon my belly. And the water surged
over my shoulders; for I kept my head above. And so I did look eager and
fearful through the steam into the shadows and the half-darkness,
towards where I did think to see the Night-Hound.

And in a moment I saw it coming; and it was a little vague, by reason of
the smoke of the river; yet did seem black and monstrous in the gloom,
and great as a mighty horse. And it went past me at a vast and
lumbersome gallop; but I did not see it in that moment; for I dived my
head down unto the rock of the river bottom, and held downward, until
that I was like to burst for sore longing of breath.

Then I put upward my head, and took swift and deep breathings, and lookt
about me, very cautious and fearful, as you can know. And I heard the
Night-Hound casting round among the moss-bushes, and it did send up a
wild and awesome baying; and I heard the bushes brake and smash beneath
it, as it did run to and hither. And afterward there was a quiet; yet I
moved not; but stayed there, very low in the water, and did have a
thankful heart that it was warm and easy to persist in; for I had surely
died of a frozen heart, if that it had been cold; for, by this time, you
do know even with me, how bitter was the chill of the Land.

Now, I had been awhile lain thus upon my belly, and heard no sound from
the monstrous Hound. Yet, I ceased not to be full of an horrid unease,
concerning the Great Beast; for I did better to know what it did, than
to have no knowing. And, sudden, I heard the sound of it, running very
swiftly and coming nigh; and it passed me, and did go up the stream; and
there was surely a quick stupor upon me; for I ducked not my head under
the water; but stayed very still; which as it did chance, was maybe not
such an utter foolishness; for my head did seem in that half-gloom to
be, mayhap, no more than a little rock in the water, and I made no move
to tell of life; yet should the Hound have smelled me; and that it
failed in this matter, doth be a puzzle to me.

And as the great Night-Hound past me, it tore the earth and the bushes,
with the exceeding strength that it put forth to run, and clods of the
earth and stones of bigness were cast this way and that by the feet of
the Hound, running. And so shall you have a little knowledge of the
strength of that Beast.

And the Hound ran on into the distance, and presently, I heard it baying
in the Night. Then I rose, and went onward, down the warm stream, and
made a strong walking, yet keeping alway to the water; and oft did stop
a little that I should listen; and always I heard the Night-Hound a
great way off in the night, baying, and seeming that it did surely run
to and fro, searching.

Now, I journeyed thus for twelve hours, and the baying of the Hound
making search, did never cease. And I kept always to the water, as I
did say, that I should leave no scent unto the Hound. And by that twelve
weary hours had gone, I found that I was come anigh unto the House of
Silence. And this put me in great trouble; as you may perceive; for
surely had mine whole effort been to the end that I should avoid that
House, by a great way. Yet had the Hound driven me thus a-near.

Now I saw that the small river did go onward, and did make a breach
across the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk; and I determined in my heart
that I should leave the water, which was now grown nigh to a bitter
cold, in that it was so long upon the face of the Land. Yet chiefly did
I mind to leave the water, that I should come no more anigh unto that
House of Silence; for the water did go that way. And I stood awhile, and
did listen for the baying of the Hound; but could hear it no more; and
did have a surety within me that it was indeed gone from searching for
me.

Then I came out of the water, and went forward, stooping and creeping,
among the moss-bushes, going outward to the Westward of North, so that I
should go away so quickly as I might from the nearness of the House.
Yet, lo! I was gone upon my hands and knees no more than an hundred
fathoms, when I did find the moss-bushes to cease to the Westward, for a
great way, and there to be a great bareness of rock, which, in truth,
was much shown thereabout. And I dared not to go outward upon that naked
Land; for then I had not been hid by the moss-bushes; but had stood
plain there for all things of the Night to behold; and moreover, though
I could nowise have a sure knowledge concerning this matter, yet did I
hope within me that I should make a sure hiding from the Power of the
House of Silence, did I but go very low among the bushes. But, indeed,
it was like enough that naught could give me hiding; yet should I lose
no chance unto my safety.

And because of this, I went backward among the bushes, and ceased to
escape out unto the Westward. And I found presently, that the
moss-bushes made but a narrow growth in that path, and grew only for a
while by the side of the Great Road; so that I was surely fain to keep
nigh to the Road, that I have the covering of the bushes.

And, in a while, I found the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, to bend
inward at the North of the House of Silence; so that it came right
horridly close unto the House; for here the hill on which the House did
stand, was very abrupt and fell steeply unto the Road. And so was that
Dreadful House stood up there above me in the Silence, as that it did
seem to _brood_ there upon the Land. And this side did seem truly as the
other; and equal lone and dreadful. And the House was monstrous and
huge, and full of quiet lights; and it was truly as that there had been
no Sound ever in that House through Eternity; but yet was it as that the
heart did think each moment to see quiet and shrouded figures within,
and yet never were they seen; and this I do but set down that I bring
all home unto _your_ hearts also, as that you crouched there with me in
those low moss-bushes, there beside the Great Road, and did look upward
unto that Monstrous House of Everlasting Silence, and did feel the
utterness of silence to hang about it in the night; and to know in your
spirits the quiet threat that lived silent there within.

And so shall you have mind of me, hid there among the bushes, and sodden
and cold; and yet, as you will perceive, so held in my spirit by an
utter terror and loathing and solemn wonder and awe of that Mighty House
of Quietness loomed above me in the Night, that I wotted not of the
misery of my body, because that my spirit was put so greatly in dread
and terror for the life of my Being.

And also you shall have before you, how that I knew in all my body and
soul, that I stood anigh to that Place where but a little while gone
there had passed inward so dreadful to an everlasting Silence and Horrid
Mystery those poor Youths.

And after that you have minded you of this, you shall consider how that
the memory of all my life held dread thoughts of the monstrousness of
that House; and now was I anigh unto it. And it did seem to my soul that
the very Night about it, held an anguish of quiet terror. And always my
mind did come back to the sheer matter that I was so anigh. And this
thing I do say unto you once and again; for truly, as you do see, it
hath imprinted itself deep into my spirit. Yet shall I now cease from
saying further in this manner; for, surely, you shall never know all
that was in mine heart; and if I cease not, I do but be like to weary
you.

And so did I hide and creep, and oft pause to a time of shaking quiet;
and afterward gather something of new courage, and go onward; and peer
upward at that monstrous House, stood above me in the night. Yet, as it
did come about, I came presently clear of that horrid place; for the
Road came round again unto the North, and I began that I made a better
way through the moss-bushes; but never that I grew to much speed; for I
had oft to go about, that I should miss a naked part here, and another
there; for truly there was an abundance and bareness of rock, so that
the bushes grew not so thick as I could wish.

And in the space of five hours was I clear of that House; and did have a
greater ease about my heart; but yet was not free to come to food nor to
slumber, the both of which I did sorely need; for I had slept neither
eat for a weariful time, as you do know. But first I must go further off
from the House, and afterwards come to some fire-hole, that I should dry
myself and get warmth again into my body, which was bitter cold.

And now that I had come unto the Northward of the House of Silence,
there came to me a great Wonder, which bred in me a mighty Hope and
Gladness. For as I did go among the bushes, there broke sudden all
around me in the aether, the low and solemn beat of the Master-Word. And
the throb of the Word was utter weak; so that one moment I did say unto
myself that I heard, and in a moment that I did not; yet had I no proper
doubt in my heart.

And I reasoned with myself, and with a great shaking of excitement and
expectation upon me, that the Master-Word came not from the Great
Pyramid, which should have power to send it as a Great Force across the
everlasting Night; whilst that this that throbbed about me was faint and
scarce to be known even unto the keenness of the Night-Hearing, which
was mine.

And, immediately, as I crouched low there, and thrilled with the hope
that was bred in me, lo! there seemed to come the far faint voice of
Naani, calling with a little voice within my spirit. And I thought the
cry to have an utterness of supplication within it; so that I grew
desperate to up and go to running; yet did curb such foolishness, and
stayed very hushed, to listen.

But I heard no more; yet was shaken continually with the Joy and Hope
which this calling did breed in me, for truly did it seem now that I was
right that I did determine to go unto the North; for sure was I now that
the Lesser Redoubt lay that way in the Night. And it did seem plain unto
me, that the House of Silence had put a barrier between; and had power
to withhold so weak a calling. And now had I come beyond the Barrier.
And I did perceive in my heart how that Naani had called off, maybe in
the sadness of Despair; yet had the weak crying of her brain-elements
been held from me by the horrid power of the house; and surely, as I did
think, it was well named; for it did make a silence.

And so shall you stay with me in your hearts, and take to ourselves
something of the new Gladness that held all my being; for it did seem
truly that my bitter task and adventuring should not in the end be
offered to Uselessness; and that I did truly draw unto that far place in
the Everlasting Night, where mine own Maid did cry for me, that I should
succour her.

And ever as I went, did I hark; but there was no more the low eating of
the Master-Word in the Night; not at that time.

And presently, I spied outward to the West, as it did seem a good mile
off in the night, the shining of a fire-hole; and I began to plan that I
should come unto that place, and have warmth and dryness, and food and
slumber. And, in verity, so set was I to the need of these matters that
if there did be a Monstrous Thing nigh to the fire--as was so oft the
case--then would I give battle unto it; for neither my Joy nor my
labours did serve to put warmth into my body; and I must surely come
anigh to fire, or die.

Then, as I kneeled upward among the moss-bushes, and made to lay a true
course unto the fire-hole, I perceived that there came a Being along
the Road unto my right; and I went low into the bushes, and moved not;
for truly I had seen that there drew nigh one of the Silent Ones.

And I made a little place that should let me to see; and I spied out,
with an utter caution; and lo! the Being came on very quiet, and with no
hurry. And in a time, it went by me on the road, and did take no heed to
me; yet did I feel that it had knowledge that I stoopt there among the
moss-bushes. And it made no sound as it went; and was a Dreadful thing;
yet, it did seem unto my heart, as that it had no trouble of Wanton
Malice to work needless Destruction to any. And this, I crave strangely
that you to understand; for it was so to me that I had a quiet and great
respect for that thing; and did feel no hatred; yet was very dreadly in
fear of it. And it was Huge in size, and was shrouded unto its feet, and
seemed, maybe ten feet high. Yet, presently, it was gone onward down the
Road, and I was no more troubled by it.

Then did I make no waste of time; but set off unto the fire-hole; and
kept so much to shelter as I might; but was oft made to run over baked
places, ere that I should come to more of the bushes.

And I came presently nigh unto the fire-hole, and made a pause, and
crept unto it, with a great care. And I found it to be in the bottom of
a deep hollow of the rock of that part. And the rock was clear looking
of all living matters, the which did make me to be glad. And I went
round about the top of the hollow, carrying the Diskos very handily; but
there was nowhere any living thing; and I feared not to go downward into
the deep hollow, and so unto the fire-hole, which lay in the bottom, as
you have perceived.

And when I was come there, I made a close search of the rock, and found
it was very sweet and warm; and there were no serpents, neither any
stinging creatures; so that a certain comfort came upon my spirit.

Then stript I off mine armour and gear, and afterward all my garments,
so that I stood naked there in the hollow. Yet was that place almost so
warm as some mild oven, and I had no fear to suffer from the cold of the
Night Land; but was uneasy lest that any monstrous thing should be anigh
to come to take me so unawares.

Now I wrung the garments, and spread them upon the rock near unto the
fire-hole, where it was hot; and I did rub my body very brisk with my
hands, so that I glowed into health and had no fear of a stiffness.

And afterward, I did look to my food and drink, and to the matters in
the pouch; but there had no harm come to any, by reason of the tightness
of the scrip and the pouch, that had kept off the water. And I eat and
drank, there as I stood waiting for the garments to come to dryness; and
I walked about a little, as I eat; for I was restless to be into mine
armour swiftly. And now I did turn this garment upward of the dry side,
and now that; but did find them to steam, so that I turned them many
times before they were proper.

Yet, in truth, they dried in but a little while, and I gat me into them
very swift, and into the armour; and I felt the strength and courage of
my spirit to come back into me, which had gone outward somewhat when I
did stand there so naked. And this feeling you shall all have
understanding of; and know that you would have felt that way, likewise,
had you but stood there in that Land in so unhappy a plight.

And when I had come into mine armour, I put my gear upon me, and took
the Diskos into my hand, and did climb out of the hollow; for I would
find a more secure place to my slumber, and did not dare to sleep in
that place; for it was beyond seven and thirty hours since that I did
have sleep; though as I do see by my count, I have made it to seem but
as five and thirty; yet was a part consumed in diverse matters that I
have not set down. And you shall mind how bitter had been my labour and
weariness in all that time; and I did know of a surety that sleep must
come heavily upon me; so that I was sorely in need that I should search
out a safe place; for I should not be lightly waked, until that I had
slept away the tiredness of my heart, and the weariful achings from my
body. And, indeed, I should mind you how that I was not yet come perfect
from the bruising which I had gotten from the fight with the Yellow
Thing.

And presently, when I had searched but a little while, I did find that a
rock stood upward from a great clumping of the moss-bushes unto my left;
and I went over to the rock, and made a search about it. And I found
that there was a hole into the bottom part of the rock, and I thrust the
Diskos into the hole, and made the blade to spin a little, so that it
sent out a light; but there was no thing in the hole, and it did seem a
dry and safe place for my sleep.

Then I turned me about, and went into the hole with my feet that way;
and I found that it was so deep into the rock as the length of two men,
and just so wide as I could lie in it without having it to pinch me. And
there I made my bed in the hole, and went swift unto my sleep, and
scarce had but a moment even to think upon Naani; and by this thing
shall you know how utter was my weariness.

Now I waked of a sudden, and was very clear and refreshed. And I crept
to the mouth of the hole, and lookt out; but there was all a quietness
round about, and nothing to threaten.

And I found that I had slept ten hours; so that I made a haste to eat
and drink, that I should go forward swiftly upon my journey. And at that
time, as in the time when I did eat, naked, in the hollow, by the
fire-hole, I eat four of the tablets; and this you shall understand to
be rightly due unto me, in that I had gone so long fasting in that my
great journeying to come safe from the Hound, and to come past the House
of Silence. And this shall seem but a little thing to you; yet was it a
wondrous important matter unto me, that had gone so long with an empty
belly, and was never satisfied. And neither should any be, that had eat
so little as I did eat, and made to fill their belly always with a drink
of water. Yet, I doubt not but that it did keep my soul sweet and
wholesome and no useful thing to the Powers of Evil of the Land.

And when I had made an end of so great a gorging, and had ceased to be
drunken with water, I gat my gear upon me, and took the Diskos into mine
hand, and so went forth once more towards the North.

And presently, I was nigh unto the Road again; for it did curve
something Westward a space beyond. And I was sore tempted to go upon the
Road; for the ground was rough and the moss-bushes did catch my feet.
Yet did I stay among the bushes, though the Road was true and smooth, by
compare. And by this telling, you will perceive that I walked once more
upright, and had given over to crawl between the bushes. And, in truth,
this was so; for the Land did seem very quiet in all that part; and I
had less of fear, now that I stood beyond the horrid unease of the House
of Silence.

Now, after that I had journeyed twelve hours, I saw that I was come upon
the commencement of a great and mighty slope, as that the world did
slope downward always towards the North. And I went on again, after that
I had eat and drunk, as I did likewise before this at the sixth hour of
that day's journey.

And presently, I perceived the Road to cease; and surely this did
confound me; as that a man of this age had come to a part where the
world did end; for you shall know that the Road was that which had
seemed to go on for ever; and you shall mind the way of my life up till
that time, and so shall you the better conceive of my bewilderment, and
as it were a feeling of great strangeness unto one that was overprest,
as you would believe, with strange matters.

Yet, truly, was this all as the little book of metal had told unto me;
and so should I have been something prepared; yet are we ever thus
needing eye-proof; and perhaps it is more proper that it be so.

Yet, you shall perceive me adrift somewhat as to direction; for I had
steered before this time so that I should come to the North of the House
of Silence; and afterward had shaped my way by the Road. But now was I
adrift, as it might be set down, in the wilderness.

And so did I stand and consider, and presently did look unto the far
Pyramid, which was now a great way off in the night, and had seemed but
small by that which I knew it to be. And lo! as I did look, I perceived
that I could but see the high upper-point of the light of the Great
Pyramid, where did shine the Last Light; and I was confounded afresh;
yet in a moment I saw that the greatness of the slope did account for
this. But here I should tell to you that the slope was nowise steep; but
did seem as that it should never cease. And mayhaps this is clear unto
you.

And I perceived surely that the time was come when I should make an
utter parting from the Great Redoubt; and the thought came very heavy
upon me. And in the same time I knew that the aether was stirred by the
emotions of the Millions; so that I had knowledge they watched me with
the Great Spy-Glass, and did send word down unto the Hour-Slips; and by
this did the Millions know, and have a great thinking upon me in that
moment.

And you shall perceive how utter lost and lonesome I did feel. And it
was at that time that I did test the compass, to comfort me, as I did
tell before this, and feared I must sure forget, when I did come to the
proper place; yet have I minded me, as I did desire.

And I saw now that the Night Land that I did wot of, was hid from me by
the slope. And I turned and looked down the slope; and surely all before
me was utter wildness of a dark desolation; for it did seem to go
nowhither but into an everlasting night. And there was no fire down
there, neither light of any kind; but only Darkness and, as I did feel,
Eternity. And downward into that Blackness did the great slope seem to
go for ever.

Now, as I did stand there, looking downward into the Dark, and often
backward unto the shining of the Final Light, and put to a horrid
desolateness, behold! there came the low beating of the Master-Word in
the Night. And it did appear as that it had been sent to give me courage
and strength in that moment; and did seem unto my fancy that surely it
did come upward unto me from out of the mighty blackness into which the
Great Slope ran. Yet could this have been but a belief; for the aether
doth have no regard unto direction to show you whence the spiritual
sound doth come; and this did my knowledge and Reason know full well.

And I made that I would send back the Master-Word, sending it with my
brain-elements, and so give news unto Naani how that I did struggle to
come unto her. Yet did I have caution in time; for in verity, had I sent
the Master-Word, then had the Evil Forces of the Land wotted that I was
out; and mayhaps had come swift unto my Destruction; and so did I
contain my spirit and desire, and made to do wisely.

Yet was I put in courage by the low beat of the Master-Word; and did
listen very keen, that some message should follow; but there came none,
neither did the weak throb of the Word come about me again, at that
time. And because that I was now grown more to my natural state, and did
feel that I should indeed find the Maid, I looked once more unto the
Great Pyramid, long and eager and with a solemn heart; yet with no sign
or salutation, as I was before determined. And afterward, I turned and
went downward into the dark.




VIII

DOWN THE MIGHTY SLOPE


Now I went downward very quiet and slow into that Darkness; and did make
but a cautious way; for now you shall know me truly wrapped about with
such a night as did seem to press upon my very soul, and such as you
shall never have seen nor felt; so that I did seem lost even from my
self, and did appear as that I went presently in unreal fashion, and did
pass onward for ever and for ever through everlasting night; so that odd
whiles I did make to walk with random, as that I stept no more upon this
earth; but did go offwards into the Void. Yet was this foolishness of
the mind set straight and proper each time that it did come about; for
lo! I did kick against an upjutting rock here, and fall upon a great and
unseen boulder there, and so was shaken very quickly to a sound
knowledge that I trode the hard and actual earth; and had no true
dealings with unreal matters.

And ever I did go downward; and by this only did I have a guide to my
way. Yet, as you shall think, through reason of the utter dark I made
scarce a mile in an hour or even two full hours; and so grew bitter by
reason of mine unableness to go forward with a proper and free stride.

But I did think me presently upon a thing that I should do to light my
path; and to this end, I did make the Diskos to spin, odd whiles, and
did look down the mighty slope, the little way that the strange
glistening of the Diskos did show, and so fixed my path into mine inward
remembering, and would go forward afresh, until that I was shaken once
more by the darkness, and would fain to look once again upon the
blessedness of light, and make me some knowledge of my way.

And, truly, the light from the Diskos did seem astonishing great, and
this to be because there was so monstrous a darkness all about me there
forever. And thereafter would I go onward again, until the pain of my
stumblings did bid me surely to have that sweet shining once more unto
my path.

And so shall you perceive my going; and sore and miserable was it unto
the heart; and like to shake the courage of the spirit; yet, in verity,
I had come through much, and did have intent to give way to no
foolishness of thought.

And you shall well believe that I did make the light not more oft than I
did surely need; for it was no properness of wisdom to use the power of
the Diskos, save for mine extremity.

Now, presently, when I had done thiswise through six long and bitter
hours, and it being now beyond the twentieth hour since I did last
slumber, I sat me down there upon the Mighty Slope, in the everlasting
Dark, and did eat two of the tablets, and made the water, and could but
feel and hearken whether I did this thing right and that.

And when I had eat and drunk, I unfolded my cloak, and wrapt it around
me, and placed the scrip and the pouch under my head; and the Diskos I
took to company me; and so fell swiftly upon sleep; yet did think
earnestly but vaguely upon Naani, as I came unto slumber.

And I slept all but six hours, and did waken very sudden there in the
utter dark; and I got me to mine elbow, and did listen very keen; for I
had waked immediately, as that something had touched me or come nigh
unto me; and I gript the Diskos, and listened; but there did not even a
little sound come to me out of all that night.

And presently I had more assuredness that naught did make harm about me;
and I sat me up in the dark, and reached for my scrip, and did eat and
drink, there in that utter night; and fumbled somewhat, as you shall
think. Yet I was done in a while, and got my gear upon me, and the
Diskos into my hand, and so to my feet and forward.

Now all that day, I did have a strange unease of the spirit, so that I
stopt oft to listen, as that my soul told of something nigh unto me that
did follow very quiet. Yet did mine ears perceive nothing; and so I
alway to go downward again into the night that held the slope.

And here should I tell how that in the early part of the seventh hour,
after I had eat and drunk, and went forward as ever, upon my journey
down the Mighty Slope, I did have a very sore tumble against a sharp
rock; for I put my foot sudden into a small hole, and this did make me
to pitch. And I was utter shaked by the fall and lay very quiet for a
time; for the rock had surely ript my body, but for the armour.

And after that I was something renewed of strength and spirit, I made
that I should go no more upon my feet, but upon my hands and knees; and
thus should I feel the way that I went, and have a less need of the
Diskos, which had not overmuch use to light my way, in that I shone it
not often, and did guess more than I did perceive, as you may think.

And so I crept all that day, which was a bitter way of travel; yet had I
done many a sore mile thus through the Night Land. And when that I had
gone downward for eighteen hours, and eat and drunk thrice, I ceased
from my labour, and did feel about in the darkness, that I come to a
level place for my rest; and so did find presently, a place not so bad,
and did push and cast away such small boulders as had been like to irk
me.

Then did I eat and drink, and afterward composed me to my sleep, and had
many a thought of Naani, as I did drift unto slumber; yet also had I
memories of the strange half-fear that had been with me all that day, as
though something went constantly near me in the Dark. And because of
this, twice did I rise unto mine elbow, and listen; but heard no sound
to trouble me, and afterward did trust that I did but fancy; and so came
at last unto slumber, that yet was not over-restful, for truly I did
listen even as I slept.

And when I had been asleep scarce six hours, I waked again very sudden,
as I had done before, and had belief that something did be anigh unto
me; and I gript the Diskos, and did hearken; yet was there no sound that
mine ears did wot of; neither aught that had power to be surely known of
the spirit.

And all that day was as the day before; save that about the eighth hour
I came near to fall into some monstrous pit in the Great Slope; but did
only fall with my breast upon the edge, and so drew back, and presently
did crawl all around it in the dark, and come safe unto the lower side;
yet shaken and put more in trouble of spirit than before, and fearful
how I should go; for I knew not whether I had come among such things, or
whether I had but few to sorrow me.

And so you shall perceive that I went over-cautious for a great while in
all that utter dark; but did think at last upon a plan to go with more
surety and speed. But to this I did need a cord, and surely I had no
cord upon me; and if a boy be no boy that hath none such about him,
shall not the same be said of any man! And this I did think, as I
searched me; for the sayings of that day had many that were like to
this.

Yet in the end I did compass my plan; for I did buckle the scrip and the
pouch together, and took one of the straps from the pouch; and this
strap was long and thin, and well suited unto my purpose. Then I fixt a
stone into the end of the strap, and buckled it there, and after that, I
cast the stone before me, as I went upon my hands and knees; and I did
hold to the hither end of the strap, and so was abled to have something
of knowledge whether there lay any great deepness immediately before me,
and thiswise to strive that I fall not down some monstrous cliff in the
night.

And so did I go, casting the stone continually to my front, down the
slope; and this you shall think to be a cumbersome fashion of travel;
yet was I in better case than in all the time since I had begun to go
downward of the Mighty Slope in the everlasting darkness.

And at the eighteenth hour I did sleep; and was waked strangely before
the sixth hour, even as I had waked before. And this did put always
upon me a new wonder and unease. Yet did no harm seem to come unto me,
and I did strive that I have no needful trouble of mind. But that
something was always nigh unto me in the dark, I do truly believe; yet
have I no knowing that it was evil; for it harmed not me.

And three days more I journeyed thus, and did never cease to creep
downward weariful upon my hands and knees; and the Diskos I had to my
hip, and so shall you know how I carried it. And by this, as you do
know, I had been on the Great Slope six days of utter Dark; and did have
no wotting but that I went unto some dire and dreadful place; for,
surely, I had gone for ever downward a monstrous way.

And here, before I tell further, I must set down how that the cold was
much gone from out of the air upon the slope; and the air was grown, as
it did seem, very heavy unto my chest. And concerning this matter I
should say something. For, if I do mind me, I have said not overmuch
concerning the air of the Night Land and the Mighty Pyramid; for truly I
have been so set to tell my story of all that I did truly see and
adventure upon. Yet, though I have said but little, you will surely have
perceived that the air of that far and chill time was not as the air of
this; but was thin and keen within the Night Land, and lay not, as I do
think, to a great height above the land, but only nigh to the earth.

And as you do know through my tellings, there was a wondrous difference
between the air within the Mighty Pyramid, and that which lay without
around the base; for upward beyond that, I did understand that there was
no outward air that any should breathe; and so was all the Pyramid
sealed in certain wise in all the upper Cities for ever; and whether it
was sealed _utterly_ from the outward air at the base, I do not surely
remember, if, in truth that I did ever bother my head to such matters.

Yet, if I be set proper in memory and understanding, we did draw air
from the Underground Fields; but whether they gat any change or newness
of air from the Night Land, I have no knowledge; and do lament that I
have no sure knowing. Yet, as you shall believe, I could surely write an
hundred books upon that Wonder of the Future, and be still lacking in
the half of all that there is to be told; and so do I try to have
courage to this my task, and to have no over-trouble, because that I do
tell but a little of a Great Tale.

And here in this place will I set down how that the Peoples of the
Pyramid were greater to the chest, methinks, than we of this age; but
yet do I have no oversurety in the matter; for well it may be that the
Reason of _this_ age doth blind within me somewhat the Knowledge that I
have concerning _that_; for, in verity, is it not but a natural thing to
believe those Peoples to be great of the chest, so that they should make
a proper dealing with the thin air of that place and that time? And yet,
as I do strive to make plain unto you, because that this thing should
be, by the making of my Reason, I do the more distrust that Reason
shall make foolish my Knowledge; for even a fool should suppose that
which I have told; and the truth may be even otherwise.

Yet that the Peoples of the _Upper_ Cities had great chests, I do well
know; for this was a common knowledge; even as we of this age do
acknowledge the Peoples of Africa to be of blackness, or those of
Patagonia to be of great stature. And by this one thing should any know
a man of the Upper Cities, from a man of the Lower Cities. And because
that there grew this difference among the Peoples, there had been once,
as any could learn from the Histories, a plan whereby the Peoples should
be moved upward and downward through the great height of the Mighty
Pyramid, from this city unto that. Yet had it met with great disfavour;
and was put out of force; and this is easy to be seen as the natural way
of the human heart.

And here it doth occur unto me that it was like enough to be a plan for
health, beside of training of the mind, that each youth and maid was put
to travel through all the cities of the Mighty Pyramid; the which did
take three years and two hundred and twenty-five days, as I have told
before this. For by this plan, were they made to breathe the air of
every height, and this, mayhaps, unto the good of their developing. And
they also to discover that air which was best to their need.

And concerning the air of the Night Land, you shall know that there was
in all that Land no flying thing, because that the air was grown very
thin; yet, as the Records did show, there had once been monstrous
flying-brutes, that went over the Land in mighty bounds; but this was in
a long gone age; and we could but suppose that the Records gave truth.

And here you shall know that, when the Monstruwacans did learn that I
would journey through the Night Land, in search of Naani, there had been
some foolish and well-intended talk among them that I take a small
flying-ship, that was in the Great Museum beside the models of the Great
Ships. For, truly, this machine was yet sound to go; for it was made of
the grey metal of the Mighty Pyramid, that did seem to have no power to
cease. Yet, in verity, I had no skill to manage this, neither had it
flown, through an hundred thousand years; so that none did know the
mastership of that art, which did be learned but by a constant practice,
and oft made uneasy by fallings that did wreck the machine, as I did
know from the Book of Flying. And, moreover, as I have told, the air of
the Night Land was grown over-weak to uphold such a thing; which, I
doubt not, had made the Peoples of the Pyramid to cease from flyings,
quite so much as that they did fear the Forces of Evil in the night.

And if that there had been air and skill sufficient unto this purpose of
flying, yet had I been wicked with foolishness that I should work to be
hung upward in the night, for all the Evil of the Night Land to behold.
And though I had gone up some great way, yet the machine had surely made
a great noise in the quietness of the eternal night, as you shall
suppose.

Now indeed am I gone weary that I should need to tell so much concerning
the air of that Time and Place; for surely I do seem to make this my
story as that I did make a lecturing upon matters of chemistry; and so
do I cast about, that I may not bother to tell more upon this matter.
Yet, in truth, a little more of my thinkings and observings had I better
set down here, and so be done with it. But you shall have patience with
me, and know that had this, my story, been no more than an idle tale, I
had been free to make no labour with such matters.

Now there doth a wonder come to me why that the Road Makers, who were of
that far-off Age which was before the Age of the Mighty Pyramid, did not
_fly_ downward from the upper world into the deep of the monstrous
valley; but did instead build a road.

Yet it may be that the air of the upper world had grown thin a great
age, so that they had truly forgot that once man did have power to fly.
But even if that they did have proper machines to this purpose, surely
it were a wondrous and fearful thing to fly downward an hundred great
miles; for they surely to have a dread that they never to rise again
through so huge a deep.

And, moreover, the downward world that was the bottom of the Great
Valley, was full of monsters, as was told in the little metal book. And
the monsters were very strange and unknown; and foreign to the whole
world, that had never come unto the deep of the Valley. And the Valley
had come, as you shall mind, when the earth did split; and this thing
was, in truth, like to be thought that same Ending of the World, which
all Nations have been taught to believe shall come. For in verity, when
the world did split and burst, and the oceans rushed downward into the
earth, and there was fire, and storms, and a mighty chaos, surely it was
proper to think that the End had come. Yet was it, in truth, but the
beginning of hope of a new Eternity of Life; so that out of the End came
the Beginning, and Life out of Death, and Good out of that which did
seem a dire matter. And so is it always.

Yet doth this go past my first wonder, which did concern the wherefore
that they made not to descend in Things of Flight. Yet, maybe, shall my
reasons stand to show why this was not.

And again, mayhap it did chance that some were wild adventurers, and did
leap over the edge of the upper world, having to ease their flight
certain contrivings, like to parachutes. And these you shall picture, as
that you watched them to leap; and so shall you see them go downward
into the gloom; and you shall see them for maybe ten miles, and maybe
for twenty miles; and afterward shall they be lost utterly in that Great
Deep, and seen no more of any man for ever.

But when the Nations became Road-Makers, and came downward slowly to the
monstrous Deep of the Mighty Valley that did split the World, then were
they come there by millions, and with power sufficient to fight against
the Beasts; and afterward to grow back again to an ancient Civilizing;
and so to the building of the great airships that were yet shown in the
Great Museum of the Pyramid. And here shall I cease from these my
thinkings on this matter; for indeed, who shall say what did be truly a
Reason for those peoples and what was their Need? And so do I come to no
surety by my wonderings.

Yet, as you do know, all things do seem verily to go in a circle; for,
behold, in time, they of the Mighty Pyramid, were likewise held off from
the glory of the airships; and so were gone backward a great way,
according as we do look upon this matter. And so hath this been the way
always, as you shall know who have studied and thought, and seen the
true ways and goings of Life.

And now will I go forward in my telling; and here will set down a sure
thing that I did perceive, both by mine ears and by my fingers; for, as
I did make clear to you but a while gone, there had come a change into
the air as I did go downward of the Mighty Slope; and truly I was come
to a great and new Deepness, even beyond that of the wondrous depth
where did stand the Last Redoubt. So that I was afar down and in a
monstrous night. And the air here was of a great thickness and
abundancy, even as it might be the air of this our Age; or maybe more or
maybe less; for who may compare two matters with a sure guessing, that
do have an eternity to keep them asunder. And because that the air was
grown very strong and apparent, it shall be, mayhaps, that it was by
reason of this thing that the water, when I did make it, did fizz upward
in a moment very loud and plentiful, and did boil overward to the earth
from out of the cup, and wet upon my hand. And surely this thought did
come very keen to my Reason, as I did fumble, each time of mine eating,
there in the everlasting night and lonesomeness of the Great Slope.

And so shall you have knowledge now of this and that thing which did
come upon my thought, and of the little and the big wonders, and all
shall help something to give unto you the ache of newness and
bewilderment that was constant companion unto me.

Now by this time, as I have said, I was gone downward ever for six great
days; and I did seem as that I should presently come to the middle of
the world; for of going downward there was no end.

And then, when it did be that I was near ready to believe this, I
perceived far off in the deep of the night a little shining that was yet
weak and unsure. And I do not know whether I can truly give unto you the
great astonishment and pain of hope that did come upon me; so that I
grew sick in all my being but to behold once again the blessedness of
light, and to have help unto my belief that I went not downward to an
utter desolation.

And I stood upward from my knees, and did look very earnest, and surely
it did seem that a light was there afar downward in the night; and again
it did seem that I must be plagued by my hopes and by my fancy, and that
there was nowhere any light. And then again I did see it very clear, and
not to be mistaken, and I had a shaking to come upon me, and I gat me to
a run, and made a great and mad speed down the dark slope. And lo! I was
not gone any way, but I went headlong, and near brake myself; and could
but hold my teeth together very fierce and quiet until that the pain was
something gone from me.

And afterward, I gat me again to mine hands and knees, and went slowly,
as before; and so for a great hour or more, and did look oft; and alway
the light became more plain to my sight; but ever to come and go,
oddly-wise. Yet did I go six hours, before that I was come anywise near
to it. And by this shall you know how great a space off it had been. And
lo! when that I did seem surely anigh unto it, truly was it still far
away in the night; and I came not indeed near to it until that I was
gone onward again for three hours more. And all that time did I yet go
downward into the night; but the Slope now did not be so utter dark.

Now, presently, I made a pause, and stood upward to my feet, so that I
should the better perceive the light. And lo! as I did look toward it, I
heard a faraway sound in the dark, as that something did set up a
strange and monstrous piping in the night. And immediately, I went to
mine hands and knees among the stones of the Slope, and kept myself low
in the darkness, so that I should be the less plain to be seen, did any
Monster approach.

But there came nothing to trouble me, and I went downward of the Slope
for yet another hour; and all the time that I did go, the sound of the
piping grew more in the great eternity of the night upon the Slope.

And by this time was I come truly near unto the light; but yet did not
behold it plainly; for it did burn beyond certain monstrous rocks that
stood between. And I went to the left for, maybe, the half of a big
mile; and all the while that I did go, the piping made a mightier
whistling in the Night; and it did seem presently as that the earth sent
forth the sound and revelry of wild roarings. And I went the more
silent; and later did kneel among three rocks, and peered forth for a
while upon the place before me.

And now, being come nigh unto the light--though yet it was not unhid
from behind the great barriers of the uprising rocks, I perceived that I
crouched within the mouth of a mighty gorge; and the left side was a
great way off, and I saw it plain at whiles when the light did rise; but
the light was to the right, and it was so wondrous great that it did
make clear to me that a mountain was to that side of the gorge, and
went upward into the everlasting night, as it did seem for ever.

And afar down the gorge, I did see the shinings of strange fires, faint
and a great way off. And so was I come at last to the bottom of the
Mighty Slope. Yet the gorge also to go downward, but not so great.

And presently I did go forward again; and so did open the point of the
rocks, as the sailors do say. And I saw now that there gushed forth a
great blue flame from the earth; and the mighty rocks stood about it, as
that they were olden giants groupt there to some strange service.

And concerning this flame I was not overmuch astonished in my Reason;
for it had seemed to me as I drew anigh, that the fire and the sound
should be made by the roaring and whistling of a burning gas that did
issue forth among the rocks. Yet, truly, though it did be a natural
matter, it was yet a wondrous sight, and set amazement on my senses; for
the flame did dance, and sway whitherward monstrously, and sometimes did
seem that it dropt so low as an hundred feet, and afterward went upward
with a vast roaring unto the utter height, and did stand mighty and
blazing, maybe a full thousand feet, so that the far side of the gorge
was lit, and surely it was seven great miles off or more; but yet did
show plain and wondrous. And the light did show me the flank of the
mountain, that made the right hand side of the Gorge, to go up
measureless into the night.

And so shall you perceive that I stayed awhile among the rocks that were
in the mouth of the gorge, that I should gaze upon this thing; but
afterward I lookt this way and that way, so that I should have a knowing
of the place where I was come.

And it was a wild and stark and empty place, as you must perceive. And
the far side did be great miles off, as I did say; and everywhere there
was abundance of rock and lonesomeness. And before me there went the
great and dim length of the gorge, and there were lights here and lights
there, in a great distance, and oft--as it did seem--the quiet dancing
of lights in diverse places; but yet were these gone on the instant. And
ever there was a strong and vacant silence upon that place.

And presently, after that I had looked once more unto the mighty dancing
flame, and perceived nowhere any life around it, I went onward down the
quiet gorge. And for a great way as I journeyed was my path lit by the
dancing of the blue flame; and oft should I seem to be going but dimly
among the rocks, and my shadow faint and long; and lo! the flame would
leap, and all the gorge come to a wondrous brightness, and my figure to
shorten, and the shadows to be black and strong. And so shall you
perceive how I went.

And oft did I turn me about to behold the dancing of the Great Light;
for it was solemn to my spirit, even amid so much of Greatness and
Eternity, to think upon that Flame, and to conceive that it had an utter
age danced there at the foot of the Mighty Slope, unseen, through
lonesome Eternities. And this I do tell unto you; that thereby may you
have some knowledge of the strangeness and the bitter loneliness of that
place; which, in verity, did seem the expressing of all the lonesomeness
of my wanderings.

And all the time as I did go downward of the great Gorge, there sounded
the blast of the roaring, that was presently afar to my back; and the
mountain sides did catch it here and in that place, and sent it offwards
with strange and improper echoings, as of a chill piping, or oddwise as
hushed whisperings of monstrous creatures; so that I did oft stoop to
hide a little among the boulders; for truly I knew not but that some
unnatural thing called from the darkness of the mountain side.

And for six hours I walked onward thus, and sometimes did hide, having a
sudden fear, as I have told.

And presently, in a great while, the roaring was sunk to a far and
monstrous piping; but in the end to no more than a far and uncertain
whistling, that yet did catch strange echoes in the night. And in the
end there was only a quietness. And yet, as you do perceive, there had
been always a silence in that Gorge, as I have told, and this to the
despite of the whistling. And I do hope that you have understanding with
me in this matter; for it was truly as I have told, and there is no
contrariness of telling in this matter.

Now in all this time that I had walked in the great Gorge, I had past
four of the far lights that I did see from the bottom of the Slope; and
the two first and the fourth were blue, but the third was green; and all
did dance and quake, and sent fitful shinings into the belly of the
Gorge. And there came also from them whistlings, and from the second one
a low and strange moaning noise; and I doubted not the gas did come
oddly and with trouble. And I past these things with no great thought;
for truly they were no matters for notice, after that which I had
beheld.

Now, as you shall mind, it was surely in the early Third of the seventh
day of my journey down the Mighty Slope that I saw the first shining of
the monstrous gas fountain; and from that time until now had there past
maybe sixteen hours. And, as you do wot, I had eat not in all my travel
since that I had seen the light; so that I was gone to a proper lack
inward; and moreover, it was full nineteen hours or more since that I
had slept; and all that while had I laboured.

And I ceased me from wandering, and lookt about that I should come to a
safe and proper place for my slumber; and this I saw very quick; for
there was dry stone and rock everywhere, and no failing of holes and
diverse places to my purpose; so that I was soon in a little cave
between two mighty boulders.

And here I eat four of the tablets; for truly so many were my due, and I
had not been violent had I eat more. And afterward, I made some of the
water, and it did fizz up in a moment; so that I perceived that but a
good pinch made a great cup-full. And this I set to the count of the
strong and heavy air, as I have told, which I did think to have a
greater power of chemistry.

And presently I slept, having my gear about me as ever, and the Diskos
to my breast. And as I went into slumber, I thought sweetly upon Naani,
as I had done, indeed, an hundred times since I was come to the
hopefulness of the lights of the Gorge.

Now, whilst I slept, I dreamed that the Master-Word did presently beat
all about me in the night. Yet, as I do mind, I waked not; and because
that I continued to sleep, I have no sure knowing whether this was truly
a dream, or an Happening. And I minded me upon it, when I waked; but
this was after that I had slept seven hours; and I could have no
sureness anywise of the matter; but only that I was come safe through my
sleep; though heavy within my head and limbs, as that the air did call
me unto a further slumbering, as is like enough.

And after that I had eat and drunk, I put my gear about me, and the
Diskos to my hip, for I needed both my hands to the task of journeying
amid the great boulders. And I set forth again down the half-light of
the mighty Gorge, and through eighteen hours I made a strong going, save
when I did pause at the sixth and the twelfth hours to mine eating.

And by the eighteenth hour was come, I was very ready to my food and
slumber; and presently I was asleep in a place of the rocks. And that
day had I past three and twenty of the dancing gas fires; and five been
like a white fire; but the others blue and green. And all did dance and
made a strange and uncertain light within the great Gorge; yet was it a
peaceful thing unto my spirit that there was truly light, as you shall
understand.

And I slept six hours, and waked, and did want more sleep, as you shall
think. But I eat and drunk and put my gear upon me, and went on downward
of the Gorge.

And at the sixth hour, after that I had eat and drunk, I came to a part
where the big gas fires did cease to dance, and there was a certain
darkness upon that place. Yet was it not a proper dark; for there came
the glimmer of a flame here and the glimmer of a flame there, as that
little flames came upward between the stones, and did vanish, and come
upward in another part. And so did light and die out constant and
forever amid the stones and the boulders of that lonesome Gorge; and
made a low-spread light, so that it did seem unto me that strange
shudders of light beat upward through the dark of that place.

And I went onward, and a heavy fume did seem to hang in the air, and
horrid gases to come upward from the earth in odd puffings; and anon a
light would leap upward beyond the next stone, and afterward vanish, and
there would be an hundred thousand such upon every hand, running to and
fore; and afterward for a moment an utter dark, and again the little
flames everywhere; so that it did seem I went one moment amid the heart
of a strange country of fire, and immediately through a country of utter
night. And this was to me strange and a peculiar matter. Yet, as I do
think, the gases did bother me the more; for they did seem as that they
were like to hurt mine health utterly; for, in verity, oft did I seem as
that I should choke and breathe no more, by reason of the poison that
came upward from among the stones and the boulders.

And all that time, as they came or went, did the little flames make
small phlocks of sound in the Gorge as they did flash or die; and the
sounds did seem, to my likening, as stones cast into an utter silent
pool; for they but made apparent the everlasting quiet of the Gorge.

And afterward, I came beyond this place, and you shall see me going very
lonesome among the rocks of the Gorge, beyond. And by this, it was come
nigh unto the eighteenth hour; and I did find a place proper to my
slumber, and did eat and drink, and was quickly gone over unto sleep.

And here, I should tell how that I had not an over-fear of Evil Powers
whilst I was in the great Gorge; for truly it did seem as that nothing
that ever did live came anigh to that wild and silent place of stone and
rock; but that I journeyed through it alone, and was surely the first
that did go that way for maybe a million years. And this feeling that
was upon me, I do hope you to perceive and take unto yourselves, and
thus have an understanding of my heart at that time.

And as you shall know, I went always unto slumber with sweet and with
troubled thoughts of the Maid. Yet, for a great while, I had been put so
mightily to the labour of my way that my heart did suffer less at this
time than should be thought; and truly it doth show me how I was drawn
unto that One with all my being, that I did surely think so oft and
sweetly upon her amid so many perils and matters of horror. And this
doth seem something strange to say, when that you do consider that I was
adventured unto these same perils and horrors but only for the sake of
the Maid.

And in six hours did I wake, as I did strive alway to set myself to do;
yet was I very heavy and slow for a little, until that I was more
properly come to wakefulness. And surely, as I did think before, this
was like to be put upon me by the weighty air of the place; but yet it
might be that the gas which did float in the Gorge was upon my lungs.
And also, as you have perceived, if but you have attended my way, the
air was grown warm, and oft were the rocks pleasant to the seat, and all
of these matters did contrive to make me slumbrous.

Now, presently, the gas fires did cease utterly in the Gorge, and I
lookt downward, along that great place, and saw only a greyness, but
above the greyness there was, as it did seem, something of a vague and
ruddy shining in the night. And this did wake me to wonder what new
thing lay before; so that I grew more eager among the boulders.

And, later, when I had eat at the sixth and the twelfth hours, and gone
on awhile, I came to a place where the Gorge made a quick turning unto
my left, and at the end of the turning was a red and glowing light that
was very great and wonderful; so that I was utter keen to come to that
place, that I should discover what made the shining. And the place where
I was come then, was very dark, because that I was nigh under the mighty
wall of the mountain of the right side of the Gorge. Yet above, as it
did seem to me, there was a far red upward glowing in the night.

Then did I go forward very fast, and presently, in a good while, I
discovered that I drew near to a second great turning, that went to the
right. And about the seventeenth hour, I came nigh unto the second great
turning. And here did I put caution upon me, and crept for a while among
the dark rocks of that place, that I should come to a sight of that
which made the monstrous red shining.

And presently, I was beyond the corner of the mountain, and did look
downward into a mighty Country of Seas, and the burning of great
volcanoes. And the volcanoes did seem as that they burned in the Seas.
And the country was full of a great ruddy light from the volcanoes. And
so shall you perceive me there among the rocks that did all stand upward
strange and bold and silent in the red and monstrous glare of the light.
And I, as it did seem, the one thing of life in all that desolation and
eternity of rock and stone, there in the end part of the great Gorge.

And I peered forth into the wonder of the light, and was full of
thrillings and fancies that I was surely come to the place where the
Lesser Redoubt had been builded. And immediately I knew that this was
not so, for surer had not Naani told how that they were in a land of
darkness. And if this did be so, truly, how wondrous and dread a way had
I yet to go, if that this Country of Seas and mighty volcanoes stood
between.

Surely, it did seem to me then as that I must wander searching unto the
world's end. And so shall you be company unto me there with my trouble
and my thoughts, and the immediate wonder and strange glory of that
mighty Country.




IX

THE DARK PYRAMID


Now in two hours more I was come clear down out of the Gorge, and stood
in that Country; and for all that I did feel fresh troubled and
bewildered, yet was I rejoiceful, as you may believe, in the surprising
light and splendour of that sudden Land.

And before that I had come down out of the great Gorge, I had stood high
within the mouth thereof, and lookt well out over the mighty Country.
And I had counted seven and twenty great volcanoes, and this doth not
take heed of two monstrous ranges of fire-hills that burned afar off,
something unto my right. Neither doth it take account of an hundred
thousand lesser places of fire.

And truly it did seem a very land of fire and water. For there was a
small fire-hill stood within a sea, as it did seem no more than a little
mile from that place where I did stand. And maybe a score to the back of
it, spread all about. And here shall I do proper to tell concerning the
seas. For there were of these, that I did count at that time, three that
were small, and a mighty sea that went onward for ever into the red
light of the fire-hills, so that it was gone utterly out of my sight,
and did show no ending.

And there rose up out of the seas, islands; and on the islands,
volcanoes. But in other parts the fire-hills did come upward straightly
from the sea. And over the near sea, as it did seem, there lay a
plentitude of steam, as that the sea did boil at whiles and in diverse
places.

And there did seem to me, as it were within the red atmosphere of that
place, as that there were a muttering thunder, low and constant, shaking
the air, now from that distance and now from this, and this did I judge
to be the voices of the fire-hills, speaking with the fire that lived in
them.

And you shall conceive how utter new was all this unto me; for there was
in that Country a constant Voice of the Energy of Life, so that the
World-Noise of this our Age was even there again, and with a keen and
undoubted apparentness; and the more so some ways, than now.

And here shall I set down more closely the things that were ready to my
gaze.

And first, that it did much attract me, there was a huge and blackened
mountain unto the left of the mouth of the Gorge, and the mountain did
go upward into the night, maybe fifteen and maybe twenty miles. And
there was a mighty peaked volcano that grew out from the side of the
mountain so high up as five miles, as I did guess that height; and this
was upon the far side. And above this there was a second, maybe nine or
ten great miles up in the blackness of the night that hung afar upward.
And, as that this were not great wonder enough, there did burn and glow
two other mighty fire-hills, at an utter height, upon the left crest of
that black mountain; and these were upward so monstrous a way, as that
they did seem to make strange and smouldering suns within the night. And
truly, as you shall perceive, this was a wondrous thing.

And below these upward fire-hills there rose up from the earth vast
mountains of ash and burned stuff, that had been cast forth by these
perched volcanoes, and had poured downward unto the earth throughout
Eternity, and so to build grey and sombre monuments unto the dreadful
glory of Time.

And to my right there was always sea and sea and the red blazing of the
fire-hills; but unto my left, there were mighty forests, and there rose
upward here and in that place, as that they were beyond the great woods,
monstrous fire-hills. And so do you take from me something of that first
impressing upon my brain and sense.

And after that I had come down out of the mouth of the great Gorge, as I
did tell a little while gone, I came upon a pause; for, surely, which
way was the way proper unto my search. And I lookt about for a great
while, and afterward did climb back into the Gorge, and called myself
foolish, that I had not thought to map my way ere I came down.

And when I was come up into the Gorge again, lo! I saw that there was
but one way that I should go; for truly, as I have said, there was only
the seas unto my right; but unto the left, where the shores did meet the
seas, there seemed, so far as mine eyes did tell to me, a clear way for
a space. And mayhap, when I had come so far, I should even find a
further way to go forward. And so did I descend again unto the Country
of the Seas, as I did ever call that red-shining country of water and
fire.

And by, that I was come again from the height of the Gorge, it was four
and twenty hours since that I did last sleep; so that I was fain that I
should put into some nook, and come to slumber, as you shall well
believe.

And I found me a neat and proper place, where three great trees grew
about a little basin of rock that was very dry and warm. And here, after
that I had eat three of the tablets, and drunk some of the water--the
while that my belly did yearn, as ever, for proper eating-stuff--I made
my bed in the little basin of the rock, and lay me down, and did begin
to think awhile upon Naani; but was gone over to sleep before that I was
aware.

And lo! I was suddenly awake, and did find that I swam in a hot water;
and a mercy, I did think, was it that I was not drowned as I did sleep.
And I gat me to my feet, and the basin was full of water, hot and
steaming, and pungent to the taste, as well I did know. And I perceived
now that the water poured in from a smoothed slit upon the far side, and
did come with a strange gurgling and bubbling, so that I conceived some
deep well to boil, and thus to drive upward this water into the basin;
and glad was I that it did not boil as it came forth.

And surely, now that I was upon the dry land, and did consider, I did
quickly suppose that the water had poured forth at seasons into the
basin for an eternity of time, and afterward did go back by fissures in
the bottom of the basin; and this to happen, as I soon did find, a
little beyond the length of every hour; and, indeed the basin to empty
slow as I did watch.

Now, being much wetted, I stript off mine armour, having before this
dipt out mine effects from the hot pool, and so did come down to the
naked flesh, and I found a place where the rock was hot, and here I did
spread my garments. And whilst that they came to dryness, I gat me into
the hot pool, and had a very pleasant bathing, and did have no great
fear of any dangerous thing; for, as it did seem, I had surely left all
such behind, within the Night Lands. Yet did I have the Diskos upon the
pool edge to my hand; for I had no proper assurance in this matter. Yet,
as it did prove, there were many monstrous beasts in that Country; but
never did I feel the nearness and horrid power of any Evil Force; for
these, as I do conceive, were congregate and gathered about the Mighty
Pyramid, being attracted thereto by the great spiritual essence of so
wondrous a multitude of humans gotten so close in one spot, even as
sharks do come after the ship that hath bullocks within. Yet, how that
the Evil Powers were given entrance unto this State of our Life, I have
no sure knowing; yet have I put forward certain thoughts on this matter
in an earlier place; and more than such thinkings is surely vanity; for
there is no certainty in my Reasoning concerning the thing.

Now, presently was my clothing dry, yet before this, I had come out from
that bath, which truly was nigh all gone backward into the earth. And I
dressed me again, and got my armour upon me, and afterward was I in a
more lightsome state of the mind; and yet very ready to come again unto
my sleep. And this I did, and had six hours more beside the pool; and
once was wakened somewhat by the gruntling and bubbling noise of the
water, that was made as the pool did fill time and again.

And when the six hours were gone, I waked very well fitted in my senses
and feelings to go forward again through that red-lighted Country, and
this I did, after that I had eat and drunk.

Now all that day I went forward at a great pace; and the nameless woods
were unto my left, and the shores of the seas unto my right. And oft did
I find that the trees grew even into the water, so that oft did I go
forward among the trees, and a very wonderful thing was this to me, that
never had known before in all my life, until I was come into that
Country, how that a glad and wild mystery doth live among forest trees.
For there was no such strange wildness among the groves of the
Underground Fields; though a solemn beauty in plenty. And the scent of
the woods was sweet unto my spirit, as you shall wot.

Now all the time that I did go, there was the shore unto my right; but
alway to my left, and around me oft-times as I did say, the great
forests. And as I did go, lo! there was life in all those darksome
woods, and living eyes did peer out odd whiles upon me, and afterward go
backward into the dark; so that I wotted not whether to fear, or to have
no heed of trouble. Yet naught did come anigh to me, to make any hurt.

And thrice in that day did I come to little fire-hills that burnt redly,
and sent out fire and noise, so that I heard their trouble each time
through the forest, before that I was come to them. And about each was
there a deadness and desolation, where the fire had killed the big
trees; yet, as I did observe, the quick life of little plants did grow
more nigh, as that they were born and lived between the times of the
fire-bursts. And this I do take it that you perceive.

And in that one day I past thirty and seven boiling springs; but whether
they boiled truly, I do have no knowledge; only that they sent out a
great steam oft-times; and some did make a strong roaring noise; so that
to hear them afar off in the forests was to think odd times that some
wild beast roared strangely.

Now, when the eighteenth hour was come, I sat me down, as I had done
upon the sixth and the twelfth hours, and eat two of the tablets, and
drank some of the water, which here did fizz very rich and quick.

And afterward I lay down to my slumber, for I was greatly wearied. And I
had chosen a place against a great rock, which was so that no creature
might come upon me from behind. And I came easy upon sleep; but yet I
did fix it upon me that I slumber only with the body; for I did know, by
the shining of the eyes in the darksome woods, that strange creatures
abode in the mighty forests.

And ere I was gone over to sleep, I thought upon Naani, as I had done
much all that day, as though her spirit did hover near unto mine, and
did strive pitiful to speak with me. And this I set out to you, that you
shall know how it did seem unto me in my thoughts and fancyings. And as
I lay there, I put a blessing upon her, and a determination into my
heart that I make a more desperate speed of my going, if that might be;
so that I come the sooner to that strange, and unknown place in the dead
world where did stand the lesser Refuge. And I was then asleep in a
moment.

And lo! sudden I was awake. And lovely was the brightness of that
Country, that did show me in a moment my danger, and did not keep me
suspend in fearful Doubt, as did the grey darkness and strange shadows
and lights of the Night Land. For I saw, on the instant that I got me to
mine elbow, how that certain things did crouch within the borders of the
trees, no more than a score paces off. And I perceived in a moment that
my spirit had been given knowledge, and had wakened me. And I stared,
the while that I did grip the Diskos; and I saw that there were six
squat men that were humpt at the neck and shoulder; and they did crouch
all there in a row, and were something hid by the shadows; and I
perceived that they watched me; and the eyes of the men did shine like
the eyes of beasts; and so shall you know somewhat of the strange terror
that came upon me. Yet had I the Diskos and mine armour; and though my
heart did shake a little, yet was my spirit assured to conquer.

Now I gat me to my feet, and had the Diskos ready within my hand; and
behold! I could not see the Humped Men, for they were gone from that
place; yet never did I see them go, though I had kept my gaze very
steadfast upon that part where they did hide. And, as you shall
understand, I was near ready to believe that there had been nothing
there within the border of the wood; yet truly I knew that the men with
the humps had been there, as I had seen.

Now, I looked presently, and found that I had slept five hours; and I
eat two of the tablets, as I did stand there, watchful; and afterward
drank some of the water; and so was ready to go forward again; for I was
grown very anxious to be gone from that place; and did have no knowledge
but that those strangely humpt Men were but a little way off, among the
trees, and might come upon me in a moment; or, further, that they did go
to call an army of other humped men to my destruction.

And after that I was ready, and had my gear secure upon me, I set off at
a great stride, and did hold the Diskos very handy, and lookt this way
and lookt that way, and all the while made onward with speed; for,
truly, I was grown so lean and hard that it did seem to me that I had
power to out-pace those men or aught else of their kind.

And all that day, through thirty great hours did I go forward, at that
stride, and did always watch; and at every sixth hour, I eat two of the
tablets and drank a little of the water, and went onward again.

And so did I hope that I was lost from those Humped Men. Yet, though I
did hope, my faith was not this wise; for twice and thrice did it come
to me that there went things through the woods to my left all that day,
and did keep always to a level with my speed; yet were always hid. And,
as you shall believe, this did be a very shaking thing to my heart, and
did make my hope of but little account.

Now, because that I had no faith to company my hope, I was not easy to
have slumber, until that I was come to a place proper and safe. And so,
as I have told, I went onward through thirty great hours; and, in truth,
in all that while I did find nowhere that did seem to fit my need.

And lo! about the end of the thirtieth hour, I perceived that there was
water ahead, besides the water of the sea that was ever to my right. And
I thought, maybe, that the sea did go inward at that part of the land;
but it was otherwise; for when I was gotten to that place, I found that
a river came into the sea, and did come out of all the country that lay
unto my left.

And in the mouth of this river, there was a small island; and surely I
did look across to the island, and think it a refuge from the Humped Men
that did surely play dog upon my going. Yet, truly, this was but an idle
thought, and my need was that I should come to some way to cross over
the river, that I go forward beside the great sea, which did stretch
onward, as it did seem for ever, before me upon the far side.

And I knew not how to go across; for I had no power to swim, and had I
swum, there were surely monsters in that great and warm-flowing river,
as you shall believe.

And I went upward of the river-bank, that I might come to some place
where the river did narrow; and surely I had been like to walk a mighty
distance to this purpose, but that I came soon to a second river that
did enter the first, not a mile above the shore of the sea; so that, as
you do perceive, there was the sea to one side of me, and this second
river unto the other, and the first river before me; and thus was I
sorely perplexed, as any had been truly that was in a like trouble.

Yet, as it did chance, the need to go forward, and the danger of the
Humped Men, put wit into me, so that I lookt about for a tree that was
fallen. And there were many, yet great, so that I was much wearied and
something strained of the spirit, before that I gat two little trees
unto the water.

Now, when this was done, I made me a rough pole of a young tree-plant;
and afterward, I lashed the two trees together with my belts and straps,
and so had somewhat of a raft.

And you shall picture that, all the time as I did go about this
business, I was very heedful lest the Humped Men should come upon me,
ere that I was gone free upon the water. And this constant heeding did
double the labour of my work, as you shall perceive; yet, in the end, it
was done, and I ready to adventure over the river.

And so I did push off with the pole, and I pusht and paddled maybe the
half of an hour, for, indeed it was all a clumsy contriving, and mayhap
I the more so in my labours. Yet, presently, I was come so far over,
that I drew nigh to the island; and it did seem a wise and proper thing
that I should have my slumber there, and afterward go onward to the
farther shore. And this I did; and after that I had eat and drunk, as
ever, I lay down to sleep. And by this time it was three and thirty
hours since last I did slumber; so that I was bitterly awearied.

And I had a great and restful sleep; for, truly, the island did seem a
very safe place; and, in verity, I came to no harm, though I was as a
dead man for nine great hours; and so shall you perceive my weariness.

And when I was come proper awake, I eat two of the tablets, and drank
some of the water; and afterward made an end of my voyage, and then did
take back my belts and straps from binding the trees, and so forward
again upon my way, and no more fearful of the Humped Men; for, surely, I
did think I had left them all upon the far shore of the river; though
afterward I minded me that they might grow likewise upon the two sides;
but yet was I only discovered by those upon the one, as you do know.

And all that day I went very swift, and past many strange matters and
did coast upon wonders oft. And at the sixth and the twelfth hours did I
eat and drink, as ever; and between the eighth and the fourteenth hours
did I come past two mighty fire-hills, that made all the Country to
tremble with their noise. And four times did monstrous creatures pass by
me; but I was swift hid, and came to no harm.

And oft as I did go, were my thoughts upon the dear Maid that I
journeyed to save from destruction. Yet, as you must see, always were my
thinkings brought sharply unto my going; so that scarce was I ever set
off to ponder upon Naani, but that there came some danger or wonder to
give me heed to my way. And because of this, as you have learned, I was
more put to plan free of the instant trouble and peril of my way,
through all that mighty journey, than to have quiet chance for thoughts
of love unto mine Own. Yet, truly, was not my journey one whole thought
of love unto Naani? And, that peril made oft dumb my brain, was but the
truer song unto my Maid.

And at times I was among trees; but oft did go past unnumbered boiling
springs and small fire-hills; and oft was the air full of the noise of
the little fire-hills, and the roar of the boiling springs; but there
came no harm unto me.

And a thousand times did I perceive things that had life; and I made a
very cautious way; though with a great speed and cleverness of going
that made my heart glad.

And oft did I come to parts where a great life held the trees, and green
stuff did flourish exceedingly, and the air rich and full and wondrous
sweet; so that I was fain to think how that in some far-off time, it
might be that our children's children should come down unto this
Country, when the Upper Valley of the Night Land was grown to an utter
chill and lacking of air; and here build them a new Refuge, if, indeed
any should come clear of the Evil Forces and the Monsters that did live
about the Mighty Pyramid in the Night Land. Yet, how should they come
clear of those things; so that this is, as you do perceive, no more than
a thought that did rise vaguely in me. And yet, again, who shall say
what may be?

And onward I did pass, and I do mind me how that I saw the lower fires
of that Country to burn very fierce; and this I set to the richness of
the air; but yet with no surety of knowledge; and do but tell the same
that you shall see the oddments of thought that went oft across my
brain, and so have so much knowledge as I, concerning this and that.

Now, a little before the eighteenth hour was come, I came out from among
the trees, and the sea was downward of a great cliff unto my right, for
I had gone upward for a long and weary hour. And I did see now a thing
that made me to be cautious, and yet that did hold my heart to go
swiftly to perceive the thing; for it was very strange.

And I went forward quickly, yet with a wise care; and so was come
presently more nigh. And I perceived that the thing was, in part, a high
rock, very tall and pointed and maybe an hundred feet high; but
afterward I did find it to be more. And there was a monstrous great
thing upon the top of the rock, that did seem very strange; and I stopt
and lookt, and afterward went forward again; and so for a time, until
that I was but a little way off. And now I saw that there did seem to be
a mighty long rock laid across the topmost part of the upstanding rock,
and yet had a very strange and shapely appearance; and did seem upon the
underpart to be as that I had lookt before upon it. And upon the upper
part, there grew trees and green things, even as these did grow upon odd
ledges of the upstanding rock. Yet, for the most, the rock was very
stark, as that a blast had blown upon it, and made it bare.

Now, when I had lookt for a while, I bethought me that this should be a
safe and proper place for my slumber, if that I had power to come safe
to the top. And when I had thought this thing, I began at once to climb
up the rock; and I found that the rock was very high; so that in a while
I was come a great way off the earth, and yet was not come to the top of
the rock. And because that I was awearied, I lookt about for a safe
place to mine hand, and lo! there was a shelf of the rock very nigh,
that went inward a little to the side.

And I gat me to this ledge, and did eat and drink, and presently I
slept, and scarce had thought of Naani in the moment of my slumbering;
for a great weariness was upon me, the which I do think to have come by
reason that I was not yet proper rested from the task of the day that
was gone before that one.

Now I waked very sudden, maybe seven hours after; and I had knowledge
within me that my spirit did wot of some nigh danger. And I gat upward
from the rock, very quiet, and had the Diskos ready in my hand. And I
lookt swift about me in the moment that I did wake; yet did see nothing;
for there was naught on the ledge with me.

And I crept to the edge, and lookt downward, and lo! I did see that
there came up the rock two Humped Men; and they did climb very swift and
silent; and I perceived that they smelled me, and came to destroy me.
And I made ready the Diskos to do battle, and ceased not to look
downward. And I saw how that the Humped Men did seem to be humpt by
reason of their being so monstrous thick and mighty of the neck and the
shoulder, as that they had been human bulls. And I saw that they were
very strong, and by the speed of their climbing, I knew they were swift;
and so did I make steady my attention and my heart to the saving of my
life; for truly I did know that I should be dead in a little, or they.

Now I stept back a space from the edge of the rock, and had the Diskos
very ready; for it was needful that I should kill one of those brute men
speedy, that I have no danger that one take me in the back, whilst that
I fight with the other.

Then, in a moment it did seem, there came upward of the rock edge, the
great and brutish face of the man. And in that moment that I slew him, I
did note curiously how that he had large teeth upon each side of the
mouth; and was aware that he had come so quiet as a great cat. And in
the backward parts of my brain, I bethought that even thus, maybe, was
primal man, so that a strange and secondary questioning and wondering
did live in that part of me; and I did learn from these scarce conscious
reasonings that I was of belief the thing was truly a man; but very
crude and dangerous. And surely it is strange that I had all this
thought in that little moment; but in verity so it was; though I doubt
not but I bettered it with after thoughts, when a while had gone.

Now the first man died ere his great haired breast was come upward over
the rock; and he sank back, and sagged and fell dully, and I heard him
bodge downward from rock to rock, very lumbersome; and so in a moment
was silence.

Then did I look this way and that way of the ledge; for the second Humpt
Man was not yet upon me; and I feared that the pause did mean a cunning
mischief and strategy. And when a little time had past, and all the
while I was ready with the Diskos, and naught did come upward to harm
me, I stept very soft to the edge of the rock-ledge, and lookt downward;
but there was nowhere any thing to see.

Now, for a little moment, I did think that the brutish man had run off,
being feared by the death that I did deal unto the first; yet I put this
from me at once; for I did wot that such a creature did not be like to
fear in such wise; but was rather set to some horrid cunning of attack,
as I did fear, and was somewhere below me among the holes of the great
rock.

Then I did think sudden that he might be gone upward, so that he should
come down upon my back, and I lookt upward of the mighty rock; but did
see naught; and afterward I stoopt forward a great way beyond the edge,
so that I should perceive whether the man did hide beneath. And, behold!
he was there below me, and crouched under the rock-shelf, ready to his
spring. And in that moment, he made unto me with so mighty a leap as any
tiger should give. And he came half over the edge, and gript the Diskos
by the handle, in an instant.

And surely I had lost that trusted weapon, or been pulled over and cast
into the depth, but that the Diskos did spin, and the Earth-Current did
make live the handle--as was intended--save where the "grip" was set.
And lo! the man gave loose the handle very swift, for it had burned and
shaken the creature sore. And I staggered back, with the effort I had
made to withhold the Diskos; and the brutish man came upward again over
the rock edge, and leapt at me. Yet he gat me not; for I sprang unto my
right, and made a blow with the Diskos, even as I did leap. And the blow
came something short; but yet harmed the Humpt Man with a gash upon the
belly, very sore and horrid among the great brown hairs of the man. And
immediately he sprang after me; but I smote full at the face; so that he
leaped back from the strange roar and blaze of the Diskos, and yet was
harmed; for he gat not right free of the blow; but did be cut very sore
on the mighty and haired arm.

Now, seeing that he was something feared of the weapon, I ran in upon
him, and smote again at the face; yet was the man gone out of my reach
before that the blow did reach; for, truly, he was quick as a panther.
And immediately, he did leap unto the ending of the ledge, where it did
join upon the Rock; and he caught the living Rock between his two hands.
And truly the Rock must have been splitten there; for he tore out a
monstrous lump, so great near as my body; and did run upon me with the
rock above the head of him.

Now, I perceived I should be smashed in a moment, if that I did not slay
the man very quick. For so mighty was he, that he did leap this way and
that way after me, as though the great rock did cumber him no more than
it had been but a light matter.

And you shall perceive that I leapt this way and that way, to avoid the
man; and twice did strike him; but yet was feared to brake the Diskos
upon the rock, which the man did use as a shield each time that I did
make a blow. And all the while, I did act to escape when that the man
should cast the rock, as I did conceive at the first to be his intent.
Yet, truly, it was as that he had no wotting that a rock may be thrown;
for he strave only to come at me with the rock, that he should crush me,
as with a monstrous club. And, in verity, what should a man do against
so horrid an attack.

And time and oft did I leap now to the right and now to the left, and
again in a moment, I did cut the Humpt Man; but the blow was something
turned off by the great rock in the hands of the man; yet so strange and
mighty was the power of the Diskos, that it shore away a small portion
of the rock, and did come to no hurt in itself.

And, surely I had presently failed in wind and limb, because of the
leapings and chargings that I did make; and because of the weight of the
armour, that was not overmuch, yet to be considered; but that I fainted
not, was by reason of the wondrous hardness and leanness that I was
grown to, with so constant a journeying and strait living; for the
tablets did keep the strength in a man, though, truly, they eased not
the yearnings of the belly.

And lo! even the brutish man did grow weary, and the hot breath and
body-stink to come from him; and surely who shall wonder, for always he
did rush to and fro upon me, with the monstrous rock to crush me. And
sudden, I leapt unto the right of the man, thinking within me that I did
perceive a chance that I should cut him upon that side; but, truly, he
was less awearied than I did know; for he came very sharp upon me, and
had me between him and the wall of the Rock; and surely I had no room to
make escape, and had died in a moment, but that I made a sudden sham
toward the left with the Diskos, as that I should leap that way. And in
the same instant, I did go to the right with a strong bounding; and
immediately did come in upon the Humpt Man from that side; and I put my
fortune of life to the stroke, and stood anigh to the man, and I smote
him across the middle part, before that he did wot of my intent. And the
blow slew the man very surely, and did nigh cut the mighty creature in
twain. And surely he fell, half leaping even as he died, so that the
monstrous rock that was in the hands of the brutish man, did crash down
almost upon my feet, and I leapt very high that I should escape the
thundering of the rock; for in verity, I was near slain in that last
moment of the life of the Humpt Man. But yet I lived and came free of
death, and did have a relief of happiness about my heart, as you shall
believe.

Yet, truly, I was much shaken; and a little weakness took me, so that I
was fain to go down upon the rock-shelf, that I have back my strength.

And presently, I was grown steady again, and I took my gear, and did
haste down the Rock, and so was come presently to the earth again. And I
saw the first of the Humpt Men that I did slay, lying very quiet a
little off from the bottom of the Rock; so that I went round upon the
other side to avoid the man; for it was no pleasure to mine eyes or to
my heart. And, truly, it did trouble me always to make a death.

And when I was come round upon the other, which was the seaward, side of
the Rock, I perceived that I was yet shaken; and I remembered that it
were wise to eat and drink and rest a little, before that I did go
further upon my way.

Now, as I did sit there at the bottom of the Rock, I looked upward at
the strange crown thereof; and until that time, I had been taken up with
the fight and with gazings this way and that to see whether there came
others of the Humped Men to work me an harm.

But now that I was given some ease of the mind and of the body, I saw
plainly that I knew the thing that lay upward upon the Rock; for the
shape had been something strange and half-known to me even before that
moment, as that I had a vague knowledge concerning it; but yet with no
surety. And now, truly, I did know in a little instant that the thing
was one of the olden flying-ships, the which, as you shall mind, there
were certain in the Great Museum of the Mighty Pyramid.

And surely, I was ready to wonder why that I had not seen the thing
plain before that moment; yet was this like to be because that there was
a shadow upon the other side of the great Rock; but upon this side there
was a little fire-hill a way off to the cliff edge, and this did throw a
warm light that made a glimmer upon the dull metal of the ship's bottom,
which was uncovered to my sight, and was surely of that same deathless
grey metal that made the Great Redoubt.

And yet, as you shall believe, even as I said this thing to my mind,
that the strange matter upon the top of the Rock was truly one of the
olden air-ships, I did feel that I should be proper to doubt; for it was
a very wondrous thing to perceive a thing common to man, in that utter
strange Country, and after that I was gone so far off from the Mighty
Pyramid. Yet, in verity, I did know in my heart that it was indeed that
which I did perceive it to be; and I did stand and walk to and fore and
look upward constant; for I was very keen that I look well upon it.

And truly, as I did look from this place and from that place, it was
scarce a thing for wonder that I had not wotted it to be an air vessel;
for there were great trees and abundance of earth and living matters
upon the topmost side of the ship; so that none could easy perceive it
to be aught save a great and desolate rock that did lie upon the other
rock. Yet, truly, it was as I have told; and presently I did make to
climb upward of the great Rock, that I should come to the air vessel to
enter it. But yet was this not proper; for I had surely no duty save to
go forward forever, until that I found the Maid; but yet did I spend a
little while to this searching of the ship; and I do but set down that
which I did, and with a serious spirit. And truly, as it doth here occur
to me, I do be ever seeming a serious young man, as you maybe shall have
grown to think; but yet was I to a dread and serious business, and the
strain did be too great upon me and the trouble too much prest upon my
heart to give me much of laughter, as you do surely perceive, and so you
to give me your ear and your understanding. For, indeed, before that I
did lose Mirdath my Beautiful One, I was not over-grave; but so young
and joyous as any.

Now it took me a great time to go upward of the Rock; for it was so
monstrous steep and high. Yet, presently was I come nigh under the
bottom of the ship; and here I did perceive that she had been sore
battered in that far-off age when she did come upon the Rock; for,
surely, as I did perceive, the peak of the Rock was through the bottom
of the ship, so that the metal was burst this way and that, and very
plain to be seen in some parts; but in other places the earth and
growing matters did make a hiding.

And after that I had climbed this way and that way, I perceived that I
must come to the topmost part by the plants that did hang over, and grow
downward. And after that I had pulled upon them, to know that they were
strong to hold me, I went upon them, and was soon to the top of the
ship. Yet, truly, I might so well have been upon the earth; for the ship
was covered above by the earth and dust of a monstrous age of years; so
that I was like to need much time to dig downward unto the ship; and
because of this, I considered a little while, and afterward made no more
to search her; but did go downward again, that I should come once more
to my journey. Yet, as you shall think, it was with a queer thrilling of
the heart, and with strange thoughts upon the end of those that did
come, maybe, to a bitter and lonesome dying in that ship of the air, in
that far-off time when she did fly.

And surely, it did seem to me as I went downward of the great Rock, how
that the flying-ship had been there for an hundred thousand years; and
that mayhaps the sea did live all about the Rock in that Age; and truly
this was no improper thing to think, for it was like that the sea had
been monstrous high and great in those days; so that the Rock was but a
little island in the midst of the sea; and now was the sea gone small
from a great sea to lesser seas, and this through an eternity of years.
And always, as it doth seem to me, had the ship lain upon the Rock, and
lookt quiet and silent over the change and wonder and the lonesomeness
of all that Country of Fire and water, for ever.

But how the air-ship did come upon the rock, how shall I know; save,
maybe, it doth seem as that she might have flown low over the sea in
that olden age, and come hard upon the Rock, because, maybe, there was
one to the helm that did steer unwittingly. And again, it shall well be
otherwise, and I do but set down mine odd thoughts; and such as they be,
they have no especial use, save that they do show to you the different
workings of my mind at that time, as I did go downward. And so to set
you the more in possession of all that I did have knowledge of.

And presently, I was come again to the earth, and did go forward with a
great speed, so that I should waste no more of that day. Yet, oft did I
think upon that ship hid there upon the mighty Rock, under the wondrous
quiet ashes of eternity.

And I went eighteen hours walking, and in all that time I did see no
more of the Humped Men; yet three times was I put in a sudden danger,
for there went past me thrice, between the fourteenth and the
seventeenth hours, great flying monsters, that were winged very ugly,
and did go, as I thought, in a great bounding, rather than that they did
fly proper as doth a bird. Yet I suffered no hurt from these; for I was
swift to hide between the great boulders that were very plenty in that
part; but no trees. For I was gone now past the forests of trees; there
being none since that I had gone through a very shallow river, that I
came to about the thirteenth hour. And this had I waded, and sounded my
path with the staff of the Diskos; but I had kept mine armour upon me,
lest there be things, even in water so shallow, that might bite and work
harm upon me. But I gat through pretty quick, and had no hurt done me.
Now I had eat, as ever, at the sixth and the twelfth hours; and by that
the eighteenth hour was come, I was nigh again unto a forest, that came
down to the shore that went alway upon my right; and I to be very sore
and wearied, as you shall know; for I had fought very desperate after my
waking, and afterward climbed the great Rock, and then again to journey,
so that it was, by this, nigh to one and twenty hours since that I did
sleep.

And surely, I lookt this way and that way, constant, and did see no
place proper to my slumber. But afterward, I considered I did be a fool,
to lack such; for truly the trees were plentiful, and I could climb a
great one, and strap my body safe, and so have a sure bed for my rest.
And I did this thing, and went upward into a great tree, and did tie my
body to the tree, with my belts; yet I eat and drank before that I went
up the tree.

Now when I was fast upward in the tree, and had made a bed upon a
monstrous branch, and had the Diskos ready upon my hip, so that it
should not fall but be nigh to my hand, I lay a little while thinking
upon Naani; and I went not over to sleep immediately, which was strange;
yet mayhaps because that my bed was so uncertain.

And I considered very gravely how that it was a monstrous long while
since that I did hear the Master-Word from the dear Maid; and truly I
was come a dreadful way from mine home, which was the Mighty Pyramid;
for I had gone onward for ever through five and twenty great days of
travel, and was not yet come to any place that did appear like to be
that place where the Maid did abide.

And it did seem that I might even wander onward in that great Country of
Fire and Water for a time beyond all that I had before gone; and this
thought did put a great weight of trouble and weariness upon my heart;
for the Maid had been in sore need of me, and I did feel sudden to be
all adrift in the wilderness. But before this time, it had seemed as
that I surely went aright. And mayhaps your sympathy shall tell you just
how I to feel in the heart.

And after that I had lain there very awkward, and thought upon all
matters, I minded me that I would try the compass again upon the morrow;
but had no great hopes of the machine; yet did be willing to try aught
to see where I had gotten to. And truly, as it did come to my mind, if
that the compass did point a little as I did wot it was used to point in
the Lesser Redoubt, then, in verity, I was surely come something more
anigh to that unknown place of the world than I did dare to believe. And
this to be plain to you.

Then a little time did pass in which I did wake and sleep, and wake and
sleep, a little; but with no surety of sleep; but as that I was very
tired of the heart, and did but lie too wearied to come properly to
sleep.

And odd whiles I did lie with mine eyes half to open, and did look very
dreamful upward among the dark branches of the tree, as they did show
black and pretty against the redness of the shining that came from the
sea; for there was stood a great and bright-burning fire-hill in that
part of the sea that lay off the shore from me. And above the glaring of
the fire-hill, there was the deep night that did brood for ever above in
a monstrous black gloom of eternity, and did make the red smoke of the
volcano to show deep and mighty and thunderous-seeming, afar up in the
great dark. And the red and shining smoke did but show the utter
hugeness of the night, that had been upon the world through the great
ages.

And, in verity, as I did lie there so dreamful, it did come to me afresh
how wondrous strange was mine adventure; and how that I did lie warm and
alive in a Country of red light and smoking seas. And, truly, as I did
remember and consider, there was a great and lost world above me, upward
through the dark ... maybe an hundred and fifty great miles up in the
grim night.

And this thing did strike me very solemn, as I did lie; and I do trust
that you conceive how that there was, in truth, afar above in the
eternal and unknown night, the stupendous desolation of the dead world,
and the eternal snow and starless dark. And, as I do think, a cold so
bitter that it held death to all living that should come anigh to it.
Yet, bethink you, if one had lived in that far height of the dead world,
and come upon the edge of that mighty valley in which all life that was
left of earth, did abide, they should have been like to look downward
vaguely into so monstrous a deep that they had seen naught, mayhaps,
save a dull and utter strange glowing far downward in the great night,
in this place and in that.

And surely, as you shall have seen, I have set the Great Deep of the
Valley to be, maybe, an hundred and fifty miles of night; for, as you do
mind, it was conceived that the Valley of the Night Land was an hundred
miles deep, and mayhap to be more; and I had come from that Place
downward of the Mighty Slope, and of the Gorge, a very great way. Yet,
in verity, I do believe in my heart this measuring was utter wrong; for
I think the deep to have been monstrous, beyond these miles that I do
give; yet have I no proving of this belief, and do set it down for no
more than it is.

Now, presently, I had ceased from these vague thinkings and half
dreamings, and was gone truly to sleep. Yet, nowise did I sleep very
strong; but did seem to come anigh to wakefulness, this time and that.
And, as it did chance, this was mayhaps a very good thing for my life;
for I did presently come awake more surely, and did turn on the great
branch; for there was a noise in the air, that was not the noise of the
great fire-hill.

And the noise did grow, very heavy and lumbersome. And, in a moment,
there came seven Humped Men, running among the trees, as that some
monstrous thing did pursue. And immediately they were beneath the tree
in which I did lie; so that a great fear came upon me, and I loosed the
belt from the branch, that I should be free to fight.

And, directly upon this, I saw that the men did leap upward into the
tree, beneath me; but not as that they did wot of me or make to come at
me; but as that they did pay a great heed to some creature or happening
that was far off among the trees. And surely, the noise did seem to come
from that part, and did grow loud and mighty, and the Humped Men did all
crouch very silent, and did make no noise or motion one to the other;
but were quiet upon the lower branches.

And, as I did look now more to my ease, I perceived that they had each a
great stone, and bloody, that did seem as that it were split to a
certain sharpness, even as a stone doth break very natural. And they
carried the stone under this arm or under that arm, so that they had
their hands free to all matters.

And, alway the noise did come the more anigh, and I saw that a Humped
Man did come running from among the trees, and did run beneath that
place where the seven Humped Men did be on the branches. But they made
no sign to the man, to save him; yet truly it was very plain that some
monster pursued the man.

And immediately I saw how this thing was; for the Humped Man upon the
ground, did not run so fast as might be; and I conceived that he did act
to make some creature to come after him, to pass under the men within
the tree. And surely this thing did prove to be; for there came very
quick, a great and ugly thing, that had an ugly way of putting down the
feet, and did have seven feet to each side, which was very strange; and
the back was as that it were horny, and the belly of the thing did seem
to brush heavy upon the earth, and it grunted, as it went, and shook the
earth with the weight of it; so that a monstrous noise came from it,
upon so hasty a journey. And I did wot that it was not such a thing as
did properly pursue after matters of food; but did rather eat of that
which did need little haste, but a monstrous strength, to gain. And that
it did so make after the man, was in truth because that it had been
wounded and made fierce; for, indeed, there came blood from the creature
from great wounds upon the back; but how these were made, I could not
know in that instant.

And it did go under the tree in which I was hid; and in that moment when
it past under the tree, the seven Humped Men did leap out of the
branches, and did catch to the brute by the great horns of the spine;
and I saw that the wounds were in the joints of the spine, as was plain
when the back did work, with the going of the creature. And the seven
Humped Men took the sharp stones from under their arms, and did strike
very brutal in the wounds that were in the joints of the spine; and the
creature roared and cried, and went onward into the trees at a great
speed; and in all the time that it ran, the Humped Men ceased not to
strike with the stones.

And sudden, when it was gone a distance off, it did roll very swift over
upon the back, first to the right, as that it would go that way; so that
the Humped Men did leap off upon the other side. And immediately the
creature rolled to that side; and there ran clear of the brute only four
of the Humped Men; so that I knew that three were slain. And afterwards,
they that lived, ran beyond the beast, and gat up into a second tree,
and the one that was chased, did entice the creature to follow, and so
did tease it once more to pass beneath the other men; and they very
swiftly again to the back of the creature; and so from my sight,
striking with the great stones, and the beast bellowing very loud and
piteous. And how many of the Humped Men there were to the beginning of
that strange hunting, I know not; but surely there were few that lived
to the end.

And surely there were such things as this thing in the beginning of the
world, and again was it thus in the end; and I did ponder this a little
while, as I did sit upon the great branch, and hearken unto the sound of
the hunting, that was now gone a great way off, and was presently beyond
my hearing.

And afterward, I gat me to the earth, and did look this way and that
way, to see that no beast was anigh, neither any of the Humped Men; and
afterward, I eat two of the tablets and drank some of the water.

And when I had gat this far to a readiness for my going, I minded me
that I should try the compass again, as I did intend. And surely the
machine did point between the North and the South, upon the Westward
arc, even as Naani had told unto me; yet, as it did seem, with somewhat
more of a Southward pointing than she had made me to think. And because
of this telling of the compass, a great ease came upon my spirit; for,
surely, was not this but a sure sign that I did go direct unto that
hidden place of the world where the Lesser Refuge did abide; but yet was
not come over-close, so that the pull of the Mighty Earth-Current of the
Great Redoubt was something stronger than in the place where was the
Little Pyramid.

And all this did I think very swift to myself, and had a glad uplifting
of the heart, as you do perceive; so that I went forward upon my
journey, with a great stride, and did scarce fear any strange thing that
all the Country did hold, in that moment.

And I went all that day at a strong pace, and did be oft tempted to send
the Master-Word unto Naani; yet did keep from so foolish an acting, the
which, mayhaps, had brought straightway upon me an Evil Power, and had
given me to Destruction when that I was near come to the succour of the
Maid. And it was this quick and constant fear of the Evil Forces of the
Night Land, that did keep me ever from calling unto Naani, lest that
they should discover me, and follow after; and this, I doubt not, you to
know by now so well as I.

Now, by the sixth hour, I was come into a part of the Country where
there were an exceeding abundance of steam fountains and sprayings and
great upboilings of water in basins of rock; and the air did be full of
the sounds and the roarings of the boilings and the spoutings, and of a
hot mist and spray; so that, truly, I had scarce the power to see to my
front, nor to any side.

And here, presently, I made a pause, and did eat and drink, and
afterward went forward again; and I did keep the shore of the sea always
to my right, and so did go proper to my way; yet with no great ease; for
the sea also did steam very strong in that part, and because of this
great fog of steam, I was surely much laboured to make a great speed,
lest unseeing I go headlong into an hole of the boiling water.

And in the ninth hour, I did go clear of the hot boilings, and was come
again free of the mist and the steam, and might look with mine eyes to
my going. And, surely, as I did perceive, I was come to the end of the
great sea that had been ever to my right; for it did go against the feet
of great and monstrous mountains, that went upward for ever into the
night, and did seem as that they were the hither wall of that strange
Country of Fire and Water. And so was I stood there very much taken upon
doubt; for how should I go farther.

And after that I had been there a while, in a bewilderment of doubt and
of wit, I went to the left, along the feet of the mountains; and truly
this but of common sense; for how might I go any other way, save I go
back again!

And at the twelfth hour I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the
water, and went forward once more. And lo! at the fifteenth hour, I was
come to a place between the mountains, even an upward gorge, very dark
and gloomy, and without light for a great way.

And, in verity, I did not want to go up the gorge, in that it was so
dreary a place and narrow and horrid and drear-seeming, after the light
and wideness of the Country in which I did yet stand.

And presently, I did go past the mouth of the gorge, that I should learn
whether there went another way out of that Country. And thiswise, for a
great hour more, along the feet of the mountains, and did presently come
to a monstrous black river, that was, maybe, a mile wide. And it to be
very shallow, and seeming as that the water scarce to cover the mud of
the bottom. And here and there a great steam did come from it, and
spirtings and moundings-up of the mud in many places, and monstrous
babblings and puffings-up of strange smoke, as that a great heat went
beneath it in this place and in that.

And surely it went backward into the country for a mighty way, so far as
my sight did go; and I did think it to be no river, but truly a further
sea. And there was no way across; for there were no trees anigh, to make
me a raft, neither might I wade across; for it might be shallow here and
deep there, and the mud be in all places. And, moreover, I had been like
to be caught in one of those upburstings of mud, even did I have a raft
to go upon. And because of all these things, I gat me back again to the
Gorge, and presently I did go upward into the darkness.

Now, I went upward very steady, save that I did stumble oft, and did go
through six great hours. And truly it did seem that I went in an utter
dark, because that I had been awhile in so constant a light.

And, by that I had been six hours in the Gorge, I was gone right away
from the Country of the Seas, and did be as that I was back into some
place that was like to the dreadness of the Night Land. For there were
in this place and in that place of the Gorge, red fire-holes, even as in
the Night Land. Yet not many until that I was come a great way up of the
Gorge. And there did be life of horrid things about the fires, as soon I
did wot; so that I made to keep off from them. Yet, as you shall
perceive, I must come oft pretty near, because that the Gorge was
nowheres scarce an hundred good paces across, and did oft come very
narrow, so that I did come oft anigh to the fire-holes, whether that I
did heed to or not.

And all that time, and ever, did the Gorge go very sharp upward, so that
it was a very weary thing to make great trial of speed, as you shall
know. But yet I went so fast as I could do; for I was grown sudden very
excited about the heart, and to feel as that I did surely draw anigh to
that strange and hid place of the world, where was the Lesser Refuge.

And when I had gone upward through six great hours, as I did say, I took
caution for a place proper to slumber; for I was surely very wearied.

And I saw a place presently, afar upward of the dark side of the Gorge,
upon the right, where a ledge of the Rock did show in the glaring from
one of the fire-holes that made a gloomy light in that place. And I
climbed unto this ledge, and did find it to be secure, and awkward to
come upon. And presently, after that I had eat and drunk, I did compose
myself unto sleep, the which came very speedy upon me, whilst yet I did
believe I thought only upon the sweetness of the Maid. And truly it had
been something over three and twenty hours, since last I did sleep; so
that I was greatly awearied.

And in six hours I waked and did eat, and did climb downward again to
the Gorge, and so unto mine upward journey.

Now, as you do perceive, when that I was come properly a great way up
the Gorge, and had come among the fire-holes, there was no more an utter
darkness, for the dull red glare of the pits beat upward upon the black
sides of the rock-mountains, that did make the sides of the Gorge; so
that oft I did see both sides very plain in the lower parts; yet of the
height of the Gorge, who might know aught; for the black sides did go
upward for ever into the everlasting night.

And because of the light from the fire-pits, I did see, time and oft
about the fires, horrid monsters, both that were snakes, and others like
to scorpions so great as my head; but no more than these for a long
while. And afterward I perceived that surely other matters did move
among the rocks of the Gorge; so that I did keep the Diskos very ready
in mine hand; yet had truly no use for it all that day.

Now I eat and drank at the sixth and the twelfth hours, and went onward
at a very strong speed. And at the sixteenth hour, I did seem as that I
knew the aether to be stirred about me, and the beat of the Master-Word
very faint upon mine inward ear. And immediately, a wondrous great and
lovely thrilling did wake all my being; for surely, I said, this was the
spirit of my love, calling unto me with her brain-elements. And, indeed,
this was a very proper and sensible thinking; for had the Master-Word
been sent from the Mighty Pyramid, I had been like to hear it very
plain, by reason of the force of the Earth-Current which was with them
and to their command. But, as you do know, the Earth-Current was nigh
gone from the Peoples of the Lesser Refuge; so that they were over-weak
to make any proper calling. And this I have spoken of before this place.

Yet, in a little while, as I did stand very hushed, that I should hark
the better, I was come to doubt whether that I did truly hear the
Master-Word. And one moment I did say that it had surely beat in the
night about me; and immediately would I be just so unsure; and so in a
while I gat once more to my journey, and had doubt in my heart; yet, as
you shall conceive, more of hope. And because of this thing, I went
onward for thirty great hours from the time that I did wake; for my
heart was excited within me. And when that I had gone so long forward as
this, I did see how that I did foolishly; and I lookt about for a place
for my slumber; and I found a small cave that was clean and empty, as I
did discover by the shining of the Diskos which I made to spin a little
time. And the cave was in the cliff of the mountain that made the right
side of the Gorge, and was nigh twenty good feet from the bottom of the
Gorge, and hard to approach.

And when I was come secure into the cave, and sure that it was proper to
my purpose, I eat four of the tablets, as was just and nice to my belly,
and did afterward drink some of the water, and so to my slumber; and all
the while, very sweet and strong in my thoughts upon Naani; so that
surely I was a little time before that I had myself rightly unto sleep.

And I slept six hours, and did wake, for I had set my spirit hard unto
such wakening; yet was I still greatly yearning for sleep. But this did
go somewhat, when that I had fought a little with my need. And
afterward, I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the water, and
did gat my gear upon me, and was presently down unto the Gorge; and so
again to my journey.

Now in all that day I did go with a very stern speed; for it did seem as
that my soul did know for surety that I was truly come something nigh
unto that hid place in the night where I should find mine Olden Love
again. And the sweet hope that was bred of the calling that had seemed
truly to sound about my spirit, was in all my being, and more sure on
that day, than before that I had slept.

And I went thirty hours in all, even as before, ere that I did come
again to sleep, and I eat and drank at every sixth hour, so that my
strength should abide within me. And by that I was come to the ending of
the thirty hours, I was sorely awearied, and gat me upward of the
monstrous cliff that did make the left side of the Gorge, having
perceived in a place a great ledge of the rock, that did seem very
proper for my purpose of slumber.

And when I was come upward upon the ledge of the rock, I saw that there
did seem something, like to a mighty spider, that did stay half without
of a hole in the back part of the ledge. And I smote the thing gently
with the Diskos, so that it was very quickly dead; and afterward I
searched well about; but did gladly perceive that there abode there no
other horrid creature.

And I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the water; and did
afterward make me ready for slumber, as ever. But now I did put the
cloak well about me; for truly there was grown a chill into the air of
the Gorge; and here also will I tell how that it did seem unto me that
the air was gone something from that great thickness and strength which
had been with me in the past days of my journeying.

Now I was gone so tired, that I fell upon sleep in a moment, yet with a
dear thought and anxious, concerning Naani; but was so starved of the
body for slumber, that even mine anxiousness kept me not awake. And I
was then so fast with sleep that I knew naught for eight hours of very
sound slumber. And then did I awake, and very thankful of the heart that
no evil beast or creeping thing had come upon me whilst that I was so
utter lost in sleep.

And now, truly, was I something fresh and ready; and I ate and drank,
and had my gear once more upon me, and so down into the Gorge. And
afterward, I went upon my journey for eighteen hours, and did pause but
a little while at the sixth and the twelfth hours that I should eat and
drink.

And when the eighteenth hour was nigh come, I perceived that the nature
of the Gorge was grown very horrid and dank. And in verity, I did feel
as that afar upward in the night the black mountains that did make the
sides of the Gorge had come together, and did make a monstrous roof
unseen in the utter height.

And this thing I do tell, only as of my belief; for I have no very sure
proof. Yet, truly, my reason doth say likewise; for there did oft drip
water upon me out of the darkness, even though I walked in the middle
way of the Gorge; and how should this thing be, save that there went an
overreaching of the sides, that should let the mildew down upon me.

And in this place, and for more than eleven great hours, there were
fire-holes and fire-pits only in this part and in that, and each a great
way off from another. And they burned very dull, and did seem to throw a
fume of sulphur into all the air, as that there was no freedom above for
the stink to pass away. And in every place were the rocks of the Gorge
very thick and slippery with strange growths; so that it was a sorrow to
walk upon them. And all that time was there an heavy wetness and
slowness in the air; and a smell, beside the stink of the fire-pits, as
that I did go forward through a place where dead things did be.

And for a great time there was a horrid darkness, as it had been that
the air was grown thick with the fumings of the fire-pits, as I do
believe; and beside this thing there was, as I have said, but a dull
fire here and another there; so that it was like that there should be a
heavy dark. And because that it was so utter black, and because that
there were growths upon the rocks in the bottom of the Gorge, I did go
but slowly, and with pain of stumblings; and always with the stink of
that place to trouble me half unto a sickness.

And sudden, as I did go past one of the fire-pits, I saw that the fire
made a dull shining upon some monstrous thing that did move before me,
upon the far side of the fire. And I came in one moment unto a swift
silence, and hid among the rocks of the bottom of the Gorge. And I lookt
very cautious at the thing that moved beyond the fire, and surely I had
seen no thing so monstrous since that I had come free of the Night Land;
for it was as that some huge Creature, like to the hull of a great ship
did move down out of the dark of the upper way of the Gorge. And it went
by the fire-hole, and onward into the dark of the lower way of the
Gorge; and I had perceived somewhat of it, as it did go past the fire,
and, surely, it was black and beslimed, and utter great in height and in
length, and it went always without noise, so that I had not known it to
be there, but that I saw it plain with mine eyes. And, truly, if I do
say that it was somewhat as that I had seen a monstrous slug-thing,
surely I should use wise and proper words to make known to you this
horrid brute.

And I stayed very quiet a time, and afterward I went upward again of the
Gorge, and did use a new caution to my way, and saw that the Diskos was
free upon my hip; for even thus I did carry the weapon, being that I
must use both hands to my way, and to save me in my stumblings and
slidings over the slippery rocks.

And once it did seem to me that some great thing moved in the darkness,
and I went downward among the rocks, and stirred not my body for a great
while; and sure am I that there went some living monster past me, that
did stink as a loathsome grave. And afterward, I went on again.

And three hours did I go thus, and came at last to a place where a
fire-hole did shine more ruddy; and I did look well about me, that I
should perceive that part of the Gorge the better. And as I stood there,
very quiet, away off from the fire, so that it did show no great light
upon my person, I did note how utter still was that place; and this to
take me anew, as though it had come fresh upon me. And here, there would
be the drip of water, and again in that place, and again elsewhere; and
all very solemn and very dismal. And the silence to be constant.

And presently, as I lookt, now to this way and again to that, I saw that
there was a monstrous slug-thing laid upward against the black side of
the Gorge, as that it had stood up on end; and the one end of the
monster went upward beyond the light from the fire-pit; but the other
part did come down and trail into the Gorge, as a long hillock, very
ugly and black and beslimed.

And I near sweat with a disgust and horror of the thing; but afterward I
had more courage, and spied well upon the brute. And surely, it moved
not at all, any more than the side of the cliff of the Gorge; and I
conceived that it stood not upward upon any feet; but clung to the rock,
even as you shall see a slug to go. And for a great space I was very
quiet and moved not, neither did I make to hide, but stood there very
stupid.

Yet, in a time, I had more of courage which brought strength unto my
heart, and I began again to go upon my way, but with an utter caution,
and I then to creep for a weary time upon my hands and knees among the
dank and weariful rocks and boulders that lay in the bottom of the
Gorge. And thrice between four hours was I passed by hidden and
monstrous things in the horrid dark places of the Gorge; yet with no
noise, save, as it might be, the odd rattle of a rock in this place and
that; but with an utter and dreadful stinking. And I to be quiet as
they went, as you shall think.

And each time now that I did go by the fire-pits and fire-holes that lay
odd-ways in the Gorge, I did pause and search about me with mine eyes,
very cautious, and oft now did I perceive how that the monstrous slug
creatures did lie in this place and in that against the cliffs of the
Gorge. And I did go then utter still, from this space to that space
among the rocks, and oft upon the flat of my belly, and with a constant
heed that I make not mine armour to knock against the boulders.

And always as I did go, there was a monstrous stench, and the choking of
sulphurous smoke very oft. And here and there, as mine heart doth
believe, there were utter great caverns within the mountains to the
right and to the left; and of this thing I have some small proof; for
once I did go by a place where a fire did burn, as it should be a
fire-hole, afar inward of the mountain side upon my right; so that I saw
in a moment that I looked in the darkness through the mouth of a mighty
cave-place; and I went past very quick and silent, for I knew not
whether any horrid thing should come forth out of that place to slay me.

And, truly, as I did think, if there did be one such place, there were
like to be many; and mayhaps the slugs came forth from those caverns,
where, as I did conceive there was naught save an eternal dripping of
waters and the foul growth of things in all parts. Yet is this last but
a thought, as I do say, and you shall wisely take it for no more than
that.

Now, I came clear of the darkness and the slime and the stinking in
about twelve hours after the time that I did think the mountains to be a
roof unto the Gorge; and the air was now free and did seem as that some
life and health did abound in it; and the fires did be more plentiful,
and burned very bright and clean, and threw all their fumings upward, so
that there was no more any bitter pain of sulphur within my throat.

And surely, it was with a thankful heart that I went onward, and with a
good speed; for there was much of light all about me, in that there
burned an hundred fire-pits here and in that place; so that I saw clear
before me and behind, and conceived that the slugs did abide only in the
closed part of the Gorge. And oft I did take the air very full into my
lungs, for the sweetness of it, after the horrid stenchings that I had
abode all those hours.

And presently, when I was come free of the roofed part of the Gorge,
maybe some three good hours, I lookt for a place proper to slumber; for
it was surely something over three and thirty hours since that I did
last come upon sleep; and I was utter worn and lost of strength with so
much of creeping and harking for monsters, as you shall believe;
moreover, about that time I had gone bitter long whiles between
slumberings through more than an hundred hours, as you shall have
perceived from my tellings.

Now, presently, I saw a small cave that went inward of the side of the
Gorge. And I lookt into the cave, and found it to be sweet and clean,
and very dry. And there was a small fire-pit off from the mouth of the
cave that did throw a good light for my purpose; so that I saw there was
no creeping thing or horror in the place; and I went in, and made to
prepare for my slumber.

But truly, when I was come to look upon myself, I was utter soiled and
did seem as that I stank with the slime and disgust of the dark part of
the Gorge, where I had gone upon my hands, and upon my belly. And
because of this, I was set that I should not eat or come to sleep,
without I washed me.

And I went out from the cave, and there was a spring near to the
fire-pit, as was oft in that part of the Gorge. And the spring was hot
and did fill a hollow of the rock, very quiet and with a fuming of
sulphur, as I did bend above it. And I washed mine hands and face and
mine armour and gear, in the hot spring, and did dry me with my
pocket-cloth; and so was sweetened and put to happiness of mind.

And I went back into the cave, and did sit in the mouth of the cave,
with the Diskos to mine hand; and I eat four of the tablets, for I was
gone a mortal long while without, and afterward I drank some of the
water. And as I did eat and drink, I lookt out upon the lightness of the
Gorge before me, and with a cheerful and composed heart.

And I saw presently that there came certain creatures out from their
holes, even as it might be that they were part rats; but very strange
looking, and not properly such. And some did lie about the fire-hole,
and some did hunt about in the rocks; and one came presently, and had a
snake by the neck. And it stood upon the snake, and did eat it, even
while that the snake did lash about upon the rock. And the snake did
lash until that it was nigh all eat; and a very strange thing this was
to see, and something troublesome to the pity. Yet was I glad to
perceive that there were enemies to the serpents of that place.

And when the rat creature did make an end of the snake, it made across
to the spring, and did drink the hot water a while; and afterward back
unto the fire, and there laid down anigh to the edge, and seeming very
sweetly comforted of the belly, which, in truth, was much otherwise with
me. And, after that, I saw many creatures that went about the fire, and
did have warmth from the fire and drink from the spring; and surely I
did ponder that the Peoples of this our Age should say, if they had
stood with me, that Providence had made nigh together the warmth and the
drink that were needful unto life (for it was grown to a bitter chill
now in the Gorge). But rather did this thing seem to me otherwise, that
these creatures did be but of their circumstance, and if that it had
been another way, then had they grown of their wits to meet it to their
means of life. Yet, as some would say, the arguments do but meet, and be
the same thing. And neither way do I care in this place; but do no more
than to show unto you the working of my brain, in this way and that, as
I made my journey.

Now, presently, when I was done eating, and come very ready to fall upon
sleep, I went out from the cave and gat me certain boulders, the which I
did carry into the cave. And when I was come back for the last time, I
put them very secure in the entrance-way, that no small stinging
creature come at me as I slept. And after that, I made ready, and went
to my sleep, having sweet thoughts and slumbrous, of the Maid.

Now I slept very quiet that time, and was not over troubled with the
chill of the Gorge, which was but little in that place, both by reason
of the fire-pit and because that the cave did help to keep my warmth to
me. And I had a deep slumber for eight hours, and waked then pretty
tired, but strong to go upon my way. And after that I had sat a little
while, I came full to wakefulness and afterward did eat two of the
tablets and drink some of the water, the which I did, sitting in the
mouth-part of the cave, after that I had cast free the boulders.

And afterward, I gat my gear upon me, and I went again upon my journey.
And the Gorge did continue very light and cheerful, with the shining of
the fires; and oft there did be a little steam that did hiss from this
part or that of the bottom of the Gorge and did blow very quaint and
noisy in the quiet of that place. And oft there did be hot pools, and
everywhere the great boulders in the bottom way, and to the right and to
the left the black and mighty sides of the Gorge that did go upward for
ever into the everlasting night.

And so I did go, and had eat and drunk at the sixth hour, and gone
onward again. And, lo! at the eighth hour, I did thrill sudden with a
wondrous great thrilling; for, in verity, it did seem to me that the
Master-Word did beat softly about me, out of all the night of the world.
And all my heart did throb with great glowings of joy; yet was the beat
of the Word unsure, so that I knew not truly whether my spirit had
indeed heard aught, for there was immediately a silence, as ever, about
mine inward being. Yet, as you shall believe, there was a new hope and
strength of courage in all my body and soul.

And I went forward very swift, and all renewed, as it were; and my
strength and hope did make naught of any terror that should lie to bar
my way, neither did I have further heed of the boulders that lay always
upon my path, but did go over them with quick leapings, and a wondrous
and thrilling eagerness of the heart within me.

And, sudden, in the end of the tenth hour, I perceived that the mighty
walls of blackness that made the sides of the Gorge did be no more
there, and that I was come truly upon the end of the Gorge. And I near
trembled with hope and astonishment; for when I was gone a little way
on, I had ceased to go upward any more, and was come clear out from the
mouth of the Gorge, and did peer forth across a mighty country of night.

And it did seem to me as that I was come to a second Land of Strange
matters, even as the Night Land where did lie the wonder of the Mighty
Pyramid. And surely, I did think within my heart that I was come at last
to that far and hidden place of the world where did be the Lesser
Redoubt. But yet was there no place in all that night where did tower
the shining lights of the Lesser Pyramid, the which I did hope vainly to
perceive. And because that I saw them not, a great heaviness came upon
my spirits for a time; but afterward the heaviness did go; for I put
Reason to help my courage, and did plan this cause and that to show why
that I was not come to sight of the shining embrasures of the Lesser
Redoubt. But yet was there left an ache of doubting, as you shall well
conceive.

Now this Land was very new and strange, and had a great light in this
part, and a wondrous grim darkness in that. And I did pause a great
while to determine how that I should go properly. And presently I
bethought me of the compass, and did draw it forth, and set it upon the
earth, that I should see how it did act. And truly it did go almost as
Naani had told to me; so that I was very sure in all my being that I was
in verity come anigh to the hidden Refuge. But yet did the compass give
me no proper guiding to my way; so that I was no more wise to this end
than before, only that I had the comfort of that which it did seem to
assure.

And, in a little while, I went forward into the Land, and did hope that
I should come presently to some matter to help my choice. And I went
first toward a certain great glowing of fire that lay before me, and did
seem joined to another great glare that went afar to my left.

And I found the ground of that Land to be very fair for my feet, and to
have in this place and that certain bushes, even as it did seem to me,
of the kind that we named moss-bushes in the Night Land, as you do know.
And I made a very good speed, and went thus until I had gone for maybe
six long hours. And by that time, I was come anigh to the glowing of
light; and did keep now a strong caution to my going; for truly, as I
did know from the tellings of the Maid, there were very horrid and
dreadful Powers in that Land, and I did well to remember that I was come
again to parts where might be the destruction of the spirit. Now I made
a pause, and lookt toward the glowing light; and it seemed to me that
for a monstrous way unto the right and unto the left, there did be
surely a great, hid valley in the earth before me. For the shining did
seem as that it came up from out of a valley, as that there burned a
deep light in such a place; but yet was I all unsure, and had no proper
knowing whether indeed there did be any valley there, but only a strange
and luminous shining that did come upward from the earth.

And I made no great haste now to go unto that place; but went down
sudden into the bushes, and lay upon my belly, and had a new great fear
upon my spirit. And presently, I parted the bushes a little, and made a
place for spying.

And I looked a great time unto the place of the light, and now to this
part and now to that. And sudden, I saw, as it did seem, a monstrous
head within the glowing; for the glowing did seem at whiles as that it
swept to and fore, as should a shining smoke that went obedient to a
quiet wind: and so to hide and again to uncover. And in a moment I lost
the great face, and was all unsure that ever I had seen aught.

And lo! in a little minute, I did see it again; but whether it did be
the shape of some utter monster of eternity--even as the Watchers about
the Mighty Pyramid--or whether it did be no more than a carven mountain
of rock, shaped unto the dire picturing of a Monster, I did have no
knowing. But I made that I should get hence very quick, and I did turn
me about in the bushes, and went upon my hands and knees; and so came at
last a great way off.

Now, presently, I came again upon my feet, and did take a new look
around that Land. And I had the mouth of the Gorge to my back, and this
I perceived by the shining of the fire-pits that made the place shown to
me.

And to the left of the Gorge was an utter blackness, as I did conceive
of black and monstrous mountains, through which the Gorge did come. And
to the right side of the Gorge there were many low volcanoes, that went
always along the feet of the great mountains that made the right wall of
the Gorge. And I saw the feet of these dark mountains, because that the
light from the little volcanoes made a glare upon the lower slopes.

And so shall you have some knowing of that part of this second Land of
Night.

And a good way off, was the shining that I had journeyed unto, and the
shining went into a distant light through a part of the Land that lay
afar to my left, for it stretched a great and strange way toward me, out
of the leftward gloom, and came unto my front, and so away into an utter
distance. Yet, though it was so great, you shall not think that it made
any huge light in the Land; but was rather as that it had a shining made
unto other ends; for it made not a great lightness in the Land.

And you do now perceive something roughly how the Land did seem to my
back part and unto my left, and somewhat before my face. And because
that I did think to have no profit to my search, if that I went to the
left, I made attention unto the Right. And here there was much of
darkness; yet oft the shining of fire-holes in this place and that amid
the darkness. And, as I did look, it grew very plain upon me how great
was the spread and drear wideness of that Country of Night; and how
that I did be an utter lonesome person in all that dark. And so shall
you be with me in sympathy of the utter greatness of my task, and know
of the fear that did breed, odd whiles, that I should search until I
die, and never find. And you to give me good human understanding.

Now I made no more to delay, but went unto the right, and did keep the
chain of the little volcanoes something level to my course; though a
great way off. And I went thus with a strange growing of hope, and an
excitement, for ten hours, and had eat not then for more than twenty
hours, and surely not since the sixth hour of that day and this because
that I was so utter shaken from my calmness of going.

And at the tenth hour, I went utter weak, and did seem surely as that I
must swoon. And lo! I bethought me how that I was gone so long without
aught for my belly. And surely, when I was quiet a time, I eat four of
the tablets, and in a good while did feel all renewed, and would rest no
more, after that I had drunk some of the water, but went onward; for, in
verity, my spirit did be as that it had slain me, if that I had lain
down at that time. And this because hope was so fierce in me; for I to
feel indeed that I was come near to the Maid.

And I went ten hours more, until that I did truly totter upon my feet,
with utter and dreadful weariness; for I had gone now through someways
of forty great hours, and had been foolish in mine eating and drinking,
as you have perceived; but yet was this to be forgiven; for I was as
that I should come any little minute upon the wonder of the Lesser
Pyramid, shining afar in the night. Yet, truly, there was nowhere
anything that might be likened unto it.

And I lay down there, just as I did be, and with no proper heed to my
safety. And I was gone asleep in one moment, as it did seem; and waked
not for twelve hours; and then did come suddenly unto knowledge; and
thankful was I in the heart that no monster had come upon me in that
dead-time of slumbering. And I eat four of the tablets, as was surely
due unto me, and drank some of the water, and so gat forward again into
the night.

And truly I was mortal stiff and did ache for a great while, and this
did be in part because that I had wrapped not the cloak about me, ere I
slept; for the Land was bitter cold and did make the blood very chill.

Now when I had gone onward through six hours, I ate and drank; for I did
mind now to be wise and keep my strength good within me. And I went
onward again at a very great speed, and full of an excitement. And
surely, I did be glad at last that the tablets were so easy gone in the
mouth, and unfilling to the belly; for I had been without power and
patience to eat proper victual.

And at the tenth hour, I saw that there rose a red-shining out of the
Land before me, as that it came upward from a mighty pit. And I made
slow my way, and so, when I was gone on for two great hours more, I saw
that monstrous figures went about, against the red glare of the shining.
And I gat me down into the bushes which were very plentiful in that
part.

And I stayed there for a certain while, and made a watch upon the
red-shining and the figures; and, truly, it did seem to me that there
were horrid giants in that Land, even as in the Night Land. And
afterward, I crept away, and went outward from the little volcanoes,
into that part of the Land that was dark, save, as you do mind, for the
glare of fire-holes in this part and that.

And I went now with an utter care; for the giants had put a new caution
into my heart, and I did surely mean that I should live to rescue mine
own Maid, and have joy through all my life. And thereafter, I went with
the Diskos in my hand, and at each hour that was the sixth, I eat two of
the tablets, and drank some of the water, and so did keep my strength
very good within me.

Now, presently, I was come to a place where the Land did go downward a
great slope, and there was a difference in the earth that went beneath
my feet, and no great plenty of the bushes; but only one in this place
and one in that, and nowhere any fire-hole.

And I gat me down and did feel the earth with my hands, and lo! I did
find presently smooth stones, and afterward olden shells. And
immediately, a great delight took me; for Naani had told how that the
Lesser Pyramid stood something nigh to the shore of an ancient sea, that
was long dried up in the years of eternity. And surely it might be that
I was come down into the dry bottom of that same olden sea, and should
presently have sight of the Little Pyramid.

And because that hope was put so fresh into me, I went forward through,
maybe, thirty hours, across the olden sea-bed; but in all that time I
had no sight of the lights of the Lesser Redoubt. And a great trouble
began to take me; for, indeed, Naani had not told me how great was the
sea; and it might be that I should wander a weariful age across it,
before that I come to the far side.

And it did come to me, presently, how that I should be wise to see that
my way was very straight, so that I waste not my strength in useless
wanderings. And I had a great care now to observe that the red-shining
did be always upon my right, to my rear; and by this reasonable cunning
did I make to steer very nicely through the great gloom of that place.

Now, as I did go across the bed of the great sea, I heard strange
sounds, now in this part of the darkness, and now in that; and oft did
there be a noise, as if things did run this way and that way in the bed
of the sea. And once, afar off in the night, there did be a strange and
horrid screaming; so that I did know truly that the monsters of that
Land were out, and did go about in the dark.

And, as you shall perceive and understand, I was all unknowing of the
lore of that Land; so that I knew not what to think of this strange
sound or that, neither knew I what they might portend, but only that, as
I did say, there were Monsters abroad. And I could do no more than have
my way forward with an utter care always, and be very ready with the
Diskos, or to hide, each as maybe according to the need.

And, surely, I went one-and-forty hours that day, and eat and drank
after every sixth hour. And before this, in the seven-and-thirtieth
hour, I heard a great roaring and bellowing in the night, coming nigh
unto me; and afterward the thudding of monstrous feet, as that a giant
ran past me in the darkness, and did make a chase of some creature. And
the thudding of the feet and the roaring went far off into the night;
and there did seem presently to come back to me from a great way, a
little screaming; but of this thing I had no surety; and I abode very
hushed in a clump of bush, until quietness was come again all about; for
there had been an utter frightening sound in the horrid voice and in the
thudding of the great feet.

Now, in the one-and-fortieth hour of that day, I came upon the farther
shore of the olden sea. But lo! there was nowhere any light to tell me
aught of the Lesser Refuge. And truly, a great doubt and bewilderment
took me; for, indeed, I could not perceive how it might be that I saw
not the lights of the embrasures of the Lesser Pyramid. And a great
despair took me; so that I sat down there upon the shore of the olden
sea, and had no heed of anything for a while.

But afterward, I ate and drunk, and went into a clump of bush, and wrapt
the cloak about me, and so went fast unto sleep, with the Diskos handy
to my breast. And, in verity, the pain of the despair and the
bewilderment of mine heart did make rather for sleep, than to keep me
wakeful; for, indeed, I was half stunned of the brain and of my courage;
and did seem now the farther off from the ending of my search than ever
I had been.

And I slept six hours, and waked then, sudden. And I leaned up upon mine
elbow in the bush, and harked very quiet, perchance some noise had
shaken my sleep from me. But, indeed, there was nothing, only that I was
wakeful, and did mind me of my trouble of failure. Yet now, I did invent
this thing and that thing to make natural account that I was not come to
the Lesser Redoubt; and so had hope again within me; yet much also of
doubt and bewilderment.

And I eat two of the tablets, and drank some of the water, and again to
my journey. And I made that I should keep along the shore of the sea,
the which I did through twelve hours, and was then still so much in
doubt as ever.

And I ceased from my journeying, and lookt about me over the Land, and
lo! I did note how that a weak and strange shining was in the air of the
Land, at a great way; as it had been that a far spreaded and faint
glowing made a little glare into all the night unto my left and before
me.

Now I ate and drank, and made to steady my spirit; for I did fear lest I
should feel utter lost in all the night of the world, and to know not
where to make any more my search, and so to grow desperate in despair.
And this thing you will understand.

And afterward, I did make across that Land, unto the place where it did
seem that the dull shining was something bright. And I went thus through
eighteen hours, and did make pause at each sixth hour, and ate and drank
very resolute; though, in verity, it did seem as that even so small a
matter as the tablets did be like to choke me. And by this is it plain
to me how great an anguish was come upon my spirit, lest that I was all
astray, and should have no joy to succour mine Own.

And thrice in the time that I did go, there did be a running of feet
amid the darkness; and odd whiles strange and horrid cryings in the
night; so that I put a force upon my despair, and hid me; for, indeed, I
had no right to lose care of my life, if there did be any chance yet
that I find the Maid.

And lo! in the eighteenth hour, which was truly the thirtieth of that
day, I found the shining in the night to be grown very plain, and an
utter stinking of sulphur; and truly I did be aware that the Land went
upward.

And I made upward through seven hours, and the light did grow more
plain, and was of a dull redness, very sombre and heavy. And in the end
of six more hours, I ceased to go upward, and did know of a strange low
sound, that did be like to no other sound that ever I did hear; and was
like to a dull roar that did never have ceased through eternity.

And I went forward unto the light, and the Land to be now as that I went
over an upland plain. And I did go thus through five hours, and the low
roar did grow ever upon mine ears. And truly! even as I did shape my
thoughts to take a caution for my body, I went upward again a little,
and came out upon the edge of a mighty cliff, and the low and constant
roar did moan upward against me with an everlasting muttering. And I
lookt downward a monstrous way, and surely there was spread out a mighty
sea, as it did seem, of dull fire, as that a red-hot mud did lap very
deep and quiet below me in all that night.

And I lookt outward across the strange sea, and the far side was hid
from me; for, surely, there were dull and solemn clouds that came off
the sea, and hid the distance from me. And the clouds to glow a little
redly; and so to rise, and presently to blacken into the night. And I
lookt to the right and to the left, and it was plain that the black
cliffs did stretch out both ways, and did go downward ever into that
monstrous sea of slow fire. And there were great headlands that went out
into the fire, as into a sea; and the fire did lap very quiet about
these, and where the fire lapt about them, there did shine and spirt out
green flames and vapours at diverse times.

And, indeed, as I did perceive, I was come to an upward sea of fire, as
it were the deep inwards of a low and utter monstrous volcano, that was
flat of the top and utter big across. And, in verity, I did look
downward into the fires of the inward earth, and a very wondrous sight
was it, to stand there alone upon the cliffs of that everlasting sea.
And a great heat came upward from the dull and grim fire of that gloomy
sea, and a reek of sulphur; so that I was like to be choked, and did go
backward from the edge of the cliff.

And surely, I was come to the end of that Dark Land upon that side, and
had nowhere perceived the Lesser Pyramid in all the night of my travel.
And a new despair came upon me; for, indeed, it seemed I was come all
astray in the night of the World, and did nowise have any knowing
whether I stood near to the Country of the Lesser Redoubt, or whether
that I was gone half across the World unto a strange place.

And, then, as the despair troubled my spirit and dulled the beating of
my heart, a sudden thought did light up a fresh hope within me; for,
indeed, as you do know, I was come upward of a great height, and did
surely have a huge view over all that Land; and mayhaps the Lesser
Pyramid did lie somewhere in a valley, if, in verity, it did be
anywheres at all in that Country. And I turned me from the cliffs, and
lookt backward over all the night of the Land; but there was nowhere in
all that Country the shining of the Lights of the Lesser Pyramid.

And lo! of a sudden I did know that there was something in the night.
And I stared, with a very keen and anxious look. And behold, there was
the black shape of a great pyramid afar off in the night, that did show
against the shining of the distant light; for it did stand between me
and the far-off fires. But until I was come to that place, whence I did
look, I had not stood to have it plain against the shining upon the
other side of that Land.

And how I did feel in that moment, I have no words to set out unto you.
But surely was my heart gracious with thankfulness, and I ready to leap
with joy and hope, and all my body thrilled with an excitement that
would not have me to be silent; so that, suddenly, I began to shout
foolishly across the night. But I came soon to wisdom and silence, as
you shall think.




X

THE MAID OF THE OLDEN DAYS


Now, as you shall perceive, all mine utter despair was turned in a
moment into an huge gladness and a great hope; so that it did seem to me
that I should be with my dear One in but a little while. Yet was this an
over-hope and expectation, and was not like to have a swift satisfying;
for, truly, I was made aware of naught, save that I did perceive the
shape of a great pyramid, going upward into the night.

And I knew that the Pyramid did surely stand upon an hill in the midst
of that dark Country, for only so might it show so great and high. And I
set me to run swift downward into the Land, so that I should make a
strong going unto the Pyramid.

And I ran for a few little minutes, and lo! I fell headlong, and did
truly feel as that I had brake my neck with the hardness and pain of my
fall. And I had no power to go forward any more for a great while; but
did just be there where I did fall, and very helpless and moaning a
little; so that any creature had been able to slay me, if that it had
come upon me in that time.

Yet, presently, I was able to sit upon the earth, and did hold my neck
with my hands, and afterward the pain went away; so that I gat once more
to my feet. But now I went forward very wisely, and had, moreover, an
anxiousness in my heart; for, indeed, how did it be that the Pyramid was
so utter dark, if that it did be the Lesser Refuge, in truth. And
immediately there did rise in me a fear that it should be some House of
Evil in the dark of that Land, or some wicked Force working a Pretence
and a bewilderment upon my sight. Yet, truly, the thing was plain now
against the far-off fires of the Land; and I did have little thought but
that it should be, in verity, the Lesser Refuge.

Now in the first moment that I did perceive the dark Pyramid, I had been
without wit, save to run very quick and blind unto the place; for you to
remember how long I had made so great a search. And afterward, I had
been minded to call unto Naani with my brain-elements, sending the
Master-Word, and my speech after to tell how that I was come unto her.
But now I did heed to have caution, and to discover what this darkness
should truly mean.

And so did I go downward again into the night of that Land, at the first
with a carefulness; but presently with a fierce eagerness and expecting
of the heart, the which had been dulled a little time with the horrid
shaking and pain of my fall.

Now I had climbed unto the upper plain of the great volcano in, maybe,
thirteen hours; but I went downward of that great Hill in ten, and had
made a greater speed, but that I was sore shaken and unsure, by reason
of my fall.

And in the end of the tenth hour, I perceived that I was come again to
the great Plain of the Land; and I had no more any proper sight of the
Refuge, because that it was upward afar in the darkness of the night.
Yet was I abled now to see that there went a bulk between me and the far
shinings, and did know that this great thing was surely the hill on
which the Pyramid did stand.

And I went four hours across the Land, and did pass in this place and
that, fire-holes that made a little red-shining in the night; and
because of the fires in those far parts and a-near, there was not an
utter dark.

And when I was gone four hours towards the Pyramid, I could no more see
the distant shinings, for the bulk of the hill-bottom stood up between,
and made all a blackness that way. And by this thing, I did guess that I
was come nigh unto the hill; but yet was a great hour more before that I
came to it. And in that five hours, since I was come down from the great
Volcano, there had past me thrice and again, the sounds of things
running in the night, and once there did be a sound as of a giant
roaring afar, and a strange and horrid screaming.

Now I began to go up the hill. And, at the first, an utter excitement
took me in the heart; so that I could have shouted the name of the Maid
aloud in the night, with vain hopings that she should hear me and make
an answer. But this state went from me very swift, as I did go upward,
and there came a caution again about me, and a coldness of fear, as that
my spirit did wot of something that my heart did not perceive.

And, presently, I was come upward almost to the top of the hill, the
which took me nigh three hours. And surely, when I was come that I could
see the grimness of the Pyramid, going upward very desolate and silent
into the night, lo! an utter shaking fear did take me; for the sweet
cunning of my spirit did know that there abode no human in all that
great and dark bulk; but that there did await me there, monstrous and
horrid things that should bring destruction upon my soul. And I went
downward of the hill, very quiet in the darkness; and so in the end,
away from that place.

And I was four great hours before that I was come clear away from the
hill, and I did feel that there was not any safety for my spirit in all
that Land. And surely I went a little blindly, in the first, and did go
with no heed unto my way.

And presently, I was upon the shore of the olden sea, and had no knowing
how that I was come there; for, surely, I did think it to be a great way
off. But now I do think that the dry bed of the sea did curve around
unto that place, or that there did be two, or more, olden seas in that
Country of Night.

Now, presently, I sat me down, very weak and bewildered; for it was as
that my heart did lie dead within me. And, in verity, you shall perceive
how this thing was, for I did know by the tellings of my spirit that
there abode evil things in the dark Pyramid upon the hill; and I doubted
not but that destruction had come upon the Peoples of the Lesser
Pyramid, and that evil creatures and Powers did now abide in that place.
And if this thing did be truly so, I was come over-late to the saving of
the Maid; and with this thought I was very glad that some evil thing
should come that I should fight with it and die quickly; for there was
naught then in all the world to make me glad to have life.

And so shall you know the utter desolation that was in my heart; and,
truly, I can perceive both the wiseness and the unwisdom of my
reasonings; for, indeed, I did have no _sure_ knowing that the dark
Pyramid did be truly the Lesser Refuge. But yet, in verity, my spirit
did know with a certain sureness, and there was no doubt concerning this
thing, in all my being.

And, after that I had sat there awhile, I did mind me suddenly that I
should send the Master-Word through the night; for, indeed, how else
might I ever know whether Naani did yet live; though, in truth, I had
little, save desperate hope in this matter; but yet did remember how
that I had seemed odd times of my journey to hear the beat of the
Master-Word with my spirit, out of all the dark of the world. And, in
verity, if Naani answered not to the Word, but there came instead an
Evil Power to destroy me, I should but cease me of mine utter
heart-ache.

And I stood me upon my feet, and looked outward about me into the
blackness of that Land. And I sent the Master-Word with my
brain-elements; and immediately I called Naani, thrice, sending the call
with my brain-elements.

And lo! in a moment, as it did seem, there broke around me out of all
the mystery of night, low and solemn, the Master-Word, beating in the
night. And immediately there did sound within my brain a far, small
voice, very lone and faint, as that it had come from the end of the
world. And the voice was the voice of Naani and the voice of Mirdath,
and did call me by mine olden love-name.

Then, indeed, I did near to choke with the utter affright of joy that
did take me in the heart, and also I was shaken with a mighty
excitement, and my despair was gone, as that I had never known it. For,
in verity, Naani did live and did call unto me with her brain-elements;
and surely I had not heard the voice of mine Own for an utter age of
grim labour and dread.

And the voice was, as I did say, as that it came from one that did be in
a far place of the earth. And, in verity, whilst I stood dazed with a
great joy that the Maid did live, I knew within me, concerning the fear
that she was utter far off; and what peril might come anigh to her,
before that I should stand to her side, to do battle for her life and
well-being and mine own joy.

And lo! in the same moment, and before that I made further speech unto
Naani, I did wot that someone did be a little way off from me, in the
bushes, where a fire-hole did burn anigh to me; and it was as that my
spirit knew this thing, and told of it unto my brain. And I made no
answer unto the Maid, across all the dark of the world; but went very
swift into a great bush that was nigh to the fire-hole, upon this side.

And I lookt through, into the open space that did be about the
fire-hole. And there was a little figure that did kneel, sobbing, upon
the earth, beside the fire-hole; and truly it was a slim maid, and she
did seem as that she harked very desperate, even whilst yet she did sob.
And surely, mine own soul did _Know_, all in one white moment of life.
And she there, unknowing, and harking unto a cry of the spirit, that she
did think to come through all the desolation of the night--even from the
Mighty Pyramid. For oft, as I did perceive, had she cried unto me in all
that lonesome month, and known no answer; neither that I was making a
desperate way unto her; for, indeed, her weakness was great, so that she
had no power to throw the Word strongly afar, neither to make plain her
spiritual cryings through any mighty space of the aether.

And lo! I drew in my breath, and set my teeth a moment, to steady my
lips; and I said: "MIRDATH," out of the bush where I did be, and using
natural human speech. And the Maid ceased from her weeping, and lookt
this way and that, with an utter new fear, and with a frightened hope
that did shine with her tears in the light from the fire-hole. And I
divided the bush before me, and went through the bush, so that I came
out before her, and did be there in my grey armour; and I did pause
then, and was all adrift in myself; for my heart said that I should take
this Maid into mine arms again; for that I was come again to be with
Mirdath after an utter lost Eternity. But yet was I all paused; for
truly she was Naani and she was Mirdath, and she did be a stranger in
mine eyes, and very dainty and pretty and shaken with woe and sore
trouble and grief.

And in that same moment of my coming unto her out of the bush, she
screamed and fell back from me, and strove weakly to gain unto the
hither bushes; for, truly, she knew not what was come upon her in that
first little moment. And immediately she saw that it did be an human
man, and no monster to slay her, and in that instant I said the
Master-Word unto her, aloud, that she should have knowledge of peace and
help. And I told my name, and said I am That One. And she knew this
thing, even as my lips made the sounds. And she cried out something in
an utter broke voice, and ran unto me, and thrust her two small hands
into my charge and keeping, and fell thence into a great sobbing and
shaking, so that I was all in trouble to ease her; but did keep a
silence and held fast her hands, for I had not on mine armoured gloves.

And she leaned against me, very weak, and seeming wondrous like to a
child. And lo! in a while she ceased to sob, and did but catch her
breath this time and that, but said no word. And I bethought me that she
did suffer of hunger, for I perceived that she had been long wandering
and alone, and was come unto the end of hope, when that I did come.

And the Maid stood there yet silent, for she might not yet command her
mouth to speak. And she trembled as she stood. And I opened my left
hand, and lookt at the hand within my palm, and surely it was utter thin
and wasted. And I made no more pause, but lifted mine Own and set her
easy upon the earth, with an hump of smooth rock unto her back. And I
stript off my cloak very quick, and put it about her, for she was scarce
covered with her clothes that had been all torn among the bushes; so
that part she shook with an utter chill, and part because of weakness,
for she was nigh to be starved unto her death, and destroyed with her
grief and lonesomeness.

And I took from my back the scrip and the pouch, and I gat a tablet from
the scrip, and brake it into my cup, and with the water I made a little
broth very swift upon an hot rock that was to the edge of the fire-hole.
And I fed the broth unto the Maid, for truly her hands did shake so that
she had spilt it all, if that I had done otherwise.

And she drank the broth, and was so weak that presently she did fall
again to sobbing, yet very quiet; so that I strove not to be troubled in
the heart; for, indeed, this thing was but reasonable, and not cause for
me to have an anxiousness. But I put my hands under the cloak and took
her hands into mine and held them strong and firm; and this did seem to
bring something of peace and strength unto her; so that presently the
trembling and the weeping went from her. And, indeed, the broth was
surely helpful in this matter.

And presently, I knew that her hands did stir a little within mine, and
I loosed somewhat of my grip; and immediately, she graspt my hands with
a weak and gentle grasp; but lookt not yet at me; only did stay very
quiet, as that she did gather her strength within her. And, indeed, I
was content; save that an anxiousness of the heart did stir me this
time and that, lest some monster should come upon us. And because of
this trouble, I did hark about me, now and oft, and with a new and
strange fearfulness of danger, because that now mine Own was given unto
my charge; and surely my heart would break, if that there came any hurt
unto her.

Now, of a sudden, the Maid did make as that she would rise, and I loosed
free from her, to give help. And she gat me by the hand, and slipt
sudden to her knees, and did kiss my hand, and did begin again to weep.
And surely I was so utter abashed that I stood very stupid and let her
do this thing. But in a moment I drew free from her; for this thing
might not be. And I gat me to my knee likewise before her, and took her
hands, and kist them once, newly humbled, as it were; and thus should
she know all that was in my heart, and of mine understanding. And she
did but sob the more; for she was so weak, and utter moved unto me,
because that I had come to her through the night of the world. And this
thing I knew, though no speech had yet past between us. And I gave up
her hands, lest she need them for her tears; but she left them to lie in
my palms, as she did kneel there; and she bowed her head a little over
her weeping; but did show that she was mine, in verity, unto the very
essence of her dear spirit.

And I took her into mine arms, very gently and without caress; but
presently I stroked her hair, and called her Naani and Mirdath, and said
many things unto her, that now I scarce do wot of, but she did know them
in the after time. And she was very quiet in mine arms, and seeming
wondrous content; but yet did sob onward for a great time. And oft did I
coax her and say vague things of comfort, as I have told. But truly she
did ask no more comfort at that time than that she be sheltered where
she did be. And truly she had been lonesome and in terror and in grief
and dread, a great and horrid time.

Now, presently, she was grown quiet; and I made to put her comfortable
in the cloak against the rock, that I should have freedom to make her
more of the broth. But yet she did nestle unto me, with a little sweet
wistfulness, that made warm my heart in a most wondrous fashion; for
surely she was mine Own. And she to begin to say odd words to me. And so
to have gentle obedience, and to rest quiet against the rock, the while
that I did make the broth. Yet ever her gaze did follow me, as I knew;
for I must look oft her way.

And I took the broth to her, and she drank it, using her own two hands;
and I sat by, and eat three of the tablets and drank some of the water,
for truly it was a foolish great time since last I had eat.

Now, in a while, the broth did make bright the eyes of the Maid, and she
did begin to talk; and at whiles had pauses, because that she lacked of
strength, and there was more to be told than an human may have the
heart-strength and cunning to make plain. And twice she did come again
to sobbing; for, truly, her father was dead and the Peoples of the
Lesser redoubt all slain and dispersed through the night of that Land.

And I learned that an Evil Force had made action upon the Peoples within
the Lesser Redoubt; so that some, being utter weak by reason of the
failing of the Earth-Current, had opened the Great Door, and gone forth
into the night. And immediately there had come into the Lesser Pyramid,
great and horrid monsters, and had made a great and brutish chase, and
had slain many; but some had escaped forth into the night.

And with these had come Naani, after that her father, the Master
Monstruwacan, had been slain by a shaggy man, very brutal and monstrous.
And there had been three maids with Naani, when that she made escape
into the night; but there had come certain creatures upon them, as they
did sleep among the bushes, and had stolen two, and the other maid had
run off, as did Naani, and they had neither met the other any more.

And this dreadful happening unto the Peoples of the Lesser Redoubt, had
been a great while gone, as it to seem to her; but she had no means to
tell me how long this time should be; for, in verity, how should she
make a count. Yet had it been a dread long while unto her; and I found
presently, that she had been lost through all that time that I did make
my journey unto her; for, indeed, this thing I discovered by asking
concerning my callings unto her. And she had heard none that did come to
her, in any time since she had escaped out of the Lost Refuge into this
dreadful Land.

Yet, in verity, oft had she callen unto me, until that her heart did
grow sick with the desolation of her lonesomeness and her utter
forsakeness. And her callings had told unto the Evil things of the Land
that she did be in this part and that; for there had come things and
beasts in search for her; but having the gift of the hearing, she had
known of their approach, most whiles, and had come free from them; yet
oft-times with piteous and fearful runnings and hiding among the rocks
and the bushes, so that she had grown afterward to make no calling unto
me, save odd whiles, lest she bring the monsters upon her. And, indeed,
as you do know, naught had come plain unto me, for she was so utter weak
that she had no power of her brain-elements to send the Word afar or the
tellings of her spirit.

And because that she was so sorely chased, she had come nigh to be
naked, even as I found her; for the bushes and the rocks had torn her
garments from her, and she had naught with which to make any proper
mending of them. And for food she had eat the moss upon the rocks, and
odd strange berries and growths, and had drunk of the waters of the hot
springs; and oft had she been made utter sick, because of the sulphur,
or somewhat, of the water and, maybe, the poison of odd plants. Yet, as
I did think, it was like that the first did save her life from the
second; but in this thing I do make only a guessing.

And in all that dreadful time, since that she had come to be quite
alone, she had heard a score drear things; for there had been once the
slaying of a young maid nigh unto her, by some Brute out in the darkness
of the Land; and thrice and more had she heard the feet of people
running this way and that, and the tread of giants pursuing. And by this
telling I did understand those things which mine ears had told to me as
I did go across that Land, and surely a new pity and sorrow and horror
did come upward within me. And the Maid told me how that she came once
upon certain of the Peoples of the Lesser Redoubt, as they did hide
among the bushes; but they ran, with no heed to her callings that she
did be human, even as they; and by this is it plain the sore and
dreadful panic that was upon the hearts of such.

And the bitter chill of the Land had made her to strive alway to be nigh
unto the fire-holes that were very plentiful; but even as this did be
needful unto her, so was it a thing that drew the Monstrous Brutes of
that Land, even as I had found in the Night Land, and in the Upward
Gorge. And because of this, she was oft made to stay afar off in the
utter cold of the night.

Yet, in truth, odd whiles she did be so desperate, that she would make
the venture, and so mayhaps have a time of warmth; and because of this,
she had been nigh slain in her sleep, twice and thrice. Moreover, there
were snakes about the fires, though not over-plentiful in all parts, and
there did be spider-crabs and monstrous scorpions.

And, indeed, even as she had lain by the fire-hole, very weak and
seeming near unto her death, even this time when my call had come unto
her to stir her unto life and bitter knowledge of despair, even then was
she all surround by creatures that were like to crabs, that did squat
all about her, and did but wait for her to die; so that she had been
feared to sleep, lest they destroy her in her slumber.

And by this thing, she had known that her death was surely nigh; and lo!
out of all the night of the world had come the beat of the Master-Word,
strong and powerful, beating as a low and spiritual thunder out of all
the dark of the night. Yet had she thought of me, only as speaking from
the far-off Mighty Pyramid; so that the cry had brought naught of hope
unto her, but only a newer and more known despair. And, behold, in a
little minute, there had come her name, spoken surely with the tongue;
and a name that was different from the name that my spirit had said
after the beat of the Word. And immediately, I had come out of the bush,
and she had fallen back in a sudden great fear that a monster was stolen
upon her; and then did see a young man in grey armour, and did know in
one instant that I was that olden one of her memory dreams, and the one
that had spoken unto her in the spirit across half of the dead world, as
it did seem. And now was I come through all that unknown desolation and
affright, to succour her. And she was immediately safe; but yet all
broken because of her weakness and her utter joy and her sweet honour
for me.

And this is the chief of that which she did tell unto me; and the way
that she had seen and did regard the marvel of this our coming together.
But, surely, no man was made ever to be worthy of the way that she did
look upon me, or of the words that she did say unto me in her weakness
and happiness. Now, with the Maid having speech concerning the
spider-crabs, I lookt presently well around, and surely, in a minute, I
saw that they were not gone away; but did be a circle of silent and
steadfast watching and impudence and horror all about us. And surely
this thing put an anger and disgust upon me; so that I gat to my feet,
and went unto the border of the light, and I spurned this little monster
and that, and did truly kick maybe a dozen, before that they were
content to be gone. And by this thing shall you know of their calm and
foolish assurance; but yet were they seemingly without courage; for they
made not to attack me. Yet a true crab of this day been wishful to pinch
me, had I put my toe forth unto it.

Now, I went back to the Maid, and she did laugh with a little, weak
gleefulness; so that I perceived that she was like to be a very joyous
maiden, if but I did have her in health. And I made her another cup of
the broth, and she drank it very easy. And afterward, I made a very
stern and playful order that she must sleep, and, indeed, she to need it
sore, for she was gone again from her excitement, and her weakness upon
her; yet very happy and content and without fear.

And I made a smooth place for her, and put the pouch and the scrip to be
for a pillow, and I did lay her there very quiet and sweet in the cloak,
and covered her feet; but, indeed, I saw first that they did be sore cut
and without any gear to them; so that I perceived that Mine Own had worn
out her foot-gear utter in her lonesome journeyings, and in running from
Brutes that did come to find her. And so I to know more in the heart,
somewhat of the true dreadfulness and fear that had companioned Mine
Own. And I was minded then that I would wash and bind up her feet; but
yet was she so utter worn, that I did prefer that she sleep so soon as
she might, and afterward, when she was come wakeful again, then should I
take a proper heed of her feet. And truly, they were very small and
shapely.

And presently, she slept; and, surely, I doubt whether she had slumbered
so peaceful and proper for a great month; for she never to have known
when any evil thing should come upon her in her sleep. And this to be a
very dreadful feeling, as you do know well; for you do know how I had
been in this same matter.

Now, while Naani did sleep, I stript off mine armour, and took off mine
under-suit, which was named the Armour-Suit, and a very warm and proper
garment, and made thick that it should ease the chafe of the armour. And
afterward, I put on the armour again; but the suit I folded, and laid
beside the Maid; for, truly, she was nigh unclothed, by reason of the
bushes and the rocks, that had rent her garments all-wise.

And I stood watch for the Maid, the while that she did slumber; and
surely she went ten long hours. And I walked upon this side of the
fire-hole and now upon that, and did oft cease, that I might hearken
both with mine ears and with my spirit; for, truly, I was all wakened to
a new care and delight, and did have a fresh and doubled fear of any
Horrid Creature or Force of Evil. And this shall be very plain to you.

And in the end of ten long hours, the Maid wakened, and I ran to her all
joyed that she was come again to knowledge and to be that I could talk
with her.

And she sat upward and looked at me, and there was new light and
movement in her, so that I knew her strength was come back into her. And
for a little minute, she said naught unto me, the while that I did ask
how she did be; and she lookt at me very keen, so that I wondered some
wise in a daze, what was in her mind.

And she askt me, of a sudden, how long it did be since that I had slept.
And having not thought to put away her asking, because that the question
was over sudden, I said four-and-eighty hours, which should be three
days and the half of a day of four hours and twenty; and this thing I
knew, because that I kept alway a very careful counting of the hours,
lest that I get all adrift, and know not how long I was taken to come to
this place and that.

And, truly, even as I told this thing to the Maid, I was grown very
quaint in the head; for, indeed, I was gone a wondrous while without
slumber, and had done much and bitter work in that time; and before then
had been much lacking of rest, as you do know.

And, sudden the Maid cried out something, and tost the cloak from her,
and had me into her arms, and did heed not to have any foolish shame of
her nakedness. And, in verity, I knew not how I was gone so strange; but
do see now that I was nigh to swoon for lack of slumber and rest.

And she kept me very steady for a little, and afterward helped me to be
laid upon the ground; and she put the scrip and the pouch under my head;
and so I did lie very calm and restful, and did be the more so, because
that I was grown so tired in the heart, the which did make my head to be
very husht, as that all the world was grown very quiet in a moment.

And the Maid did mind then that she did lack to be properly covered, and
she gat the cloak, and put it about her, and did afterward sit a little
beside me, and did rub my hands. And presently, I was something more to
myself, and she did grow more happy of her mind, and made to give me
something for my stomach; for, indeed, I was grown those late hours to
be foolish and to have no wiseness to proper eating.

And she did lift my head, the while that she did take the scrip from
under, and kept me very sweetly upon her knee, and so until she had gat
free a pack of the tablets, and the flask and the cup; for I had put all
matters back into the scrip before Naani had gone unto sleep, and
because of this, I had not been able to eat or drink aught, save by
wakening her, as you perceive; for, indeed I had put the scrip and the
pouch under her head for a pillow, as I have told.

And she would not bide that I should do aught; but only did ask
concerning the making of the water, and was wondrous amazed to see how
the powder did fizz up and become water; and indeed, she had too much
into the cup, for, truly, it rose up and ran to the ground. And when she
had done thus, and ceased to marvel, she put three of the tablets into
the water, and made me a broth, even as I had made a broth for her; but,
indeed, I was in no need, and had done very well to eat the tablets and
drink the water. Yet, truly, I was not wishful to lack the love of her
way, as you may think.

Now while I did drink the broth, I did be very restful upon the earth,
and mine head against mine own Maid; and I did mind me now that I tell
her concerning the Armour-Suit that I did mean for her wear.

Yet I said not that I had stript it from me, for then she had been like
to say nay, and to trouble that I was like to come to a chill, as is the
way of a woman. But, indeed, I might so well have told her, for truly,
she did know on the moment, and set to a little unto weeping; yet very
gentle and sweet, and did kiss me as I lay there, and say such things as
should make a young man the better to have heard, if but that his own
dear Love doth say the same.

And she would nowise wear the garment; but yet in the end I prevailed by
gentle reasonings and because that I was her master, as I was born to
be; and moreover, her own sweet sense did show that I spoke for wisdom;
for how should she come through all the bitter way before, if that she
had not a strong and close-made garment; and as you do mind, her
coverings did be in utter rags, as I have told; yet very sweet and
clean, as I had known; so that I ween she had stript oft in the lonesome
night, and washt her garments in this or that hot spring of the sulphur
waters and other matters.

And, in verity, alway she was much given to washings, as I did soon
perceive.

Now, presently, I did be very well again; but with a sore slumber that
did press upon my head. Yet, ere I should sleep, I did mean that I bathe
her feet and bind them with ointment and with my pocket-cloth; and truly
her feet were very small and pretty.

And I sat me up, talking my head from her knee; and told her of mine
intent. But, in verity, she did but throw her arms about my neck and
give me one loving kiss, and laught so hearty that I did think to do
this thing when indeed she was the better able to mind it, and I the
better suited to have me to my rest. And, surely, this was very true,
and I made no ado, save to give her the ointment; but lay back, and did
be quiet.

Now I did be upon my right side, and she went to my back, and took the
cloak from about her, and spread it upon me, and afterward stoopt over
very dainty, and kist me, and bade me to go very swift to my sleep, for
that she did mean to make her toilet and to get into mine Armour-Suit.

And I made no foolishness in this matter; yet told her to ease the cloak
a little about me, so that I should have room to take the Diskos from my
hip; and this thing I did, and took the Diskos to my breast, as was my
habit; and surely I saw that her eyes did look at me with a little
shining, because that I had so strange and fierce a bed-mate.

And I made her to promise that she keep a very keen harking, the which
was like that she should do, and to call me on the instant that she did
perceive any unease in the night. And after that, I shut mine eyes, that
I should not shame her, and put out mine arms, and kist her once and
turned from her unto my slumber; and she away to my back that she might
be modest to her needs.

And surely, I was asleep in but a little moment, and with a great love
and delight in my heart and in all my being.

And, truly, I waked not for twelve great hours. And when that time was
gone, lo! I came awake, and surely the Maid did sit beside me, so bonny,
and so winsome and pretty that mine arms went unto her in a moment, and
she into them, and gave me a loving and tender kiss; and afterward slipt
away from me, very sensible and loving; and did stand up and turn about
to be lookt at. For she did wear the Armour-Suit, and surely it was
loose upon her; but yet very pleasing, being close-knit. And I to my
seat, from lying, that I might see the Maid the better. And, in verity,
I must kiss her again; for she did be with her hair all about her, that
she look pretty unto me; and her little feet did be bare, and so that
they made my heart new tender to look upon them; for truly she was utter
lost of foot-gear. And I to my knee to her; and she, not to deny me, did
come to be kist again.

Now when I found how great a time I had slept, I did scold Mine Own; but
yet, as she did say, I must have long slumber if that I go so long
wakeful, else should I lose my strength. And I askt how oft she had eat,
and she told me but the once, and that six hours off.

And on this I did scold again; but surely she put a very pretty finger
sudden upon my lips, so that I might do naught but laugh, and kiss that
same finger.

And, after that, we did eat and drink, and made plans. And once I did
comfort the Maid; for, indeed, her sorrow did rise in her, because that
her father was come unto his death, and the Peoples of the Lesser
Redoubt all destroyed, and adrift in the night amid the monsters of that
Land.

And, in verity, I was set that we go quickly out of that place, ere
there came an horrid Destruction upon us; and, surely, there should
scarce be any human, beside, in all that Land; for there must have come
death upon the chief of those that did make escape.

And after we had eat and drunk, I did count the packs of the tablets,
and was thankful in all my being that I had been careful and denied my
belly; for I did perceive that there were left enough for our needs, if
that we made a good speed, and did not fear to be empty. And of the
water-powder, as it might be named, there were left two full flasks, and
somewhat of that one that I had drunk from, all my journeying. And by
this thing you shall perceive that we did not be like to die for the
need of such matters.

And here, as it doth occur unto me, I do ponder how it did be that we
had no thought to slay any small creature for our food; but, mayhap, we
had no knowledge this way; for surely, they did not this thing to my
knowing in the Mighty Pyramid. But yet, as I have said before this, I
have not all knowledge of the doings of the Peoples. But, in verity, I
never saw joint meat in all the time of that far Life that I do wot of.
Yet, had we but slain somewhat for our hunger in that great wandering,
we had been less empty in the belly.

Now, before that we should do aught beside, we must contrive that Naani
have some gear for her feet; and to this intent, I did make a search
into the pouch, and surely I found that there did be a change pair of
inner shoes, that were made to go within mine own shoes of the grey
metal.

And at this I was wondrous glad, and did make the Maid to sit upon a
little rock, while that I made a fitting of the shoes. And, surely, they
did be utter big and clumsy upon her little feet; so that I was in
surprise to know how great is a man, beside a Maid. But in the end I had
a cunning thought, for I cut off all the side of a strap, throughout the
length of the strap, very thin and careful, and so had a lace to tie the
boots around the tops, which were soft and easy for such a purpose. And
after that, I stood away to look at the Maid, and neither she nor I were
truly pleased; for, indeed, she was too pretty to be so hid and muffled.
Yet were we glad otherwise; for now she might go without hurt to her
feet.

And afterward, we packt our gear, and she did make a bundle of her torn
garments; for, truly, they might be proper somewise to our need. And so
we to begin the way out of that Desolate Land.

And we went forward together across the Land, and the journey was no
more a weariness, but of a close and sweet joy; yet did I have a new
anxiousness, as you do perceive, lest that any monster come to harm Mine
Own.

And we went twelve great hours in the bed of the olden sea, and did eat
twice in that time. And surely the Maid did grow utter weak and weary;
for she was not come proper unto her strength; yet did she make no odd
saying to tell me of this thing. But indeed, I did know; and I stopt in
the thirteenth hour, and took her into mine arms, even as I should carry
a babe; and I went forward with her, and did hush her protesting with a
kiss, and afterward she did but nestle unto me and shelter against my
breast.

And I bade the Maid to sleep; but, indeed, she had no power to this end,
for her body did ache very sore; but yet did she strive to give me an
obedience in this thing. And in the eighteenth hour, when that I stopt
to have food and drink, surely she did be awake, yet had she been utter
silent; and I made to scold her; but she gat from mine arms, and did go
upward upon her toes, and put her finger against my lips very naughtily.
And afterward she did be impudent unto me, and did deny me to kiss her.
But she went unto my back, and did open the scrip, and gat me to my
food, even as a quiet and proper wife should go. As she did be so sedate
that I knew she had mischief her heart of harmless kind.

But afterward this did pass sudden into weeping; for she had a quick and
sore memory of her father and of the Destruction; and I took the Maid
into mine arms, and did let her be there very gentle, and made not to
kiss or to comfort her; but yet to give comfort.

And presently she ceased from weeping, and did slip her hand into mine,
and I to keep it within, very soft and quiet; and afterward, she began
to eat her tablets, yet always she did be very husht; so that I did be
quiet also, and feel as that my love did be round her as a shield. And I
knew that she had knowledge of this thing in her heart.

And oft I harked into the night of the Land; but there was nowhere any
sound, or disturbing of the aether, to trouble me. And the Maid in mine
arms did know when that I harked; for in verity, she had the
Night-Hearing and the understanding spirit that doth be needful to such.
And odd whiles did I look down to her through the gloom that did be
about us; and presently I did perceive that she lookt up to me, out of
mine arms.

And I kist her.

Now, in all that day, we had come nowhere upon any fire-hole in the bed
of the olden sea; and truly I did ache to be nigh unto the warmth of
such; for I did feel the cold of the Land, because that I was weary, and
because that I had not the thickness of the Armour-Suit below mine
armour to warm me.

And the cloak did be about the Maid; for I had feared that she should
grow cold as I carried her. Yet, now she did know subtly that I was come
to feel the utter chill of the Land; and she gat from mine arms, and put
the cloak about me, and afterward came again into mine arms. And I let
the cloak bide there, and drew it forward to be around her, also. Yet,
truly, I was joyful that I did be cold, as you shall perceive. For it
was sweet to the heart to bear somewhat of that dread chill for Mine
Own; and she half troubled and likewise with understanding of my heart,
because that I was less clothed than I had been.

Now, in a little while, the Maid did pack the scrip; and so we did make
ready again to go forward, for I was grown anxious, as you may suppose,
that we should come to some fire-hole, that we have a place for sleep
that had warmth and light; for, truly, the cold of the Land did be drear
and horrid.

And I stoopt to take the Maid into mine arms, that I should carry her;
but she did say nay, that she did be well rested. And I not to gainsay
her, for she did mean the thing, as I perceived, and I had no desire to
force my way upon her, save when I saw truly that she did seem to go
unwisely. And, indeed, when such did be the case I did strive with her,
only with a nice reasonableness, as you shall know.

And the Maid walkt by my side, and wondrous silent; but yet very nigh to
me, so that I knew she did be very full of love to me, and of that
quaint and sweet humbleness that love doth breed odd whiles in a woman
when she doth be with her man, if but that man be also her master. And
presently, I perceived that the cloak did be over mine own shoulders,
and I took it and would have put it about the Maid; but truly she did
not allow this; and when I did be stern with her, that she obey me in
this matter, she did stand upon her toes, that she might kiss me, and
pulled my head down, and surely she kist me and coaxed me that I wear
the cloak, else should I give pain to her, in that I did surely be cold
because she did wear the Armour-Suit.

Yet, I would not hark to this thing; so that the Maid did be truly in
trouble. And first she made a threatening that she wear but her olden
garments that did be only rags, if that I did persist. But this I saw to
be foolishness and scarce-meant, and did as much need to smile at her as
that I did think to scold her; but I did be firm that she wear the
cloak.

And lo! she went sudden into crying; and this had been beyond my
thoughts. And truly, it set me all adrift; for I perceived that she did
be greatly distrest concerning this matter, when I had conceived that
she did but mean this thing for tenderness' sake. But mine heart helped
me to understand, and I saw how she did be truly shamed, in her sweet
womanhood, if that I helped her not in this matter; for she did feel
that she was made to do hurt unto that one that was her Love. And this
thing I do pray you to think upon, that you understand; for, indeed,
until that I was made to think, I had not seen it thiswise, for her.

And in the end, I came to agreement with the Maid, that we wear the
garment hour by hour, in turn; and she to wear it the first hour and I
to wear it the second hour; and so to go forward.

And truly, this did be an happy arranging; but yet she stampt her foot a
little, as I put the cloak about her. And thrice in the hour did she ask
me concerning the time that was gone; and surely, when the hour was but
up, she had the cloak off in a moment, and went to my back and cast it
upon my shoulders, and after to my front, and made it fast upon my
breast; and so eager and naughty was she to this, that I took her by the
shoulders, and shook her, somewhat, even as she had made to stamp at me;
yet mayhaps with more of laughter. And she to take no heed at all; but
to button the cloak and be very sedate. Yet, in verity, I caught her up
into mine arms, and kissed her, for a sweet and naughty Maid; and she
very willing, now that she had gotten something of her way.

But yet in an hour, I did have the cloak about her, again; and so did
straiten matters, as you shall conceive.

Now, when we had gone forward, through five great hours, I perceived
that the Maid did be utter worn, but yet did make presence that she was
unwearied. And because I saw how she did be, I did heed and be anxious
only that we come to some rock, to be for our safe refuge, and mayhap
there to find an hole or cave, that should be somewhat to keep our heat
about us; for there was nowhere any fire-hole anigh in all those hours.

And presently, we came to a part where there did be rocks, and we went
to and fro in the gloom, and came in the end to a place where the rocks
did go upward into the night, as that it had been a small and ancient
cliff.

And surely in a while I found a hole that did go inwards of the rock;
and the hole did be above mine head; yet when I was come to it, and had
made the Diskos to spin therein, that I should have light to see whether
there did be any creature or creeping thing in the hole, I was well
pleased; for truly it did be sweet and dry.

Now the Maid had cried out a little to see the sudden shining that did
come from within the hole, when I made the Diskos to spin, and because
of the low roar of the weapon. But I answered her that there did be
naught to have fear concerning; and so was she peaceful again, but yet a
little trembling when that I came down to her; for, indeed, the Diskos
did make always a strange sounding and a quaint and drear shining, as
you do know; and she did be feared for me that some Evil Force had come
upon me out of the cave; for she had neither knowledge nor conceiving
that ever there did be so wondrous a weapon in all the world.

And I gave the Maid an help upward to the little cave, and came after,
myself; and so we did be in a very nice and cosy place, that did not be
easily gotten at by any monstrous thing. And surely I was utter glad for
such a place, so that both should have safety that we might sleep in the
same hours.

And, in truth, this was a needful plan; for if one had stayed wakeful to
keep a watch for the other, then had our sleep taken us double hours;
and this thing might not be, else should our food be done, and we to be
twice so long as need be, ere ever we did come unto the refuge of the
Mighty Pyramid; and I utter wearied and anxious of the heart and spirit
that I bring Mine Own soon unto the safety and glory of my Mighty Home,
and so free from the Destruction that did hang above our two souls for
ever in that Land, and the peril that did be everywhere, save in the
Last Redoubt.

Now when we were come into the hole of the rock, the Maid did slip the
scrip and the pouch from my shoulders; and she gat out the tablets, and
made some of the water, and did be very swift and natty, and all to the
despite of the gloom that did be utter in that little cave.

And we eat each of us two of the tablets and drank some of the water;
and I made jest with the Maid how that the tablets did be proper for
strength, yet very lacking to fill the belly; though, indeed, I named it
otherwise.

And she to agree, and did pat mine arm, and did tell me how that she
should cook me a monstrous tasty and great meal when that we were come
unto the Mighty Pyramid. And immediately afterward, she did make to
laugh upon me, and to name me impudently for so much thought unto my
feeding; and afterward again to silence, and to patting my hand.

Now, when that we had made an end of eating and drinking, I was very
ready for sleep; for, truly, it was six and twenty great hours since
that I did last slumber; but for the Maid it did be eight and thirty
great hours; for, as you do mind, she had made no sleeping when that she
did lie in mine arms for six hours of our journeying.

And I made how we should sleep; and put the cloak about the Maid; but
surely she did refuse, very piteous, and seeming to have also somewhat
of doubt and puzzlement. But in this thing I did be very stern and
intending; for she did not be over-warm clad, as you do know, and
moreover, she was but a little One, while I did be wondrous hardy.

And, in verity, I made her to obey, and gave her the scrip and the pouch
for her pillow; and she, as it did seem to me, to sob to herself a
little in the gloom of the night. But yet did I stay my heart a little
stern to mine intent. And I wrapt the cloak about her, and set the scrip
and the pouch very nice beneath her head; and afterward, I knelt over to
kiss her, before that I came unto mine own slumber. Yet did she turn her
mouth from me, and did put her hand above her face to ward me off, the
which did grieve me; for truly, I did heed alway that I should never
thrust my love upon her in her lonesomeness; but only let it be to her
for a shield and for all comfort unto her heart.

And I turned my back, and went a pace away and lay down; for truly there
did be no way else but to be near unto the Maid, for it was but a little
cave. And I lay very husht, because that I was so sore in the heart.
Yet, truly, I could not come unto my slumber, for I was so disturbed in
my love; and I stayed very quiet maybe for a great hour; and did fight
that I shake not mine armour to jinglings with the utter cold that did
make me to tremble. But the Maid did sleep very sweet and calm, as I
perceived by her breathings.

Yet, in verity, the Maid did be so much awake as I, and with some sweet
and naughty intent of the heart, as my spirit did sudden perceive. And I
lay very husht, and did wait to discover what this thing might be.

And I made my breathing to seem as the breathing of one that did sleep,
even as that naughty Maid did make pretending. And surely, in a while I
did know that she moved very quiet, and came unto me; and I made yet
that I slept very sound and strong; though the cold did nigh to conquer
all my quietness.

And in a moment I perceived the intent of the Maid; for I did feel the
cloak spread over me with a wondrous gentleness; and afterward there did
be a soft kiss put upon my hand; and the Maid back then to her pillow;
yet, as I did hear, she brought it something more nigh to me; as that
she did crave to be near unto me that was her own Love.

And I sat up, and I put forth my hands suddenly and took the Maid into
mine arms; and she to nestle unto me so that I did be wordless, because
that I loved her so utter.

And presently, I felt her to stir in mine arms; and I loost her
somewhat; for I did be always very mindful that I impose not upon her
dear liberty of maidenhood. Yet she made not to go from me, but only to
gather the cloak about her; so that we did both be in the cloak. And she
askt why this might not be; for surely it did be madness that one should
starve and the other be very nice in warmth. And, indeed, this did be
but wisdom; yet it might not come the first from me.

And I said to Mine Own that this thing should be; and she reached out,
and brought the scrip and the pouch, and placed them for a pillow for my
head, and told me that I should put my head thereon. And I askt her how
this did be right; for she did need a pillow the more than I. But she
bid me to bide, and to have obedience in my turn. And when I was so, she
spread the cloak over me, and afterward crept under, and did lie down
beside me, and did seem as that she was asleep in one moment.

Yet, though she did be so sedate and matter-of-the-fact, as we do say,
while that she was wakeful, she did yet nestle unto me very sweet and
childlike in her sleep. And surely I did want to kiss her; but yet did
refrain from my love; for, truly, I did well that I treat her very
gently, at such a time, as you do perceive. And, in verity, such a Maid
doth make a reverence in the soul of a man.

Now, presently, I was gone over unto sleep; and in seven hours I waked;
and in that time had the Maid slumbered through eight hours; yet did I
intend that she be not disturbed, until that we were aready to the
journey. And I slipt from under the cloak, and put it round her, very
gentle. Yet it to be as she did miss me, even in her sleep; for it to
seem to me that she put out her arms in the darkness, and she made a
little moaning in her slumber. Yet, in a moment, she did be quiet, and
afterward I put the cloak about her again.

And I went then to the opening of the little cave, and put forth my
head, and lookt well about, and harked a long while; but there stirred
nothing in the night thereabout; neither did my spirit wot of any matter
for trouble unto us.

And presently, I gat out two of the tablets; for, as you do know, the
Maid had given me the scrip and the pouch to be my pillow, so that I had
power to come at these matters, without awaking her; but for her own
part, as I did learn after, she had used her torn garments to be for a
pillow; yet had made no explaining, as you do mind; and surely this was
one of her naughty whimsies; and mayhap she had been so full of a
playful happiness--as doth take the heart betimes--that she had made a
little mystery where there did be no mystery; and this but to release
her joy, and so to say masterful things unto me, out of her impudence;
and afterward had meant that she tell me; but yet was gone unto slumber,
ere that she did mind her.

Yet, since that time, a new thought hath come unto me that she did mean
in the first that she should come into mine arms to sleep, and thereby
need no pillow. But afterward, it may hap that she saw with a sudden
olden wisdom, all in one moment; and afterward did act lovingly, yet
with understanding. And so did change from her intent; yet with no
improperness of modesty; but only with a niceness of Sense, which she
did make no talk of; but yet did have. And surely, how oft is a man thus
wisely ordered, unknowing.

And to cease from these thinkings, and to go forward, I eat two of the
tablets, and afterward made some of the water. And lo! the fizzing of
the water waked the Maid; and I knew that she reached out very sudden to
me; but afterward knew in a moment what did make the sound, and that I
did be up and making ready for the journeying.

And she gat up in the darkness, and said my name, and came unto me, and
kist my forehead in the dark; and immediately she ran her hands gently
downward of my left arm, and when she came to the cup, she took it from
me, and slapt my hand, very dainty. And afterward I knew that she took a
sip from the cup, and then did turn that side to me, and so gave me to
drink, and did scold me that I had not waked her to tend to my needs;
for surely she did be Mine Own, to have her duties to me.

And after that I had drank, she took the cup, and did finish it; and she
gat two of the tablets, as I did think, and came afterward and sat upon
the rock to my side, and did nestle somewhat against mine armour, and
took mine arm and set it about her; and so did make to eat.

But first she put her tablet unto my lips, in the dark, that I should
kiss it; and surely this was an olden way of Mirdath My Beautiful One;
so that I did be all shaken of the heart. And I kist the tablet; and
immediately she nestled unto me, and did begin to eat.

And truly it was as that Eternity had been rolled backward; for I had
discovered the soul of mine olden Love in this dainty Maid to my side.
Yet, in looks had Mirdath been of an utter differing; but, in verity
Naani was wondrous lovely. But, though I to be so stirred, I did be
silent; for my heart was very full of memory.

And as the Maid eat, she slipt her fingers between mine, curling them
softly; and surely her fingers did be very little; and she stirred mine
olden memories again in this thing. And surely I was dumb before my
Memory.

And presently, she put up the second tablet, as I did think, that I
should kiss it; and I kist it, as before. Yet, ere she did begin again
to eat, I did wot suddenly that she hid some intent from me.

And I caught her hand very quick in the dark; and her fingers did close
upon the tablet, very guilty; so that I perceived that I had guessed
aright. And I opened her fingers; and I found that there did be but the
half of a tablet within her hand. And surely she had taken but that one
tablet, and had given me the one end to kiss, and afterward the other;
so that I should suppose she did eat two proper and complete tablets.

And I perceived that she had done this thing secretly, being minded that
if she eat always but one tablet, then should I never lack, even if that
we did be over-long coming unto the Mighty Pyramid.

And I askt how oft already had she eat but one, for two. And she
confessed in a very quiet voice that this did make the fifth time. And I
was so angered, that I took her hand and whipt it thrice, so hard that
she had screamed if that she had been any coward. And she said nothing
to me, neither went away.

And she began again to eat the half of the tablet, and did eat it from
the other hand, as I to be aware, because that her left hand did be
hurt. And she wept not, but was very quiet by me; and presently I knew
that she kist the whipt hand secretly in the dark.

And afterward, I put mine arm again about her; and she did be there in
it, very sober and happy. And when she had made an end of the first
tablet, I gave her the second, and she eat it very quiet and content.

And presently I talked with her, and showed her how that this thing did
hurt my heart, even as she had been hurt that I did be cold garmented,
the while that she did be warm. And I showed her the wickedness that she
had done, that she did play so foolish with her life and strength; and
well might she be weak and all a-lack.

Yet, did I think a little sweet impudence came into her, as I told her
concerning her wickednesses. And I took her then into mine arms, and I
showed her how that I knew all the unselfishness and wonder of her
heart; and I kist her, and truly her lips did have a lovely glad
humbleness as they came unto mine; so that it was as that I had not kist
her truly until that moment. And I made her to promise that she never
deceive me in such matter again. And indeed she promised; but yet with
no ready tongue.

And afterward, we made proper for the journey; and when we had gotten
our gear together, I went downward of the rock, and gave the Maid help
to come down. And when we did stand at last upon the bottom of the rock,
I askt Naani how she did feel, and whether her feet did hurt. And she
answered that she did be very well and had no soreness in her feet.

And we went forward then, and she close unto me; and odd whiles with low
speech, but more oft with silence, because that we did need that we hark
alway for any danger or horror; and also there did be so utter a silence
upon that part of the Land, which did be the bottom of the olden sea.
And we eat and drank at the sixth and the twelfth hours; and in the
fifteenth hour, we came upon a great slope of the earth; and lo! it did
be the far side of the sea. And we went upward for a long hour; and so
came to the upward part, and did be able once more to look over the
greatness of that Land.




XI

THE HOMEWARD WAY


Now, truly, it did seem very light, after the horrid and lonesome gloom
that did lie all-ways in the bottom of the olden sea; and I saw that I
was come out upon a part of the Land that did be surely to the right of
that place where I made entry into the sea-bed, on mine outward going.
And there did be a great plenty of fire-holes, so that mine heart was
warmed to see them; yet did I mind to be wary in coming unto them; for,
as you do know, there did so oft be life of this kind and that about
these fires.

And I lookt now down to the Maid, and she upward to me, and did come
more anigh to me, and truly she did be most wondrous pretty and sweet;
yet did seem very awearied and pale in the face; so that I made blame
upon myself that I had overwalked her; for, in verity, I do think that I
was so strong and hard as that I had been made from iron; and she but a
dear and tender Maid. Yet did she refuse that I should so reproach
myself; and did but stand anigh to me and look at me with eyes that were
very beautiful. And so I put mine arms about her, and kist her; and
afterward lookt again over the Land, that I should shape out our further
journeying.

And from that place where I did stand, there spread out all before me
the blue shining that I had seen from the mouth-part of the Upward
Gorge; yet did it be a great way off. And, indeed, I should tell you in
this place, that it was by the glimmering of this shine within the sky
of the night that I had steered, as we did come across the olden
sea-bed. And, truly, it was but a broad thing to go toward; but yet did
serve me, in that it told me that I went toward the far side of the
sea-bed, and made not to go all about in blind circles in the night.

And after that I had considered a while, I did know somewhat where the
Gorge should be, and perceived that I should go unto my left; but not
overmuch, for indeed I saw the red-shining of the giants' hole that lay
at a great space that way; and surely I must go so that I missed the
place of the giants so much as I might, and in the same going, come not
overnear unto the blue-shining that lay before me, across all the far
part of that Country; for, in verity, I Mistrusted the place where that
shining did be.

Now when I had gained somewhat of knowledge where should be found the
Mouth of the Upward Gorge, I put mine arm about the Maid, where she did
stand so nigh to me, and very husht, the while that I had lookt about. And
I pointed outward over the dark Land unto my left, and told her that the
Gorge did be somewhere that way, a great distance off; yet utter out of my
sight, and only to be known that it did be somewise there by the things
that I did mind of, concerning my way after I came into the Land.

Now the Maid, having stood very quiet, had lookt all that time about
her; and so had come to some knowing of the place where she did be in the
Land, for she to know the land someways, as you shall think. And she askt
me how I did mind to go; and truly I said, so straight as we might; but yet
so that we come neither too nigh to the shining nor to the great red
fire-pit of the Giants.

And the Maid bade me to look in the way that I did mind to go; and I
lookt, but yet there was nothing save, as they did seem, certain
fire-holes that had a green-shining about them. And she set out unto me
then, how that there did go a tract of bad gas in that part of the
Land, that should be utter poisonous unto any; and this had been well
known in the Lesser Redoubt, by the reading of their instruments. And
where the gas did go, there was there a green-shining about the
fire-holes.

And she showed me how that the Place of the Gas went a great way unto
the North-West, so that I learned now somewhat how the land did lie, as we
do say in these days. And it was in all the North-West that the great
blue-shining did burn. And I askt Naani how they named this, and she told
me by no name, save but The Shine.

And Mine Own made very earnest to warn me, regarding The Shine; and urged
that we go no more that-wards than should be needful to our lives--the
which, indeed, was no wish of mine. And her reason to be that the Fixed
Giants did be within the borders of The Shine, and all hid in the light
thereof, save when the burning mist did roll this way or that. And I
took a great heed of this thing, and did guess that these Fixed Giants
were somewhat even as the Great Watchers that were about the Mighty
Pyramid, as you do know. And immediately I minded me of that utter
monstrous face that I did see amid the bright smoke of The Shine, when
that I came first into the Land; and surely this had been one of the
Fixed Giants, that Naani told me were Forces of great and very horrid
Evil.

And I askt Mine Own how far the Place of the Gas went across the Land;
and she pointed and made further explaining. And, in verity, in the
end, I saw not how I should come that way to the mouth of the Gorge, if
that I would keep off-wards from The Shine. Yet, in a moment, Naani askt
me how I did come across the Land, when that I searched for her. And,
truly, as I showed her, I had walked then by a sweet chance, or guiding,
alway upon the far side of the Place of the Gas, and so unto the Olden
Sea bed; and was in this way come free of the gas, and all unknowing of
it.

And at this telling, the Maid said that we go downward again into the
bed of the Olden Sea, and walk some great hours below the shore, but in
the way that should take us unto the South-West, and so until we were
come beyond the Place of the Gas. And afterward up again into the Land,
and then to have an utter caution that we escape the watching of the
giants who did be ever about the Great Red Fire-Hole. And by this plan
very speedy to the entering-part of the Upward Gorge.

And, truly, this did be very good and sound, and such as I should have
planned in a moment; for, indeed, I am not over-slow in such matters;
only the Maid did be very eager and quick; and it was very sweet to me
that she should thus plan; for, in verity, I loved alway the sounding of
her voice, and to hear her have speech and to plan and think, and so to
show me the workings of her inward self and her dear qualities and human
niceness. And to have part and lot alway with me in all things and
thinkings.

And, we shaped to this plan that Naani made; but at that time, as you do
mind, it was somewhat of seventeen hours since last we had slumber; and
the Maid was sore wearied, as I did see. And I showed to her how that it
did be wise that we have our rest very soon, and so forward again in new
strength and ability.

And the Maid did soon agree with me; for indeed she was very weary; and
we made it that we should venture unto one of the fire-holes that lay no
great seeming away, a little upon our right, which was the Northward-way
of that Land.

And we went toward the fire-hole; and, truly, it did be further off than
we had thought; for it was a good hour before that we came anigh to it;
and, indeed, it to prove a very great and red-glowing shine that went
upward into the night, out of the hollow place where it did burn among
rocks.

And when we were come near unto it, I made a sign to the Maid that she
be utter husht; and I took the Diskos from mine hip, and went forward
before her; and afterward to my knees and hands, and beckoned backward
to Mine Own, that she do likewise.

And we came this way to the edge of the hollow-place where the fire-hole
did burn; and so were able in the end to look downward. And truly it was
a great fire that burned in the earth in that place; yet, as I perceived
very swift, there did seem nowhere any monstrous thing about the fire,
the which set some peace upon mine heart; but yet not overmuch; for it
was come fresh upon me that we did well to stay afar off from the fires
of the Land, in that it was about the fires that all living things did
congregate.

And I lookt a great time, and the Maid crept unto mine elbow, and lookt
with me; and afterward we harked, very keen, into the night; but there
was nowhere any trouble of the air or of the aether of the Land. Yet I
spoke quiet with the Maid, and showed unto her how that we did well to
stay off-ward from the fires; but, truly, she was so utter cold and
chill, that she did beg that we go down by the fire-hole, even should it
be that we stay no more there than should put a warmth through the utter
chill of our bodies.

And, in verity, I was so bitter cold that I was all weak to go beside
the fire; yet, truly, I do think that the shiverings of the Maid was
that which did force my heart, to go against the teachings of my head;
so that in the end, we came down into the hollow, and very swift unto
the fire.

Now, truly, it doth seem a strange thing to be so diverse-minded as
this, when that, as you do know, I had been so long a-search for a
fire-pit; and mayhaps you shall perceive the better how my heart and
brain did be contrary, when that I tell to you, now, how that I have
belief that my spirit did even then be subtly set to warn me. And, also,
as all do know, it doth be easy to forget this warning and that of
experience; by which saying, I do mean that, oft as I had come to know
the dangers that did be alway about the fire-holes, yet when I did be
far off from them, and Mine Own broken and a-shiver with the chill of
the Land, the danger did seem but a small thing and afar off from my
mind, and unreal; but the cold to be doubly real. Yet, when we did come
even unto the fire-hole, then did come again all about my heart the
truth of those dangers that had seemed, but a while gone, so little.
And, indeed, I do hope you perceive me in this thing, and how that I
strive alway to set unto you the utter truth, so that you shall go with
me all the way, and lend me your nice understanding.

Now, when we were come down unto the fire-pit, I went this way and that
among the rocks that did be in the bottom of the hollow, so that I
should perceive whether there did be any living creature there hid, that
should mayhap come out, unknown, to work us harm.

But, indeed, I discovered nothing of any greatness; yet I saw three
snakes, and there were, beside, two scorpion-creatures, as I did name
them, that neither went backward from me, nor came against me; but did
bide where I saw them, each in an hole of the rock.

And because I had seen these things, I saw that we should not do wise to
sleep nigh unto the fire-hole; for the creeping things did mortally like
the heat, and should be like to come upon us in our slumber. And,
indeed, this did but uphold my caution, that we should be well
actioned, if that we chose some other part to our rest.

Yet, as you shall suppose, I said naught unto the Maid concerning the
creeping and the poisonous things; for I did mean that she have rest and
happiness the while that we did stay beside the fire-hole; and
afterward, I should tell her, and so she be the more ready to see the
properness that we go elsewhere to our sleep. But, as you to understand,
if that she not to see wisely and be still intent to the fire-hole, I
should have her to obey; for surely she was Mine Own, and I did love her
and did mean alway to have her to safety.

Now, presently, the Maid was something warmed, and afterward, she slipt
the scrip from my shoulder, and so had food and drink very swift to my
need.

And we sat together, and eat and drank; and the Maid very sweet and
quiet, as she did begin to eat her second tablet; and, truly, I had
knowing that she did remember in all her body that I had whipt her. And,
indeed, she did be utter mine.

And oft as we did eat and drink, I lookt this way and that, so that no
creeping thing should come anigh to us; and presently, when we had made
an end of our food, the Maid saw that I did look about, and she then
very swift to catch some of mine unease, and to stare over her shoulder.
And, indeed, in a little while she saw a snake go among the rocks; and
she then to be very eager that we find some place that should be secure
from creeping things. And we to begin then to look for such.

But in the end, we stayed in the hollow, for we found a little cave that
did be in an upstanding rock of the hollow, and the upstanding rock was,
mayhaps, an hundred good feet off from the fire; for the hollow was very
great. And the cave did be a hole that was thrice my height up from the
bottom rocks; and it was dry and sweet and with no creeping thing within
it, neither did there be any place to hide such therein.

And when we were gotten into the hole, surely it did be very sweet and
cozy; for the shine of the fire-hole did shine therein; and surely we
had felt it a very haven, but that there was ever the fear of the Land
upon our hearts; and upon mine the more than upon the Maid; for, truly,
Mine Own did seem to trust me utter; and to seem that she feared not any
evil monster, but to have surety that I had power to succour her in all
ways. And truly this trust had been very sweet unto my heart, if that I
had lacked somewhat of my terror for the safe home-going of Mine Own.

And we slept that night as we had done before, and shared the cloak over
us; for truly, the fire-hole made no great warmth unto us; yet was it
less bitter in that part than in the darkness of the Land.

And by that we had come unto sleep, it was twenty good hours since last
we had slumber; and truly we did be very wearied; but yet came unto our
rest with our spirits set anxious to harken on danger the while that we
did sleep.

And we slept seven hours, and did know suddenly of some matter that had
need to waken us; and lo! in a moment I did wake, and the Maid in the
same instant of time; and there was a great screaming and crying out in
the night, that surely affrighted us both; yet did hurt our hearts the
more; for it did be the utter cryings and terror of poor humans in the
night of that Land. Yet might I do naught; but only wait that I learn
more of the matter; for my duty was unto Mine Own, and I had no leave of
rashness any more.

Yet, as you do suppose, I was all shaken to go downward of the rock, and
afterward to climb out from the hollow, that I should give some help
unto they that did need help; but yet might I not leave the Maid.

And immediately, there was a great roaring in one part of the night, and
again another roaring in another part of the night; and lo! in a moment
the roarings did be answered; and the roarings were the sounds of big
and husky voices; so that it did seem that we harked to men so big as
houses that did run and shout in the night.

And the Maid did begin to shake, and I put mine arm about her, and drew
her backward into the hole so that she did be into the shadow; and she
to tremble like one that was broken in courage; for, truly, she had
heard those sounds oft in the night in all the long and dreadful month
that she had wandered.

And, indeed, I was all shaken in my courage; for it did be the shouting
of giants that I heard; and you do know somewhat of the utter horror and
terror that did be alway in the heart that did harken unto those
monstrous voices, for you do know my tale.

And there came in a moment, a dreadful screaming out in the night, and
the screaming did be the screaming of a young maid that doth be slain
very brutal. And my heart sickened, because of Mine Own; but my spirit
did swell with a strange and utter anger, as that it should burst my
body. And the Maid to my side broke into an utter sobbing.

And the screaming of the maid afar off in the dark did end very sudden;
but in a moment there did be other screamings in diverse places, and the
hoarse shoutings of the great men and the thudding of mighty feet that
ran this way and that, a-chase.

And the cryings of the humans came nearer, and the thuddings of the
great feet. And, in verity, in a little minute, it did seem unto me that
the sounds did be right upon the hollow; and I crept forward, and peered
out. And I felt the night to be full of people running; and immediately
there passed by the hollow a clustering of humans that ran ever, and
screamed and gasped and wept, panting, as they ran. And the shining of
the fire-hole made them plain seen and clear, and they did be both men
and women, and were but in rags or utter naked, and all torn by the
rocks and the bushes, and did seem, indeed, as that they had been wild
things that did go by so swift and lost.

And mine heart troubled me with the pain and longing that it did know;
so that I had gone in a moment after those people, but that I should
leave Mine Own and put her to peril. And even while that I felt so utter
in this thing, there came a great thudding of monstrous feet; and there
ran four great men out of the night, and went past the hollow very
quick. And three did be dull coloured and seeming much haired and
brutish; but the other did be an horrid white, and livid-blotched; so
that it did seem to my spirit that there went by, a thing that did be a
very man-monster filled of unwholesome life. And surely they did be gone
from out of the shine of the fire, in one moment, as we do say; and
again into the night to their dreadful chasing.

And when the thudding of their feet had gone a long way off over the
Land, I heard them bellowing, and afterward a far away screaming, that
did have a death note in it; and I knew that those dreadful brute-men
did be taking the life from some poor wild humans; and afterward there
did be the silence again.

And, surely, it did come to me with a fierce impatience of sorrow, that
those people did be without spirit of courage; else had they turned them
upon the giants, and slain them with their hands, even if that all had
died to compass that slaying; for, truly, they should all die anywise by
the giant-men; and they had died then with somewhat to comfort their
hate.

Yet, as I do know, the Peoples of the Lesser Redoubt had long been born
of parents that were starved of the Earth-Current through an
hundred-thousand years and more, and because of this thing, they did
surely lack somewhat in all ways. Yet was Naani otherwise; but this not
to prove aught, save the rule, as we do say.

Now, sudden, as I stooped very husht and troubled in the mouth of the
little cave, I knew that Mine Own sobbed dryly in the back part of the
cave. And I had gone to comfort her, but that in the same moment, I saw
a naked maid run very swift over the edge of the hollow, and did look
over her shoulder, as she ran. And she came to the bottom, and crept in
under a ledge of rock that did be in that place; and she did seem utter
worn, and gone of the spirit, and desperate. And I perceived in the same
instant why that she did go stealthy and swift in that fashion, and to
cower, as for her very life; for there came a squat, haired man, so
broad as a bullock, who did come silent down into the hollow, looking
this way and that, even as a wild beast doth peer, very sudden.

And the Squat Man had instant knowing of the place where the maid did
be; and ran in upon her, with no sound.

And I paused not; but leaped all the great way unto the bottom of the
hollow, which did be, mayhaps, twenty good feet and more; for mine anger
was upon me, and I did mean that I save that one, though I did be
powerless to give succour unto those others.

And I fell strong upon my feet, and had no harm of my limbs, for all
that the leap did be so high. And in that moment, before that I had time
to save the maid, the Squat Man ript her; and she cried out once with a
very dreadful scream, and was suddenly dead in the hands of the
Brute-Man.

And my heart made my blood to burn with wrath in mine eyes, so that I
had scarce power in that instant to see the Squat Man, as I ran upon
him. And the roar of the Diskos filled all the hollow, as I made it to
spin, as that it did rage with an anger, and to be glut of the Man.

And the Man came round upon me; and thought, mayhaps, to deal with me,
as it had dealt with that poor maid, but not all thatwise, as you must
know. And I swung the Diskos, and it did seem to sing and to cry eager
in my hands. And I smote at the Squat Man, even as it did leap silent
upon me, as a tiger doth leap, making no sound. But I gat not home the
blow; for the Man dropt sudden down upon the hands, and the blow went
overwards. And the Brute-Man caught me by the legs, to rip me; and I cut
quick with the Diskos, and it did have but one monstrous talon left unto
it. And immediately, it cast me with the other, half across the hollow,
and I fell with mine armour clanging mightily, and the Diskos did ring
like a bell.

And by the graciousness of all good things, I was harmed not by that
monster throw; but was to my feet in one instant, and had not loosed the
Diskos from my hand. And the Beast-Man did be upon me with two quick
boundings; and I stood up to the Man, and it made no sound or cry as it
came at me; and there did a great froth of brute anger and intent come
from the mouth of it, and the teeth came down on each side of the mouth,
very great and sharp. And I leaped and smote, so that my blow should
come the more speedy, and the Diskos took away the head and the shoulder
of the Squat Man; and the dead thing knockt me backward, with the spring
that it had made; but it harmed me not greatly. Yet afterward I did know
how sore and bruised I did be, in all my body and being. And I came back
very swift against the Man; but it did be truly dead and greatly horrid.

And I went from the dead monster, and did go, all heart-shaken, unto the
dead maid. And I took the torn body of the maid, very sorrowful, and
cast it into the fire-hole.

And I turned me then that I should look unto the cave, that I should
know that all did be well with Mine Own, and whether she did have seen
the horror, or be gone into a swoon.

And lo! Mine Own did run toward me; and she had in her hand my
belt-knife which I did give her, before that time, to be a weapon for
her defence. And I perceived that she had come to be mine aid, if that
I did need such. And she did be utter pale, yet very steadfast and not
seeming to tremble.

And I made to take her from that place; but she went beyond me, and
lookt at the monstrous bulk of the Squat Man; and was very silent. And
she came back unto me; and still so silent. And she stood before me, and
said no word; but my heart knew what she did be thinking; for I am not
foolish, to have lacked to know what did be in her heart; though mine
effort had not shown itself that way unto me, before that moment. And I
had no pretending of modesty, but received with gladness and a
strangeness of humbleness the honour that her eyes did give to me; for,
indeed, she did be so, that she might not give word to her joy of me and
her glad respecting, the which is so wondrous good unto the heart of all
men that do be loving of a dear and honest maid.

And she said nothing, neither then nor afterward; but I did be honoured
all my life after, when that I did anytime mind me of the way that Mine
Own lookt upward at me in those moments.

And afterward she did need and allow herself to come unto mine arms,
that I hold her from the trembling of heart which did come to her, after
that there did be no need for courage; for surely we had both seen a
very dreadful thing, and there was a great horror upon us.

And I climbed upward again to the little cave, and did help Naani; and
when we were come there again, we did rest awhile. And presently we eat,
each of us, two of the tablets and drank some of the water, and indeed
we were both utter thirsty.

And in about an hour, after that we had harked very keen a time, we came
downward again from the cave, and had our gear with us; and we came up
out of the hollow, and set forward with a great caution unto the olden
sea-bed. And we came there in two long hours; for we went very slow and
with constant harkings; for the fear of the monstrous men was upon us.
But there came no harm anigh, neither did we perceive any disturbance in
the night of the Land.

And we went down an hour into the olden sea-bed, and did go now the more
swift; for our fear was something eased from us, because that we had
come away from that place where we had perceived so great and dread an
hunting. But yet had we all care about us; for the giants surely to be
everywhere in that Land; but yet, as I do think, they to roam more oft
anigh to the fire-holes; for the humans did surely wander in such parts,
that they have warmth of the fires.

And after we had gone downward an hour into the sea-bed, we turned
somewhat unto the South-West, and went for twelve great hours, and did
never be any huge space from the shore; for it did run that way, as you
do know. And I made to steer by the shinings of the Land, and with
advices from Mine Own.

And in the end of the twelfth hour, I did count our distance, making
that we did walk somewhat of a certain speed; and by the tellings of the
Maid, we did be surely come beyond the place of the Land where the
Poison Gas did lie.

And by this, it did be something after seventeen hours since we did
sleep; and surely we did be very ready to have rest; for we had gone
forward strongly, and with anxiousness; and truly my hurts did be come
upon me, so that my whole body did ache; for the quick fight had been
bitter, and I had been thrown very hard and brutal; and, indeed, it was
wondrous that I had not been all smashed, only that the armour did save
me.

And this doth show truly how hard and strong I did be; and Naani did
speak upon this, and was oft a-wonder, and at that time did beg me that
I make some rest to cure my hurts; for she had not conceived that a man
did grow so strong and hardy; and, in verity, the men of the Lesser
Redoubt did be soft-made and lacking of grimness, as I did perceive,
both through my reason and from her tellings; for they did lack the
strong life that doth breed where is the beat of the Earth-Current, as
we to have in the Mighty Pyramid. And this thing I have said somewise
before this time.

And because that we did be so wearied, I said unto Naani that we find a
place for our slumber, and she very willing, as I have shown, and to
counsel me likewise.

Yet did we search about in that gloom for a great hour more, and found
no cave or hole to give us a safe refuge for our sleep.

And when that we could not find such, I told Naani that we should put
the boulders together, somewhat, and so have them about us, that we be
greatly hid; and, in truth, even as I began to tell her my plan, she did
have the same words in her mouth, so that we caught our little fingers,
there in the dark of that grim Land in the end of the world, even as she
and I had done oft in the early years, before that eternity, when that
she did be Mirdath the Beautiful. And we did both be silent, and after
that we had wished very solemn and earnest, we said each a name; even as
lad and maid shall do in this age; and so to laughter and kist one the
other. And truly, the world doth seem not to alter in the heart, as you
shall think. And this was what I did find.

And we set-to, and gathered together the boulders which did be very
plentiful in that part. And she carry those that did be thin and flat,
and I to roll those that did be great and round. And I made a place that
did be long and narrow; and afterward, I set the flat stones round the
sides, that there be no little hole by which any creeping thing should
come inward to sting us in our sleep.

And afterward we gat inside; and surely it did be very cozy, as we do
say; but yet not so secure as I did wish, only that I could not shift to
plan aught better. And, indeed, it should keep off from us any small
thing, and should be like to save us from any monstrous Brute treading
upon us; but otherwise, it did be but a poor affair.

Now we eat two of the tablets, each, and drank some of the water, even
as we had done in the sixth and the twelfth hours; and afterward we
shared the cloak for our slumber; and we kist very sedate and loving,
and charged our spirits that we wake if that any horrid thing should
come anigh to us in our sleep; and afterward we did be gone very swift
to slumbering, and suffered no harm.

And I waked seven hours after, and surely I did ache very bitter, as I
did move my body; for the bruisings did be gotten hold of me.

And I slipt away from the Maid, very gentle; for I had mind that she
sleep a while more, as I did mean that we make a great journey that day.

And after I had harked a while, and perceived that there was no evil
thing anigh, I went outward of the stones. And I walked to and fore and
moved mine arms, that I be eased somewhat of the stiffness and ache; but
surely it did seem that many hours must go ere I should make any speed
of travel; for I did be all clumsy and slow and nigh to groan with the
pain of going and aught that I did.

And I minded me that I should do somewhat to ease this thing, lest that
I cause us both to come to an harm by staying over-long in that Land.

And I went back into the stones, and gat an ointment from the pouch,
that I did carry. And surely the Maid did yet sleep. And I went outward
of the stones, again; and stript off the armour, and all my garments;
and I rubbed my body with the ointment, and surely the pain did be so
that I groaned at this time and that; but yet must I rub good and strong
so that I die not of the cold of the Land; and beside I was greatly
anxious to cure myself.

And sudden, as I did rub very strong and savage, and heeding so well as
I might that I groan not, the Maid did speak close beside me. And,
indeed, she could see me but dimly, and had waked sudden to hear my
groaning, and I was not to her side. And immediately she had thought
that some evil thing harmed me, and was come in an instant that she be
with me.

And she cared not that I did be naked; but was utter in anger that I
strove to do this thing alone, and with none to aid me, and all
uncovered to the chill of the Land. And she ran back into the stones,
and brought the cloak and put it about me; and was so angered that she
stampt, and had no impudence, but rather as that she did be minded to
have tears.

And she sent me back into the sheltering of the stones, and gathered
mine armour, and brought these things after me. But the Diskos I took in
my hand. And she took the pot of the ointment from me, and made me to
lie, and she rubbed me very strong and tender, and kept me warm with
the cloak; and surely she was a wise and lovely Maid, and utter Mine
Own.

And in the end, she askt me how I was, and I said that I did be
different; and she hurried me that I be clothed very quick; for she did
be sore afraid that I should come to a chill.

And when I was gotten again into mine armour, she came to me, and showed
me where I did lack wisdom, and spoke very straitly and gentle and
serious; and afterward kist me, and gave me my tablets, and to sit
beside me. And we eat and drank; and I with a new lovingness unto Mine
Own; and she somewhat as that she did mother me; but when I put mine arm
about her, she did be only a maid. And we did be thus, with but little
talk and a great content.

And afterward, we gat our gear together, and went from that little
refuge that we had made; and in a while we did go upward out of the
olden sea-bed.

And when we were come again to the top of the shore, the which we did in
two good hours, I lookt over the Land, a time, with Mine Own anigh to
me. And I perceived that the Great Red Fire-Pit of the Giants did be no
mighty way off unto the South and West; and surely in a little moment,
we saw that there went monstrous figures against the shine of the mighty
fire-pit; and we stoopt unto the earth; for it did seem that the light
did be like to show us standing there, though truly we did be afar off,
as you perceive. Yet, mayhaps, you do share with us the utter horror and
distress that those horrid Men did cast about the heart, and so have a
kindly understanding of our fear.

And over all the Land, in this place and that, there did be the small
shining of little fire-holes and pits, that did be alway red, save in
that part where the Poison Gas did lie, the which we had now come safe
past.

And beyond the fire-holes, was the great Shine, that lay from the West
unto the North of all that Land; and, in verity, we did need that we
steer so that we come not anigh to it, neither unto the Great Red
Fire-Pit of the Giants; neither unto the low volcanoes, which were
beyond the Great Red Fire-Pit, as you do know, and someways unto the
Mouth of the Upward Gorge.

And the way of our journey was between the West and the South-West of
that Land; and to be made with cunning and wisdom, that we come clear of
all unseemly danger unto Mine Own. And I askt her concerning this thing
and that of the Land; and surely she told me so much of terror that I
was half in a wonder that ever I did live in the end to come unto her.

And it was because of the things that she set out to me, that I
perceived how we must come nowise anigh to the low volcanoes that were
upon this side of the mouth of the Upward Gorge; for it had been known
alway in the Lesser Redoubt that there went very horrid men in that
part that did be called wolf-men; but whether there did be any such
thing in that age, she had no knowing; for she told me the things that
did be set down in the Records and the Histories; and truly no man of
the Lesser Redoubt had found heart in a thousand great years to make a
journeying through the Land, for the desire of glad and dreadful
adventuring, such as our young men did be oft set to; though it was not
all such that went.

And because there did be no adventuring for so monstrous a space of
years, there was no certain new knowledge of the Land of that age. And
this thing is plain to you, and needing not of many words, which do so
irk me.

And Naani set out to me how that The Shine was conceived to be a land
where Evil did live for ever, and whence came all those Forces of Evil
that did work upon the Lesser Refuge. And afterward, she did quiet; so
that presently I perceived that she did weep to herself, because that
her memory was all new-stirred by my questionings. And I took her very
gentle into mine arms, as we did be there kneeled upon the earth.

And after that time, I askt her no question, save as it did be needful
to our health and life; yet oft did she tell me this thing and that of
her knowledge, to be for mine help and guiding.

Now we went forward, going a space toward the North-West, so that we
come the more clear of the place where did be the Great Red Fire-Pit of
the Giants. And we journeyed with a care alway that we show not
ourselves over-plain unto the light that shone over the Land from the
great Pit; and oft we did creep a while over this stark place and that;
and went nimbly amid the bushes that grew oft in great parts.

And we made six hours this way, and did then have pause, that we eat and
drink; and truly it was nine hours since first I did wake; yet had we
made no pausing, because that we were so set to our journeying to come
clear of the place where did be the Giants.

And after that we had eat and drunk, we went onward again; and made now
unto the South-West; for we did heed that we go no more unto the
North-West, because that should bring us over-near to The Shine.

And in the fourteenth hour of that day's travel, we came to a part where
the Land dipt downward into a broad valley; and surely it did be very
dark down there, and did be seeming shallow, yet truly of a great
deepness; but we went that way, because that it did be a weary long
journey to go around the place where the valley did be.

And the Valley had a different darkness from the gloom that went alway
in the olden sea-bed; for the gloom of the sea-bed did be ever of a
greyness; but the gloom of this Valley had a greater dark within it; yet
did the air seem more clear.

And we went downward three hours into the Valley, and stopt then that
we eat and drink; and truly I had not paused then; but that Mine Own did
insist; for our methods did be like, else, to go all adrift, and we to
be lacking of proper strength.

And this was wisdom of the Maid; but I to be a little irked-like and
restless; and this mayhap because that my blood did itch me, because
that it did be so full of the poison of my bruises.

And it was gone now of seventeen hours since last we did sleep; but yet
did we be ready to go forward, that we come so quick as maybe out of the
dark of that Valley; for there did seem nowheres any fire-hole to make a
light; only that in this place and that, there did be a little blue
shining, as that there burned a strange gas in this part or that.

Now, in two hours after the time that we did eat, we stopt, both of us,
very sudden; for there did be some vague and curious sound in the night.
And we went very swift to the earth, that we be hid, and harked. But did
hear nothing.

And in a while, we to go onward again; yet there did be an unease upon
our spirits; for our spirits did perceive something afar off in the
night; but yet had we no surety in this matter.

And we went forward through a great hour more; and did pass in that
time, two places where the blue-shining did be; and truly it seemed as
that a low gas hung to the earth in this part and that, and made a slow
burning, having neither noise nor spurtings; but slow, as that it did
smoulder and be all to shine and luminous. And oft there did be a strong
smelling of a bitter gas, very horrid in the throat.

And in the end of another hour, while that we were a space off from one
of those gas-shinings, there went past us at a distance, as it did seem
people, running in the night; as that they did be lost spirits; yet with
a rustling very soft; so that they did be like to be barefoot.

And I thought mayhap that these did be some of the Peoples of the Lesser
Pyramid; yet did they be only as that shadows went among the
blue-shinings. And I pondered a moment, whether that I send my voice
over the Valley, to question what they did be; but yet had caution, and
harked through the utter silence of the night; for I had no surety of
aught.

And, surely, in that moment that we harked very keen, there did be a
sound afar off in the night of the Land; and it was as that we had heard
the sound before; and, in verity, our spirits had perceived the sound,
those two hours back; and now our bodies did wot, and perceived that we
had known it subtly before that moment. And the sound was as that
something went spinning in the night.

And a very great terror came upon the Maid; for she did know the sound;
and the sound was that which did show that one of the great Evil Forces
of the Land did approach; and the sound had been known alway in the
Lesser Refuge to show this thing. And, indeed, mine own spirit had been
half to know that a Power of Evil did come through the night; but yet
was the assurance very terrible; for how should I protect Mine Own.

And the spinning came toward us, and was presently in the Valley; and it
came swiftly across the dark of the Valley. And my heart was all broken
within me, because that there had been happiness with us, but a little
time gone; and now there did be our death anigh.

And Mine Own gave me the knife that I had given to her; meaning that I
slay her, in the last moment; for she did heed even in that moment that
she be not gashed horridly by the terror of the Diskos. And I took the
knife. And I kist not Mine Own; but stood there, very shaken and
desperate, and gript her fast unto me, scarce heeding the hardness of my
gripe; and alway I lookt unto the way of the coming of the Sound. And
presently did unbare my wrist where the Capsule did be.

And the sound of the thing Spinning came anigh, across the Valley; and
my heart did dull and my spirit go black with my desperateness, because
that this thing must be, and because that I could nowhere see hope that
I should save Mine Own.

And, of a sudden, the Maid put up her arms, and pulled me downward, and
kist me once on the lips; but I wot not whether I kist her; for I did
burn with despair and was all adrift in my being. Yet was there a sharp
comfort that mine own dying did be so nigh.

And the Maid stood gently against me; so that she did be convenient unto
my hand. And afterward I remembered this thing; and do you pray that you
be never to have such a matter on your hearts! But, indeed, there was a
wonder in this thing, beside the horror; so that my memory doth be alway
knowing of this wonder; and mayhap you do see with me, and love Mine Own
also in your hearts. And in the moment that the Maid stood thus, as I
have told, I perceived sudden that there did be a little glowing in the
night, and the glowing was pale and horrid. And there was no more any
sound of the Spinning; only there did be, as it were, the trunk of a
great tree, that did show in the glowing; and the trunk of the tree came
toward us across the darkness.

And I turned the Maid from the Tree, and she did flutter a little in my
hands, as I did know, scarce-knowing; for she perceived that she did be
going to die in that moment. And I had my body thus between the Evil
Thing and the Maid. And lo! the Tree came no more anigh to us; but went
backward, and the pale glowing did fade, and the Tree no more to be
seen.

And I cried unto the Maid, very husky, that we did live; for that the
Evil Power was gone off from us; but she answered not, and did be heavy
against me. And I held her, and lookt alway about us, lest the Tree come
in upon the other side.

And, as I lookt this way and that, I saw naught; and afterward, in a
moment, I searched the night above, lest that the Thing come from
above. And, behold, I saw that there abode over us a clear light, as it
were a clear burning Circle, above us in the night. And my heart did
leap with an holy joy and an utter great thankfulness; and I was no more
in fear of the Tree; for, in verity, there fought for our souls one of
those sweet Powers of Goodness, that did strive ever to stand between
the Forces of Evil and the spirit of man; and this matter have I shown
to you, before this time.

And concerning this holy Defense, I have thought that it should not,
mayhap, to have had so strong a power to save us, if that we had shown
an over-weakness and fear, but because that we did rather stand so well
as we might to make battle of escape from so dire a Destruction.

And, surely, this doth seem but a sane thinking unto me; but yet without
proof, and to be said to you, only as the shapings of my thoughts. And
this the chief end of that happening, that the holy Circle did truly
deliver us, and burned through twelve great hours above us; and by this,
do I know that the Evil Power hovered anigh, to destroy us, all that
while; for, indeed, it doth not be proper of reason to suppose that such
an utter wondrous thing did be needlessly over us, save to be a Shield
of Great and Lovely Force against a waiting Evil Thing. And surely you
do see thiswise with me?

And, truly, so soon as my Spirit and Reason perceived that we did be no
more to suffer from the Evil Thing, I remembered that I did know that
Mine Own had swooned. And, in verity, you shall mind how that she did
face her death so utter sweet and brave, and had given no cry, but made
quietly to help me in that dreadful moment, and did stand brave and
gentle to the stroke. And so fell into a swoon, as you have seen,
because that she did suffer an hundred deaths as she did stand so brave,
waiting to be slain, for the blow did be so long delayed, yet to come in
any moment.

And I gat her to come-to unto her life again, and I set the lovely tale
very swift to ease her, and surely with love and warmth, and kist her
with a great joy. And I showed how I did honour her for her good
courage.

And she to weep a little, with the ease come so sudden upon her; and
afterward to kiss me upon the lips an hundred times, and to need that
she be very safe in mine arms, because that I had meant that I do so
dread an office to her. And surely I do wonder whether you perceive all
that did be then in her heart.

And the holy light that did be over us, she did watch with a sweetness
of awe; and rest did come more great upon her in the heart, as she did
learn how sure was the seeming of that Lovely Power to deliver us.

And, presently, we made forward again in the Valley. And did go
steadfast, and newly-loving each to the other, and so through twelve
great and body-weary hours; but our hearts could never be done singing
within us, nor our hands to cease from the hands of the other, because
that we did so crave each unto the beloved.

And in the ninth hour, a monstrous way off in the dark of the Valley,
there did seem as that there went a far and dreadful screaming in the
night. And it did be as that our spirits perceived the sound of
something Spinning in the night; yet faint and a great way off; but yet
had we no surety that we did truly hear the sound of the Spinning; only
we did be so shaken in the heart, for truly there was some horror done
unto humans, downward in the mighty darkness of the Valley. And to think
upon the sound of the Spinning, was to be in a shaking trouble of the
spirit; and to bless the quiet and holy light that went above us in all
that time; and to ache only that it should stay to be to our protecting.
And surely it did be plain that there were the signs of great Forces in
that Land.

And three hours after that time when we did hear the far-off screaming,
we were come up over the edge of the Valley, and did be once more unto
such light as did be general in the Land; and truly it did seem a
wondrous lightness, after so utter a dark.

And we did be all exhaust, and Mine Own drew her feet so weary that it
was as that she must go no more, until we did rest; for indeed it was
three and thirty hours since last that we had slept; and a bitter
trouble and work there had been in that space, as you do know.

Now we had eat some of the tablets a few hours back, as we did walk, and
had drunk some of the water; but had made no rest; for we did crave only
that we come free of that Valley. And now it was needful that we rest,
if but a little time.

And I minded that we find some place where I should have a hot pool,
that I be able to bathe Naani's feet. And, surely, we came in a while to
a hollow-place, and there did be two dull-burning fire-holes in this
place, and a hot-bubbling spring, the which did seem to be a rare thing
in that Land; so that we were the more fortunate to perceive it.

And I made Mine Own to sit, with her feet in the hot-spring; for it was
not over-hot, and did seem pretty natural to my taste, as I did prove in
the first. And also I did search about the hollow, lest there be any
harmful creature near-by; and this you will have truly supposed, because
you do know the methods of my journeying. But yet did I not have so much
care as did be proper; for I was so dull in the mind, by reason of my
weariness; but, indeed, there came naught to work us any harm; and so we
came to no suffering, through mine aches and dullness.

And I sat beside the Maid, and made her to eat a tablet, and saw that
the cloak did be nice about her, and her head to rest against my knee,
and I laid the palm of my hand to be as a pillow, because of the armour,
to ease the hardness.

And I eat with the Maid, and we both drank after; and so there came
back somewhat of our strength. Then I took the Maid's little feet, and
rubbed a portion of the ointment from the pot all about them, very
gentle and constant; and so did they be new-rested and eased; and she
presently fit again to the journey; for I was strong set that we go
quickly hence out of that Land, and stay no more there to sleep, lest we
come unto Destruction.

And when we had rested an hour, I put the shoes again upon the Maid, and
made them secure; and so gat my gear about me, and made to the journey.

And lo! as we did leave the hollow, I lookt upward unto the Holy Light;
and behold it was gone from us, and by this thing I supposed that we had
come free of instant danger; but yet did there be to me a seeming of
nakedness and unprotection, as you must perceive.

And because that the Light was vanished, I was the more set that we come
speedy out of the Land. And we went forward at a strong speed, and had
the Great Red Fire-Pit of the Giants to our rear unto the left, and a
mighty way off in the night; but yet I did wish it the further. And
before us, was a small ridging up of the dark Land, as I did judge,
because that our view of the lights and the shinings was bounded; and to
our left at a great way the low volcanoes, and somewhat to our right,
across all that part of the Land went the cold and horrid glare of the
Shine.

Now, in a little while, I felt that the ground did be sloped upward
before us a little, and by this thing I saw that I had known aright, for
that there did be a ridge that hid the Land somewise over unto the part
where I lookt to find the mouth of the Upward Gorge. And we went up this
slope at a strong pace, because that I was so eager that I find where we
did be in nearness unto the mouth of the Upward Gorge.

And surely, I was something forgetful, in mine eagerness, and came
somewhat ahead of Mine Own, who did make to hide from me that she did
begin to lag, because that her new strength was near gone from her.

And sudden there did be a very dreadful cry, to my back; and I came
round in one instant, so quick as a light doth flash; for it was the
voice of Mine Own, and all my being did suddenly burn with fear that
kindled through me in a moment of thought.

And lo! Mine Own did struggle terribly with a yellow thing which I
perceived to be a man with four arms; and the Man had two arms about the
Maid, and with two did make to choke her unto death; for she cried out
no more.

And I came unto the Man with a quick leaping, and stopt not to pluck the
Diskos from my hip; and surely I did be very strong, and mine anger and
rage to make me monstrous; for I caught the two upper arms of the Man,
and brought them backward in an instant, so fierce and savage, and so
wrencht upon them, that I brake them in the shoulders of the Man.

And the Man roared and shriekt, even as a wild and dreadful Beast should
cry out, and came round upon me with the two lower arms. And surely it
was a mighty and brutish thing, and so broad and bulkt as an ox, and the
lower arms were huge and greatly haired, and the fingers of the hands
did have the nails grown into horrid talons, as that they should grip
very bitter.

And it caught me by the thighs, to rip me upward, as I did fear; but yet
this did not be the intent of the Man; for in a moment it caught me
round the body; and on the instant, I gat the Man by the great throat,
and the throat did be haired, and so great as the neck of a bull. And I
strove with mine armoured hands that I choke the Man, and surely I made
it to suffer great trouble; yet, I could not harm it in the life.

And so I did be an horrid minute, and fought with the Beast, with no
more than the strength of my body; and it was as that an human went with
his hands to slay a monster so strong as an horse. And the breath of the
Man-Beast came at me, and did sicken me; and I held the face off from
me; for I had died with horror, if that it had come more anigh; and
surely the mouth of the Man was small and shaped so that I knew that it
did never eat of aught that it did slay; but to drink as a vampire; and
in truth, I did mean that I chop the Man to pieces, if that I have
chance to the Diskos.

And I did sway this way and that, as we did struggle; and surely it was
as that the Man had never made to use the lower arms, save to hold unto
prey, the while that it did use the upper arms to strangle, as I do
think. For all that weary minute of the fight, the Man made not to loose
from me, that it should tear my hands from their grip to the throat; but
made vain waggings with the arms that I brake, as that it would use
these to the attack; but surely they had no more power to do hurt.

And sudden, it put forth an utter power about my body, so that mine
armour did be like to crack; and truly I had died in a moment; but for
the strongness of the armour. And the man hugged me thus for an horrid
time, the while that I did hold off from me the brutish face, and gript
very savage into the haired throat.

And lo! the creature did work slow in the brain, and in the end loost
from me, abrupt, and went back with a leap, so that my hands did be ript
from the throat of the Beast. And in one instant it did be back unto me,
and gave me no moment to free the Diskos. But I made anew to fight, and
shaped as I had learned in the Exercises of mine Upbringing; for truly I
had been alway deep in practice of such matters. And I slipt from the
great hands of the Man, as it did try to take me by the head; and I hit
the Man with mine armoured fist, and put a great power and skill to the
blow. And I went instant to the side with a swift stepping, and evaded
the Man, and I smote the Man again, and took him very savage in the
neck; but all the while grown very cold and brutal and cruel; for I was
set to the slaying. And the Man-Beast came round on me; and lo! I slipt
the gripe of the great hands, and my body and my legs and mine arms did
work together unto that last blow; so that I did hit so hard as a great
hammer. And I gat the Beast in the throat, and the Beast went backward
to the earth, even as it did think to hold me.

And lo! in a moment, I was free, and I pluckt forth the Diskos from my
hip. And the Yellow Beast-Man grunted upon the ground; and it rose up
again to come at me; and it stood and did grunt, and did seem as that it
was gone mazed; for it did make other sounds, and an horrid screeching,
so that truly, by the way of it, I conceived that it cried out unknown
and half-shapen words at me. And in a moment, it came again at me; but I
cut the head from the Beast-Man, that was in verity an horrid monster,
and the Man died, and was quiet upon the earth.

And truly, in that moment, the distress of mine efforts and mine utter
tiredness and the ache of the bruises took me; so that I do surely think
I rockt as I stood; but yet was my head strong to think and my heart set
in anxiousness; for I wotted not how great an hurt had been done upon
Mine Own.

And I ran to her, and came to where she did be upon the ground; and
surely she was all huddled, and had her hands very piteous to her
throat, that did be so pretty. And it did shake me in that moment that
she was truly slain; for she was gone so utter still and as that she did
be broken unto death.

And I took her hands from her throat, and surely it did be a little
torn; yet not to be much, or so that it should loose her of her dear
life. And I strove that I steady the trembling of my hands; and I gat
free of mine armoured gloves; and made that I feel whether her throat
did be deadly hurt; and, in verity, it seemed not so; only that my hands
did so shake, because that I was so frightened for Mine Own, and because
that I was but new come from the battle; and because of this, I had not
power of touch to assure me.

I made then that I quieten my breath, which did yet come very full and
laboured; and I put mine ear above the heart of the Maid, and lo! her
heart did beat, and the horridness of my fear went from me in a moment.

And I had the scrip from my back very speedy, and some of the water to
fizz, and I dashed the water upon her face and upon her throat; and
surely there did be a little quivering and an answering of her body.

And I strove with her for a while more; and she came unto her life
again; and in the first, she was all a-lack, as you may think; and
immediately she began that she remembered, and she then to shake.

And I told her how that the Four-Armed Man was surely dead and could
harm her no more; and she then to weep, because that she had been put
to such shock and horror, and held by so brutish a thing. But I took her
into mine arms, and so she did come presently to an ease; and I
perceived in all my being that she was as a little ship that doth lie in
harbour; for she did cling and nestle unto me; and did be safe with me
in all her heart and body and belief. And surely she was Mine Own, and I
to have glory in that knowing.

And presently, I put her from mine arms, to lie; yet so that she might
not perceive the body of the Yellow Beast-Man. And I made clean the
Diskos, from her sight, and afterward I put on the scrip; and I took the
Maid to mine arms again, and had the Diskos in my hand beside her.

And she made protest that she should truly walk; for that I was all
a-weary, and she come to her strength again. And, indeed, I carried her
a certain way, and did then put her down to her feet; and truly her
knees did so tremble that she had not stood, let be to walk! And I
caught her up again; and I kist her, and I told her that I did be surely
her Master, in verity, and she mine own Baby-Slave. And truly you shall
not laugh upon me; for I was so human as any; and a man doth talk this
way with his maid.

And she did be quiet and sweet and to obey wisely; for she was gone very
weak. And thiswise we did go; and I to say loving words, in the first;
but afterward I did heed more of my going, now that she was something
eased and at rest within mine arms. And I did peer everywhere about,
lest that some other evil thing come outward of the bushes, to have at
us ere I did ware. And, truly, the bushes grew here and there in that
place, very plentiful, in great dumpings.

And presently I was come to the top part of the ridge; and lo! a great
gladness took me, and some amazement; for there did be the lights that
did be in the mouth of the Upward Gorge, and they did show me that I was
come anigh to that place. Yet had I feared that we were surely a dozen
great miles off; and now I to learn that we did be scarce of two or
maybe three, as I did judge.

And I told this thing to the Maid; and she rejoiced in mine arms, with a
deep and quiet thankfulness. And I set forward then at so good a pace as
I might; and I was come into the mouth-part of the Upward Gorge in about
an hour; and surely I did be very weary, for it was beyond six and
thirty hours that we had gone since last we did sleep; and there had
been sore labour and terror to our share in that time, as I have told.

And I turned in the mouth of the Gorge, and told Mine Own, very gentle,
that we did take our last look upon that Land. And she askt that I put
her down to her feet; and I put her down. And therewith we stood in that
place, and mine arm about her; and so did I support the Maid, the while
that she lookt silent over the dark of the Land.

And presently she askt me in a very husht voice, whether that I knew
where the Lesser Pyramid did be in all that Darkness; for she was all
adrift of her bearings, and was as a stranger, because that she had
never lookt upon the Land from that place, before then. And I showed her
where I thought the Pyramid to stand hid in the everlasting night; and
she nodded, very quiet, as that she did think thatwise, also.

And so a time did pass, and I knew that Naani said good-bye forever unto
all that she had known of the world in all her life; and she did be
whispering a goodbye in her soul unto her Dead.

And I was very husht, and deeply sorrowful for the Maid, and did
understand; for in verity, there should no other human look upon that
Land of terror through all the quiet of eternity; and the Maid did lose
all her young life into that blackness, and the Father that was her
Father; and the grave of her Mother; and the friends of all her years.
And there went death in the Land, even then, after those that did live.

And Mine Own shook a little within mine arm; so that I knew she strove
that she be brave, to weep not; but afterward, she made not to cease
from her tears; and truly I was there, to be her understanding; and she
did be sweet and natural ever with me; for she was Mine Own, and did be
hourly the more so.

And presently, I moved a little, to sign that we go downward of the
Gorge; and she stayed me one moment, that she look once more over all
that Land; and afterward, she submitted, and turned with me, and did
break into very bitter sobbing as she did go stumbling beside me; for
the sorrow of memory did fill her; and she was truly a very lonesome
Maid in that moment, and had come through much dreadfulness.

And in a minute, I stoopt and lifted her; and she wept in mine arms
against mine armour; and I very silent and tender with her; and carried
her downward of the Gorge for a great hour more. And presently she was
grown calm, and I knew that she slept in mine arms.

And in thiswise we made farewell of that dark Land, and left it unto
Eternity.




XII

DOWNWARD OF THE GORGE


Now I carried the Maid an hour downward of the Gorge, as I did say; and
I was then grown so weary that I near fell, as I walked, and stumbled
everywhile, because that I had lost somewhat of guiding in my feet, the
which did show mine utter alackness.

And I saw that I must come very swift to a place for slumber, or that I
did be like to fall headlong with the Maid; for I nigh slept as I walkt.

And I began that I give attention to the sides of the Gorge; and surely
I had gone that hour all in a dream; for I was fresh-waked, as it were,
in that I did give my will to perceive aught; and when I did come to
have power to attend, I knew that I had gone, even as a sleep-walker;
for the Gorge did seem a fresh matter unto me, and as that I had come
awake sudden to find myself a-walk in that strange and narrow place.

And presently, I saw somewhat where I did be; for I minded the memory of
mine outward journey, and truly I have a good power to know and remember
a way that I have gone. And I saw that there was a great and ruddy
fire-hole anigh to me; and I was all sure that I had perceived certain
caves in the wall of the Gorge, near to that fire, as I past it on mine
upward way; and I had been given a mighty longing of heart at that time,
that it be given to me that I should bring safe Mine Own out of the
peril that beset her, and have her unto just such a place for her
slumber, on the way of our journey backward.

And surely I tell you this thing as a child in pleasure; for, truly, it
was a wondrous happy matter that my desiring should be like to have a
true ending; as, indeed, it did seem was truly to be, if that my memory
had set me aright.

And I went onward somewhat; and lo! I to be right, for the little caves
did be there, a little past the great fire-hole; and there were seven of
them in the left side of the great cliff of the Gorge; and one did be as
that it were very cozy and a place of sure safety, if that we could win
unto it.

And truly, as I did conceive, we had come safe from the Evil Forces of
that Land; but yet did I mind that there was no surety in this thing;
and neither did I know but that some Monster should come downward of the
Gorge, out of that Land; and so work our deaths, as we did sleep; if
that we have no sure place for our slumber. And, indeed, I had wished
that we were come a greater way downward of the Gorge, but this might
not be; for I was all adrift with weariness. And truly, if that we gat
upward to the top-most cave, there did be few Monsters that should have
power to come at us, ere we be warned of their coming. And afterward
they should be like to come upward against the Diskos; and this should
be indeed a thing difficult, as you shall conceive.

Now it did be needful that I wake the Maid, and I kist her, as she did
be in mine arms; and surely that dear One did kiss back again in her
sleep, and was yet asleep. And truly I did love her with all my being;
and I kist her again, and shook her very gentle, and so had her to
wakefulness, and told how we did be come to a place fit for our slumber.

And she to look about, very sleepy, as I set her to her feet; and then
to upbraid herself that she did over to slumber, the while that I did
labour with her carrying. And, in verity, I kist her again, as she did
stand making to steady herself, and looking so pretty with the sleep
that did lie yet in her eyes. And she to kiss me very dear and all mine;
and even then scarce proper come to wakefulness; and did say with
something of a little dear abandon, that she did love me utter and
forever.

And afterward, I climbed to the topmost of the caves, and told Mine Own
the while that she walk up and down a little; so that she come to a full
awakedness; and this I was careful to, because that she should have a
need of all her powers that she come safe upward unto the cave.

And when I was come to the cave, lo! it did be so sweet and dry, as did
make glad my heart. And there did be a warmth in the cave, as that there
went a fire somewhere through the rocks anigh. And the light from the
fire-hole did make a reflection inward, and so this did seem a place
safe, and fit to our slumbering.

And I came downward unto Naani, calling that the cave was very proper
for our use; and presently I gave her mine aid to the climbing, and so
we came in the end safe into the cave; and truly we did feel very safe
and happy.

Yet, before we did sleep, I set free the scrip and the pouch, and took
the straps and went downward again into the Gorge; and I gat a good
boulder, so heavy as I might carry, and strapt it to my back, and came
upward again to the cave, and the Maid very grave and anxious, lest that
I slip to my hurt. And when I was come to the cave again, I set the
boulder in the mouth of the cave, and did balance it so light upon the
edge, that a touch should send it rolling downward.

And by this devising, I conceived that any Beast or Monstrous thing that
should climb upward whilst that we slept, should be like to set the
rock adrift, and mayhaps the rock to work an harm to such, but the
chief end to be that I should be swiftly waked by the noise.

And then I did turn that we go to our slumber; and lo! the Maid had
spread the cloak upon the rock, that we should sleep upon it; for truly
there did be no need that we have it now to our covering, because that
the cave did be so warm as I have told before.

And surely, there did be no cause either that I should have the cloak
for a bed; for how should I perceive any softness from the cloak,
through all the sternness of mine armour; but yet did I see that the
Maid had made a couch that should be for the two of us, and did be so
sweet and natural, and to lie by me; but yet to preserve her sweet
modesty, and to do the thing with no thought, save that it was natural
to our hearts; and that she did long alway to be anigh to me; but yet,
mayhaps, scarce full conscious that her heart did prompt her in this
thing.

And, in verity, I loved her very dear.

And surely, Naani showed me the where that I should lie upon my side;
and when I had obeyed, she kneeled, and kist me on the lips, very sober
and loving; and she lay down then upon the cloak beside me; and truly we
had both gone to sleep in one little minute, as I do think.

Now I did be waked twelve great hours after, by the fizzing of the
water; and lo! when I lookt, the Maid was not beside me; but did make
ready our simple eating and drinking. And she laughed at me, very sweet
and tender, because that she loved me so, and did be so glad to have me
awake to her; and she came over to me, and kist me, very bright and
loving upon the lips.

And after that she had kist me, she kneeled beside me, and lookt at me,
very dear and tender; so that I knew in a moment that she had waked a
while gone, and watched me, somewise motherlike, as I did sleep. But how
I knew this thing, I am not sure, save that my spirit did know, or that
her thoughts did have tongues unto mine.

And truly I needed that I be so loved, and all of you to say like with
me; and I put up mine arms to her, as I did yet lie; and she not to deny
me, but came into mine arms, and did snuggle there so sweet and happy
and gladly, and with so true a delight, that it did be plain how she did
love in all her body and spirit to be anigh to me, as I to her. Yet,
truly, as you do mind, the armour did be upon me; so that I feared to
take her very strong in mine arms, lest I hurt the dear Maid; and surely
the armour did be a stern matter for her to nestle unto; but yet,
mayhaps, did the sternness something please her womanheart, and yet,
again, mayhaps to lack.

And presently, she made that she would go from me, and I loosed mine
arms from her very ready, because that I did heed alway that she have
full sweet liberty of her dear Maidenhood; and I to be watchful
sufficient unto this end, yet always honest and wholesome and not
over-pondering even in this my care; and this proper intending you
shall ever perceive, if that your hearts do strive to hearken unto my
heart, which doth speak alway before you.

And the Maid went from me, over to where she had put the cup of the
water, and the tablets; and I to make to rise, that I look that the
boulder did be safe untouched in the mouth of the cave. But she called
unto me that I lie backward; for that she did mean gently to spoil me
that once; and that I have no heed to the boulder or whether there did
be any Monster or Beast anigh in the Gorge; for that the boulder did be
safe as I did balance it; and nowheres any Creature to sight in the
Gorge; for she had lookt oft, since waking, to this end.

And truly I obeyed, and lay back, and did like that I should be spoilt,
as we do say. And Naani brought the cup of the water, and the tablets
over to me; for she gat them from the scrip before I had it to my
pillow, in that while when I had gone downward for the boulder. And
surely, even when she brought the cup, she would not have me to rise;
but took my head upon her knees, and kist me once very dainty on the
lips, and I very happy to be so loved, and wishful no otherwise.

And she took a tablet and kist it and gave it to me; and afterward
touched another to my lips, and had that to be for her own. And so we
eat and were very glad and happy, someways as children are happy, and
our hearts all at ease.

And presently, we eat each our second tablet, in the same wise as the
first. And truly I did be kist more than once. And afterward, we drank
each of the water.

And when we had made an end, Naani told me that I move to stand; and
surely I wondered; and I stood up, and lo! I near cried out with the
pains of my bruisings; for I was all gone stiff in my sleep, and as that
I did be more sore than ever; and this to be because I had fought again,
as you do know, and surely had been hurt more by the Four-Armed Man than
I had known.

And I perceived then that Naani had supposed that I should be thus
pained, and had given dear thought to the matter; and truly she had the
pot of the ointment, ready, if that I did be very bad, that she rub me.

And she gave me aid with mine armour, and afterward eased me with my
garments; and surely I did be utter bruised in the body, by reason of
the violence of the Yellow Beast-Man. And the Maid had somewhat so
tender and sweet in her eyes as she looked upon the bruisings, that I
did be very happy and to glow with contentment.

And she had me to lie, and made me in comfort with the cloak, so loving
and grave, so that I was as a child that doth be cared of by his mother.
And she did rub me very skilful and gentle for a great hour, until I was
all refreshed. And in verity she was a lovely wise maid.

And as the Maid ministered unto me, I lay alway very restful, and
harked to the low sound of the muttering of the fire-hole that did be in
the bottom of the Gorge; and alway I did feel as an happy child that
doth be clothed in love and guided in wisdom.

And presently, when that the Maid had ended her dear care, she put by
the ointment, and gave me her hands very dainty, that she mean to aid me
to rise; and surely when I was come again to my feet, I was all eased,
and to have movement with no great pain; and truly this made me wondrous
pleased and to feel new couraged; for I had been troubled that I should
be so helpless, in that I did be the Protector of Mine Own.

And when I had tried my limbs, and found them to be in command and
ready, I lookt about for my garments. And lo, the Maid brought me my
spare body-vest, from the Pouch, and had it upon her arm, to give to me.
But surely she denied me a moment, of the vest, and stood before me, and
had an admiring and wonder, very sweet and honest, because that my arms
did be so great and hard with muscles.

And, indeed, I did be very strong, as you have perceived; for I did be
alway in affection of the Exercises that were taught in the Upbringing
of all the Peoples of the Mighty Pyramid; and by this explaining, you
shall understand that I was like to be strong; but indeed, I owed the
straightness and shaping of my body to the Mother that bore me. And
afterward, in all my life, had I taken pride of my body to be of health
and to have strength; and surely this is a matter very fit for pride;
and to be told bravely and with honesty.

And the admiring of the Maid was very sweet to me; and, in verity, I did
be to deceive, if that I said otherwise. And in a moment, she dropt my
body-vest, and put out her hands to me that I take her into mine arms.

And I took the Maid into mine arms with a great gladness and with
somewhat of humbleness that I was nowise good enough to hold her, for my
heart was young, and I loved her very dear and youthful. And she did lie
there very quiet and happy, a little; and surely I did find presently
that she kist the great muscling of my breast, very sweet and sly, where
her face did be press against it. And lo, in a moment, she came free of
mine arms, and gave me an aid with my garments, and afterward with mine
armour.

And when that this was done, she stood off from me; and she lookt at me,
half shy and half of sweetness and naughtiness. And she came then in a
moment, and put her hands upward to my shoulders, and so stood her
eyelids something down over her eyes; and did steal a little look up,
this time and that. And lo! in a sudden moment, before I did wot, she
was to her knees before me, and did weep; and I down very swift to kneel
with her.

And I askt not why she wept; for I perceived that she did have joy and
glad happiness and sweet trouble of her man; and that she did be a true
woman, and one part of the woman did worship, so that she did be
strangely humble and nigh to be shy; and another did love, and need that
she be anigh to me; and a third to have a calm wisdom. And all did now
be a-tremble, together in her heart; and I knew that I did be truly an
hero to her, though but usual to all others. And my heart was wondrous
proud and wondrous humble, so that I was in the same moment upraised and
to feel dreadly unworthy. But I made no pretending to discredit myself
to her, but only did resolve that I win alway her dear respect; and I
did be natural and truthful of my manner and without foolish denial of
her sweet worship, for she was utter Mine Own, and it did be a pitiful
thing if that I seem otherwise than an hero unto her.

But of you I ask kind understanding, and to call me not a thing of
conceit because that I did understand; for truly I knew my faults, even
so well as you, that do know all of my going. And you to look backward
upon the love-days, and to mind how that your maid did ever to make you
great in manhood with her dear belief and uplooking; and so shall you
conceive of all my feelings; for we do be all so human in this matter,
and to meet on a dear natural ground, as you will say.

And, truly, in a little time, Mine Own did be steadied, and wiped her
pretty eyes, and nestled to me a while, very husht and to need that she
be close. And I to have her gentle against mine armour, and to be in my
heart as that I did be her father and her lover in the one man, and
surely to be silent and joyful that I lived.

And presently I slipt her shoes from her little feet, with my right
hand, the while that she did rest within my left arm; and I condemned
myself that I had thought not more swift to this end; but indeed I had
thought upon it while that Naani rubbed me, and had intention thiswise;
but afterward forgat, as you shall understand, that have been with me
alway. And truly Mine Own did be hurt that I say aught to my blame; and
I to cease, but yet to feel reproached by my heart.

And when I had lookt to the Maid's feet, I tied on her shoes again; and
we gat together our gear. And afterward we came down from the cave, with
a great care, because that it did be so high up in the cliff of the
Gorge.

And afterward, we made downward of the Gorge, and had a good care to our
going, and so much of speed as we could make, that we come something off
from the Dark Land of the Lesser Redoubt, so quick as we might.

And in six hours we had gone very well, and we stopt then that we eat
and drink; and afterward, I lookt again to the feet of the Maid. And I
bathed them in a great rock basin of warm water that did be anigh to the
place of our eating; and afterward I put the ointment about them very
thorough and gentle and for a good while; and so she had some ease and
comfort.

And afterward, we made onward again; but now we did go pretty easy; for
I had considered the notings of mine outward journey, and so did
perceive that we should be but six or seven hours off that part of the
Gorge, where did be the Slugs.

And I was minded that we rest and sleep, ere that we make through that
dire and dreadful place; for that we should be twelve great hours, and
more, to go through, and to have no rest or pause, until that we did be
safe outward again, as you shall think. And so did we need to be strong
and well rested, and this to be wise also for the feet of the Maid.

Now surely the Maid did be in delight of the fires of that part of the
Gorge where we were come, and she had beside a rest of the soul, in that
she had feeling that there did be no Evil Force to trouble us to our
destruction; and I bothered her not yet awhile with tellings of the
horrid place that we should to journey through in a while, as you do
know.

And so we did go, and alway with a good caution, lest that some Beast or
Creature should come upon us; and alway with the fire-holes before and
behind, and in the air of the Gorge the little whistlings of steam that
did spirt out in this place and that; and a good warmth in many parts,
by reason of the fires; and odd whiles a smelling of sulphur; but not
greatly, nor to our trouble. And alway the low muttering of the
fire-holes and pits, and the red lights, and the dancing of the shadows
when that we did go by a fire-pit where the fire did frisk and burn
lively. And upon either side, the grim walls of the Gorge going up
measureless into the night.

And so we were gone presently, pretty comfortable, for six good hours,
since last that we eat; and we made halt, and eat and drank; and I
showed the Maid how that we should make a short journey that day, and
sleep, and so be ready to the horrid journey through the dark part of
the Gorge, where the Slugs did be.

And we made search then, that we have a safe place to our slumber; and
surely I perceived where we did be; for we came upon that same cave
where I did sleep after that I was come free of the Slugs; and that we
were come no farther, doth show how easy did be our present going, and
this you do know. And there did be the spring where I washed, and the
fire-hole anigh, and truly they were not like to be gone away, as you
shall say! Yet did we exclaim, very natural; for the Maid did be so deep
in interest of the matters of my coming, and to be at once that no other
place should serve for our rest and slumber.

And, indeed, this was a natural thing, and the place so good as any,
save that I did wish it had been upward unto a high place of the Gorge,
as you shall understand. But yet might we block the mouth-part of the
cave with boulders, somewise as I did before, and so to have a defence
against any thing that should make to enter upon our sleep; or at the
least to be waked by the falling of the boulders.

Now Mine Own went inward of the little cave, which did be very light
from the fire-pit that was to the front; but before that she did go, I
made a swift search of the place, that there should be no creeping
thing; and truly it was sweet and free. And the Maid did be strangely
taken that she should come to the veritable place where once I did lie
on mine outward way; and truly I do understand, and so shall many that
do have these feelings about matters. And afterward, we went unto the
hot spring that was in the hollow of the rock, anigh to the fire-pit.
And I saw that there did be no snakes, neither any of the rat-things
anigh; and so I had the Maid to sit very comfortable on the side of the
pool, and I freed her shoes, and bathed her feet, and afterward rubbed
them very steady with the ointment; and so for a good time, and alway to
keep a looking out upon the Gorge.

And presently, when that I had taken a loving care of her pretty feet, I
tied the shoes again upon the Maid, and so back to the cave; and the two
of us to carry boulders, according to our strength. And when we had a
sufficient, we builded a rough and clumsy wall, after that we were gone
into the cave; and the wall rose nigh to fill the mouth of the cave, and
made us to be somewise in darkness, but yet to feel in safety. And I had
a good heed to make the chinks of the wall very close in the bottom, so
that no small creeping thing should come through unto us whilst that we
slept.

And afterward, Naani set the scrip and the pouch to be for my pillow;
but had the bundle of her torn garments to be for her own purpose.

And I perceived that she had the water-powder and a pack of the tablets
to her hand for our waking, that she might prepare our food, and mayhap
to wake a little before me, so that she have all ready to greet me from
my sleep. But, indeed, I said naught to show that I knew; for I saw that
this thing did give her a dear pleasure, and truly it was very sweet to
have her to these gentle duties, that did be to her so sure and quiet a
delight.

And Mine Own bade me that I lie; and she put the Diskos upon the outward
side of me, to mine hand; and with a dainty and fearful touch; for the
weapon did be very dreadful unto her thoughts; but yet a comforting
thing to abide for our defence. And afterward, she covered me with the
cloak, and kist me very sedate upon the lips; and then to her own side,
and to come very nice and happy under the cloak, and so to her rest.

And presently she did sleep, as I perceived by her breathings; and
surely it did seem to my spirit that she had an utter and dear content
in this arranging of our slumber, so that she did be all at peace in all
her being, because that she did be nigh unto me, that did be her Own
Love.

But, indeed, I could not sleep for a time; and surely, in a while, Mine
Own did nestle unto me in her sleep, so sweet and dear as a child, and
likewise as that it did be her right to be so anigh unto me; and I to be
that I should put mine arms about her, but indeed I moved not, neither
did I kiss her, as I did wish; for truly I should be very manly with
mine own maid that did be so trustful and utter mine in her sleep.

And presently I was over unto slumber also, and stirred not for eight
good hours, and did wake then to the hissing of the water, so that I
knew Mine Own was awake before me, as she had planned, and was making
ready that we eat.

And when she saw me move in the half-light, she gave out a little word
of joy, that I did be again to knowledge of her; and she came over, and
put her arms about my neck, and kist me very loving, thrice upon the
lips. And, in verity, it came to me in that moment that I had been kist
a while gone in my dreams, but scarce to know it; yet I perceived now
that Mine Own had taken a naughty advantaging of my slumber, that she
kiss me to her own pleasure; yet did the Maid say no word of her
naughtiness; and I to be likewise; but to resolve that I waken, mayhaps,
on the next time, and so catch her in her sweet and secret delight of
me.

And, truly, this doth sound quaint; but to be true.

And I rose, and took down the half of the wall that did be across the
mouth of the cave, and afterward lookt out; but there was no sight of
any horrid thing in the Gorge, save that one of the rat-things did
slumber, very gorged-seeming, upon the side of the little fire hole.

And afterwards, we eat and drank; and the Maid then to rub me, as
before; for I was greatly stiff on my waking, as you shall think; but
she came not into mine arms presently, as I did hope; but only kist my
shoulders, when that she had finished, and so bid me to dress.

Yet, after that I was drest, and had mine armour full upon me, she must
come unto me, and she slipt her two small hands into the one of mine,
and so stood by me, very silent. And sudden she put up her lips very
quiet and passionate, that I should kiss her; and she kist me once, as
it did be as that her spirit kist mine, and all her being came unto me;
and she gave me but that one kiss, and afterward slipt her hands very
gentle from mine, and made to the gathering of our gear.

But truly, I that loved her so great, knew that a tumult of love did be
hid in her heart. And, indeed, she looked once at me in such wise, that
I grew near to a true humbleness of heart because of the honour and love
that did be in her eyes.

And surely, it is a very little thing to die for such an One as Mine Own
did be. And by this saying, shall you perceive my heart in that moment,
and that I did pant, as it were, that I do some deed of love to show my
love. And truly this is but a natural desiring and human, and the cause
proper to the uplifting of manhood. And surely you shall all mind you of
such feelings in the past love-days, that I do pray should be never
past.

And when we had our gear together, I left it in the cave, and took Mine
Own over unto the hot pool that was anigh to the fire-pit; and she to
exclaim upon the rat-thing that did be yet a-slumber upon the side of
the fire-pit; and I to say that the thing did be no cause for fear, but
rather, indeed, a good friend, in that it was a devourer of snakes, as
you shall mind.

And while that we talked, I bathed the little feet of Naani; and surely,
as I dried them upon my pocket-cloth, I was taken that I should kiss
them; and surely I kist them, and they did be very shapely and dainty,
and all eased of travel by the care that I did take to this end.

And afterward I rubbed them with the ointment for a good while, and so
had them again into the shoes, and the Maid very quiet, after that I had
kist her feet that did be so dainty, but yet with a sweet naughtiness in
her way, as my heart perceived, though she did nothing, neither said
anything, to this end; and was truly very obedient, and orderly to all
my wishes.

And we went back then to the cave, and the Maid put the pot of the
ointment back into the pouch, and she buckled the pouch and the scrip
upon me; and the Diskos I had upon my hip; for I went nowise anywhere,
without it, as you shall suppose. And she had the little bundle of her
clothing for her burden, and truly, I was ready that she should carry so
much; for we did be to act wisely, and she well able to carry so small a
thing, and I better to have my hands alway free to the Diskos and to the
needs of the way.

And we went downward of the Gorge at a strong speed, for there did be
somewise of fifteen hours good journey, ere that we come out upon the
far side of that place where the Monsters did be, and this did be three
hours to the upward beginning of that place, and twelve hours journey
then, in the least, that we should take to go through again into the
light of the Gorge below. And this I did reckon from my notings of mine
upward journey, as you do know.

And I made all clear to the Maid, of the thing that did be before us,
and made not to hide the danger and horror, but yet to make not overmuch
of the same. And she to walk close beside me, very sweet and trustful,
and to say that she feared naught, so that I should be there to have
care of her; but only that she did fear harm for me; and yet to have
confidence that I should slay all hurtful things that should be like to
trouble us. And, truly, I did kiss her for her dear belief and love.

Now, in the middle part of the third hour, the air of the Gorge did
begin that it was heavy, and to have a seeming of fumes that stang
something upon the throat, odd whiles. And there were presently less of
the fire-holes, and soon, as we did go the more downward, the beginnings
of a great gloom, and to have smoke therein that made us to feel husky.

And in the end of the fourth hour, we were come truly far downward
within the gloom; and to be as that we groped in a fog of distaste; and
to know not how we went with any surety; for oft there did be an utter
darkness about us; and awhile the shine of a dull-glowing fire-pit upon
our sight, that did show us the gloom and dread of that place.

And we went alway very husht, and the Maid to my back; but I did halt
now and this time, and make to know how she did be; and surely she
whispered very brave to me through the dimness, and once did slip her
hand into mine, and I to take off mine armoured glove for a little
moment, that I hold her hand, and give her nice assurance. But, in
verity, there was terror in mine heart, that did be a terror far beyond
the trouble of mine upward way; and surely I was shaken newly with every
danger, lest that I should lose Mine Own, or she to come to any hurt.
And, indeed, you shall perceive how I did be; for so should you be in a
like case, and, in truth, it doth be an utter anxiousness and suffering.

Now when we had been two hours in the dark part of the Gorge, I smelled
of the dread and horrid stink that you do wot of. And surely a great
fear came upon me; for I perceived that we did come among the Monsters,
or that one came anigh to us.

And I whispered unto the Maid that she halt; and we stood very husht a
while, and surely the stink did grow, and to be very dreadful in the
nostrils, so that I felt Mine Own Maid to shake somewhat with the fear
and disgust that this thing did make in us. And presently the stinking
did ease somewhat from about us; but whether there had gone past us a
monster Slug, I have no sure knowing; for there did be no fire-pit anigh
to that place; so that there was a great darkness all about.

And surely there was a great slowness and wetness of the air, and dismal
drippings that made desolation in the silence; and the feel of strange
growths upon the boulders, as you do know, and oft an horrid slime and
dankness; and the stink to be everywhere, so that we knew a constant
disgust and fear. And alway the fumings of sulphur, that did seem, in
verity, to beat down upon us, utter heavy and sore upon our lungs.

And so went we onward amid the smell that did be as of dead things; and
oft did we make pause and hark, and had a great care as we did go by the
dull fire-holes and fire-pits, that we should make no showing of
ourselves in the light.

And sudden, as we did go by a great pit that burned very deep and red, I
reached back and caught Mine Own by the arm, and I set her gaze unto
the right side of the Gorge, which was beyond the fire. And the Maid
went very still, as she did see the thing that was there; for in verity
it was utter monstrous, and did shine very wet-looking in the light of
the fire. And truly it moved a little with the head, this way and that,
stretching through the dark and the shadows, as you shall see a slug to
move, and with no speed or sound, and nowise seeming heedful of aught.
But yet did I fear that it smelled us, if this might be; and this, as
you shall think, to be a very natural fear.

And alway, as I do mind, it seemed to go blindly somewise, or to have
that slow and strange moving that doth make one to think of a blindness;
but whether it did be truly blind, how shall I say; only that it was an
utter Monstrous Brute, so great as the black hull of a ship, and very
dreadful unto our hearts.

And we moved not for a while, save that I pulled Mine Own down into the
hiding of the boulders of that part; and she to put her hand very
anxious unto me; yet not to be comforted, as I did half to think, but to
persuade me, lest that I go to some adventuring that should set me in a
surer danger. And this I perceived in a little moment, and loved her for
her care.

But, indeed, I had no mind to aught, save that we come clear of that
place; and I watched the Monster, through places between the boulders;
and surely, in a little while, it swayed the great head very slow and
quiet unto the cliff that did make that side of the Gorge; and the Brute
set unto the Cliff, and began that it went upward with a strange moving
of muscles that did go wavewise under the wet and horrid-gleaming hide.

And so, in a little time, it was gone quiet against the cliff, and the
head-part did be upward in the darkness above, so that it did be from
our sight. But the monster body did be plain for a great way, and was
seeming clung to the cliff, and to come downward out of the dark, as
that it did be a great black ridge of soft and dreadful life upon the
face of the cliff; and the tail was something less bulked, and to taper,
and did trail outward into the Gorge upon the boulders.

And surely the thing did seem as that it slept, but that odd whiles the
tail did lift a little off the boulders, and curl somewise, and
afterward come down again upon the boulders, mayhap in this place and
mayhap in that place, as we did watch, all hid.

And it was as that our sense and our Spirits did assure us that the
thing had no wotting of us; but surely our fears did nigh to equal the
comfort of this sweet reason, and to make us think otherwise.

Yet, in a time, I made that we go forward together through the spaces
that did be among the boulders. And I went creeping, and the Maid to
follow likewise.

And oft I did pause, and made a watching upon the monster; but truly it
moved not, save as I have told; and I kept a great heed upon the Maid,
that she follow alway close unto my feet.

And in the end we came safe from that place where the monster did be
clung unto the great cliff in the night.

And we went then for two great hours without adventure, save that once
the Maid touched me that we pause; for that something went by us where
we did be in an utter dark place of the Gorge, and no fire-hole anigh.

And I knew that the thing did be near, even as the Maid toucht me. And
caught I the Maid in the dark, and thrust her under the side of a
boulder; and I crouched then before her, with mine armour, that I should
protect her from any Brutish thing. And the Diskos in my hand, and
afterward an horrid time of waiting.

And the stink of that part of the Gorge grew very dreadful, so that it
did be as that we should not breathe, with the horror of the stink. And
there went past us some horrid and utter Monster, that made neither
sound nor anything, save that there seemed a strange noise that might be
the breathing of a great thing; but yet did be all uncertain, in that
the sides of the Gorge cast the sound this way and that, in an horrid
whispering of echoes; so that we did not know whether the sound be made
nigh to us, or afar upward in the eternity of the night, where I did
suppose the mountains to be joined over the Gorge in a monstrous roof in
that part.

And presently, the strange noisings died in the upward height, and all
about us; and the utter disgust of the stink went from us; so that we
knew that the Monster had gone past us, and did make downward through
the dark Gorge; and mayhap then to some lone and dreadful cavern of the
world, as I did think.

And, indeed, as I do mind, I had a sudden wonder at that time, and other
whiles, as it did chance, whether this way did be truly the olden way
that the Peoples of the Lesser Refuge did travel in the Olden Days. And
surely, as I did suppose, they had come some other way, or the Gorge to
be different and less dreadful in the far-off years. And this thing you
shall agree with me to be a reasonable thinking.

And after that the Monster had gone a good while we went onward again,
and with a great caution; and dreading alway lest that we come upon that
Monster, in the darkness; but yet did we know by smell, and by all our
consciousness, whether that we came nigh unto one of the monster Slugs.

Then, in the end of the fifth hour in the dark part of the Gorge, we
came by the mouth of that great cavern, upon our left; and you to
remember the same.

And I made pause in the darkness, and had the Maid very gentle by the
arm, that she should look with me. And I whispered how that I past this
place, to my right, upon mine upward way, and how that I did think
there to be a-plenty of monster caverns within the mountains that made
the sides of the Gorge, and that, mayhap, the Slug-Creatures had there
an home in such places, or came up, it might be, from some utter strange
deepness and mystery of the great world.

And the Maid did bide very close unto me, and silent, whilst that I
whispered; for the terror of the place did be on her, yet not to make
her lacking of courage, but yet to put a monstrous awe upon her and a
great and natural fear; and I likewise, as you do know.

And we stayed there, where we did be, a little moment, and looked
downward into the bowels of the monster cavern; and the shine of the
fire-hole beat over the cavern in the near part; but there did be an
utter mystery and deathly dark beyond the shining of the pit that did be
within, as you shall remember.

And, in verity, as we stayed but to glance, I perceived that there lay
humped things about the fire, and some to be black-seeming, and some to
have a seeming of whiteness, but with no sureness in the colour to mine
eyes.

And there came a moving in one of the humpt things, so that it did be as
that an hill did wake unto an horrid life. And immediately I knew that
the humps did be some utter monsters, mayhaps even the great Slugs,
a-slumber about the fire-pit that did burn in that strange deeply
cavern. And I saw that I did ill for our lives, that I should pause even
for a little moment to such staring.

And immediately I whispered to Mine Own that we go with all our speed;
for, indeed, I knew not whether that our nearness had waked that
Monster, or whether that it had but waked by chance. And truly, I was
utter eager that we be gone from that place, so swift as we might.

And we went on then through all of the sixth hour that we did be in the
Slug part of the Gorge, as I named it unto myself. And in all that hour,
there did nothing harmful come anigh; only, as I did know presently,
there came an unease upon our spirits, but yet to be very little at that
time, and we to be scarce knowing of it. And alway, as we went, there
did be darkness for the most, and odd-whiles a vague murmuring of the
night far above, as it did seem; and presently the dull glare of a
fire-pit to shine out far off below us in the Gorge, and to seem very
dim and unreal unto us, by reason of the smokes and the fumes that made
a haze and a distaste in the Gorge.

And presently, the murmuring of the night to grow somewhat, and,
afterward, the sound of the muttering of the fire-pit to come unto us;
and the murmuring to die unto our ears that did be hearing now only the
dull muttering, and so we to know that the murmuring of the night did be
truly the far-off muttering of the fire-holes, and our eyes to guide our
hearing, and our reason to explain and knit the sounds; and so we to
pass by the fire-hole with a great quiet and caution and ever with
watchfulness, as you shall suppose. And afterward again into the dark;
and presently again the murmuring, to tell that we came unto another of
the fire-pits, that was yet afar off in the Gorge, and made dim echoes
in the night.

And alway we went very watchful, and in grim fear; but with
steadfastness and good intention to win forth out of that desolation and
horror, and having alway so great a speed as the darkness and the
dangers and the trouble of the way did allow.

And in this place I will make explanation why that I speak somewhiles of
fire-pits and otherwhiles of fire-holes; for the holes did be those
fires that burned nigh to the brim of the holes; but the pits were those
places where the fire was deeply in the earth. And this thing I give for
your enlightenment, even on a small matter; so that you shall have a
clear knowledge to abide with me all the way; and you to agree of this
for wisdom, and I to be pleased that you so agree.

And here also, I should tell that there did not come a muttering from
all of the fire-holes and the fire-pits; but mayhap from this one, and
mayhap not from that one, according to the way of the fire therein. And
this shall be plain unto you.

And so shall you see us go, and the smoke and the bitterness of the
sulphur to be all about us; and oddwhiles the murmuring of a far-off
pit, and oft the utter silence; and to pass this time a lonesome
fire-hole; and afterward the utter dark, or the half-gloom, all as might
chance, according to the nearness of the fires. And upward in the
everlasting night, the grim mountains to make a roof over us, as I did
suppose.

And all this while did the unease, of which I have told, make upon us;
so that, presently, Mine Own whispered unto me the thing that already my
spirit did half to perceive, that there came after us through the night
some harmful thing, that did be surely no great way off, as I did feel
within me, and the Maid to have a likeways belief.

And, truly I thought at once upon that Brute that did wake downward in
the mighty Cavern, where did be the great inward fire-hole, as I have
told; but whether this did be true knowledge that we did be chased in
the dark by that thing, or whether there came after us some other
Monster, I could have no sureness; but only that we did be chased, and
of this I had assuredness.

And I set the Maid before me, that I have myself ready to the danger
that followed; and we made forward again then, so quick as we were
abled; and she went very wisely; for she had good wit and had noted the
ways of my leading.

And we went thus until the end of the seventh hour. And surely, in that
time, we heard the murmuring in the night which told of a fire-hole
somewise before us; and soon to have the red glare plain to our eyes,
and the noise of the murmuring to die away into the nearer mutter of
the fire; and so presently to be anigh; and we to make forward with a
good speed, because that we feared utterly the thing that made quiet
chase of us through the night.

And oft I did look backward, and smelt the air, that I know whether it
did be a monster Slug-beast that chased us; but there did be no
worseness of the smell, to tell me aught.

And alway, I did be fretted in the heart, that we could make no greater
speed; but, indeed, as you shall perceive, our going did be but a slow
thing in the dark places, and even thus we had many a sore tumbling and
bruising.

And by this, we were come almost unto the fire-hole; and immediately, I
saw that I knew the place, for there went upward beside the fire, a
great jaggedness of rock, that I had seen upon mine upward way.

And surely, I caught the Maid in an instant, and bent her, and she quick
to obey with her body. And we were both immediately hid downward among
the boulders. And this I did, because I minded how that there did be
many of the Monsters nigh to this same fire-hole, as I did go upon mine
upward way.

And we went forward then with an utter care; but yet to keep onward,
because that there did be somewhat in chase of us. And, in verity, when
that we were come opposite unto the fire-hole, I saw that there did be
seven of the monster Slugs against the far side of the Gorge, and did be
all set upon their bellies against the cliff, and their horrid heads to
be hid in the upward dark, and their tails to lie very great and
soft-seeming in the bottom of the gorge, upon the boulders.

And, lo! the Maid toucht me, and she drew me to look upon the near cliff
of the Gorge. And truly there did be three of the Brutish Things laid
upward there, and a fourth did be humped somewhat upon a great ledge
that did be upward of the Gorge, and just to be plain to our eyes.

And surely, it was as that we did be all surround by such Monsters, and
to make the heart sink, and fear to lie upon our hopefulness. But,
indeed, the Maid showed a good spirit, and I to have fierce determining
that we come free of that Gorge, and afterward, in time, unto our Mighty
Home.

And we made forward again, and did go creeping among the rocks and the
boulders; and so came presently past that place, and had not waked the
Monsters, if that indeed they did truly sleep.

And I made halt a moment upon the far border of the light from the
fire-hole, and I lookt backward up the Gorge, perchance that I should
see the thing that followed us. But, indeed, there came nothing out of
the dark of the upward Gorge, so that I knew that there did be some safe
space to our backs, which did be truly a comforting thing.

And here I should tell how that there was no great stinking in that
place where did be so many of the Slug-beasts, and this to puzzle me;
and in the end to make me think that some of those horrid things did
stench more great than others; but yet I to have no certainty in this
matter, as you do perceive. And, truly, this thing troubled me; for I
had been comforted that my nose should tell me when that the thing that
made chase of us should draw nigh in the darkness; and now, in verity, I
knew not what to have for assurance; for the awaredness of the spirit
was but a vague thing, and no more in such a matter, than a feeling as
of an inward warning.

And we went onward then for a great hour, and with an horrid unease upon
us; and thrice we did go by fire-pits in the darkness; and alway I made
pause upon the far side of the light, that I should look backward; but
did have no sight of aught; yet did my spirit or my fears warn me with
new fear, and a greater sense of nearness; and the Maid to confess also
to this thing.

Now, we saw not any of the Slugs for a long while, neither had there
been any about the three fire-holes; and the air of the Gorge was grown
something sweet and free somewhat of the stench of dead-seeming things;
but yet to be very bitter with fumings and smoke and sulphur stinks.

And lo! in the middle of the tenth hour, as we did go, painful and with
anxiousness in a very dark place of the Gorge, there came unto us again
the smell that told to us that one of the Monsters did be anigh. And
surely we had both a great fear, in that we had belief that it did be a
sign that the thing that made chase, did draw near upon us. But yet did
I to use my Reason also, and to know that the stink might be from some
Monster that we were come nigh to in the darkness of that place; and I
whispered this unto the Maid, and she to say, very husht, that it might
be so; but to have no belief; and I to be likewise, as you do see.

And we pusht forward at a new speed, and had many bitter falls, so that
we did be all bruised; but not to know it at that time, because that our
fear did be so keen. And oft we made a little pause and harkt; but there
did be only the dismal drip of water from on high; and presently the
murmur of the night, that told that we drew near unto a new firepit.

And surely this was a great easement to our spirits, in that we should
have light to perceive our danger, and mayhap to win free. But to be in
that utter dark, was a thing to break the courage, and to breed belief
that we did be utter helpless, and all wrapt in horror and despair.

And the stink grew ever, as we made forward; so that I knew not whether
there did be great Monsters beside the fire-pit that was to our front,
as I have told, or whether it made plain the advancing of the Pursuer.
And we only to be able to make our best speed, and to be weary with hope
that we rush not blind into death; and alway to be chilled in the back
with the belief that the thing that made chase did be very close in that
utter dark, and to gain upon us.

And we knew not whether to make our belief to be the tellings of the
spirit or the utterings of our fears; and so shall you perceive our
plight; and we but to be able to make forward. And, in verity, the
dreadfulness of that time doth shake me now to think upon, and you also,
if that you have gotten my tellings to your hearts, so that your human
sympathy doth be with me.

And there came presently to our ears the far mutter of the fire-pit, so
that very soon the murmuring was lost to us in the night, and only the
slow mutter to be plain. And the dull looming of the fire shone afar
off, through the night and the smoke and fumings; and we to a great
speed, and to pant with fear; but yet with a freshness of hope again to
sweeten us.

And we came nigh to the fire-pit, and lo! the smell did be grown very
drear and foul; but there did be no Slug-Beast near the fire. And by
this, we perceived that we did be truly in an utter danger, in that the
Pursuer did be upon us, and the stinking to tell this to be truth, and
our spirits to have warned us very strong and proper.

And I stopt near to the fire-pit, which did be great, and very
red-glowing; and I lookt upward of the Gorge, into the night of the
Gorge that we did come from; but the Monster was not yet upon us to work
our death. And I lookt to the sides of the Gorge, and the Maid to have
the same thought that did be mine, that we climb the mountains that made
the sides of the Gorge.

And I lookt very keen first to this side, and then did run overward,
that I look more close upon the other; and afterward back again; for it
did seem that we should have a greater ease upon the side that we did
be.

And I askt the Maid whether that she did be prepared; and she to be very
white and wearied, and all besmirched with the dankness and growths upon
the boulders and the hidden pools of the Gorge and the dripping of the
waters; but yet did she be sound in her courage, and to show that she
had all belief and abiding in me, and her judgement likewise to be with
mine, in that her own Reason did approve.

And I took the bundle of her torn clothing from her, for it did be at
her girdle, and like to trouble her movings; but she to refuse, very
determined, in that I did be already over-burdened. And I to be firm in
my deciding, and to make her to yield the bundle, the which I hookt unto
the "hold" of the Diskos, where it did be to mine hip.

And the Maid to be there, a little figure, and white in the face, and
strangely angered, and her anger mixt with hidden acknowledgement that I
did be her master, and half to be minded that she move not from where
she did stand, and part to be reasonable and fearful of the hidden
Beast; and in part also to thrill in her womanhood unto the man that did
be so masterful unto her. And all to pass in a little moment, and we to
be to the Gorge side, and busied very eager to the climb.

And the Maid to be first, as I did heed, and I to follow, and have
constant looking to the task and to her safety, and alway to be bitter
anxious for our speed to be good, and to be anxious the more then, lest
that Mine Own should slip; for there did be an horrid wetness upon the
sides of the Gorge, as you shall have guessed, and horrid growths that
blotched the great rocks mightily, and made an utter slipperiness, if
that they did be trod upon; and we to have to come so clear of all such
matters, as we might, and yet to be speedy for our lives, and likewise
to lack no care and thought to the setting of our hands and of our feet
in places fitted to the lifting of our weight.

And truly you shall see that we went very desperate, and I to give word
to the Maid that she look not downward, the which I was urgent upon,
lest that she come giddy in the heart. But I, as you shall think, could
scarce to keep from fearful peerings below, so that I learn speedy
whether the Pursuer did come yet into the light of the fire-hole,
beneath.

And presently, the Maid did gasp very weak and troubled with the
soreness of the climb; and I came higher, and set mine arm about her, as
we did be there upon the face of the cliff; and she stopt very still a
little while, and an ease did come to her, and an assurance of safety.
And surely, I kist her there where we did be in that upward place, and
her lips did tremble unto mine; and her courage and strength to come
back into her, so that in a minute she did make once more to the
climbing.

And we came presently to a place where a great ledge did be, that jutted
out from the mighty cliff, and was surely a huge way above the Gorge
bottom. And the ledge sloped, and there were on the ledge, great stones
and boulders that did make lodgement there through eternity.

And I lookt very careful to our way, and saw that we did be in the path
of a mighty rock that was over-nigh unto the edge of the shelf-place,
and did put fear upon me, in that it seemed that it should come down
with great thundering upon us, if that we but shook the place where it
did be.

And I caught the Maid very swift and gentle, and shaped our path unto
one side of that great rock, and did presently lose my fear, when that
we did come safe from under it.

And in a minute after, we were come upward upon the ledge, and a very
safe place it did seem, and surely as that no monster should be abled to
come upward upon us. And this I did try to make for comfort unto
ourselves; but that we both to know how that the great Slugs could lie
up against the sides of the Gorge, and surely it did be like that they
should be able to come upward clear of the Gorge, and so to the place
where we made to have safety. And I had no thought to deny this thing,
when that it was clear to my brain; but set rather that we should have
some way to fight the Monster, if that we did be discovered.

And I thought in a moment upon the stones that did be about; and the
Maid in the same moment cried out that we should push the big rock down
upon the Slug that we believed to have chase of us, and indeed, the rock
to be a great weapon, if we could but stir it, as you shall think.

And alway, as we talked, very hushed, we lookt downward into the
deepness of the Gorge, unto the upward end of the fire-light; but there
came no thing yet unto our knowledge, only that the stinking did rise up
to us through that great distance.

And the fire-pit to seem now a very small burning, and to give no great
light up to us; and we neither to be abled to see very clear of the
Gorge bottom, in that the haze of the fumes and the smoke was in the air
of the Gorge, and made uncertainty; and we to be nowise proper free of
the smoke, even where we did be.

And we watched, very set with anxiousness and fearful expecting of the
monster; and did be both yet lost of breath, and the Maid that she made
her words something broken for a little while.

And lo! in a moment, Naani cried out very low and sharp that the thing
did come; and I to see a moving of somewhat, in the same instant, in the
Gorge that lay upon the upward side of the fire-pit.

And immediately I saw the great and monster head of the Beast come
forward into the shine from the pit; and the head did be of a blotched
white, and to have the eyes upon great stalks that came from the forward
part of the head; and the stalks to be set downward, so that the eyes
lookt upon the bottom parts of the Gorge. And surely this doth be very
horrid-seeming to the mind of this age, but yet to have a less
strangeness unto the two of us that had seen many horrid sights, as you
do know.

And as the Monster came forward the more into the light, I saw that the
great and utter mighty bulk did be all of that same whiteness, that did
be so set over with blotchings and a seeming of unhealth. But, truly the
colour was proper to a creature that did abide in so great a darkness,
as you shall say, yet had those Slugs that we did see, been black and
shining, for the most, as I have told; and this to be as I saw, and I
not to heed here that I try unto explainings in this place; else should
I be never eased of my task, as you do see.

And the Monster Slug came onward, and as it did go, it set the stalks of
the eyes in among the boulders, as that it did search; swayed now this
way and now that way, from side to side of the Gorge, and alway it
pushed the stalks of the eyes inward among the boulders; and so to go
forward, searching. And truly it was very dreadful to see the thing make
search for us, and to go so steadfast to so dread a purpose.

And, indeed, I saw it not so plain as might be, because of the haze of
the fumes and the smoke that did lie in the air of the Gorge, as I have
told, and made something vague the sight at this time and that; but yet
we did both see a strange thing; for when that the great white body did
be come half into the light, the Slug-Beast set out a big tongue among
the boulders, after that it did peer thereunder; and the tongue did be
very long, and white, and something thin-seeming; and the Monster lapped
inward in a moment a great snake from among the boulders, and the tongue
did hold upon the snake, as that there did be surely teeth or roughness
upon the tongue; but yet the distance to be too great for any surety of
the sight, as you do know; and moreover, there did be the uncertainty of
the haze within the air.

And the Slug took the snake inward, all as it did lash and wriggle, and
swallowed it in a moment; and, in verity, that snake did be a big and
horrid creature, else had it been not so plain to our sight; but it did
be as a worm unto the monster, and gone instant.

And immediately, the Slug-Beast went again to searching, and the head to
sway from this side unto that side of the Gorge; and by the wideness and
ease of this swaying shall you perceive the utter greatness of the
Beast.

And alway, as it did come downward of the Gorge, it thrust the stalks of
the eyes inward among the boulders, looking all ways; and oft the breath
did come from it, as a cloud; and the stink to rise up unto us, very
plain and an abomination. And again, we saw the Beast set the tongue in
among the boulders of the Gorge bottom; and it lickt forth a snake that
did seem so thick as a man in the body, and the snake to thrash in the
great white tongue, and to be immediately drawn inward, and gone utter.

And surely, as the thought did stir in me, there did be a great Mercy
over us, in that we did not die by such a serpent in some dark and
horrid place of the Gorge. But yet, as it is like to be, mayhap the
snakes did be only anigh to the fire-holes; yet doth it be anywise a
wondrous thing that we had come so free of them alway; and truly to
learn, was to be given a new terror.

Now the Monster was come fully into the shining of the fire-pit, and was
upon this side; and the fire to make a shining against the side of the
Slug, so that odd whiles I did perceive very plain the huge wrinklings
and musclings of the skin, as the Beast made onward. And alway it did
search, thrusting in the eye-stalks among the boulders.

And sudden, it made pause, and did begin that it brought all the mighty
body together, and humpt itself, and brought the head-part round unto
the bottom of the cliff that made this side of the Gorge. And it
gathered itself, and afterward did lengthen upward against the cliff,
and begin to climb. And lo! I saw that the Beast did scent of us, and
made to come upward to destroy us.

And as the mighty hill of the body did come into length against the
great cliff-side, the Beast set the eye-stalks into this cave and that,
as it did go, and into all crannies; and so lengthened upward very
straight and monstrous and dreadful unto us, and did be as a white and
mildewed hill, that had an horrid life. And the stink to come up, so
that we did be like to lose our breath with the dreadfulness of it, as
you shall think.

And surely, for a moment, I looked unto the rocks upon the ledge, and
this way and that way, and upward unto the everlasting darkness that did
be above us, and again unto the great rock that did seem to quiver upon
the edge, as I have told. And I was grown utter desperate in a moment;
for, truly, it did seem in that instant that there did be no power in
the world that should slay so utter mighty a Monster.

And immediately, even as I did despair, I had run very swift unto the
great rock, and the Maid with me, both very strained and shaken with the
horror of the thing that did make upward unto us so sure and intent.

And I set my strength unto the rock, and heaved; but indeed the rock
gave not from the place where it did be; so that I had a dreadful
despair; for I saw that it did be more secure than had seemed. And the
Maid lent her strength unto mine, and we heaved together, with sore
pantings, and little cries to guide our endeavours and because we could
not be contained in that moment.

And surely it seemed that the great rock moved, and lo! as we strove
together to the task, there came a vast and sudden grinding, and the
rock to cease from our shoulders, and to be gone from us, or scarce we
did wot of the happening. And the rock went over, and rushed downward
upon the Monster, and with mighty crashings, as it did grind and crush
the face of the cliff-side with a quick and constant thundering. And I
caught the Maid, as she did stagger upon that dire upward edge because
that she had set her strength so utter to the endeavour, and the rock to
be gone so sudden, as you do see, and she to be like to follow after.
And she clung unto me, and I to hold her very safe as I lookt down upon
the falling of the Rock. And behold! the Great Rock smote the Monster in
the humpt part of the back, below of the head, and did enter into the
Monster, even as a bullet doth strike, and was gone instant from my
sight into the Vitals.

And there came a mighty sound of anguish from the Monster; and the
Monster did loosen from the cliff, and to crumple, as it did seem, and
sink backward. And a great steam of dread breathing to go upward from
the Beast, and a reek; and it made again the strange and horrid noise of
pain, and the Gorge to be yet full of the echoes of the Rock thundering,
and with the noise of the rock there was now mingled the horrid sounding
of the death-crying of the Beast. And the Gorge to be filled with dull
and dreadful echoings, as that an hundred Monsters died in this place
and that of the darkness in the Gorge, and all to be bred of the noise
of that mildewed hill a-dying.

And the echoes ceased not for a while, even after that the Monster did
be utter quiet; for truly they came presently from far upward and
downward of the Gorge, out of all the eternity of the night, and to be
as that they came backward very faint out of lonesome miles, and out of
the strange deepness of unknown caverns of the world. And so in the end
to silence; and the far bottom of the Gorge to be filled with a white
and horrid hill, very dreadful, and that did yet quiver to show the
slowness of Death. And alway a dreadful reek and stinking to fill all
the air, even unto the height, as of the grave.

And I stood upward in that far, high place, and held the Maid very
strong and tender; and she to have covered her ears from that dreadful
crying; and to be yet shaken with the greatness and horror of the dying
of the Monster, and the nearness that she did come unto falling, as you
have seen.

And presently she came less to tremble, and did weep very easeful, even
as a babe doth weep; and I, mayhap, to be not over-steady, as you shall
think; but yet to have a great gladness set in my heart, and a triumph,
and an utter grace of thankfulness.

And I held Mine Own, very tender and sure, as I did say; and she very
soon to be eased of her trouble, and the shock to be something gone from
her. And she lookt up at me, and slipt her arms upward about my neck,
and pulled me downward unto her, that she might kiss me.

And we to talk then, of the going down; and surely this did seem a great
and dangerous task; for, truly, we had come upward pretty easy in the
excess of our fear; but how we might go down, with our blood cool, I did
be all in doubt.

Yet, before that we did aught else, I led the Maid upward on to the safe
part of the ledge; and we sat there, very quiet and weary, and she did
be leaned against me. And we eat, each of us, two of the tablets, and I
to scold and coax Mine Own to this end, and she to obey and to be better
afterward, because that she had eat. And we drank some of the water, and
did rest a time longer.

And presently, our courage and strength was come back into us; and we
packt the scrip again, and the Maid set it fast to my back; and we went
then to the edge of the shelf, and lookt downward, this way and that;
and surely, there did be no way to go, save the way we came; only that
we might shape our downward climbing to bring us a little below that
place where the dead Monster did be.

And I saw by mine own heart and by the paleness of the Maid, that we
should do well that we consider the thing no more; but make to the task.

And I went immediately over the edge of the shelf, upon my belly, and I
bade Naani to follow. And we began then that we go downward; and, in
verity, we went downward for, mayhap, a great hour; and I gave help
alway unto Mine Own, as I could; and she to come after me very brave,
and made that she hold back her fear, and come downward of that cliff,
that did be oft like to a mighty wall. And surely, even as we came down,
I marvelled how we did ever go upward, even though fear did aid us; but,
indeed, I do think it doth be easier to climb safely, than to come
backward; for this is how I have found.

And we made rest thrice upon ledges of the cliff. And afterward came
downward again; and alway very slow and with exceeding heed where our
hands and our feet did go, that we slip not suddenly to our death.

And once, as I did see, the Maid was lost of all her strength, and did
be going to fall, because that she did be all gone into a sudden
weakness of the head in an instant. And she did be silent, even in that
moment, the which doth be marvellous unto me, and to give me a strong
pride of her, as you shall understand, if that ever you have loved. And
surely, I came upward, in a moment, that little space that was between,
and had mine arm about Mine Own very swift, and held her hard and fierce
against the cliff; and this I did that she should feel how that she
could never fall; and immediately, her strength and her dear courage
came back into her; and I kist her, there against the mighty cliff; and
afterward she did have power again to come downward safe.

And presently we were come to the Gorge bottom, and maybe an hundred
paces down the Gorge from that place where did be the dead Monster, all
sunk into an ugly and horrid heap, so great as a small hill.

And a dreadful stinking did hang in all that part of the Gorge, by
reason of the Slug; and signs of disgust, as you shall think; and the
great and mildewed body of the thing yet to settle and twitch, as I did
look, as it did come properly unto death in all that mighty bulk. And
everywhere, the skin of the Beast did be set into great wrinklings, and
horrid blotchings to be upon the improper whiteness thereof; and truly I
did be in haste that I turn the Maid away from that thing, and that we
haste downward of the Gorge.

And we went then for two good hours, and alway I did hearten the Maid,
and she to go very husht and trustful by me; but truly I did be in an
anguish of heart, because that I was newly aware that there did be such
great and dreadful serpents in that part of the Gorge, as you do also
know. And I was not over-feared for myself, but for the Maid that did
have no armour to protect her dear body. And because that I was so set
with this trouble, I took the Maid presently into mine arms, that I
carry her, and so to have her clear of aught that should lie among the
boulders.

And, in verity, Mine Own did show an anger very surprising and
determined; for I said not why I should carry her--fearing to give her a
greater unease--but only that she did be weary, and I very strong and
willing.

And, indeed, I could not bring her to reason, without I told her, which
was not mine intent; for she did refuse me to carry her; and said that
truly I had need of no added burden unto my labours.

And when she saw that I would not be moved by her reasonings, she made
to win upon me by her loving ways; but, indeed, I only kist her; and
went forward with her in mine arms. And she half naughty, that I did be
so heedless of her wishings, and somewise hurt also; and so to be silent
in mine arms; yet mayhap to be something stirred in her nature, that I
did be steadfast to mine intention, despite that her will did be
contrary.

And this I do believe to be truth, because that, afterward, I do think
that she lay there in mine arms, only as a woman that doth be in the
hands of her Master that hath all her love.

And in thiswise we went forward.

And in the end of the two hours that we did go, there was come the end
of the dark part of the Gorge; and we to be outward of that mighty roof
of the mountains, as I do think it to have been; and the air to be free
of the stink of the Monsters, and the fire-holes to be very plenty, and
their smokings to go upward very proper; so that we had no more the
bitterness of their fumings in our throats.

And there did be a pretty good light, to go by the contrast of the past
hours; and I set Mine Own again to her feet, and made that she keep to
my rearward, so that if there did be any serpents to our path, they
should come first under my feet, and thiswise to work no harm to me,
because of mine armour, neither to Naani, Mine Own Maid.

Now by this time, it was somewhat of nineteen great hours since we did
sleep; for we had been a long while making that we come safe from the
Slug; and, indeed, we had come downward with a less speed than I did go
through upon mine upward way, as you shall mind; and this to be that
Mine Own did not have the hard strength that was in my body to the
enduring of great labour and stress; and this surely all to be plain
unto you that have been with me in all my journey. And, moreover, there
must be kept to mind the three hours that we had gone, ere we were come
proper into the dark part of the Gorge; and so all to be remembered unto
you; and also you to mind that we did be wakeful a time, ere that we set
forward upon that day's journeying.

And we did go almost in joyous-wise, because that we were come safe out
of that dreadful place; and surely, odd whiles I did feel the hands of
Mine Own Naughty One to be hookt very pretty and sly into the backward
part of my belt, as that she did make a pretending that she drive me
before her; and surely this doth be a strange thing to tell upon; for
there did be no knowledge of the olden horse in all the eternity of that
dark world; but yet, maybe, some dear olden memory-dream did set her
hands unconscious to this pretty work.

And, in verity, once I turned very sudden, and had her swift into mine
arms, as she did pretend to drive me; and she to laugh with a sweet and
joyous gurgle against mine armour; and I to heed that I hurt her not,
because I did be like an iron man that should put arms about a tender
maid.

And we lookt alway now for a place that should be proper to our rest and
to our sleep; and when it did be close upon the end of the twentieth
hour of that journey, the Maid showed me a cave that was, mayhap, fifty
good feet upward in the right side of the Gorge.

And I lookt about, and saw that there did be two fire-holes anigh, and a
warm spring to make a basin of water, that did lie between the fires;
and all very well set to our need, as I did perceive; for, indeed, we
did be utter besmirched with the filth of the Slug part of the Gorge,
and to need that we be nice and fitly washed, before that we have any
comfort of our selves.

And I bade Naani to wait a little minute; and I lookt well up the Gorge
and well down the Gorge; and lo! there did be no thing to set me in
unease; and I told Mine Own that she keep a sharp and steadfast
watching, and not to heed me; and this I said, because I knew she did be
like otherwise to look at me and be over-anxious, as I go upward to the
cave; and, indeed, she to be better anyway in watch of the Gorge, and to
cry out to me, if that anything came anigh, whilst that I went upward.

And I made upward to the cave; and was come there pretty quick; and
truly it did be good for our purpose, and fresh-seeming and dry, and to
have no holes that I could see for the hiding of creeping things.

And I called down gently to the Maid that the cave did be proper; and
she to show her gladness, and to be looking upward at me, instead of the
way of the Gorge, as I set her; and truly she did be a dear and human
little Maid, and utter Mine; so that I did find a new joy in each small
lack of wisdom, and this just so much as that she had done a wondrous
proper thing. And truly, you shall say, there was some properness to her
heart, in that she could abide not but to watch me.

And I went quickly down to Mine Own; for there was alway an unease upon
me, save when I did be nigh to her, in chance of trouble.

And when I was come down to her, the Maid did be seeming a little in
thought; and afterward showed me how that she did be all in a pitiful
disgust of the dirt and slime and the drippings of the Gorge, that did
be on her, and had made her garment utter wet and bemired, so that she
did feel that her very body was a repulse unto her.

And I saw how it did be with Naani; and I went to the warm pool, and
felt that it did be not over-hot, and afterward found the deepness, by
the handle of the Diskos, and this to be scarce of three feet, and the
water very clear to show me the bottom, so that it was surely a nice
and proper place to be for such a purpose as I did think. And I set some
of the water to my mouth, using my hand; and truly there did seem no
hurtful chemical in the water; and therefore was I eased that the Maid
should have the desire that I did see to be in her mind.

And I saw that I should be helpful to Mine Own, if that I make the
arranging of things to be in mine own hands. And I went back unto the
Maid, and told her that the pool was very nice to be for a bath-place;
and that she to haste to wash herself, whilst the Gorge did be free of
any Creature or Monster.

Now I saw that Naani was troubled, and feared that I did be going to
leave her, and yet did be paused a little in her words, to show me all
that she did wish.

And surely, I stoopt and kist her, as she did look so wistful in her
little puzzlement; and immediately I removed her trouble very natural,
and told that I should stand guard anigh to her, the while that she
bathed. And, truly she did be at ease on the moment, and mayhap
something surprised to know wherefore she had been something a-lack to
ask me. But, in truth, it did be very natural.

And I told her to be so quick as she might, which was a needless thing
to say, yet to start her; and she to go quietly to obey me; but first to
take the cloak out of the hold upon my shoulders, and to unfold it, and
so to the pool. And I to stand with my back thatwards, and to lean,
ready, upon the Diskos.

And presently she did be in the water, as I knew; and I to be her man,
very sure and gentle to her and sedate. And truly, as you shall think, I
did love that I be to stand guard to her in her dear maidenhood; and
she, after that she was cheered and warmed by the delight of the water,
to sing very low and happy to herself, where she did be to my back.

And, sudden, the singing to cease, and the Maid screamed; and I to have
no thought of improper modesty but turned instant to the Maid. And in a
moment, I saw what did trouble her; for there came a serpent out of the
water; and the Maid to be all adrift with natural modesty, and with her
fear of the serpent. And I was come into the pool in a moment, in mine
armour, and did lift the Maid, naked and wet into mine arms, and had her
instant from the water, and upon the side of the pool; and there I wrapt
the cloak about her; and ran very quick and killed the serpent, as it
did go offwards among the boulders. And surely it did be so thick as
mine arm, and to have come from some hole that did be hid in the bottom
of the pool.

And I came back then to Mine Own, and took her into mine arms, and set
the cloak well about her; and she to cry and to tremble with the shock
and disturbance of the thing; but soon to be eased, and ready to laugh
with me.

And so she was come proper to her happiness again, and I very gentle
and joyous with her, for truly my heart had been sick that she had come
so nigh to that horrid danger.

And I eased the scrip from me, and opened it, and made her to take two
of the tablets, and she to refuse to eat, save I company her also; and
indeed I did be very willing, for truly my belly was alway empty. And
she to be very glad to eat, because she did be clean now, and to have no
more disgust of herself. And afterward, we drank some of the water. And
soon we did be finished, and she to ask for her girdle that I did give
her with the knife, as I have surely told. And she belted the cloak very
graceful about her; and lookt very dear and pretty with her little bare
feet; and her hair very lovely upon her shoulders, for she did wear
alway in the Gorge the lining of my head-piece, and so had her hair dry
and sweet.

And, in verity, I did mind now, how that she did look very beautiful in
her bath, as I had gone to succour her from the snake; and I to be
nicely wholesome in this remembering, because of my love, but yet to be
knowing that I was sweetly stirred to new things; and did not know
before that a maid lookt in the same moment so holy and so human. And
afterward, in odd whiles, I remembered; but never to think overmuch,
because that I did feel inwardly that I should be gently wise in such
things; and you to understand my heart in this, if that ever you have
loved.

And surely, the Maid brought me from my dreamings very sensible, in that
she had me to stand; and she was gone about me very swift and natty with
her pretty fingers, that she ease me of mine armour.

And afterward, she bade me to strip and wash, whilst that she keep watch
for me of the Gorge. And she took the Diskos, and leaned upon it, very
brave and proper; but yet, as I do think, with somewhat of roguishness
within her, very deep hid, and scarce known unto herself.

And I warned her to be very wise with the great weapon; for it did fit
only to fight in my hands, and did be like to cause harm to any that
should meddle with it or make to use it, save me.

And Naani to nod that she did hear me, and to be half in fear of the
thing, and half to feel that it did be friendly to her; and so to stand
guard for me; and truly to seem a very sweet and slender maid, despite
the bigness of the cloak; and the great weapon to seem more great in her
small hands; and to mind me how strong I did be. And surely you shall
think me in conceit; but truly I did be glad to be so strong; and a
proper thing for pride, if that there be no scorn for others therein.
And you to agree with me in this thing, or to be lacking of sympathy and
good human understanding.

Now I washt me, not by going down into the pool; for indeed I did not
wot whether there be any more snakes hid there in some other hole. And
the way I washt, was that I dipt my head-piece into the hot pool, and
poured the water over me, and rubbed my body very strong with my hands;
and there to be, surely, some certain chemical in the water that aided
mine efforts; for the water went very smooth under my hands.

And when I was done, I washt my pocket-cloth very speedy in the pool,
and wrung it, and did then wipe my body so dry as I should; and
afterward I wrung the cloth again, and set it about my loins, and so to
be as proper as I might.

And I did call to the Maid that I was proper, and she to come then and
kiss me; and she gave back to me the Diskos, and set me that I stand
anigh to the nearer fire-hole, and so to be that I should guard her, and
in the same time be come free of the chill of the Gorge, which was not
great in that place.

And surely I did mean that I help her; but she would have no help in her
work that she did say to be her glad right; but bade me that I to mine
own work to be her dear protector, as she did call me. And I to lift
that Wilful One into mine arms, a moment, and to give her a very loving
hug, and for that time to have no fear that I harm her, because that I
was freed of the hardness of the armour about me, as you do know.

And surely she to feel very dear and pretty in mine arms, and she kist
me the once with a little passion of love; and immediately to want to go
from me; so that I freed her in a moment, as was ever my way. And she
then to pause a small space off from me, and lookt at me with a light in
her eyes, and half to put out her arms that she be taken again into
mine; but so to cease, ere she yield to her heart; and turned from me
immediately to the task of the washing.

And she took first my body-vest, and washt it very quick and clever in
the pool, and afterward came over by me, and spread it upon the hot flat
rock anigh to the fire-hole.

And she got then my change body-vest from the bundle of her torn
garments, where she did put it to be washt on opportunity, even as now;
and mayhap to like that it should lie in her bundle with her own
garments, for so, as I do mind, the thought came to me very natural; but
she to say naught to lead me thus; yet to be a very honest and dear
Maid, and to have little secret ways of love, as I did perceive, that I
did not be told of.

And she washt the second body-vest, and set it to dry by the first; and
afterward did likewise with all my garments, and came then to the
washing of her own.

And lo! as she spread it also to the drying, there came to mine heart
that the Maid did have only this one rough and thick garment, that did
be the armour-suit, as I have told. And surely it did be dreadful that
she have the hardness of that strong knitted and fibrous garment to be
next to her dear body, and I to be in comfort with the softness of my
body-vest.

And I was all angered in a moment, that she had gone thiswise, while
that I had been gentled, as it might be. And I bade Naani take the
second vest to her own use when it did be dry. And she to look upward
from where she did turn the garments upon the hot rock; and to mean in
the first to deny me. But indeed she was quick to see that I did be
truly in anger; and mine anger to come because that I was hurt that this
did be, and because that I was shamed that she had gone so rough-clad,
the while that I had no thought to the matter. And moreover because that
she had known her lack, and did not tell me of the thing.

But yet I did have a great tenderness in the backward part of mine
anger, because that I perceived all the unselfishness and delight of her
love that did be about this little matter, as you shall see, if you have
gone alway with me.

But mine anger yet to be something hard, because I did see that I have
need to watch the Maid, that she put not her dear body to pain, that I
might come unknowing to some little pleasuring or ease, as did be now as
I have shown. And truly it did be sweetly done in love; but to be
somewise lacking of judgement; and so shall you know somewhat of the way
that I did be angered, and to have understanding with me; but if you
have not, you shall think it to be naught, and that the Maid did need
only that she be kist, and to be shaken a little in playfulness, and
warned to heed that I did be earnest; and mayhap you to be somewise
right, and not to guess far off from the inward deepness of my heart.
But yet it doth be verity that I was truly angered, and fit to shake
Mine Own, and in the same moment to be utter tender unto her. And surely
this doth be all a contradiction, and the human heart to be a wayward
thing, whether it doth be of a man or of a woman.

And Naani, as I do think, to have loved the chafe of that rough garment
for love's sake, and to go very humble and loving, as I lookt at her;
but in verity to be never gone from the sweet naughtiness that did be
alway in her heart, and to plan even in that moment some new and secret
service unto me, that should be for her quiet joy, and to be hid from
me, until that my wit should come upon it to uncover it. And in verity a
young man doth want that he whip his maid and kiss her, and all in the
one moment. And, indeed, he to have delight in both.

And she obeyed me that time, as alway when I did be earnest, without
more word. And surely that Naughty One did know how I loved her.

And the Maid washt then her torn garments that did be in the bundle, and
had gotten soiled by the slime of the dark part of the Gorge. And she
put these to dry, and afterward washed mine armour and the scrip and the
pouch and the cloak-hold, and all such matters of our gear; and so to be
presently done.

And she was heedful then that she turned the garments upon the hot
rock; and afterward did attend to my bruisings. And when she did rest, I
lookt to her pretty feet, and rubbed them very gentle and constant with
the ointment; and surely they did be pretty well; but I to _like_ that I
should tend them, and to have joy to feel their littleness within my
palms, and surely she did know how it did be with me; for presently she
took her feet inward under the cloak; and I, maybe, to look something
woeful; for she put one out presently, when that I did the least expect,
and slipt it very cosy into my hand; and surely I kist her naughty toes;
and she then to be very sedate.

Now, presently, when Naani found the garments to be proper dry, she gave
those to me that were mine, and bid me to turn my back and be drest very
speedy. And lo! in a little time, when I was nigh done, she came over
and stood before me, and was drest again in the armour-suit, and to look
very slender and dainty. And she lookt at me, so that I put out my
hands, that I kiss her; but she went from me, very proper, and brought
mine armour, and gave me help with it, and alway very grave and quiet;
but yet to have naughtiness underneath, as I did believe.

And when I was full armed, she took my hand, and set mine arm about her
waist, and she leaned her head against my breast, and put up her lips to
be kist, as that she did be a child maiden; yet when I kist her, she did
be a woman, and to kiss me very dear and loving, and to look at me then
from under her eye-lids; and sudden to make a dainty growling, and to
pretend that she did be a fierce thing that should be like to eat me;
and I to be utter feared, as you shall think, and to be scarce able that
I kiss Mine Own Pretty Fierce One, because that I did laugh so hearty,
and to be so taken with a surprise that the Maid did show this new
playfulness; and in the same moment to be stirred and waked anew that
she did be so lovely and graceful in mine arms, and to make her naughty
growling so pretty that I did be eager that she make it again; but she
to do this playing only as her mood did stir her.

And she made then that she would go from me, and I to loose her, as
ever; and she bade me that I guard her the while that she washt the
outward part of the cloak; for the inward did be clean, and the cloak
proof to water; but the outward part to be something needful of washing.

And surely, when this was made clean, it dried very quick, because that
the water went not into it; and whilst that it dried, I gave Mine Own an
aid upward unto the cave, and afterward I passed up the gear, and the
cloak when it did be dry; and so came upward also myself, and brought
with me a boulder, that I balanced very light in the mouth of the cave,
so that it should fall, if that anything toucht it; and this plan you do
know of; for I used it before, as I have told.

And truly we did be utter wearied, and the time to be something beyond
three and twenty hours, since last we had slumber. And the Maid had the
scrip and the pouch set to be for my pillow, and the bundle of her torn
garment to be for her own. And she to have me to my pillow, and to tuck
the cloak about me, and the Diskos to my hand; and afterward to kiss me
very sedate upon the lips, and then to come in under the cloak, with a
quiet and lovely happiness, as I did know; and to be gone to slumber
very content and sweet.

And I waked eight good hours after, with the fizzing of the water in
mine ears; and lo! Mine Own did be waked and to make ready our
breakfast; and I came upward upon mine elbow, to see whether that the
boulder did be unmoved; and indeed it was not touched.

And Mine Own saw that I was come awake; and she ran to me, very dear and
glad, and kist my lips very eager and loving. And surely, as she kist
me, I did feel that she had taken again a naughty advantaging of my
slumber, and had kist me as I did sleep; but truly I said no word of my
thoughts; for I did mind that I should wake sudden one time, and so to
catch her in this, and to call her then Mine Own, and that she did be a
rogue; and all as you shall know, that have loved.

And I scolded the Maid a little, in that she had not waked me; but I
said not that I would attend to the duties that she did heed to; for I
knew that she had joy of these things, in that she did love to do aught
that should be done unto me. And when I scolded her, she to make but a
little mouth at me, as we do say, and to put her tablets to my lips,
that I kiss them, and she to kiss mine; and so to our breakfast.

And when we were done, we gat together our gear, and went downward from
the cave, and began again to journey. And we went eighteen hours that
day, and eat and drunk at every sixth hour, as ever.

And in the fourteenth hour, I perceived that I did be like to overtravel
the Maid, though I made alway to have a less speed than did be natural
unto me. And surely then, I took her up into mine arms; and she to
refuse, and to be troubled that I should so carry her; for she did think
that I was like to be wearied by the task.

And I to take no heed to her pretestings; but to laugh gently with her,
and to carry her, even as a babe in mine arms; and she to love that she
be in mine arms, if but she be able to have assuredness that I come not
to weariness through her. And truly it did be a dear love task, and to
be set unto the needing of mine especial heart.

And I carried Mine Own then for four hours; and in the eighteenth hour
we were come to that part of the Gorge where did be the ledge where I
killed the spider, ere I slept, as you shall mayhap to mind. And here I
aided the Maid to climb, and we had the same ledge that night to be our
refuge; and did sleep very happy and unharmed, and alway with our
spirits set to warn us, if that harm did make to come nigh to us.

And we went then through three days of eighteen hours' journey each;
and alway I did carry Mine Own, from the twelfth unto the eighteenth
hour of each journeying; and this to be very dear unto me, and to give
me a new rejoicing that I did be strong and easy to carry Mine Own; and
she to lie in mine arms very content, when that she perceived how that I
did be so glad to go thiswise and that I had no weariness by the
carrying.

And thus I did rest her feet, and wore not her dear and slender body
overmuch with the vigour of my going; and was abled to make a very good
speed.

And Mine Own, this time and that, to make sayings of impudence unto me,
and to hide her naughty lips, when that I should kiss them; and to have
quaint nestlings unto me, and odd whiles to kiss me very dainty when
that I did be going thoughtful of the way. And surely never did there be
so dear a maid as Mine Own; so that I did go many a mile, and to be
scarce that I knew that I was gone any way, because of the stirrings of
my heart and the content of my spirit.

And oft as we did go, there were great scorpions in the path, and odd
whiles they to have no heed to go from my way; but to be so great as my
head, and very fat and lazy, so that surely I kickt a good number, from
my path, even as you shall kick a ball with the foot; and three I burst
in this way. And truly it did be well that I had on me mine armour, else
had they been like to sting me very quick unto death; for they were so
great.

And likewise, in this place and that, there were snakes; but none to
come anigh to me; and I to choose alway the open goings; for I did think
there to be many hid snakes and lesser monsters in the dark places
between the great boulders. And alway, when the Maid did walk, I to go
before, that I see clear her way, and this thing to be but a matter of
wiseness, as you shall think.

And odd whiles, as I did carry Mine Own, she to talk a little with me of
her memory-dreams of the olden days; and mayhap you to think it strange
that we said not overmuch on this wise; but the way of our journey to
have been so utter bitter, as you have seen; and we to be more of that
far age, than we did be of this present age; and this present life to
seem but a dream of Memory, and we to be set then with the realness of
that life. And this telling, indeed, to be a plain thing to your
understanding. Yet did we have a greater talk to these ends, when that
we were come free of the Gorge; but yet, oft there to be an odd saying
and a sweet memory, like to an olden and forgot fragrance of dreams, to
pass between Mine Own and me. And do you to set your sympathy of
understanding with me in this thing, and to know how holy these things
did be, and far off, and to hold memory, as a mist that doth shine with
golden lights, that did make an holy pain upon the eyes of the spirit,
even as a quiet dawn of this day doth set a pleasure of vague pain upon
the heart.

And once, as I did carry the Maid, I saw that she wept a little, very
husht unto herself; and I to say naught; for I saw that it did be a
natural sorrow for her father, and for the dead Peoples of the Lesser
Redoubt; that did be left for ever unto the desolation of Eternity. And
so, because I did be wise to leave her be, she to be eased presently,
and to wipe her eyes, quiet and secret, and mayhap to think that I did
not perceive; and then to nestle unto me; and so to be the more Mine
Own.

And about the middle part of the second day, we came past the cave where
I did sleep on the upward journey; and I to tell Naani, and she to look
upward to the cave, and to wish that she might come a moment into it;
only that it did be twenty good feet upward, and I to desire that she
run no risk of her dear life, when that there did be no need.

And so to go onward; and odd whiles to see strange things a-lurk among
the boulders; but none to come anigh to us; yet did I keep the Diskos
very ready in my hand, as you shall think; and had mine eyes alway to
look upon every side, and mine ears to be wary; and to use my spirit
alway to mine aid.

And surely, as we did come lower in the Gorge, the Maid was all
a-wondered at the warmness that did grow, and something disturbed in the
first, by the new thickness, as it did seem, of the air. And she to
waste some of the water, because that it did fizz up so quick, even as
I, until that she was come used to this newness. And all this to be very
plain unto you.

And in the end of every journey, we slept eight good hours in a safe
place; and so to go onward again; and the Maid to grow very eager as I
did tell her this thing and that of the Country that we did come
downward unto.

And she askt me questions, time and oft, and much I told her, and she to
think upon it with a growing wonder and desire, even as a gladsome child
that hath never seen the sea, and doth be told that it shall presently
be there. And this to be but to shadow the way that Naani did be; for
truly she did be a very live and eager maid, in all things.

And we to be still within the Gorge, and to go constant by the
fire-holes and the fire-pits, and to see the flames leap upward in this
place and that, so that the mighty walls of the Gorge would show very
plain in an instant; and immediately to come the shadows again, and
afterward the leaping of the flames. And so did it be forever. And oft
the muttering of the fire-pits; and oft the utter quiet and the shadows.

And this time and that there did be a snake to go by us, and the
scuttling of the monster scorpions; and mayhap a moving in the shadows
of the great boulders, that did tell me there went maybe some peculiar
monster in that place; so that I did be very wary, and to have the
Diskos alway ready.

And when the fourth day was come, I showed the Maid, in the sixth hour,
the ledge that did be my first sleeping place, when that I was entered
into the Gorge.

Now presently, in the eleventh hour, after that we had gone five hours
in a gloom, there did show afar off a shining; and I caught the Maid,
and I pointed; and she also to perceive that it did be surely the
shining of the light of that great Country that I did tell upon.

And immediately we did begin to run downward, and with sore stumblings
in this place and that; but not to halt us; for we did be so mad as two
children for the gladsome light.

And we came down presently in the twelfth hour of that journey into the
warm light and wonder of the Country of the Seas.




XIII

HOMEWARD BY THE SHORE


Now we came presently out of that sad and dreary place that did go
inward of the great mountains, and which I have named the Upward Gorge;
and we to halt soon between the feet of the mountains, beyond the
mouth-part of the Gorge.

And Naani alway to look every way about her, and to breathe very quick,
and her eyes to be gone bright with wonder and the seeing of new things,
and the coming of freedom from so great a dread.

And she turned, now, and did look upward into the dark of the Gorge, and
to spy upon the great mouth thereof, and to be feared then, and must run
a greater way downward into the lightness of the Country of the Seas;
and to come once more to pause, and to look backward, and with an awe
and a relieved soul; and so again to the wonder of the spreaded Country
and the great Sea; and did near to laugh and cry in the same moment,
with the amazement and gladness and great astonishment that did be upon
her. And she to turn constant this way and that, and to be never ceased
of looking, and of deep breathings of the wide air; for never in that
life had she been in a broad place of light, as you shall have
perceived.

And we to feel, both, that there did be no more need to talk husht, as
we did alway in the gloom and narrow dark of the gorge. And surely she
to shout, as a child that doth try an echo; and her voice to go very
pretty into the distance, and to be lost afar off in that Country.

And lo! in a moment, an echo to come out of the dark mountains to our
backs; so that we lookt round very sudden; but whether the echo did be
truly an echo, or some strangeness, or some unnatural call to come
downward out of the gloom and horror of the Gorge, we did be all unsure;
and indeed must run downward a while more, until that we did be all
breathed, and to halt presently where we did feel to be utter free of
the Gorge and of the strangeness that did seem to our minds, in that
moment, to lie upward in the darkness of the great mountains.

And surely we did took about for a flat rock to be for our use, and we
came presently to a place nice to our purpose, that did be yet upward
over the Land; and we climbed up on to the rock and sat thereon to have
our food and drink.

And as we eat and drank, we did sit very close and happy; but yet to
have a wise looking about anigh to us, so that we be caught by no danger
of the Humpt Men, or by any other danger that might be.

And alway, the Maid did question, and did stare afar over the Country,
and to have a shining wonder and joy of the sea, and to be stirred in
all her being, so that she was pained with vague and sudden memories,
that did be as strange dreams, and all mixt with pleasure and pain. And,
indeed, she sudden to weeping, and to need that she be in mine arms,
until that she know herself once again; and so to her dear natural joy
and way.

And oft did Mine Own speak upon the clear wonder of the air, as it did
seem to her; and to me it did seem likewise, that had lived my life also
in a Dark Land, as you do know.

And she to break sudden from her rapture, and to set back her speech an
Eternity with vague words, and memories so olden and englamoured that
they did be as moonlight that once hath shone. And in a moment she to be
forward again into that far future time and speech, and all her being to
be close unto me, and oft in a solemn silence of the heart.

And the greatness of the sea to call unto her with an olden voice, and
to half waken her; and I with her to be thus half-wakened, yet had I
been not thus as I did come mine outward way; but truly I did stir to
the stirring of the Maid, and all mine olden thoughts that did be my
memory-dreams, to come afresh upon my spirit.

And so we two to sit there all shaken with dreamings that did concern
happenings of the olden world that did lie upward in that dreadful night
which made a mighty and deeply roof over that Country. And surely I am
dumb, in that I have no speech to make known to you all the troublings
and stirrings of our spirits that we did know in that moment.

And far off, by miles, beyond the feet of the mountain, where went the
shore of the sea, upon our left, there was a great mist and steam; and
this to be that mist and steam that I did come through on mine outward
way; and Naani to ask concerning it, and I to tell her so much as I
knew, and how that we must indeed come presently through it, upon our
journey.

And she to be in wonder of the volcanoes that did burn in the sea, and
in this place and that of the wide Country, and the height and grandness
to exalt her, and in the same time to give her a strange humbleness of
her mind; so that presently I did take her into mine arms, for I must
kiss her, because that she did be so utter a sweet maiden, and lovely
with interest and naturalness. And truly she to kiss me in turn; and to
make her questionings between her kissings; and this to be because she
did yearn for a greater knowing of the Country; but also, as I do half
to think, because she did be sweetly impudent unto me; and this to be of
her joy.

And presently, she to kiss me thrice very passionate and warm upon the
mouth; and immediately to take my shoulders, with her small hands, that
did seem so pretty upon my broadness and upon the metal of the armour.
And she to strive thus that she shake me to a speedier answering; and
she, all that while, to be full of a dear naughtiness, and to need that
she be kist very hard.

And I to answer her; but after mine own fashion which did be a word
between each kiss that I gave to her. And she very quick and naughty to
put her hand between our lips; and I then to kiss the palm, that did be
in my way, and did be very small and pretty. And she, when I had no
thought, to open her fingers very quick, and kiss me through between the
fingers, and immediately to shut the fingers, so that I did be stopt
from the same.

And afterward, I made her to stand upon the rock, and I set free her
hair over her shoulders; and I took then the boots from her, so that her
little feet did show bare and pretty. And she, at the first, half to
refuse me; but afterward to stand very dear and obedient that I should
have my way with her; and to be a little shy, and the more pretty
because of her sweet blushings.

And surely, when that I had her to my likings, I stept back a little
pace, and lookt at her. And she to look again at me, very quaint and
naughty; and then to turn her about, very grave; and to make pretend
that she did be a dummy figure. And, surely, when she did be come right
round, and to face me again, and had a very sedate look, she stretched
out her pretty foot, all in a moment, and put her pink toes sudden upon
my lips; and I to be so in surprise, that I had not wit to do aught, ere
she had them back swift from me. And she then to make one glad spring
into mine arms, and to want that she be hugged, and to be loved very
great. And I to laugh, all tender; for I loved her so utter, as you do
know; and I to tell her, as you sure likewise to have told your maid,
that I wanted a pocket sufficient, that I might have her therein alway
anigh to my heart; and this thing I to say to her, as a man that doth
love, shall say it; and you to know the way of it so well as I. And she
to laugh very mischievous, and to tell me that she should truly tickle
me, if that I carried her thatwise; aye and to pinch me, too. And I to
have no answer, save that I shake her, very gentle, but indeed she to
kiss me very naughty on the mouth, in the midst of my shaking; and
truly, what shall a man do with such an one.

And she then to want to be more sedate and to be set down upon the rock;
and she to make me to turn around, so that she should come at the pouch,
which did be upon my back.

And she gat thence the comb that was a fitment, and did comb her pretty
hair, and I to sit and talk with her, and to jest, with a heart that did
be so light as it had not been for a great while; for though I did dread
the Humpt Men and the monstrous animals of the Country of Seas, I had
not any abiding horror of aught that I had seen in that Country; for
there seemed a naturalness in all things, so that I did have no
loathing; neither any fear of an Evil Force.

And presently, when that the Maid had combed her hair, she to bind it
upon her head; but I to ask that she leave it upon her shoulders,
because that it did be so pretty; and she to smile at me, and to be
happy to my pleasuring.

Now we did be truly sedate, and to set our gear together; and I to put
the boots upon the Maid; and afterward we to begin again to journey
downward into the Country of the Seas.

And we went at a good pace; but not to bring us to any great weariness;
for it was mine intent that we rest for our slumber upon this side of
the place where did be the steam of the boilings, that was anigh to the
shore of the sea, as you shall mind.

And we at this time to be passing along the feet of the mountains, unto
the place of the steam; and to go thiswise for six good hours, and still
to be a great hour off that part; for we went not so fierce as did be
the speed of mine outward way, which was utter strong, as you do mind,
that have gone with me in all my journey.

And so, when we had walkt six hours, we did be gone something beyond the
eighteenth hour of that day's journeying; and to be very ready to our
slumber.

Now, presently we found a tall rock, very hard to climb, that had a flat
top so great as may be twice my length everyways; and this to be very
good to our purpose. And when we were come safe to the top, we to eat
and drink, and presently to sleep, and to have the cloak under us, as
did be the will of the Maid; for the Country did be utter warm and nice,
so that we had no occasion for covering.

And surely, we waked, both of us when that we had slept seven good
hours; and we sat upward, and lookt newly each at the other; and to be
as that we did each see the other anew in that good light, and to have a
fresh joy each in the look of the other. And she to come into mine arms,
and to kiss and to need that she be kist; and truly, we both to have our
need; but yet to be something the more hungry of the other, for the
having.

And Mine Own then to make our breakfast; and the water to fizz very
strong and surprising; and we to eat and drink, and to be utter happy
each with the other, and to talk on this thing and that, and the Maid to
look about, as we eat; and she to look afar off at the wonders and the
newness of the Country to her knowledge; but I to look near, lest there
be any danger that might be anigh.

And in a while, Mine Own to draw my gaze to the Mountains that the Gorge
came through. And, in verity, now that I did look in ease, I to see with
her how that they did be truly monstrous, even as a monstrous wall that
did go upward for ever until that they were gone out of the light of
that Country, into the dark night of the deathly Upper World, that did
be lost an eternity. And I to mind that I had some vague thoughts
thiswise, on the outward way; but now I to have ease, and the Maid to
speak with, and so to perceive odd matters the more. And I to tell you
this little thing, so that you shall perceive the way that restfulness
did be upon me, by compare with the Outward Going.

And, truly, we had no great speed with our talk and with our eating; but
in the end did make somewhat to hurry, because that we did be conscious
that we leaned to slackness. And indeed, we came down then pretty speedy
from the rock where we did sleep; and had forward to our way at a good
pace.

And when we had gone a while, we to begin to hear the far hissing of the
steam and the noise of the upward burstings of waters that did boil; and
the sound to be very strange; but I to have heard it before, as you do
know; so that it to trouble me the less than the Maid. And I to assure
her; and she to come nigh to me, and thiswise we to enter presently into
the steam.

And we went then for more than three hours; and I had the Maid to my
back, that I should be the first; and this I did, that she have no
danger to walk into a boiling pool in the mazingness of the steam, which
was everywhere. And I to be something guided in my path by the shore of
the sea which did be unto our left alway; only that we could see neither
the sea nor otherwise, except that we go so close that we near into the
water.

And, truly, the sea to seem to boil in parts, and there to be hot pools
in all places; so that who should say with ease whether we did go by one
of the great hot pools or by the true sea. And this, our constant
puzzle, shall be likewise to you; and you to perceive how that we did go
utter wary.

And about us from every part there did come the strange burstings and
shriekings and whistlings of the boil of the waters breaking upward from
the deep world. And odd whiles the sounds to be as of great monsters;
and the earth to shake under us; and other-whiles there to be a hush and
only the steam about us, and somewhere in the distance and uncertainness
a low piping of some steam cranny, very strange and lonesome-sounding.

And when it did be somewheres nigh upon the fourth hour, we came out of
the thick steam; and the pipings and the roarings to be to our rearward;
and soon the steam to be gone thin, as but a mist, and the noises to be
very far-seeming; and presently we to be come clear out into the air of
that Country.

And the Maid now to perceive the trees, which did be in great forests
unto our right hand, while that the shore of the sea did go alway upon
our left. And she to be utter in wonder of the trees; and to need that
she pluck branches, and smell of them and look at each leaf; and so to
be all stirred; for never in that life did she to have seen such a
matter as those great trees did be; but yet to be all stirred by vague
memories that did seem no more than dreams. And you to think but a
moment, and to perceive how the thing did be with her; and you to have
been likewise stirred, if that you did be so strangely waked in a corner
part of the heart; though but a little matter to wake you.

Now when the sixth hour did be full come, we made a halt in a wise
place, and had there our tablets and the water; and afterward, the Maid
bid me that I take her unto a warm pool that did be near by, and to ask
that I turn from her, but yet to be anigh for her Protector, as I did be
ever.

And so she to wash and to make herself happy with a sweet cleanness that
did be proper to her; and afterward, when she did be done, she to act
watch whilst I to mine; and to help me in all matters, that she was
able; and truly, I to be happy indeed that she did so have delight to
attend upon me and to treat me mother-wise; yet truly with her
maid-heart not all hid, as you have perceived, this time and that.

And surely thus did we go alway in these matters; and oft that I have
not space to have told; and oft that you shall remember, if that I do be
too full of other happenings to give heed to tell upon.

And afterward we to our journeying again; and to talk upon this thing
and that thing; and I to be watchful as we talked, and to tell the Maid
that she keep her eyes wary, but yet not to be of unease.

And when we did go thiswise for seven good hours, we were come nigh
opposed to the bright-burning fire-hill that did be offward in the sea,
and had made me a warm light in that time when I did sleep in the tree,
as you do remember. And truly, as I shall here mind you, we did be past
seven hours coming to this place, from the part where the steam did be;
yet had I gone that space upon the outward way at a speed that was
greater; but truly I might not set so great a pace to the Maid, save,
mayhap, odd whiles; and this thing I beg that you have alway in your
mind, and so to understand why that we did be oft long upon this part of
the journey and that, by compare with mine outward going.

And, in verity, I had set off our hour for food, because that I saw we
did come nigh to the place where the tree did be; and I to know that the
Maid should like to eat and drink anigh to that place, and to know that
I did sleep there.

And surely I took her to the tree, and when that I told her, she to beg
me that I indulge her and that we go upward to that branch where I did
sleep, and there to eat our tablets.

And I to be willing, and to enter into her wishing; for, indeed, there
was no danger in the climb, and I to go alway below her, so that I could
be surety for her safeness. And we came up to the great branch; and she
to make how we should sit, and I to have to show just where I did lie,
and she to look very close, and to see that my weight had surely marked
the hardness of the armour upon the bark; and she then to be upon that
branch alone, as she did eat and drink; and to look outward at the light
from the fire-hill, and to be very husht, and to think, and I not to
disturb her with speech.

And when she did be done, she gat from the branch, and kist the place
where I did lie; and lo! in a moment a thought came into her, and she
drew her knife, and cut out a piece of the bark, and put it into her
breast to be for a keepsake; and so to seem somewise contented.

And truly, I told her about the great beast, when we were come down
again to the earth; and she to cry out and to show me that there did be
yet the mark where the belly of the monstrous beast did brush upon the
earth, as it ran, and moreover the broken places of the foot-marks; and
she by this to see how great a beast it did be; but yet did it be a
little thing beside the Slug; only that it did be a thing of horn and
hardness of skin, as you have perceived.

And truly, I do mind how that the observings of the Maid did bring very
keen to me how that there had past but seventeen days since that I did
go onward from this place; and this to seem very strange and scarce
credible unto me; for I had thought it, somewise, as a great time; and
truly this to be because it was so marked by stress of the mind and
great happenings; and you to agree in this thing. But yet, also, we
shall truly mind that those times that I have called days, did hold oft
the hours of two days, and mayhap three, as you do remember. Now we
went onward then to our journeying; and I to make to carry the Maid, as
ever, after that she had walked twelve hours, though she did walk
thirteen hours this time as you have seen. And she to say that she go
now upon her own feet through the next six hours, and so to ease me from
the labour that did be needful to carry her.

But I to know how that she did be like to be all gone of her strength
thiswise, in but a day or two, and we to make the better speed, if that
I keep to my way, and to have her to walk twelve hours of every journey,
and afterward to come into mine arms; for, truly, she did be bred less
hardy than I, as you shall think from all that I have told concerning
the Peoples of the Lesser Pyramid; and moreover she was yet something
weakened, as I did think, by the dreadful month of her lonesomeness and
escapings, before that I was come to succour her.

And truly, as I did carry her, the Maid did make remark of her
wonderment concerning me, in that I did be so hard of my body and set in
the determination of my mind. And, in verity, I did be exceeding strong
and of great hardness of body; and mayhap my will did be somewhat this
way also, else do I think I had never borne to come unto Mine Own
through so much desolation. And I to smile very happy upon her; for I
did love that I was so strong, and very truly in delight that Mine Own
Maid did take gladness in this thing. And you to mind how you did be
also in the love-days; and so to have nice understanding of my
naturalness and human pride.

And surely the Maid did nestle unto me, as she did talk; even, somewise,
as a Child shall come nigh to the Mother, but yet also as a Maid doth
love to be nigh unto her Man, if that she doth truly love. And I to lift
her more nigh to my lips; but she to refuse to kiss me, and to be a
Sweet Impertinence that did lie in mine arms; yet when I did make to
lower her again to the way that had her easy to carry, she to slip her
pretty face very snug under my chin, and to kiss me there, after her own
fashion; and afterward to be willing that she be as usual into mine
arms.

Now, as I set the Maid again comfortable, it seemed to me that she was
something tender; and sudden it came to me that mayhap the armour to be
very hard and painful unto her; and I to ask this thing of her, in a
moment; and she to see that I would not be put off; and so to tell me.
And, truly, I was utter angered with myself; and somewise also with her,
in that she did not waken mine unthinkingness to this thing.

And I set her instant to the earth, and made her to bare her shoulders
to me; and truly they did be much bruised where that she had lain so oft
in mine arms, against the hardness of mine armour.

And I to be so angered that I near shook her, and she to see how I did
be, and that she did be nigh to be shaken, because that I was grown so
angry that she should let herself come to this foolish hurt, that yet I
did know was very dear unto her secret heart. And, in truth, she put up
her lips to me, very sudden, and with a strange naughtiness, that she
have her own way with me to tempt me from mine anger, that yet she did
half to like. And, in verity, I near slapt her then upon her pretty
shoulders, but that she ceased from her tempting of me; and instead she
turned her shoulders to me, even as a child, that I button her garment
for her.

And surely, when I had buttoned her garment, she came round unto me, and
closed her hand, so that it did be a little fist, even as I did love her
to do, because that it was so small beside my great hand.

And she slipt her shut hand into mine; and surely I let it stay within,
very quiet, and made not to close upon it, as I did wont. And the Maid
did move her hand around in mine, that she make me to take notice upon
her, and to grasp her little fist. Yet I did be very stern, for I was
truly angered; and neither did I put her hand from mine, nor made to
hold it; but only to let it bide; yet, truly, I to be something stirred
in the heart-part by her pretty ways.

And in a little while, she took her hand from out of mine, and did have
daring to be cold unto me. And mine anger then to be quaintly renewed,
and to think that she did well need to be whipt. And she made a naughty
and foolish impudence upon that which I said to her; so that presently I
did say that she did need such as should make her to heed her manners;
but yet, as you shall conceive, I to know inwardly all that time how
that even this true naughtiness did not stir me to proper anger; but
more that it made me masterful and to lack not that I make her to know
truly that I did be her Master; and in the same time to be strangely
touched in a very deep and secret place of my heart. And truly love doth
have strange actings upon the heart.

And the Maid to ask me in a very saucy fashion that did be intentioned
to anger me, what I did mean that she to need. And truly I said that she
did go the way to earn that she be flogged like any boy, and I to mean
actual all that I did say, which doth something amaze me now; but, as I
do know, I yet to be constant stirred inwardly by her beloved quaintness
that did be alway so dainty, even when that she did mean her naughtiness
to be truly to anger me.

And lo! when I told the Maid this thing, that she did well go to earn a
sharp reproof, she turned in a quick instant, and came close to me, all
tender and small and to need to be nigh to me. And she slipt both her
closed hands into the one of mine, and truly they did be little fists.
And because I could be no more stern with Mine Own, I put mine arm about
her, and she did nestle to me, so that all my being did want to be a
shield about her.

And she to hark very quiet and humble to my counsellings; and in the
end did be so strangely husht that I lookt down to where her pretty face
did be hid against mine armour, as she did love to do, when that I did
be those odd whiles a little stern with her. And I held her face away
from mine armour; and surely she did be smiling, very quiet and naughty;
so that I perceived that she did be good only for that time, and did be
like to show again this wrongful and impudent spirit. Yet I not then to
be in trouble of the future; but to hope only that I do wisely, if that
she show again this waywardness. And, truly, I to perceive now that I
did be very young; but, anywise, as you do know, I to act alway from the
natural telling of my heart.

And I shook Naani a little, for this naughty spirit which did not be
gone from her. For I perceived that my manhood had but stirred the woman
in her to that strange quick humbleness that had seemed to be a
quenching of her wayward unwisdom; and truly it had not been stilled,
but only sunken for a little moment in the uprising of her dear nature,
which had responded unto me.

And the Maid to look at me from under her lids, as I did shake her with
gentleness; and I to know that Mine Own did be a wondrous maiden, full
of all life and spirit, and to be held wisely and to be loosed wisely,
all as did be for the best to bring out the uttermost of her goodness
which did be in all her being, and to be very lovely; and to make me
feel as that I did be a giant that held a white flower very tender; but
I to feel also that I did be her Master. And this mayhap you to
understand, if that you look into your hearts.

And by all my telling, you to know that I did be very dainty with Mine
Own Maid that did be all of daintiness; but yet I to be masterful, as
did be my nature, and a very proper way it did be with the Maid, so that
she did be alway reasonable in the main; and this to come out of her
love, which did have pleasure to know that I did be Master unto her, all
in the same while that she did fight to show that I did be otherwise.
And truly, and in part by this same showing, you shall perceive that her
naughtiness to come likewise from her love, and the way that my nature
did work upon her.

Now I to shake the Maid very gentle, as I have said, and with much that
did be of play, but in the same wise there to be also somewhat of tender
reproof. And surely, that naughty maid to spring very light upon her
toes, and had kist me sudden and dainty upon the mouth, before that I
did wot.

And I to put mine arm about her, and to give her a little hug; and
immediately then to matters that did be practical; for I was eager to
have come across that stony part of the journey, that did be before us,
as you do know, before that we look for a place for our slumber. And
this eagerness of haste to be, because of the great bird things which I
had seen to go bounding over that waste, when that I was upon mine
outward way.

And, surely, after that I had thought a little moment, I bid the Maid
that she dress in her torn garments, so that these should be over the
top of the armour-suit, and thiswise to make a soft thickness upon the
top of the armour-suit, that should act for a cushion between mine
armour and her dear body.

But indeed, the Maid would nowise to do this thing; and I not to make
her, because that my heart perceived how it did be with her. And her
reasons to be someways mixt, as doth be proper in all humans, and the
more so when that it doth be a maid that hath reasons, as you to know,
if that you have ever held such dear perverseness in your arms.

And she, as I could know, to be strangely in love that her gentle body
be bruised by the hardness of mine armour; and if this might not be, she
to be not wishful that she wear her torn clothing upon her neat suit and
so to seem careless and to lack to be dainty in mine eyes; for, indeed,
she did be alway to wash herself and to make tidiness; and she to have a
way now that she did set the armour-suit upon her, that had it to seem
different, and she to have set a little sprig from the trees upon her
breast, and in her girdle, and so to seem the more of a maid; and surely
a man doth know and love these things; but not alway to have full
knowing how that they be done. And, indeed, you to be likewise with me
in this thing. And we all to think we know, but somewise to be just
a-lack when that it doth come to the proof.

And, in verity, the Maid to find a way that she be eased of the hardness
of the armour; and I to have come to the same thing in the same moment;
but truly I do think she had been able to think upon it a long while, if
that she had been so desired.

And truly, this was but that I fold the cloak very thick across mine
arms and breast, and to take her then into the little nest that did be
prepared.

And, surely, now that the Maid might no more have her secret wish that
she lie close against mine armour, she to be helpful, and to have the
cloak folded so in a very quick while; and so to be into mine arms
again; and we to be once more upon the journey, and she to nestle to me,
as that she did hunger to be nigh to me; and she to talk with me, odd
whiles, and odd whiles to be silent.

And once, I to think that she wept a little; and to know that she did be
like to think upon her father and her own Peoples; but she to have her
face turned to me, so that I could but guess upon this thing; and she
very soon to be husht again of this sorrow, and to lie content in mine
arms.

And once, when that I had carried her for three hours, she to ask me
that I kiss her; and truly I did kiss her, very gentle and with
reverence, because that my heart did understand the holiness that did be
in her heart in that moment.

And, surely, as I kist her, she to kiss me very tender; and I to know
that some olden memory did be like to stir in her. And in a moment, she
to take her lips from mine, where she had let them to nestle very light,
and did whisper mine olden love-name; and I then to look at her, and her
eyes to shine as the olden stars that did shine in the olden summers.

And I to be too shaken even that I kiss her. But she to put her arms
about my neck, and to look steadfast into mine eyes. And immediately,
after that she had lookt awhile, and I to have ceased from walking, she
to put her hands upon each side of my face, within the metal of mine
head-gear, where the guards did come down at the sides; and she to kiss
me very sober upon the lips; but yet to mean utter by that kiss. And I
not to return the kiss; for I saw that it did not be her need.

Now, in the beginning of the fourth hour, as I did go with the Maid, I
to see afar off one of the half-bird monsters, that I did see before
upon this place where there did be naught save great stones and boulders
for a great way that did be many miles.

And truly, I to hide very swift with the Maid, where two great boulders
did come together; and surely the bird-creature to go past at no great
way, and to go with a great bounding, that did be half of flight and
half of leaping, as that it did be too weighty in the body to make to
fly proper.

And, indeed, I to have a sudden memory how that there did be a picture
in some book that I did read in the Mighty Pyramid, where it did show
such a bird-thing as this; and to make remark in the book that these
things had been seen no more in the Night Land for a score thousand of
years, or more; and to be extinct, as we do say.

But, indeed, now I do think that they did be come downward to that warm
Country, a great while gone, and so to have new life and to breed
through a great age, and this way to have set a pattern unto the Humans.
And, in verity, it might be that in some age that did be far after that
time, the Humans to find some way to journey from the Pyramid, and to
build a new Refuge in that deep Country; and mayhap the Humans thiswise
to have a new space of life, after that all the Night Land did be dead
and lost in the bitter frost of Eternity. But this, indeed, to be no
more than an odd thought; for how might any great multitude pass the
Monsters; and I to ask that you take it for nothing of fact, but only as
of my suppositions; and thiswise to come back again to happenings.

Now, when the bird-thing did be gone a long way off, I to go forward
again with Mine Own, and to have a new care, and to look very swift and
frequent everyway.

And, truly, it did be as that the creatures did inhabit that part of the
Country; for in an hour after that, I to see a good score. And, I to
free the Diskos from my hip, and to have it ready in mine arms beside
the Maid; and so to journey.

And many times I to have to hide with Mine Own, and to crouch low among
the rocks and the boulders; and this way to escape free of all for a
great while.

Yet, when that the fifth hour did be nigh gone, I heard a noise sudden
to my back, as we did go over a clear space. And, in verity, there did
be one of the monsters that came upward over certain rocks that were to
my rearward; and surely it to have been stayed hid there, or resting,
and to have heard us or to have smelled us; but anywise then to have
knowledge of us, and to come with low and brutish heavy boundings, very
lumbersome, after us.

And I lookt everyway in a moment; but there was nowhere any shelter
anigh. And the Maid to leap sudden from mine arms, that I be free with
the Diskos; and I to look swift to her, and to see that she have her
knife ready in her hand, that she might chance to aid me. But surely I
might not fight in ease of mind, if that Mine Own did be needless in
danger; and I caught her very quick by the waist, and set her upon the
ground between my feet. And she to make half to refuse; but I to have no
time for explaining, and to be sharp that I have her safe; so that I
gave her a little shake that did sudden to make her feel the strength in
me; and she then to be instant quiet in my hands, and to let me that I
set her upon her face, and to cast the thick cloak above her; and in a
moment to be stood over her, and to set down the visor of mine
head-gear, lest that the bird-monster strike me in the face.

And surely, the bird-thing did be scarce an hundred good paces off; and
to make two lumbering and monstrous bounds, and to come at me.

Yet, truly, it made sudden a pause, because that the Diskos did roar and
send out fire, as I made it to spin; but in an instant the great thing
to come in at me upon the left side, and to strike me very hard with the
bill, that did be so long as mine arm, and had surely gone through my
body, if that I had been naked. And the bill of the monster rang upon
mine armour; and it smote me twice thiswise, so that I staggered very
sick and shaken. But in a moment, as it made to draw off, that it should
come the more hard upon me, I swung the Diskos very sure and quick, and
I smote the Bird-thing above the place where the great seeming-leathern
wing did join upon the right side, as it should be the shoulder of the
Bird-monster. And, in verity, the monster gave out a mighty squarking,
and went backward this way and that, and beat all about upon the stones,
and did strike with the great bill at the place where it did be hurt.
And I heeded that I end it swiftly; and I ran in upon it, and the
creature to strike at me with the great bill, very savage. But I jumpt
speedy to this side, and again to that, and so in a moment to have
chance to come in surely. And truly I split the skull of the
Bird-thing, so that it died very quick and was gone from pain.

And the Bird-creature lay all spread upon the stones and the rock of
that place; and surely it did be as that it were leathern, and made
somewise as a bat doth be of this age, in that it did have no feathers.

And, truly, it lookt mighty, where it did be spread; and indeed the body
to be full so big as the body of a young horse; and the bill to be very
deadly and sharp and cumbrous, as you to have guessed. And I to be all
and utter thankful that it did be there, dead, in the stead of mine own
body. And the thing yet to twitch and stir a little, as the life did go
from it.

And surely I was back then very speedy to the Maid, and she to be
kneeled upward to watch me. And I took her into mine arms, and lookt
well about; and made then forward again.

And about the middle part of the sixth hour of crossing that rocky land,
I saw that we did draw near unto the shallow river, that you shall mind
I came over, after that I had done with the olden flying ship. And in
all that time, since the Bird-monster to come after us, I had seen but
two more, and they a great way off, so that I guessed that I was come
beyond that part where they did go very frequent.

And I to wade over the river, and to carry Mine Own upon one arm, the
while that I did sound my way with the staff of the Diskos; and truly I
came across very easy, save that I did have to go around somewhat, where
that the river did seem to have a deep place.

And when that we had crost the river, it did be full one and twenty
hours since that we slumbered, as you shall know, if that you but count
a little; for you do mind that we spent a certain time within the tree,
as I have told; and this not to have been proper counted into the time
of our journeying.

And surely, the Maid to have been very quiet, since that I did show my
strength a little to her, when that I made her to lie, that she be safe
from the bill of the Bird-monster. But she not to be anywise in anger
upon me; but only, as I do think, that the woman in her did be something
fresh waked unto me; and she to be very content that she be quiet in
mine arms.

Now the place that we were come to, was much spread with boulders; but
yet to have the beginnings again of the forests, as you to remember; for
I to have made some small remark of the land in this part, upon mine
outward way. And we lookt about for a fire-hole, that I should dry my
lower garments; and truly, we had not past many in a great while; but we
to be in fortune, that we came soon upon a little fire-hill that did be
no more than so high as a man, and to have the rock all hot about; so
that this did be a good place to our purpose.

And I kist the Maid, and set her down out of mine arms; and when that I
had lookt well about, and seen that there did be naught to our sight to
give us to fear, the Maid to help me with mine armour; and afterward
with my garments, and to ease me all ways that she could think of with
helpfulness. And she set the garments of my lower parts to dry, and
whilst that they did be drying, she to make ready the water and the
tablets, and to have me to sit beside her, in my body-vest and gear, and
we to eat and drink very comfortable in the warm hollow that was
something anigh to the small fire-hill.

Now, truly, I did be very hungry that time, and indeed to be alway so,
for the tablets did be very unfilling to the belly, as you do well know
from my tellings. And when that I did be finished, I saw that the Maid
lookt at me somewise oddways, and sudden she to come into laughter, and
askt me whether that I did be very empty; and in the same moment there
to be a wondrous dear look within her eyes; so that I perceived that
there went a mother-note under her impudence.

And she to yearn, as I could know, that she have some way to feed me;
but truly there did be no way, for we thought not to make to slay aught
for our purpose, and we did be feared that we eat any root or plant,
lest that we be ill. And this to seem strange to my spirit of this our
age, but to be natural unto that; so that I do think I did be so long
bred from the primal obtaining of food, that I did be all lost to that
which should seem natural unto the peoples of this early age of the
world; though we truly to think that the world doth even now be old; and
this to have seemed a true thing unto every age that ever did live.

Now, beside that we did lack somewise to think serious that we slay
something to eat, in that the tablets did actually suffice to our
strength, I to believe that there did be some other reason that I do
forget, and mayhap never to have thought plain upon; but which to be set
within me as an instinct, as we do say; and this to mean, if that I try
to set it in other words, that the tablets did keep the body and the
spirit in such condition that the Forces of Evil did have the less power
to act upon us.

Yet, have I no remembering that I was taught in the preparation that I
eat naught, save the tablets; and this mayhap never to have been set
upon me; but to have been as a thing that doth never need to have been
told; even as you shall not tell a grown man in this Age that he shall
refrain from dung, and eat only wholesome matter.

And truly, I to hope that I have made this thing somewise clear unto
you; for, indeed, it doth be something hard to set out; for every Age
hath the subtleties peculiar to that Age; and these to be hard to the
understanding of other Ages, but yet to seem plain and utter natural,
even without thought, unto the Peoples of the Age.

And surely all this to be plain to you, and to be over-plain; for, in
verity, I tell to you, and over-tell, until that I should be weary; and
mayhap you to be the more so. And, indeed, I not to blame you; but only
to hope that your understanding, which doth mean also in general your
hearts, doth be with me all along my way. And, indeed, this my tale to
be not easy told.

And, in verity, I to be back now unto the Maid a-laugh upon me, and in
the same moment deeply loving and a-lack that she could not feed me, and
I to laugh with her, and to have understanding with her, as you to know;
and, indeed, I to have an heart that doth be made someways natural unto
understanding; so that even though I be dead when you read this, my
tale, you to feel that we be friends, and to know that could I meet with
you in pitiful trouble, I to have understanding and love to you, if that
you be not utter brutish; and even-so, I to be sorrowful that you should
be brutish, and to have understanding, in that I to know that by
developement you to become wise unto sweetness and charity, and in love
with all dear things, and kind pity of the rest. And thiswise you to be
in human sympathy with me, because that you do feel that I be honest
with you, and somewise even now to your elbow, as you read. And this to
be writ now, and you mayhap not to be born a great while yet; but in the
end to read and to have understanding with me, and to know how I did
love Mine Own. And so we to go forward again, the closer, in that we do
be the more knit in dear human sympathy.

And surely the Maid kist me very nice on the lips, and did promise again
how that she should make me a great meal when that we did come to our
Mighty Home; and, indeed, as she to say, she to join with me, and we
both to be naughty gluttons for that once. And, surely, I laughed gently
at the Maid, because that she should be so dainty a glutton; but for my
part, I to feel that I could eat an horse, as we do say in this Age.

And by that we had eat and drunk and talked awhile, and lookt oft about,
so that we know that no brutish thing came near, to our hurt, the Maid
to tell me that my garments did be dry; and she then to give me aid that
I dress very quick; and afterward she to help me with mine armour, the
which she did wipe after that we had eat and drunk; and she to have had
joy that she do this thing, and all things for me; and to have used a
part of her torn garments to this end.

And so, truly, I to be clothed and armed very speedy, and to feel eased
and the more sure in my mind; for in verity, I was alway in unease, when
that I did not be ready that I be able to meet any horrid Brute that
should be like to come upon us.

Now, when that I did be into mine armour again, the Maid to set the
scrip and the pouch upon me, and all the while I scarce to be loosed of
the Diskos, as ever. And we then to our way, which did be that we find a
place proper to our slumber.

And when that we did be gone all-ways, and no cave proper to our sight,
we found a great tree, that did be set off alone, and had a plenty of
branches; but none that did be near to the bottom-part.

And surely, I gave the Maid a lift, and held her up so far as mine arms
did go, so that she might stand upon the palms of my hands, and be
steady against the trunk of the tree; and she thiswise to have a hold
upon a branch, and so to go upward.

And, truly, when that she was safe, I loosed one of the straps from the
pouch and the scrip, and I cast this up to the Maid, and she set it
strong about the branch. And when I had caught the downward end, I went
upward very easy; and afterward took loose the strap; and this way we
did be something safe, as you shall see.

And we climbed upward then, and so came to a part of the tree where the
branches did be very thick together; and we made here a place for our
slumber, and the Maid set the cloak over the branches that did be so
close, and afterward we lay down; but first I set the strap about her
waist, and thence to a branch, and she to refuse sleep until that I be
likewise; so that we did be both very safe from any fall.

And she kist me, and we then to our slumber, and very weary; for it did
be two and twenty hours, by this, since that we had sleep.

Now we had eight hours in which we slept utter; and we both to awake, as
it did seem in the same moment; but truly, I to think that Mine Own did
be wakeful before that time; for, indeed, as she put her arms very
dainty about my neck, that she kiss me, I did have a quick and sudden
knowledge that I had been kist oft in my sleep, and this to have been
but a little while gone. And surely, it did seem to me that Mine Own did
have a sweet and contented Mischief inward of her eyes; but yet she to
be very sedate outward, and to kiss me loving and dear, and then we to
our breakfast, upon the cloak.

And afterward, I climbed to the topmost branches of the tree, and lookt
well over the Country all about; but there was no brutish thing to my
sight in any place, neither near nor far.

And I came down then to the Maid, and told her how that there was
quietness of life all about. And we had our gear together, and went
downward to the earth, and I to help Mine Own, and this way she to be
safe.

Now, as we went forward upon our journeying, I perceived that the Maid
had a wayward air; and truly, I thought that she did have her heart all
set toward naughtiness and mischief; and in the same moment that I was
in this belief, I did know in mine understanding that this did spring
from the workings of my nature upon the nature of Mine Own Maiden.

And Naani to walk, in the first, beside me, and to have no word for me,
because that she did be so filled with the stirrings of her naughtiness,
that did be in the same moment very sweet unto me, and yet to waken all
that did be masterful within me. And she to be that she did know, and
to delight, in her secret heart that she waken that which did be
masterful in me; but yet in the same moment to be strong determined that
she be not mastered by me. And surely this to seem contrarywise in the
words; but to be clear to the heart, if indeed you have ever been loved
by a dear maid of an high spirit.

And above all this, the Maid did be filled with a love for me, that did
beat and dance in all her being; and this in truth to overweigh all; but
yet from this same thing her dainty naughtiness to be born, because, as
I did say, my manhood to stir all her nature up-wise in sweet trouble
that did be half of rebellion, and half that she did ache that she be
close unto me in mine arms.

And, in verity, you to be with me in all these things, if that you have
had the love-days beside a dear and dainty maid, of an high and pure and
natural spirit; so that if you be old these days, even but the light
merriment of a passing maiden to bring a pain of wonderings and golden
memories upon your heart.

And presently, I saw that Mine Own put a little space between us, as the
naughtiness did work in her, as my heart to know; and she to be offward
from me a little. And she still to have no speech with me; but in a
little to begin that she sing in a low voice; and to have her pretty
body very upright and lithesome, and to go forward with a wondrous
dainty swing, so that my heart told me that she did all be stirred with
small thrillings of defiance unto me, and with thrillings of love; and
she to have the triumph of her Maidenhood and of her Womanhood, as it
were both to contend in her and to thrill upon her tongue, and to show
out the lilting and pretty warfare of her spirit that did go dancing and
dearly naughty in her breast.

And surely I went, very lifted in my heart, and astir; for it did be
wondrous to me that this lovely Maid did be so utter mine. And to see
but the way that she set her feet to the earth, and the way that she did
lift them sure and dainty; and the way that her body did be poised, and
the way of her head; and the way of her naughtiness and the sweetness
and the love that did be wrapt in with all, did make me want that I have
her in mine arms.

But yet, I not to do this, because that in the same time that she did so
stir me to love and admirings, she to set somewhat else in me at
variance, so that I did half to feel stern with her, for I perceived
that she had that naughtiness then within her, that she did be like to
have a real intent of impertinence unto me, so that she should be
naughtily outrageous, and to have no heed to my advisings, neither unto
my desires, unless that I set my hand upon her, to _make_ her to obey.

And truly, you that have had dear maids, shall follow mine explainings;
but unto others, I know not whether they shall understand, until they
too have been possessed of One that shall set all their heart adrift,
even as this One that did be Mine Own.

And sudden, I to know that Naani did change from her low singing unto an
olden air that had surely not been heard in all that eternity. And in
verity, for a little while, I not to know why that it did so shake all
my heart; nor what it did be; nor whether that I had truly heard it
before, or only to think so.

And, surely, it did be as that the silence of the olden moonlit world
did steal all about me; and sudden, I to know that the Maid did sing an
olden love-song of the olden world, and to go halting a little as she
sang, because that the words did steal something odd-wise through the
far veils of her memory, even as a song doth come backward out of
dreams.

And I to feel all my blood to seem to tremble in my veins, and my throat
to be troubled, as with vague sobs that did be the ghosts of forgotten
tears. And the dim sorrow that had come so swift and strange upon me, to
be likewise steeped in golden mists of the love that I once did love;
and the glamour to be come all fresh upon me, and I to know in that
moment how much we do forget, even when that we do believe that we have
all memory and all sorrow within our hearts.

And I lookt unto the Maid, something dimly, because of the way that I
did be; and I perceived in a moment that Mine Own did weep as she
walked; but the less with pain than with the strange anguish of Memory,
that doth have in it Tenderness and Sorrow and Love and all that Hath
Been and all that Did Never Be, and all to make a Vale unto the Spirit,
where doth be both a dim greyness and a warm and everlasting light, and
an utter speechlessness, and the low and far music of forgotten songs,
that do come downward over the shadowy mountains that do be builded of
Years and Forgetfulness, and yet made to be seen with the light of that
our Memory, which doth cast so many husht shadows.

And surely, as I did say, the Maid did weep as she went; but not to be
cast down; but rather that she held her head upwise, as that she did
walk in a glory. And the song to come oft-broke, and oddly, and to set
her voice to little human quiverings, as her memory did shake her sweet
spirit unto tears afresh; and she to walk with her pretty head upheld
and as that she did go in a Triumph; and the tears to come down
strangely upon her face, and all her soul to be there, pure and
wondrous, and in the same time both troubled and glad.

And this thing to be very dear and amazing; and she to be as that she
not to know then that she sang; but as that she did be lost in her
thoughts, as we do say, and this to have come sudden upon her, out of
all her upliftedness of spirit, that had been like to make her very open
unto all subtile and subtle powers of thought and inward stirrings, as
you shall think.

And again the song to come full-remembered, and fresh, as that this
Eternity did be but the yesterday of that moment. And Mine Own to be
all in a sweet madness with those half-dreamed memories, and the wonder
and pain of all that no man hath ever said, and that shall be never
said; and of the utter lost years, and all that hath been lost, and all
forgotten greatness and splendour, and the dreadfulness of parting, and
the loveliness of beautiful things that do be hid in the abyss of the
years.

And it did be sudden to my quickened fancy, that there did be low echoes
all about us, of the voices of dear beautiful ones that have died; for
so did memory set a strange and lovely mystery about my spirit in that
moment, that I did be all shaken so much as Mine Own. And I to be as
that I drew my breath anigh to tears, and did be there with Naani amid
the quiet spareness of the trees and the rock of that part of the land;
but yet did be to see half dimly that I stood within a light, even as
the light that doth be the wonder of olden sunsets; and I to be, in the
same time, both _that_ man and _this_ man that now doth write; and to
have beside my spirit but one maid, that I did lack to know whether I
say to her Naani or Mirdath; for though the two that have been Mine Own
did be different-seeming to the eye, there to be but the spirit of one
maid beside me in that moment.

And surely, I did be there, all shaken unto the seeing of visions, as it
did seem; so that the Land about me to have grown half as that it did
lack that it be real unto my sight, because that I lookt inward unto
Lands that did be of Memory. And lo! in a moment this to go; and I to be
in that Country of the Seas, and to look newly unto Naani, and she to go
as I have told; and there to be the lonesome trees and the rocks in all
parts for a great way about.

And sudden, as I lookt at Mine Own, she to come round unto me, and she
held out her arms, and did gaze at me with such a love, as that she were
transfigured, and to need strangely that she be in mine arms; and
surely, I to an holy need that I have her unto me, because that, after
all, there did be no wonder so great as that wonder, that when all did
be said I did have Mine Own, after that all Eternity had nigh past.

And, in verity, we ran each to the other, and did be silent, because
that there was no speech of words by which we could say aught of all
that did be in our hearts. And truly you to be with me in understanding;
for you too, mayhap, to have suffered thiswise of dumbness; even if that
it hath not been so great. But yet to make you to know.

And presently, we grew quiet in the spirit; and Mine Own to come back
again to her joyousness, and to go beside by me, as we made forward.

And presently, Naani to begin that she look at me with dear impudences
again, that did be very sweet unto me; but yet to be like to lead unto
defyings.

And truly, by these things shall you know the spirit of Mine Own Maid;
and there to be none to me that ever did be like her. But, indeed, you
to think thatwise of the maid that you did love; and all the world to be
thinking each these thoughts of one dear maiden that doth be the one
maid in all the round world.

And this to be the lovely niceness of the human heart; and I not to have
any grumble thereat; but yet, surely, you shall say that this Maid that
did be Mine Own, did be very dear and lovely. And, in verity, I to show
my human heart in this thing; for you likewise to want that I think your
Maid to have been just so dear, and the more so. And indeed we ever to
be going these ways; and to have good comradeship of understanding,
because that we have all loved and suffered joy and had utter belief in
a dear One.

And surely a defyingness to come presently into the way that the Maid
did go, and she to walk a little offward from me; and truly I lookt at
her, both with love and yet with somewhat that did be to reprove her
gently, and all in the same moment that she to make my heart stirred
with her sweet naughtiness.

And she to look sudden at me; and to be that she half to intend to run
to kiss me; but also that she be minded in the same moment that she set
herself up impertinently against me. And, in verity, she made me to
harden my nature a little, as manhood doth make a man to do; and this
because of the rebellion that I knew to be in her; and she likewise to
know. But she hid her eyes, when that I shook my head, half with play
and half with earnest; and was then impudent unto me; and gone from that
in a moment to her pretty singing, and her naughty walking apart. But
she no more to sing an olden love-song.

Now, in a while, we past a basin of rock, in a place among the trees;
and there was a warm spring bubbling in the rock, and the basin to be
full of water, very warm and with some smelling of chemistry.

And the Maid told me that she would wash, and I to think it a good place
for that end. And when I had tasted the water, I found that it did seem
smooth and proper for our intent, as that there did be a verity of an
alkali in it.

And truly we washed, and after that I was done, the Maid bid me that I
turn my back; and I to do this, and she to mock me very naughty whilst
that I could not see her, and to seem very quiet; for indeed, I heard no
splashings of water, though I stood off from her a long while, and she
alway to say naughty things unto me, as that she did mind truly to have
me angered; for, indeed, she did have a plain intent that she mock at
me, and to ease not her wit. And surely, after that I had stood a great
while, I askt the Maid when that she did be like to be done; but she to
say that she was nowise ended of her toilets. And I knew very sudden
that she made foolishness upon me also in this matter; and I turned
upon her, and lo! she did be sitting upon a little rock, very sedate,
even as when she had bid me turn from her; and to have made no more
forward, but only to have been there at ease, that she keep me turned
away to please her naughty mood, and all the while have a double liberty
to have impudence upon me.

And, in verity, I did be a little angered; but scarce that I did know
it; for I did love her very great, and was stirred inwardly with her
dearness and that she did look just that-wise that I knew not whether I
to need to kiss her, or to shake her; and truly, how should I know; for
my heart did ache that I have her to mine arms; but my brain to say that
she did go over-far in the joke; and truly you to see that I did not be
unreasonable, neither to be lacking of grace; for indeed I do think that
I was swayed all-ways, because that I saw all the dear way that her
pretty nature did work; and to conceive of her mood and to understand
and be stirred; but yet to shape a little in my manhood unto hardening,
and in my judgement unto sternness.

Yet, truly, I scolded Mine Own with no more than a little jesting, and
did be nice and gentle with her, because she did be so dear, and I to
know just-wise her mood and the cause and working of it.

And I told her that I did love her, and that she hasten now and let us
again to the journey. But, indeed, she only to make a face at me, so
that I did be near like to shake her unto sedateness. And she then to be
both merry, and a rogue, as we do say, and to stop her ears and again to
sing very gleeful; and all so that she might not hear aught that I said.
And surely she lookt a very dainty Rebellious One.

And I went then straightway to her, and took her hands from her ears;
and I kist her pretty ears very gentle that I not to deafen her. And I
kist her lips as she did sing; and afterward shook her, that she be not
such a sweet Torment. But this to have no success that way; for she only
to put out her toes to be kist; for her foot-gear was off from her feet.
And, indeed, I laughed, even as I made to frown; and truly I kist her
pretty toes, and tried then to coax her to go forward something speedy
with her hair, and to be ready to the journey. But she only to sing, and
to refuse to be sedate.

And, in verity, in the end, I caught her up in mine arms, and had her
bundle in my hand, and so went off with her very sudden, with her hair
all loose upon me in a lovely and soft shining, and her feet bare as
they did be.

And this action I made, because that I was grown truly a little stern
with Mine Own; for, indeed, she did half to need that she be whipt unto
properness, as you shall think, that have seen how she did be thiswise
only because that her nature did be stirred strangely, and her Womanhood
and her Maidenhood to be all unto war, and in part to make a rebellion
against me that she did know glad to be her true Master; but yet she to
be thus, even though she did be so glad.

And this to act so that she did be in the same moment both sweet and
wise and yet to show a dainty foolishness and a true naughtiness that
did make me to feel somewhat of a real anger; but yet did have me to
know that all my being did be stirred by her; so that I did think with
one thought that she did be very foolish, and with another that she did
be lovely wayward.

Now, when that I took the Maid up so quick, and made off with her, she
to give a little gasp and to submit to me with a quick humbleness; but
immediately, she to regain her courage, and to be outraged of me. But,
indeed, I took no heed, only that I was like to shake her; and did know
also that her hair did be wondrous pretty upon mine armour. And she soon
to lie very quiet and easy in mine arms, and to be demure.

And I to have a half knowledge of somewhat amiss; but yet to have no
sureness, neither to think much upon this vague feeling.

And when that I had gone a good mile, she to put up her lips to be kist;
and I to kiss her very loving, for she was so dear. And she then to say,
very ordinary like, that I should do wisely now if that I went back for
her foot-gear, which truly I had lacked thought to notice, when that I
did pick up the Maid.

And I saw that she had known this thing all that while, and had made
that mile of carrying all a waste and a foolishness, because of the
naughty rebellion which did be in her. And lo! I set her instant to the
ground; and she gave out a little cry as she saw that I did be gone
somewise hard and stern with her.

And indeed I pulled a small branch from a tree that did be near, to be
for a switch as you shall whip a boy with; and I held her with my left
hand, and in verity I laid the switch thrice very sharp across her
pretty shoulders, that she know all that she did need to know. And she
seeming to be ceased in a moment from her perverseness, and did nestle
very quick unto me, that had whipt her; and did need that she be
wondrous nigh unto me. And, truly, how shall even a young man flog such
an one.

And the Maid to be very husht against mine armour, and to resist that I
look into her face that did be prest so anigh me. But presently, I used
a little and gentle force, and so to look into her face something
sudden. And truly, that One did be smiling very naughty and dainty to
herself; so that I perceived that I had not truly whipt her enough; but
yet I could harden my heart no more at that time; for, in verity, there
doth be a strange half-pain in the bosom, if that you have to flog a
maid that doth be utter thine, and this to the despite that there hath
been--as then--no properness of anger to have for an after
self-reproach.

And surely, I to have done this thing only of a stern intent and
steadfastness, that I steady Mine Own Maid unto wisdom; but yet to have
been helpt by a little anger, because of the thing that she had done.
Yet, alway, my love did be so strong, that mine anger never to have
aught of bitterness, as you shall have seen, and to understand.

And we went back then for the foot-gear of the Maid; and she to be very
husht in mine arms; but yet, as I perceived, not to be quiet, of an
humble little heart, but only of the chance that her nature did be
stirred that way for the while.

And truly, when we were gone back, the foot-gear did be there to the
side of the pool, and the Maid gat shod very speedy, and would have no
aid; and afterward did up her hair very tight upon her head, to have it
utter from my sight; and this to be for a perverseness; for she knew
that I did love to see it pretty upon her shoulders, or if that she must
do it, that she do it up very loose and nice; and truly you to know how
I mean; only that I have no skill of such matters; but yet a good taste
to admirings, if that the thing be aright.

And I to say nothing, as I looked at her; and she presently to make a
quick glance unto me, to see why I did say naught. And I shook my head,
smiling at her waywardness; but she to look away from me, and to seem to
be set to fresh naughtiness.

Now we went forward then upon our journey; and alway the Maid to walk
onward from me; but yet to have no other impudence, neither to sing.

And I to go kindly with her; but yet to think that she did lack somewhat
to know that I did be truly her Master; and I to wonder a little whether
she did know proper that my gentleness with her did be not of weakness,
but born of understanding and love, and the more proof that I did be fit
to possess and to guide her.

And truly this was the thought of a young man, yet lacking not of Reason
in the bottom part, though mayhap to be something clumsy-seeming unto
the mind of a maid; and to be very human to my years; and you to have
been likewise, if that you have tried all-ways with a dear One, and she
to be yet over-wilful, so that you to wonder whether she did truly know
how you did understand.

And surely a maid doth know much that doth be in the heart of a man, if
that she be true woman in her own secret heart. And oft she doth know
more of her man than her man doth wot of himself, and to go her own
diverse ways that she search out and bring forth and waken all that is
the inward being of the man that she doth love.

Yet, when that she have stirred you in the deeps that you scarce to
know, she to be all fearful, and in the same moment to have no fear; and
to be in rebellion, and in the same moment to be most strange humble.
And all to be born of love, and nature in action upon nature.

And more than this how shall I have learning of the heart to tell you;
for, in verity, there doth be much in these few lines, if that you know
to read. And surely you to know, or to learn; but if neither, then have
you gone short of joy and the true inwardness of life.

Now this way I did be, as I have told; and the Maid to be quietly
naughty in perverseness, as also I have set out; yet to have a strict
mind to her duties, and to go now wondrous sedate upon the journey; yet
alway apart. And likewise, when that the sixth hour did come, and we to
our halt, as ever, she to be very speedy and nice that the water and the
tablets be ready for me; but yet to have no word; neither to eat by me;
but again a little apart, and not to share the water, but to make a
brewing to herself, when that I had done.

And likewise, the Maid held not up her tablets to be kist, as alway; but
eat them, quiet and meditative, and with little nibblings, as that she
did ponder upon other matters, or mayhap to be not hungry.

And these things I saw, as we eat and drank in a silence; and I to look
at the Maid, somewise sad in the heart, and something stirred; and I to
say to myself wisely, yet as a young man, that she did not yet be taught
sufficient that I was her master. And this you to perceive.

And she never to seem to look at me; but to be quiet and demure, and to
have her eyelids something down upon her eyes.

Now, presently, as I thought upon the matter, I saw that I do well that
I take no heed of Mine Own; but to let her to come to a natural end of
this naughtiness, that did be, in the same time, both pretty and a
little foolish; so that in half I condemned it and in half I was
stirred; and alway I loved the Maid very dear, and had a good
understanding; and there to be also an interest in my heart at this new
side that she did be showing. And also, she to stir me odd whiles unto
masterfulness; and so you to know pretty well how it did be with me in
the matter.

Now, surely, I found this plan, that I attend not to the Maid, to have
something of success; for I knew presently that she did look upward at
me, slyly, from under her pretty eyelashes; and after, to be demure in a
moment; and this to go forward for a while; yet I to show no heed.

And in a while, I saw that she gave attention to her garments, in the
way of nattiness; and afterward, she took down her hair, and made it up
then very loose and pretty upon her head; so that she did be very
lovely, and to tempt mine eyes that they look alway at her. But, indeed,
I did make as that I had no heed that the Maid did shape her hair
different upon her head.

And she very soon then to speak, and to have the lesser gear together,
and to make that she attract me. But truly, I was very nice with her;
yet to keep her now a little off from me in the spirit; and so to teach
her that-wise, that she was somewhat of a dear naughty maid; but also,
as I do think, I was this way, because that in part I would tease her,
in great love of her prettiness and her makings up to me; and so maybe
even that I make her to be the more defying of me. And this to be as
that I also lacked somewhat of reason; for I did strangely that I think
that she need to be whipt, and in the same time that I go to make her
the more deserving of the same.

Yet, this to be the truth, as I know it; and surely to be the natural
waywardness of love. But yet, there did be also in the backward part of
my wisdom, an intent that I be wise and careful with Mine Own; and I
surely to have no full realisings that I did be like to set her further
unto perverseness than yet she did be.

Now, after that I had shown well that I lacked to heed the Maid, I found
that I did be looking oft at her; and she to be so dear and pretty, and
to be all husht, that truly I could not bear that I be longer silent to
her advancements.

And I ceased then from pretending, and would have had her into mine
arms; but she to be now in sweet dignity, and to keep me off with very
sober graces. And because of this, I to feel someway that I did be
someway in blame; and surely, now that I consider it, I can see that I
was something acted upon, even as had been the Maid; and so we two to
be; and a most human pair, as you to say; and somewhat both a-lack; but
indeed, we did be very wholesome, and in utter love each of the other;
and mayhap both then to perceive something of the sweet foolishness
within us that did be as yeast a-work in us; for I thought that Naani
did smile a little to herself. But, surely, this clear-seeing, to be but
for an odd time; and afterward we each again to earnestness in our way
with the other; but alway, even when we did make to show indifference,
we to be something troubled inwardly with sweet flashings of our
bewildered natures.

Now, though I have shown you that I to know that I did be not utter free
of this most strange and natural foolishness; yet you to perceive that I
tell this only that I have utter truth of all things that did happen;
for, in verity, because that I was something subtly touched this way at
whiles, yet was this no full excusing of the Maid; though, in the same
moment, you to perceive, that there did be only the half of me to think
that she did need to be excused; for, in truth, mine understanding went
alway, in the main, with the workings of her nature; and had a natural
sympathy with her dear whimsies; but also, as you to know, I to be
stirred constant in my manhood by her naughty defyings; and to be
troubled in my Natural Sense, when that her whimsies made her to act
that she be likely to come unto aught of harm.

And surely now you to see all the way of my heart, and to have
understanding in things that do follow. And alway you shall mind that I
did love her utter, and to crave alway that I be a shield unto her;
though truly, there doth be, mayhap, somewhat in me that doth act to
make me a little stern seeming in my love; but yet not oft so; as you do
know, that have gone with me in all my tellings.

Now, we went then upon our journey; and the Maid to be somewhat before
me, and offward to the side, upon my right; and to have no speech with
me, but to make a good pace, and to be very dear and graceful as she
went.

And now we did pass this thing of strangeness, and now that; and these I
did point out to her, and made some telling concerning the same, having
the memory of mine outward way, and how that I did see these things
then, when that I was all in suffering of so lonesome a doubt.

And she to hark alway very intent, and to move her head nice and
intelligent, to show that she heard me; and once I saw that she lookt
sudden at me with a dear light in her eyes; but this to be done in a
moment, and she to be again silent-seeming and in her new perversity of
dignity.

And surely she did seem so utter sweet in this new way of naughtiness;
but yet I did think, odd whiles, that I should like to shake her unto
dear humbleness and her usual way.

And in the twelfth hour, we made halt again, and had our food and our
drink; and the Maid to serve me very clever and quiet, as that I did be
her Lord, and she an husht slave. And I saw that she made a constant and
naughty mock upon me; and truly, as I did half think, she to need that
she be in care that I not treat her sternly, as shall a slave-master,
and to give her that which she did ask for so mute and impudent. But
alway she did stir me mightily to have her to mine arms, and to love her
very dear.

And presently, we did be again to our way; and to be yet silent; so that
I scarce knew whether to have patience with Mine Own, or whether that I
take her and speak seriously with her to cease this play, which did
begin a little to dispirit me somewhat strangely.

And in the end I went over to her, as we did walk, and I put mine arm
about her, and she to yield to me without word, and to hark very quiet
to my speech of reasoning and gentle sayings, and to hide whether she
did be stirred inwardly, or not; though, indeed, my spirit to know that
her spirit did never be afar off from mine in all deep matters; but only
this thing to be to the top, and to set somewhat between us that did be
both a sweetness and a trouble.

And alway, as I talked with the Maid, I saw that she did make naughtily
to act as that I did be a slave-master, and she but a chattel to me; for
she to be husht before me, and neither to yield her slender body willing
to mine arm, nor to resist me; but only to be still, as that she had no
saying in this matter; and as that I was like to beat her at my
pleasure, or to withhold my hand, all as might chance to be my desire.
And this I perceived was the shaping of her actions, so that all her
dumbness and her quiet obedience did be but a way to say this thing to
me; and all to have come from her love of me and that she did be shaken
in her nature by my manhood, and so to be but a new form of her
naughtiness, that did have this change when that I whipt her.

And all this, you to perceive, that have gone with me.

And I saw that she would not cease from this perverseness, but made a
dumb and naughty and hidden mock upon me, very dainty and constant, and
scarce to be truly perceived, save by the inward sense. And truly, I
grew something angered afresh, and to feel that she did need that she be
shaken so stern that she come unto the reality that I did be her man and
natural master; yet alway in love.

And surely I loosed her then, and went off a pace to her side; and we
again to go forward thiswise; yet she soon to have a greater distance
between us, which she made very quiet and natural; but, indeed, I saw
what she did.

Now, about the fourteenth hour of that journeying, I saw before us, in
the far distance, the rock upon which did be the olden flying ship, that
you shall remember. And presently, as we came more nigh, I lookt oft to
Mine Own; and I saw that she did be staring that way, and to be in
wonder; but yet to say naught to me.

And soon, as we came very close, I did want that I tell her about the
ship, and of mine adventuring there, and of the wonder of that olden
ship, set there through Eternity.

But in the first, I hesitated, as you shall think, because of her way;
but truly, my heart knew that her heart did be proper unto me; and,
moreover, I should be small in my nature, if that I let any pettiness
put a silence upon me; though, in verity, if that the Maid had not been
inwardly loving to me, I had been that I had told her no word; and this
to be very natural, whether it be of smallness or not.

And when that we were come beside the great uprising rock, I made halt,
and the Maid to halt with me; and I showed her how that the thing upon
the rock did be an olden flying ship from the Mighty Pyramid. And in the
first, she askt no questions; but did be quiet and but to show with
little noddings that she did be greatly interest.

And I to show to her how that this olden ship did be there mayhap an
hundred thousand years; and to have been there, as it did seem to us
(that were of that age) since the beginnings of the world; though, in
verity, our two spirits did know that the beginnings of That Age, did be
truly the ending of This, as you also to know.

And much I told Mine Own, and afterward concerning the two Humpt Men
that did come after me; and she alway to be silent, until that I spoke
of the fight; but then to come round upon me very swift, and with a dear
light in her eyes; and had askt, before she did wot, whether they did
hurt me.

And surely, this to have been the first thing of her olden sweet
naturalness that she did say for a great while, and I to be so in
delight, that I had her into mine arms, and kist her very loving, all
in a moment, and she to submit with a nice gladness, and to nestle unto
me, and all unwitting that she did be gone from her waywardness.

Yet, in verity, she did be a naughty Maid; for she minded in an instant
that she did forget her pose unto me; and lo, her lips did be no more to
search unto mine, but to be as that they did be kist only of my will,
and she to have no more live nestling unto me, but only to be quiet in
mine arms. And I lookt into her face, and her lids to be down somewhat
over her pretty eyes, and she did look very husht and demure; so that
truly, I knew not whether to shake her or again to kiss her.

But in the end I loost her, and made then that we go forward; yet,
indeed, she did rather stay awhile, to hark further concerning the olden
ship and of mine adventurings; but she did then to mind that she obey as
a slave shall obey; and truly, I did punish her, in that I told her no
more; but went forward at a good pace, and had some natural wonder how
that I deal with such a Maid, if that I spare to shake her.

And surely, I thought then again that I leave her be, and so to have her
presently again to her old and natural way.

Now, in a while, I lifted the Maid into mine arms, that I carry her, as
ever, through the last part of each journey, and so to have her never
over-tired for the morrow. And she for a moment to resist; but instantly
to give unto me, and to lie quiet in mine arms, as that she had no
saying in aught that did be done, but must alway obey. And, indeed, you
to see how dearly perverse she did be.

And I went on then through four hours from that time, and lookt oft upon
every side, and walkt quietly; for truly we were come now into a part of
the Country where I did feel that there might be near some of the Humpt
Men.

But I saw nowhere anything to put me in dread.

And alway as we journeyed, there did seem a great stillness in all the
Country near about; and afar off the low mutter of the Great Fire-Hills,
in this place and that, and a drowse as of life and warmth about us, and
everywhere the air very rich and plentiful.

And presently, when that we did be come down from that high place where
did be set the rock and the olden ship, we came in among the trees that
came very nigh to the shore for a great way; and oft as we did go, there
were clumpings of small fire-hills that did cast fire and noise; and oft
the roaring of monstrous springs a-boil; and then again the smell of the
woods about us, and oft still in odd places the low near sound of a
little fire-hill, that did burn, lonesome, in some clear space of the
woods, in this place and that; and afterward we to be gone onward again
into the dull low mutter that did be in all the air of that Country, and
that did but make a seeming of silence, because that it did be so far
and constant.

Now, about the eighteenth hour I to note that the noise of the Great
Fire-Hills grew more loud; and I saw presently over the trees, afar
upward in the great night and gloom that did lie above, those two mighty
Fire-Hills that I did feel to make the earth tremble, in that part, upon
mine outward way. And surely I have told something of this before; and
you to remember, if that you but think a little moment.

Now, it may appear strange that I speak thiswise of seeing the two Hills
of fire; as that I had perceived them sudden. But, indeed, I had been
long abled to see them both, yet to have had no attention to them,
because that they did be a great way off, and because they did be but
two Hills of fire, in a Country that did be plentiful with such.

And, truly, I not to have said aught about them, only that our path did
take us now by their feet, and I to see them, as it were, newly; and to
have nice ease of heart to perceive how that they did be a wonder unto
the spirit and the brain for all time.

For it did be as that the earth had a constant shaking within miles of
them, and that a monstrous force of nature did be in that place. But yet
there to be no desolation around, as you should think; but in all parts
a wondrous growing of trees and great plants in abundance.

And the trees to grow upward upon the shoulders of the mountain; and
there to be no falling of hot rocks and ash, as you to think; but all
very sweet and wholesome, as that the mighty valley made a chimney to
the mountain, and mayhap to others, so that their waste, if that they
had such, did go free. But, indeed, you shall take no heed of this
explaining, save as an odd thinking that hath come to me, and to be
without foundation. And there to be no surety of the reason to this;
only that there did be no falling of ash in that part, as I do know. Yet
in other parts of that Country the Fire-Hills did make new mountains of
the matter that did come from them; but this not to be alway so; and
there to seem to my knowledge no cause to order why this did not be
constant; save that my guessings to be right, or naught to be blown from
some. But, indeed, I to be sure only of that which did be plain to mine
eyes. And mayhap there to be no mystery in the thing; but a score of
natural explainings, if that I did know, or had patience to think long
enough upon such.

Now when that the eighteenth hour did be proper come, we to be anigh to
the great Hills, and there to seem nowise any danger of falling fire, so
that I sought about for a place for our slumber.

And I found a cave in the side of a big rock; and the cave was dry and
comfortable, and had the mouth about a score feet above the earth. And
when that I had climbed and lookt well into the cave, I gave the Maid an
help, and had her safe into that place; and she then to prepare the
tablets and the water, the while that I brought up a boulder from below,
to set very light balanced in the mouth of the cave. And this I meant
for a signal to fall, if that any creature should climb upward into the
cave, while that we did sleep. And surely, you to know this plan; for I
did it before, as you to have learned.

And the Maid sat near to me, and eat her tablets very quiet and with a
demure naughtiness; but yet to be also in wonder, and to gaze outward at
the Great Fire-Hills, and to be in awe, as I did know.

And I put my half-anger and my play from me, and told her of mine
outward journeying, and how I did go by these same mighty Fire-Hills,
that did seem as mighty torches to light me in my search, and to have
held a new strangeness and wonder over my path.

And she still to be silent, but yet to look at me twice or thrice with a
very dear and loving way; though she did hide her eyes in a moment, when
that she saw that I perceived her.

And soon the Maid spread the cloak for our sleep; and while that she did
this, I lookt well about for any creature that might be anigh; and I had
an especial thought unto the Humpt Men; but, indeed, there was naught
living, unto my sight, and nowhere did I see anything to put me in fear
for our lives.

And truly I had a great viewing from that place; for we did be in an
upward rock that stood in a high part, and the cave to be twenty good
feet aloft, as I have told; so that all made to set us in a lofty place.

And the cave to look toward the two Mountains that did rise upward no
more than twelve good miles off from us, as I do think; and the Country
between to be somewise as a mighty park; for it was spread much about
the feet of the Great Fire-Hills, and did be bare in this place and
that, as that rock did make the earth naked there, or the falling of
some later fire to have wrought thus. And between the bare parts, there
went strange and romantic woods, seen mistily, and in parts the gleaming
of waters, as that hot lakes did be half shown among the broken forests.

And presently the Land did go upward with a monstrous sweep, and was
then in great terraces in the height, and trees to grow very plentiful
upon the mountains, in sundry parts; and so those two Mighty Hills to go
upward to meet the everlasting night; and presently to show strange
uplands that did be seen very wondrous and queer in the light that did
glow from the vast glowing of the fire that did be a crown upon the
hills, that did seem in verity to be that they burned halfway between
that known world, and the lost olden world, that was mayhap two hundred
great miles above in the everlasting night and eternity of darkness.

And I lookt upward for awhile, and was much held by the mighty uplands
that did be on high; yet did lie utter far below the burning crests of
the Mountains, and showed vague and sombre and dreadful seeming, because
that they did be so lost upward, and to have the mystery of the red
shining and of the shadows upon them, and to seem to slope far under the
great fires, but yet to be a place where no life should ever come,
because that they did be so monstrous a way upward beyond the great
shoulders of the Hills, the which did be themselves a huge way up. And
truly, I should give you somewhat of the affecting of those grim and
unknown Uplands, if that I said they did seem to my fancy to be a place
where a sorrowful thing might wander lost forever. But why I to think
this thing, how shall I say; and do tell it to you, only because that it
doth seem to hold in the thought the grimness and utter desolation of
those high and lonesome lands.

And by this, I was done looking, and turned me about, and so did find
that Mine Own did stand silent, and waited that I come to my slumber.
And surely, I lookt at her; but she did have her lids something
downward, when that she saw me turn; and so in the end, I said naught,
but went to my sleep, and had the Diskos very handy, as ever, beside me.

And I then to know that Mine Own did lie down beside me, to my back, as
alway, and this to gladden me, as you shall think; for I perceived
afresh how thin did be the crust of her naughtiness; and I to be alway
stirred and touched in the heart by her loving naturalness, that did
need alway that she be near to me, save when she did play this
naughtiness upon me along the way.

And I saw that she had no mind to be perverse whilst that I did slumber;
but must now be nigh unto me, and quietly loving; though nowise truly
ceased from her naughty acting that I did be as an hard slave master,
because that I had whipt her; yet she to have somewhat a truce with me,
as my heart did know. But, indeed, she not to kiss me good-night upon
the mouth, in her dear usual and sober fashion.

And surely I did lie awhile, and pondered upon the Maid and upon all her
ways; and I perceived that she kist me not, only because that she did
not be able to break utter from her perverseness, that did come from the
stirring of her nature. And truly, I did love her, and was half minded
that I turn about to her, and take her a moment into mine arms; but yet
to abide from this, because that I was set that I wait awhile, and to
bring her to me thiswise, mayhaps.

And presently, I knew that the Maid kist mine armour, very quiet and
shy, because that she must kiss me; yet to be intent that I have no
knowledge of this pretty act. But, indeed, I did know in all my being,
and did be newly tender unto her; yet to say naught, and to wait.

And thus I knew presently that her breathing did go easy, so that I
perceived that she was all content and gone over unto slumber, somewise
as a little child that doth be weary, and doth sleep without care, and
with happy assurance.

And, in verity, did a man ever to have so sweet and gentle a maid, that
did be in the same time so troublous and perverse.

And I to lie yet awhile, and to note the constant tremble and shake of
the rock that did be under us; and this to be alway thus as I did lie,
and to be the more plain, because that I did be quiet in thought. And
this, as I conceived, did come from the earth-shaking that was made by
the inward fire of the world, the which did make a vague trouble in all
that part of the Land.

And then in a little, I was gone over into sleep, and waked not for
seven good hours; and then to hear the fizzing of the water, very brisk
and cheerful, and so to have mine eyes open in a moment, and to know by
my time-keeper or dial, that was somewhat like to a watch of this age,
that I had slumbered through seven good hours. But this to be learned
after that I had lookt to see whether Mine Own did be well, and whether
that the boulder did balance in the mouth-part of the cave.

And surely, there did be nothing in harm; for the boulder was there, as
I did put it; and the Maid a little off from me, and did make ready the
water and the tablets, that we eat before our journeying.

And I rose then, and in the same moment I did know that my mouth had
been kist whilst that I slept; and the knowing to come to me vague, as
that I had been kist in my dreams.

And I lookt over toward the Maid; but she to have her lids something
down upon her eyes, and to seem very demure; so that I saw her
naughtiness was come again upon her. Yet, truly, I could not bear that I
not to have her into mine arms; for, indeed, her perverseness did seem
as that she did the more tempt me unto her. And thus I came to her in a
moment; but she neither to resist me, nor to give herself unto me; but
only to be still in mine arms, and to do no more than submit very quiet.

And because of this, I loost her unkist, and was silent, and a little to
be angered, even whilst that my heart perceived the way of the working
of her heart. Yet truly I ached now that she come back to her dear
natural fashion.

And I eat my tablets and drank some of the water; and the Maid to do
likewise.

And afterward, I lookt well from the mouth of the cave; but did nowhere
see aught to put me in trouble for our safety, though, truly, as
presently I saw, there went an herd of strange creatures afar off in the
Northwestward part, which did be that way of the Country, beyond the
feet of the mountains, toward the In-Land.

Now, when that I was something assured of the safeness of the way, I gat
the Diskos to my hip, and the Maid to have the scrip and the pouch ready
to my back, and her bundle to her hand; and so all to be ready.

And I went downward from the cave, when that I was girt, and gave aid to
Mine Own; and so to be soon upon the journey.

And surely, as we went onward, and I to look about me with
different-seeing eyes from my looking on mine outward way, I to see how
wondrous this part of the Land did be; and how that it did be truly like
a great and wondrous park, that did be made of the skill and labour of
godlike things; and truly this to show my feeling, as I lookt all-ways.
And all that part did be bred of the inward forces of the world, and did
be burned clear in this place, and upheaved in that, and made to an hot
lake in another part; and odd whiles there to go a great steam fountain,
that did whistle a lonely song forever. And anon there to be a small
wood, and again a wood; and oft the quietness of great and strange
trees, that did stand alone. And here, and in that part, a little
fire-hill, that did be surely no greater than an house, and we to pass
seven of these in but three hours. And two to glow very steadfast, and
to make no vigour of burning; but the five others did burn very strong,
and sent out a smoke and ash, and made a small desolation all about
them; and of these five, there did be one that cast stones oft and
again, so that they went upward with a strange loud noise, and fell in
this place and that, all about, so that we came downward more nigh to
the shore, that we be a good way off.

And here, as I do mind, there was a strangeness, in that there did be
many trees that had stones set in the branches; and this to be plainly
the work of the little fire-hill; and I to think it but something new
come, else surely there had been no trees within all that space that it
did throw; but yet, mayhap, I am wrong in this; for all things did seem
that they grew very easy in that Country; and indeed this to be for
surprise to me, only that I saw it with mine own eyes, as we do say.

And alway as we did go, there were signs of inward life and forces; so
that we but to stand quiet to feel that the earth did tremble gently in
many parts.

And presently there sounded for a great while a low and dull booming
sound; and this we found to be from a place amid certain great rocks
toward the mountains; for there came thence a mighty up-spouting of
boiling water, that went so high as an hundred feet, and oft to be
thrice so high, and belched a great steam; and there went up in the jet
of the water, a great rock, that was so big as an house, and did dance
and play in the might of the water, as that it had been no more than a
thing very light and easy. And when that the water fell, as it did oft,
the rock to go downward with the dull booming that we did hear.

And I minded how that I had heard the booming upon mine outward way; but
had been then something more to the shore, so that it had been less
plain to mine ears, as you shall suppose; neither had it been then to my
sight, as now it did be to us because that we were come mayhap the half
of a mile more toward the In-Land of the Country.

And truly, we lookt awhile at this huge great fountain and up-boiling,
and came nearer unto it; but yet to be a large space off, because of
the way that it did throw out a spattering of small stones odd whiles.
And surely the thing did cough and roar in the deep earth, and anon to
gruntle gently and to sob and gurgle; and lo! to come forth in a moment
with a bellow, very hollow and strange, and the great rock to go
spinning upward, and all a-shine in the light from the volcanoes, and
was so round as a monstrous ball, and polished by the fret of the
waters, so that I saw it had surely danced in the great jet through a
weary time.

And anon the jet to cease and to go downward with a great soughing and
thundering of waters, and the dancing rock to fall downward from that
height which did show very huge, now that we did be come so near. And
the rock surely to fall backward into some deep pit, whence came the
waters, and as it fell, there was again the dull booming. But why the
rock brake not, I could not perceive, save that it did alway fall into a
boiling up of waters, and had no hurt from the rock of the place whence
it was come.

And the Maid and I both to have stood a while, that we stare at this
thing; for it did be more strange than I have made you to know; but now
I did make to our journey again, and did think the Maid followed; but
lo! in a moment, when that I lookt, she was to my back, and went toward
the great boiling fountain. Then I stopt very swift, and called to her;
but she did take no heed of me, and went onward very naughty, unto the
danger of the great boil of the Jet, and the constant flying out of the
stones, that you do know.

Now, even as I stood and lookt, the Maid drew nigh to the place where
the water did thunder; and the Jet in that moment to bellow, so that I
knew it came upward again. And I ran then after the Maid, and she to see
me, and began likewise to run from me toward the monstrous fountain; and
surely I did think that I had done well if that I had whipt or beat her
proper before this time; for truly it did be as that her naughtiness had
gone nigh unto somewhat that did be near to a wayward madness, so that
as I did perceive all her nature did surely work in her toward some deed
that should be for regret; and this to come, because that she did be
something pusht from her dear balance by her loving, and by the acting
of my manhood upon her, so that her nature both to be in rebellion
against me and to need me, and all in the same time. And this-way, she
to be in an inward turmoil, and to be ready foolishly that she put in
danger her beloved life, if only thereby she to make me something
adrift, and in the same moment to have some ease of her perverseness.
And, in verity, you to know all this, because that I have shown the
working of her heart to you before this time.

Now, I caught the Maid among the great rocks, which did stand all about;
and before her there did be a monstrous pit whence came the upbursting
of the water; and the water to go upward before our faces in a mighty
column, so that it did be as that a sea shot up on end, into a pillar of
living water, and went upward forever, as it did seem in that moment.
And how we should be saved, I knew not, for the water did be as that it
overhung us, and should come down upon us and smother us in one moment,
forever. And the roar was in our ears and shook all the air of that
place with sound, as of an harsh and dreadful thunder; and there was a
scalding of beaten water, as fine as an haze, all about us.

And I had the Maid in one instant into mine arms, and I ran very swift,
with a fierce running, that I have her away speedy, and so made forlorn
trial that I save her life. And lo! as I went from under that huge and
dreadful overhang of the great waters, there came downward from the
height a great stone that had been cast by the Jet, and it burst upon
the rock to my back, and certain of the flinders did strike and ring
upon mine armour, and made me to stagger as I ran. But I held the Maid
crowded safe against my breast, and she did not be hurt; and truly I was
yet able to run, and did save Mine Own, and brought her out from under
that grim Spouting.

And I put the Maid down then to her feet; and she not to know how near
that she had given us to death, neither of the way that the fragments
did strike me; for she laughed very naughty and gleeful. But truly I
laughed not; for my heart had been nigh husht with terror for her; so
that I did be yet sick in my spirit, and mayhap also something shaken by
the blows that I gat from the broken stone.

And, in verity, I to have meant that I flog her, very sharp, if that
there be no other way that I might bring her to reason; for, in surety,
as you to see, she to be acting so wild as a child, and so unreasoning
as only a Maid-in-love; and I to know that she did have to be brought
back from this way of spirit, even though I have to hurt her pretty
body, that I bring her again to her dear natural wiseness.

Yet, indeed, I could not whip her then, because that she did laugh so
joyous, though with a naughty heart, and did look so wondrous dainty, so
that even her defyings did but seem that which my heart desired. And
you, mayhap, to have been something likewise in the love-days. Yet I
pled and reasoned with her to be a wise maid; but, indeed, she only to
make a gleeful mock of all that I did say.

Now I went forward again, for I was not harmed by the stone, only that I
did be shaked, as you shall think. And the Maid to go offward from me,
and to sing, and did oft dance naughtily as she went. But truly, I did
be silent with her, for I was but human, and did lack that she come to
mine arms, and love me, because that I had pluckt her safe from that
place. And, indeed, this to be but a natural desiring; and you to have
understanding with me, and to know that you also to have this lack and
need, if that you to have done aught for love of your maid, and she to
deny you a word of loving tenderness.

Yet, in verity, I to be even then able to perceive with mine inward
senses, how that the Maid did have a wondrous up-pouring of love for me,
but yet did be so perverse, and the more so, mayhap, because that her
love did so urge her unto loving admittings that I did be her Man. And
she, maybe, to have meant that she be the more humble presently, but yet
to go naughtily awhile more, and not, indeed, to have had the power
within her at that time, to have come unto me, and cast off her
waywardness, and askt that she be in mine arms, as all my heart did
desire.

And so, as I have told, I went silently, and mayhap with a little
dullness, that did be part of anger and part of hurt and part of that
same strange love-foolishness from which the Maid did suffer. And truly,
this doth be very contrary-seeming, only that you have seen my heart;
and all indeed the more human, that it doth be so contrariwise to the
brain-reason; and all to be desired, else did a man be no better than an
ant or a weariful machine.

And this to be truth and wholesomeness as you shall perceive, if that
you look deep enough, and do modify Reason with heart-understanding;
for, in verity, how shall that which we call Reason, bring any to the
full and the great knowledge. And this doth be a power of holy things,
and doth be a child that is born of Love and Reason, and in the one to
hold the two, and to know all things is the gift of this power; so that
no man may walk truly that hath only the first, neither any man do utter
wise that hath only the second.

And surely, I to cease from these thoughts, and to my tellings; and you
to your harkings and dear sympathy.

Now, when the sixth hour did be come, we made a halt and eat and drank,
and afterward went onward again, and so came presently clear of the two
monstrous fire-hills; and their great noise to be presently to our rear,
and likewise that quiet country that did be round their feet, and did
seem so utter husht and strange and doubly so, because of the upward
noise of the mountains, and because of the slow and subtle earth-shaking
that did be so constant, and because of all those things that I have
told.

Now, when we had made halt, the Maid had done her hair very uncomely
upon her head, and had lookt slyly to see whether I did note; but truly,
I took no heed; so that in the end she had it again in a pretty fashion,
and did sing naughtily and with an heart of mischief, as she did shape
it loose and wondrous nice about her head.

And I still to have no word for her; neither to show that I did watch
her with love and somewise a quaint pleasure of her perverseness, even
whilst that I did strive by silence and an aloofness that I bring her to
my side, as she did be in the first days; for truly I did ache that she
be near unto me, and to cease from her waywardness that did put a
distance of spirit between us, as you to perceive.

And so we did go forward again, as I have told, and the Maid did strive
that she make me to give attention to her naughtiness, for she did walk
alway offward from me, and did sing aloud, and truly they did be songs
strange unto me, but yet to be of love, and much as the songs of this
Age; for, truly, there doth be but one song upon all the earth, and she
but to sing it in diverse ways.

And she did oft to make little glancing toward me, and did pout very
pretty; and in a moment come something toward me, as that she did be
humble, and would be forgiven; but all to be in a naughty mockery; so
that, in verity, I lookt not at her, save odd whiles; but did go forward
alway, and made as that I had no heed of her doings.

And surely this did presently to stir her to a new defying and to a
pretty anger; for she did sing other songs of impudence, that she did
fit very clever about me; and this way to have a constant impertinence.

And so we did go, and I never to speak with the Maid, but to wonder when
that she cease, or how long it should be ere that I did run swift to her
and have her into mine arms, that I shake her and kiss her, all as my
heart did desire.

And when that the twelfth hour did be come, we made halt again and eat
and drank; and the Maid to serve me very intent, and hand me the water,
the while that she went down upon her knee, as a slave; but when I would
have laughed gently at her mockings, and taken her into mine arms, she
went from me very sudden and cold, and was afterward silent and did sit
apart from me.

Now I also did be silent, and in the first because that I was a little
pained, and also because that I did be new touched with the
love-foolishness that did trouble Mine Own.

But afterward, I ceased from these feelings, and did be intent to
another matter; for it did seem to my spirit that there was some danger
anigh to us; and I had a thought of the Humpt Men, and lookt well about,
and did beckon the Maid to come nigh, because that the trees did be
plentiful thereabout, to hide any creature.

But Mine Own came not over to me, so that I loosed the Diskos from mine
hip, and went that I be nigh to her. And she made that she saw me not;
but did set the gear together, and had it presently a-ready for the
journey, the while that I did look all-ways among the trees; but indeed
I saw naught.

And when that I had the gear upon me, and the Maid her bundle, we went
forward again; and I to be very wary, and bid the Maid keep close to my
side; but indeed, she would not obey, and went offward among the trees,
so that I was all an-haunted with dread for her, and ran and caught her,
and talkt wisely with her; but indeed she did not hark to me; but did
run off in the moment that I loost her.

And I caught her again, and I took one of the straps from around the
Scrip and the Pouch, and set it about her pretty waist, and the end I
held in my hand, and so had her to obey me in this thing which did be
needful to her safety.

And the Maid to go with me very husht for two great hours, and I alway
to look well about. And in the end of that time, the Maid did begin to
sing impudently, and I did ask her that she be a quiet maid, lest that
she bring danger upon us; but she to be the more impudent.

And lo! as I did strive that I look all-ways, lest any harm did come
upon us, and in the same moment to reason Mine Own from her pretty
folly, she did grow very husht, so that I lookt round upon her in an
instant. And truly, she had cut the strap with her belt-knife, and did
run away very swift among the trees. And surely my heart did slow a
little in my breast, because that there did seem something a-move in the
dark of the shadows, where the trees did grow thick, and the Maid did
run that way in her foolishness and waywardness.

And I ran hard after the Maid, and did call her, not over-loud, lest I
bring somewhat upon her; but she to have no heed, and to run very light
and swift, so that I caught her not for the half of a minute, as it
might be; for she was gone ahead, and I did be a little cumbered with
mine armour.

And lo! when I caught her, I shook her, and pointed inward among the
trees, for it did seem even then to me that something moved there; but
she to struggle in my hand a moment, and afterward to be still, and to
ask with an insolence and a defiance whether that I did mean to flog my
chattel, the which she did call herself in her naughtiness.

And, in verity, ere I did know, she had twist from me, and did run with
a true wickedness straight toward that place where somewhat had seemed
to be a-move. And I ran then with all my strength, and with a fearful
and an anxious heart. And because I put all my strength to the matter, I
caught the Maid in a moment, ere she did be gone any way; and she again
to fight to be gone from me. But I took her into mine arms, very strong,
and I ran outward from that place where the trees made a darkness.

And surely, when I was come again to where the trees did be more spare,
I saw that I was come nigh to that river which I crost on the raft, as
you shall mind; and truly I did be glad, and to feel safe in a moment.
Yet I was firm now to my purpose; for I set the Maid to the earth upon
her feet, and kept my hold very sure upon her; for I did mean that I
whip her, before that her love-foolishness bring her needless unto
death.

And I took the belt from her pretty waist, for it did be but a light
strap, and I whipt her very sharp over her shoulders with the belt. And,
truly, she did make to nestle unto me in a moment, as that other time
when that I whipt her; but I stayed her from this, and I set the belt
thrice more across her shoulders, very sharp, so that she to learn
wisdom at once, and I to be free for ever of this need to pain her,
which did hurt me very strange.

And the Maid to stand very quiet, now that I did keep her from coming
unto me; and her head did be something bent, so that I knew not whether
I did mayhap have flogged her over-hard; for I did be something lacking
in knowledge whether that a maid be very easy hurt.

And I stooped and lookt into her face; and lo! she did be smiling
naughtily, and kist me in a moment very saucy upon the mouth, ere I did
be aware; and afterward, she laughed and made try to make a bitter mock
upon me, and askt when that I should be pleased to cease from whipping
my chattel; for that then she should run away immediately into the wood,
and to trust the Humpt Men that they protect her from me.

And surely, I lookt at her very grave; for I perceived that she did not
truly jest, but made to anger me, and did be half in a strange anger
herself, and something adrift; for she had not been whipt enough, but
only to stir her rebellion utterly. And I saw that if she be not set
right then, ere she leave my hand, she to be like to have some new
foolishness that should take her unto her death, even as she had come
overnear already, as you to know. And this to be because that her nature
did be stirred so that her natural wiseness was all overset, and she to
be that she do aught of unwisdom that should come to her, because of her
pretty love-foolishness, which did now be made the more strong, by
reason of the half-rising of her anger.

And this way, as I have known, I perceived that, for her dear sake, I
should not let my lovingness weaken me in that moment. And, in verity, I
shifted my hand and loosed the fastenings of her garment, so that her
pretty shoulders did be bared. And her face to change sudden, and she
lookt up at me an instant, with a little gasp; so that I knew she did be
all unbroken, as was mine intent; but she did not yet have learned
deeply in her heart, all that I was minded that she to learn; for even
in that moment, she made a sound that showed she did try to mock me; but
truly, she did not know in that instant whether to mock or to weep;
though she did try to suppose that she had yet an heart for mockery.

And I set the belt thrice across her pretty shoulders, where they did be
bared; and surely the blows did be very stern and sharp. And lo! in one
moment Mine Own broke into an utter weeping, so that I took her instant
into mine arms, and did hold her strong and gentle against mine armour.
And she to be as a child in mine arms, and did sob very strange and
bitter, as that she did be all undone in the heart.

And presently she did be quiet in mine arms; though I to feel how she
did yet tremble; and she did cling tight unto me, and her face to be
against mine armour.

And afterward, when that she had ceased to tremble, I kist her, and
surely her mouth did be very humble, and her lids to be downward, and
she to be something pale. And she then to be awhile more in mine arms,
very quiet; and so to come unto her dear self. And lo! presently, she to
want to kiss me of her own accord; and she put up her lips, very sweet
and as a loving maid, that I kiss her. And surely I kist her, with an
humble and a masterful love; and a strange pain to be about my heart, as
you shall suppose; but yet my heart and my reason both to approve mine
action; and the Maid to be but the more mine own, and to have come again
to her dear natural wisdom.

Yet, as you shall know, there to be for a long while a strange and mixed
pain, in my bosom, both dreadful and tender, because that I had been so
stern with Mine Own Maid; so that even while that my heart and my reason
did approve me, my heart to make somewhat of reproach. And this to have
been someways of foolishness; but yet human of our Nature, and an
wholesome trouble to the spirit, if that this troubling be not allowed
to shape our actions to any harmful weakness.

Now, in a while, the Maid did come to composedness, and to be very
gentle and sweetly natural. And she made presently that she would have
me to loose her; and afterward, she turned her back to me, even as a
dear child, that I fasten her garment again upon the shoulders. And she
did be both shy and glad, and humble, and in dainty pride of submission,
and utter Mine Own. And surely, as I did this thing for her, I perceived
that she lookt with a great shyness at the belt which did be yet in my
hand. And when that I had made an end of fastening her garment, she did
nestle unto me for a while, and afterward stood away and made shyly to
show me that I put her belt again about her pretty waist. And I saw that
she did be somewhat a-lack yet that she touch the belt, because that I
had whipt her with it.

And truly you to perceive how her heart did be in this matter; but if
you not to know, then how shall I to tell you; and do but bid you ask
your own maid; though, in verity, she to be like that she but laugh at
you, and leave you so wise as you be now; for the way of the heart of a
maid doth be most hid to the maid, and she but to know the desire, and
to lack the ending. But truly she doth know when that a man shall set
the truth of her heart before her.

Now, when I had buckled the belt very nice again about Mine Own, we went
backward a space, until that we found the bundle, which she had dropt,
when that she ran off from me. And I saw also the portion of the strap,
which she cut; and so all to be found.

And we went then at a good speed toward the river; for I was still
minded regarding the seeming of movement which there had been among the
trees; and very wishful that we have a raft made with haste, so that we
might come to the little island, where I did sleep before, upon the
outward way, as you shall remember. And I thought to have our slumber
again in that place, and to make that day's journeying something short,
because that the island was near, and a good and safe place for our
sleeping.

And I told the Maid concerning the island; and she to be in great
delight and interest, because that it did be one of those halts of mine
outward going, and did be all eager as a child, when that I said we
should truly have need of a raft to come to the island.

And we came downward to the shore of the river, and, indeed, there did
be those two same trees, that had been my raft, there upon the shore of
that place. And I showed these to Mine Own, and truly she did nigh to
weep upon them, because of her dear emotions and love, and did cut a
small branch therefrom, with her belt-knife, and put the branch where
she did put the piece of bark; and this to be for a remembrance and an
after-delight and pondering.

Now we lookt well in all parts, that we find some other small tree that
should be fallen; and the Maid did climb a rock that did be near, with a
flat top, so that she might search out around.

And presently she cried out to me that there did be a tree to our
purpose, and but an hundred paces away; and she to go with me to show
me, and to aid, if need be; but, indeed I carried the tree very easy,
and had it with the others; and afterward, we went about again for
branches, and these I cut from live trees, using the Diskos with care
and wiseness.

And with these branches to be for cross-pieces, and our belts and the
straps for binders, I set the trees together into a raft, and made it
pretty good for our need, and so that no monstrous thing in the river
should have chance to snap upward between the trees at my dear One.

And when the raft was done, I gat it to the water, and the Maid did lend
her strength; for the thing was heavy, as you shall think. And when this
was done, I pushed a sharp branch downward into the shore, and I hookt a
branch of the raft about this mooring, and so did be nigh ready for the
voyage.

But first I did need a pole to push the raft, and did wonder now where
the other did be gone, that I cut upon the outward way; for I had set
the pole with the two trees, as I did mind, having some vague thought
that mayhap I should live to come that way again.

And I had a little strange unease that the pole did be gone; but scarce
to know that I did be troubled, yet to set me to a new haste. And I bid
the Maid put the scrip and the pouch and her bundle secure upon the
raft; and in that time I lookt well about for a sapling tree that should
do my purpose. And I saw that there grew an odd one a little to the side
of the flat-topt rock that the Maid had lookt from; and whilst that I
cut it, the Maid did come to watch, and made pretty chatter in the time
that I trimmed the branches away.

And lo! whilst that I did be part divided in mine attention between her
dear talk and my work and an haste that did be born of that little
unease that was come upon me, my spirit to seem to be aware that there
came a danger anigh to us; and the Maid to have this same knowing; for
she ceased her speech, and lookt at me with somewhat of trouble. And lo!
in that moment, as I balanced the pole in my hands, there came the noise
of a sudden bounding to our backward part, where the trees did grow
something anigh.

And I turned, instant, and lookt; and behold! there did be upon us an
Humpt Man, very lumpish and mighty; and he stretched out his hands, and
ran at me. And I had no time to the Diskos, which did be upon the earth
to my feet; and I smote the Humpt Man with the point of the pole that
did be in my hands, and the point took him very strong and horrid in the
breast, and entered in, so that the Humpt Man gave out a strange
howling, that did be half seeming of an animal and half of an human. And
he clutched at the pole that did so hurt him, and I stoopt very swift
for the Diskos, and had it in a moment. And the Humpt Man tore the pole
out of his breast, and in the same instant I ript him from the head
downward, so that he did be nigh in two halves; for I had no mercy in
mine act, even though my heart did be something sorry.

Now, even as the man died, there did be a sound of running in the wood
before me; and lo! I turned very speedy to the Maid, and she was there
to my back, and had her belt-knife drawn in her hand; for she had it in
her bosom, where she had put it when that I took her belt for the raft.

And I caught the Maid about the waist with my left arm, and was come
with her to the top of the rock in two great houndings. And I set her
there upon the rock, and turned again to the way I came and swung the
Diskos free; for indeed, I had seen that there did come a number of the
Humpt Men among the trees.

And there came running from the wood, mayhaps a great score of the Humpt
Men; so that it did seem to me that we did be going to die; for how
should one stand against so many, and they so quick and strong, as you
shall mind.

Yet, in verity, I had no despair; but did be mixt in the heart with a
great fear for Mine Own, and a strange and exulting gladness that I
should do that day some deed for Mine Own Maid; and truly this to be the
pomp of love and the heart-cry of the barbarian, as you shall say. And
this maybe; but truly I did be proper human, and to make no excuse
because that I was natural; neither have I hid anywheres aught that I
did think and feel.

And whether that you approve or not, if that you condemn me, you to
condemn all Humanity, and to have vain words and vain regrettings; for
these things that be named for faults, do but be the complement of our
virtues, and if that you slay the first, you may chance to wither the
last; for now I speak of things as they be now, and as they did be then;
and nowise of lovely ideals that do live chief in the mind, and so much
in mine as any, as you to know, if that you have gone with me all along
my way.

And surely, I must cease from my thinkings, and go forward with my
telling; for the Humpt Men did come forward at a wondrous quick run, and
did swarm upward on to the rock, as that they did be panthers; and they
made no outcry; but came silent to the killing; and I saw that they did
be something smaller than he that I had but then slain. And, in verity,
I did be all knit in that moment with speed and cleverness; for I split
the heads of three, with but quick turns of my wrist, as I did wield the
Diskos. And I kicked the face of another, in the same time, with my
metal boot, so that he died; for there did be all my strength and all my
skill working then for our salvation.

Now all this to have been done in but a few beats of the heart, as I
might say; and these men to have been in the front of the attacking. Yet
there did be no space to have breath; for there leaped three more of the
Men upon the rock; and one smote me with a great piece of rock that he
carried, so that mine armour did seem as that it crackt, and I to be
driven backward upon the Maid; yet had slain one of the Humpt Men, even
in that moment.

And surely, my dear One caught me in her arms, behind, and steadied me,
so that I fell not; and I slew the Humpt Man with the rock, even in that
moment whilst Mine Own held me, as he came again to strike me. And I
then to be firm again upon my feet, and did spring at the third of the
Humpt Men; and surely there was no room that he should be able to avoid
me, even did that be his intent; and he came at me with a great leap.
And I stood strong, looking clearly to my work; and I swung the Diskos
with both my hands, and the blow took the Humpt Man in the middle part,
and split him, whilst that he did be yet leaping. And in that instant
there reached over the edge of the rock, two of the Humpt Men, and gat
me by the feet; so that I was pulled sudden to my back very hard and
bitter; and this to be done, even whilst that the body of the Humpt Man
did be yet in the air. And the body came forward over me, and did be
utter dead already, and fell down upon the rock beyond me, and rolled
horridly and went over the edge of the rock.

And I did be all shaken and something bemused by the hardness of my
fall; and the hands of the two Humpt Men pluckt me sharp to the edge of
the rock, the while that I did strike vaguely to wound them; but did
only chip the rock, and fortunate that I harmed not the weapon.

And lo! in the moment that they had been like to have me downward to
the earth into their midst, I to make a good stroke, for I cut the
shoulder of one very dreadful, so that he loosed me; and immediately, I
kicked very fierce with my freed foot, and surely I nigh crushed the
hand of that other with my metal boot; and he likewise to cease from
dragging upon me.

And immediately, I knew that Mine Own did be helping me that I get
instant to my feet again; for I was yet something dazed.

And there came then a rush of the Humpt Men up the rock; and truly it
did be a glad thing for our lives that they might come up only upon but
one side; for the other sides did be utter steep and smooth worn; and
this to have been unto our saving, as you shall think.

And I stood up to the rush of the Humpt Men, and did smite hard at them,
with a quick circling of the Diskos, so that the great weapon did glow
and roar. And they gave back from the blaze and the sound of the Diskos;
and surely then I ran in upon them, whilst that they did be something
bewildered; and I gat the foremost man full upon the head, so that he
did be dead before he did know what thing happened. Yet, in verity, this
did be a dread moment to me; for the Humpt Men leaped in at me upon
every side in an instant of time; and I did be struck upon my head-piece
and upon my back and breast with the stones that certain of them did
carry, so that I rockt as I stood, and did near to swoon, and mine
armour to be all dint and bent upon me, and I truly to seem that I had
come to the time of my dying.

And lo! in that moment of time, there did come to my dazed sense a low
and bitter cry of anguish from the Maid; and this to set all my life
aglow in me. And, in verity, there went a strange greyness of fury
before mine eyes, and I then to fight as I did never fight before; and I
did smite as it did seem forever. And the greyness did ease from mine
eyes, and the Maid did have her arms about me as I stood, and the dead
Men to lie heapt upon the rock, and Mine Own to steady me, for I did be
near slain and the blood did go from me, and mine armour was all broke
upon me by the smitings of the sharp stones.

And I lookt something slowly upon Mine Own; and she to know that I would
ask whether that she did be harmed anywise; and she to be very brave
with me, and to tell me that she did be well; and she to be all slain in
the heart, because that I did be so hurt; but truly I had fought a good
fight, and did lack only to know that she come to no harm. Now my wits
did come back into me very soon; but I did be utter weak, and scarce to
stand; so that I did mind only that I get Mine Own safe unto the raft,
and to put off then from the shore.

And I walkt slow to the edge of the rock, and lookt well about, that I
learn whether the Humpt Men did be all gone away; and the Maid did
steady me.

And lo! there came up in that instant the last of the Humpt Men, and
they were five and did creep very stealthy, that they have me in
surprise. And I loost from the Maid, for I saw that I must come upon
them whilst that I had any strength left in my body; and they now to
leap upward unto me, so that I gat the first upon the head, and he to go
backward dead; but truly I did be more weak than I knew; for I swayed
upon the edge of the rock, and sudden I went downward to the earth; and
did be there upon my knees, and my back to the rock.

And, in verity, the Humpt Men did come in upon me very swift; yet did
they give back from the Diskos, which I swung to and fro, so speedy as I
might, for my weakness, which did be so utter that I could nowise come
to my feet to stand.

And Mine Own came down swiftly from the rock, and ran past the Humpt
Men, and I to make that I shout to her to go to the raft; but truly I
had no voice in my body, and did be dumb and weak, and did know that I
should be gone forever from Mine Own in a little moment, and she to have
none to protect her, neither to know the way of our journey, save by
reason.

And behold! Mine Own did shout to the Humpt Men, and I perceived that
she made to draw them after her; for she ran to and fore and did shout
continually. But, indeed, the Humpt Men had no heed of her; but did make
alway to come at me; and surely, in that moment, one of the Humpt Men
reached me, and smote me so shrewd that sure he nigh crackt his
monstrous hand upon mine armour, and did drive me backward upon the
rock, and to make me bleed afresh, so that I was all in a daze and near
swooned away. And the Humpt Man caught at the Diskos; yet, in verity, he
loost it on the instant, for it did burn and shake him very sore; and
immediately, he smote me again, and so made to end me.

And lo! in that moment, the Maid ran right in among the Humpt Men, and
she struck the man that strove with me, and drove her belt-knife once
and again through his arm, very savage and determined. And surely, the
man turned upon her, and he caught her by her garments, and he ript her
two garments utter from her, so that they came away and she did be free.
And behold, mine utter despair for her did give me a new strength, so
that I shouted to her that she run instant to the raft; and I cut the
Humpt Man in twain, and did fall back then into a part swoon against the
rock. And lo! the Maid ran out from the Humpt Men; but they neither to
know whether that they follow her or that they come in upon me; and as
they did pause, she to call to them, and to try that she tempt them from
me toward the wood; for she had no thought of her life, but only that
she free me and save me; and I too weak even to have power to command
her to the raft; and she, truly, to have no heed to such command, even
did I thus to call again. And there I did be, half-gone out from this
life, and lookt at her with eyes that did scarce wot, save as in a
dream.

And lo! the Humpt Men ceased sudden that they heed her; and the three
that did be left came very sly unto me, and with slowness and cunning;
for they wotted not whether I did be dead, or but a-wait for them. And
the Maid perceived that they came not after her; and she let out a great
cry that did be distant-seeming in my dulled ears, and came back, naked,
and running very swift. And she ran by me as death should run, white and
silent and her face set unto despair, and her eyes utter intent. And she
struck her belt-knife into the shoulder of the near Humpt Man; and the
Man howled and turned, and she did leap to the side, and the Humpt Man
ran at her. But lo! she leaped again this way and that, and utter
silent, and so quick as a light doth seem to dance all ways in a moment.
And the two other Men did join with the first, that they catch her; and
behold! she went about, and did run right away among the trees, and the
three Men did come after her, running very lumbersome, yet with a great
speed.

And the Maid had the knife in her hand, and I knew that she did mean to
slay herself presently, when that she could run no more; and in that
moment it seemed that my heart burst; for that I should never more see
Mine Own Maid forever. And there came some power of movement into me,
and I came forward from the rock and fell over upon my face. And I gat
again to my knees, and began that I creep after the Maid, and I did
shout in whispers, for my voice had no more power to call. And the Maid
went from my sight among the trees, as a far white figure, that did run
very swift, and was presently lost utter to my sight; and the Humpt Men
did go after; yet even in my weakness, I perceived that two did go
something clumsy, as that they had been hurt in the fight; and they to
be the rearward of the chasing; but he that the Maid did cut with the
knife was to the fore, and did run very strong; and surely they were all
gone inward of the trees with a dreadful speed, and were lost from me.
And the world did become sudden an Emptyness and a great Horror, and
there was no sound in all the Earth, as it did seem. And I knew that I
was come to my feet, and did run toward the trees, and the Diskos did
trail from mine arm by the hold-buckle; and the ground did be as that it
moved and shifted under me, and I not to feel where I trod, but did only
peer desperate and lost among the trees; and, as I to know now, I heard
my voice calling strangely; and afterward there was a thundering in mine
ears, and I came downward upon my face.

And I did know presently that I was alive, and there to be some dreadful
terror at my heart; and surely I did remember and sickened and gat my
head from the ground. And I lookt among the trees; but there did be
nothing, and everywhere there did be a strange silence and a dimness of
unreal seemings. And I knew that Mine Own was gone from me, and had
surely died. And the earth did be all stained about me with my blood,
and I did be utter glad; for I to need death.

And I swooned again and was lost to my pain; but did live presently to
know.

And there was a little strength come into me, and I gat my head up
somewhat from the ground, and did peer among the trees; and my head did
be too heavy, and my face came against the earth once more. And because
that I could not hold up my head, I rolled my head a little, until that
my cheek did be to the ground, and I to look thiswise, so well as I
might; but there did be nothing; and afterward, I rolled my head again
to the other cheek, and so to stare very weak and desperate, and not
abled to look proper to my front. And lo! there went something among the
trees, and did show white in the gloom of the wood; and did come through
the trees. And I not to believe in the first that I did truly see aught;
and sudden I to know that I saw somewhat. And behold! my heart did bound
in me, so that all my body did waken; for I knew that Mine Own Maid did
run slow and staggering toward me, through the wood. And I did be now
upon my knees and upon my hands, and did begin again to creep and to
bleed; and did make little callings to Mine Own, that had no sounding.

And Mine Own drew nigh, and did rock and stagger, and did strike anon
against the trunks of the trees, as that she did be gone near blind with
her running. And in a moment she saw me, and that I did yet live and did
come unto her; and she made a strange and loving crying unto me, with a
great gladness and with an utter weakness.

And she came running, and was lost with faintness, and did sway this way
and that, stumbling; and she went sudden to the earth, and did be still.

And I crept onward so speedy as I might, and the earth to seem alway as
that it moved from my hands, and to slide; and this-seeming to be of my
weakness; for my hands and my knees went everyway, and my head to be
that it kept nodding forward very stupid to the earth.

And lo! as I came anigh unto the Maid, where she did lie so quiet, I saw
that something moved in the wood, and was running. And truly it did be
an Humpt Man, and came forward very silent and with a quick slyness, as
that he did track the Maid secretly; for he lookt alway to the earth.
And I perceived that he was that one of the Humpt Men which the Maid had
cut with the knife; for the blood did show upon the shoulder and the
breast; and this bleeding mayhap to have slowed the Man; so that Mine
Own did be like to have supposed she had come utter free; yet he to have
found her, by tracking, as I perceived.

And I strave to my feet, that I should come to the Maid, before the
Humpt Man; and surely I gat upright, and went with a strange running,
and did roll, and lo! I fell immediate, ere I was come to her. And the
Humpt Man to run also; and surely it did be a dreadful race; for I went
creeping and did be weak and as that I was of lead. And the Humpt Man
came very swift and brutish; but I came the first to Mine Own Maid. And
I rose up at the Humpt Man, upon my knees, and I swung the Diskos, and
the great weapon did roar in my hands, as that it did know and did live.
And the Humpt Man ran in upon me; but I smote him truly with the Diskos,
and he ran past me, all blundering, and fell and died upon his face, a
little way off.

And lo! my wounds had brake out into a great bleeding, and my head did
roll upon my shoulders. And I lookt down dull, yet with an utter great
love upon Mine Own; and there did be no proper wound upon her; but yet
was she all bruised and knockt and marked with the trees, and where she
did fall in her running. And she did be there, very still and dear, and
I to have brake my heart with love for her, but that I did be so dulled,
as I have told.

And I fought that I should be strong a little while more against my
weakness; and I strove that I set mine ear gently upon her breast, that
I should listen for her heart. But my head did go downward something
clumsy and heavy upon her; and I then to hearken, and surely she did
live and her heart did beat; though, in verity, mine ears did have at
first a thundering; but afterward a quietness in them, that made the
sounding of her pulsing to seem an utter long way off; and very faint it
did be. And surely, in that moment, even as I harked, I was gone over
into a deadness, and had no more knowing; neither to have even a
knowledge that I did be slipt from my senses. And, behold, the Maid did
lie swooning; and I to be there in my broken armour, and my head upon
the breast of Mine Own, and likewise to know naught; and about us the
quietness of that Country, and the far noise of the great Fire-Hills
that did sound through Eternity.




XIV

ON THE ISLAND


Now I came unto my senses, and did be in pain and a great forgetfulness
and bewilderment. And I strove that I rise; but did be held by a strange
force, that did be surely my weakness, as I to know afterward.

And I was upon my back; and a little sound did be near me, as that
something did pant. And I turned my head, very slow, because that I did
so lack of strength. And lo! I saw that the Maid did be anigh to me, and
did be yet naked; and did pant, and pusht hard and desperate with a
great pole, which did be surely that one which I had cut when that the
Humpt Men came upon us. And therewith I remembered all, and perceived
that I did be upon the raft, and the Maid to push the raft along with
the pole.

And, at that, I made a little sound with my mouth; but the Maid not to
hear me; for she did look backward, as I should think to the shore; and
her face did be very set and anxious; and there to be a far noise of
howling, that I knew to be the voices of the Humpt Men; and so to
perceive that the Maid had come unto her senses, and had gat me somewise
to the raft, whilst that I did yet be swoond. And thus to save me ere
the Humpt Men had come. But, in verity, how she did this thing, I never
to learn; neither she to know, but only that her love did give her a
great and desperate strength that she save me, that did be her man.

And afterward, Mine Own Maid did tell me how that she had come into her
senses, and did be there upon the earth, and somewhat did be upon her
breast; and she saw that it was my head which did be heavy upon her, and
I to be surely gone out from this life; for I was so still.

And she came from under me, and did ease me out upon the earth, and her
heart nigh brake, because that I was so be-bled, and my blood to have
stained all that did be near. But when she had gat me restful, she saw
that I did surely live; and a great hope to spring in her heart. And
oft, as she had eased me, she had lookt about, and there did be naught
to the sight, save the body of the Humpt Man anigh, and the others dead
about and upon the flat-topped rock, as you to mind.

And she ran then very speedy to the raft, and brought water from the
river in my headpiece, and she dasht the water upon me; but I to have no
power to come unto my senses. And lo! in that moment, she to know by
some subtile telling of the spirit, that there came some danger anigh;
and she then to make that she save me, or that we die both of us
together. And she strave with me, and did carry and draw me that
weariful way unto the raft. And she gat me on to the raft; and she ran
then for the pole that did be beside the rock; and whilst that she took
the pole, she perceived her torn garments, that did be yet in the hands
of the Humpt Man, even as she had slipt them to escape him. And she
caught the garments very hasty from the hand of the Man, and ran then to
the raft; and she pusht the raft out from the shore, and leaped aboard;
and behold! as she made to use the pole, there came a sound out of the
wood. And there ran from the wood the two Humpt Men that did yet live;
and they to have trackt her, after that she did run from them; and they
ran downward to the shore, very silent and intent upon her; but she to
work with an utter despair, and to have the raft a good way out, ere
they did be come. And surely, they either to have no power of swimming,
or to know that there did be a Dread in the water; for they made not to
come after; but did stand and stare very stupid, and afterward to howl;
and this howling I did hear when that I was come unto myself upon the
raft, as you do know. And by this telling, you to be so wise as I; for
more I know not, save odd things that I did learn afterward, that did
but set my love more holy unto Mine Own Maid; and these to have been but
small matters of love-thoughts that we did have together; and scarce
clear unto my remembering.

And lo! even as I harked unto the howling of the Humpt Men, the sound
did grow more faint and far off; for the Maid worked very desperate with
the pole. And I did feel that I would help her; but yet was so a-lack;
and surely, even as I did mean to rise, I was gone again utter from my
senses; and that dear naked One did pilot me safe and loving unto the
safe harbouring of the little island, that you do mind; and had no
thought unto herself; but only that she save me. And I to be there,
scarce offward from my death, and to have no knowing of aught, and no
more power to help or to be a shield unto Mine Own; but did be only an
helpless man, that had surely died, save for the care of My Beloved.

Yet did I fight a good fight, and have alway a great joy in the
remembering.

Now, I mind nothing very clear after this for a great time; but only of
pain and weariness, and of half wakings and times when I did know
naught, and others when that I did be awake, yet did have no realness,
either in myself or in any land or place; and all to come back strange
and vague; yet with a constant knowing that there went Love about me,
and a great and gentle watchfulness; so that I was eased when that the
black mists of my weakness did uprise about me to swamp me; and I was
made to know hope, when that unknown despairs did live stealthy within
me.

And lo! there came a time when I waked, and did be freed of uncertain
burdenings and peculiar woes and that still haze through which great
achings did come constant upon me. And surely, I was laid very nice upon
somewhat that did be soft, and there went a sweet quietness about me,
and an healthful drowse did grow in my bones.

And slowly I perceived that the Maid did kneel beside me, and did look
upon me with so great a love and gladness that it did be as that I drank
in health and a drowsy joy and peace. And surely, she stoopt and kiss me
with an utter gentle love, upon my mouth, and her tears to go sweet upon
my face; and truly I kist her again, with an utter content.

And she took my head in the comfort of her arm, and gave me somewhat
that I drink; and when I had drunk, she kiss me once again, so light as
that a pretty wind did blow hushed upon my lips. And my head she made
easy; and lo! I was gone over unto sleep, even as she tended me.

And thrice do I mind that this to happen; and at the third time, I knew
that my strength was come something into me again; and I moved my hand a
little, this way and that; and she to know that I did need her to hold
my hand; and she to do this, and I to go into sleep again, even while
that I look sleepy, yet with all my love, into her eyes.

And when I waked for the fourth time, I did whisper that I loved her;
and surely she broke into a sudden weeping, and did hold my hand very
dear against her breast.

And when I waked for the fifth time, I to know how things did be about
me, and that I did lie naked in the cloak, and did be all bandaged about
my body; and the bandages, as I did know afterward, did be from the torn
garments of the Maid.

And I look at the Maid, and knew that she did be drest again, and did be
in the garments that I did give to her, as you to mind; which did be
that one, and the inner, that the Humpt Man tore from her, and which she
had slipt, that she escape from the Man.

And afterward, I found that she had made a very cunning mend of the
garments, whilst that she did sit so utter long beside me to tend me;
for she had gotten threads from her torn garments, and had made needles
from thorns that did grow on the little bushes of the island; and the
thorns did brake oft, and she then to have another, and so to persist an
hundred times. And this way she did be drest very nice and dainty.

And Mine Own Maid perceived how that I lookt with interest at her, and
did mind, very natural, how that I last to have seen her; and she then
to blush gently; and did kiss me, that she have her pretty face
something from mine eyes. And truly, I to wish the more that I be
strong, that I kneel in a glad reverence unto her; for this way did be
my love, and ever so; and you likewise, that have truly loved.

Now I did begin that I grew very steady unto my strength, again, and
Mine Own Maid did tend me alway, and she gave me a broth of tablets and
the water at set times, by the telling of my timepiece. And oft she
washt me and did change the bandages, and did wash and dry the bandages,
that she use them over again; for we did be so lacking for such matters,
as you to know.

And on the fifth day, I was come utter to ease; and did be wondrous
happy, and Mine Own to make pretty talk unto me; but had me to be alway
quiet, because that I did be yet so weak.

And on the sixth day, I to be let answer Mine Own, and to say how great
I did love her, the which mine eyes had said alway, while that I did lie
in silence. And I to be assured by the Maid that she did be in health,
and recovered; but indeed, I saw that she was gone very thin, and that
her eyes did be weary, even while that they had so great a love and a
gladness to me.

And I made Mine Own to bring her tablets by me, as she did alway, and
when that I had kist them, and she to have eat and drunk, I bade her to
make me the broth ready; and when she had made the broth, I askt that
the Diskos be set anigh to me. And afterward, I bid her to my side, and
had her to lie by me; and I took her pretty head upon mine arm, and told
her that she to lie thus and to sleep, and to have no fear that she
weary me; for that I to be but the more rested to have her so, beside
me.

And she in the first to trouble that she be too heavy for mine arm; but
truly, I showed that my strength was something come back to me; for I
prest her gentle unto me, and she then to nestle content, and to be gone
into an utter sleep, and to have been in a sore need of the same.

And Mine Own did sleep for twelve great hours, and had scarce any life
in all that time, save when once she did make a little and gentle
moaning, and did afterward set her pretty face more nigh to me in her
sleep. And surely, I had neither weariness nor lonesomeness; but did lie
with an utter content; and did look downward upon the Maid, where she
did sleep in the hollow of mine arm; and truly she did be most wondrous
lovely and dainty; and the goodness of her face did seem as that it made
an holiness about my heart, so that my spirit was uplift in a quiet and
constant glory of love.

And I drank a part of the broth at the third hour, and at the sixth
hour, and at the ninth hour, when that I finished it; and my right arm
did be free to this purpose and to the Diskos; and surely I did twice
and thrice set my hand upon that great weapon, as to a true comrade;
and, in verity, I could think the weapon did know and did love me. And
this thinking to be because I did be so uplift, as I have told; yet
truly, the Diskos did be a strange and wondrous thing, and did be alway
thought to have an oneness with the man that did use it.

And in the twelfth hour, the Maid awoke sudden, and came upward out of
mine arm, all in a sweet haste, that she know that I did be well; and
she did be eased wondrous, when that she saw how I laughed with a quiet
joy but to see her dear eyes, and her pretty trouble. Yet did she be in
reproach to herself, when that she lookt to find how the hours had past.
But, indeed, I did make a mocking sternness with her; and forbad that
she even to say one little word more upon this matter; but to be glad
that I did be so utter happy, and she likewise.

And truly, when I had said this, that impudent Maid did set her little
fist against my nose, and to threaten me. And, in verity, I laught so
hearty that the Maid did be in fear I should set my wounds again to
bleed, and did reproach herself again; but, in truth, I came to no harm.

And when that I could speak, I askt the Maid whether that there had been
brothers to her, because that she did play so natural. And this I askt,
not thinking; and lo! in a moment I perceived my thoughtlessness; but
said naught, save to take the hand of Mine Own, that she know utter that
I did not be heartless. And she to nod very quiet, and afterward kist my
hand, and slipt from me. And I knew that she was gone a little way off,
lest she weep; and I did be in trouble for her and for mine a-lackness;
but truly I could do naught, only that I called very gentle unto her.

And she to return soon, and did smile loving and cheerful upon me; but,
indeed, I saw that she covered her weeping, whilst that she had made me
new broth. Yet, before I would take the broth, I would have her to mine
arms; and she to submit very glad and happy, but to keep her pretty
weight from me, lest she hurt my woundings.

And afterward, we both to eat, and be happy in glad talk.

And presently, I did sleep; but would have her to be nigh to me, even
though she did be wakeful; and so we to be utter content together.

Now, the seventh day, as it might be called, was a wondrous happy time;
and when I waked, the Maid did be sleeping as a child to my side, and
her face nestled against me. And she to waken in a moment; for thus had
she drowsed and watched through all the hours whilst that I had slept.

And we then to eat and to drink together, after that Mine Own had made
me easy with a gentle washing and care. And I now to be allowed that I
have my tablets whole, and the water afterward, as when that I did be
well; and this to please me, as you shall think; for I did ache that I
be strong very speedy, that I have power to guard Mine Own Maid again,
and to go forward with our journeying, that I have the Maid unto the
safeness of the Mighty Pyramid; and surely, now that I had my tablets
whole, I to feel that I did grow near unto fitness again; and moreover,
they did satisfy my hunger the better than the broth.

And the Maid to give me my tablets oft, so that I eat a great many; and
I did make her to count; and surely there did be sufficient, if that I
get strong pretty quick. And so I made no refusing of the tablets; for I
did need them, that I make blood again within me, else should I be
lacking, when that there came any need anigh.

And we kist each the tablets of the other, and did drink from the same
cup, and did be utter happy; and did be part like children, but also to
be man and maid.

And presently, the Maid did shift my bandages, as alway, and washt me
proper, and had me into comfort. But she did keep me alway very
low-lying; and truly I scarce to mind; for I was not gotten enough of my
strength, to give me to feel irked. And further, as you shall think,
there did be that lovely One with me alway; and did make sweet quips
unto me, and talkt and did laugh, and oft did come into singing; for she
did be so sweetly joyed that I was in life and did mend so proper.

And afterward, she went off from me a little, to her toilet; but I to
ask that she be so swift as might be, and she to promise very merry; and
she came back in a little while, and her hair to be in a lovely cloud
about her shoulders, and her pretty feet yet to be bared from her bath,
which she had in a pool beyond some bushes; and she to say that I did be
so impatient a man, that she to be forced that she do the half of her
dressing with me; but truly, she came thiswise only because she to know
how I did delight in her thus, and to watch the way that she set up her
abundance of hair; and she to be hungry also that she be with me, and to
love me that I watch her, even while that there did be oft a little and
quaint stirring of shyness in her dear heart.

And I had her to come beside me, and to sit anigh to my hand; and I made
presently that I did scold her, because that she had no proper care to
her pretty feet; and I bid her to set her feet toward me, that I look
the more close at them. And she to be a pretty rogue, and did think I to
mean to kiss them--and truly not to think alway wrong--but I then to
have another planning; for I had pluckt a hair very sly from her head,
and she but to have said an Oh! to me, and to have thought no more. But,
indeed, when that she gave her feet to me, I held them so strong as I
might, and I bound her pretty toes together with the hair; and surely
she did be a captive unto me, and we to laugh, as that we to be both
children. And afterward she stole back her feet from me; but, in verity,
I knew that she had a wondrous heed that she brake not the hair that
bound her; but did sit beside me bound in that pretty way; but yet to
hide from me that she did not brake the hair.

And she then to do her hair upon her head, very lovely; and afterward,
I put up my hands, and took it down again; and she then to kiss me and
to ask how that she should ever have it proper upon her head, if that I
did alway so tease her.

And she then to take her hair, and did set the abundance of it upon both
sides of my face, and then to kiss me, as I did look up at her, from out
of so much beauty.

And afterward she cut a lock of my hair, and a lock from her own dear
head; and she did plait the two locks together, so that our hair did
blend and be together; and afterward she hid it in her bosom. But I did
be then out of content, and would have done likewise, only that it did
so weary me to uphold my hands; and she to cut a second lock from my
head, and a second tress of her own most lovely hair; and she made me to
kiss the hair that did be from her, and she then to kiss the hair that
did be from me; and afterward, she did plait them together, and gave
them to me. And I set the hair, for that time, under the great bandage
that went over my heart; and truly, she did be then the one that lackt
content; for she to say that the second plaiting did be kist, and the
first to lack; but I to refuse to exchange; so that we made up a
quarrelling, and did presently have to be kist, unto forgiveness. And,
truly, have you not likewise known such glad foolishness, when that you
were in the love-days.

And she then to make me to be quiet, and to keep my hands downward from
her hair, because that the uplifting did prove overmuch to me; and she
took my great hands then, and did threaten how dreadful she use me, if
that I be not humble. And truly, I said that I did be an humble man; and
she then to hold my hands with but one small one; and surely, her hand
did be so small that she not able to hold me, save by the thumbs. And
she then with her free hand to cover mine eyes, so that I might not see;
and whilst that she did hold me thus so utter helpless, she to kiss me
very dainty and impudent upon the mouth; and afterward she loost me, and
did be demure.

And we did be then silent a space; and presently, I put forth my hand,
that did be very great, yet to be gone white and to tremble, because
that I did lack so utter of blood. And the Maid to know what I did mean,
and she clenched her hands into two fists, and set them both into my one
hand, and surely they did be little fists; and I then to be happy; for
this did be a wondrous pleasure alway unto me; and she to have her lids
a little downward upon her eyes, and to be quietly happy. And, truly,
how I mind it all so plain.

And afterward, I did plague her very gentle that she to be all a-lack,
if that she did try to use her hands to aught, because that they did be
so small. And she in a moment to have her two arms very dear about my
neck, and did kiss me with an utter love and tenderness upon the mouth,
and afterward went from me, lest that she have me to overset myself.

And I did then to make her to sit by me, and I did tell her a tale how
that a young man did once live in the olden days, and did meet with the
One Maid Upon All The Earth. And how that they loved and did be married,
and she to die, and of the utter and desperate madness of grief that
nigh destroyed the man; and how that he sudden to wake into the future
of the world, in a New Time, and did come to learn that His Own did also
to live in that Time. And he then to make that he find her; and did
truly come unto her. And how she did be different in her beauty; but yet
to be utter lovely. And the man did hold an utter reverence to the Maid,
that had been his wife in the olden dream-days, so that his reverence of
love did live in him like a constant pain and anguish of sweetness and
trouble, and of holy thoughts that did be bred of her lovely
companionship, and of his memories.... But, in truth, I gat not further
in the tale than this; for Mine Own did have come sudden into weeping,
and had gotten to her knees, and did hold my hand against her breast,
and did put her hand gentle upon my lips. And, in a moment, she to
whisper somewhat through her tears; and there to be dear Motherhood
within her face; and a sudden shining of Memory in her eyes, that had
been near dreadful, only that it did seem to be to her as that she were
part dreaming. And the strange and solemn pain did come also unto me
through the part-open gateways of my Memory. And I to remember very
clear and with an anguish in that moment. And I told Mine Own how that
the babe had gone onward, after that the Beloved had died. And there did
be then an utter quiet upon us.

And lo! sudden the Maid did bend unto me, and I to take her into mine
arms, out of the vague dreamings of her Memory-dreams. But, ere she did
be come outward entire from the haze of the Past, she to try to set
somewhat into words concerning this memory-vision of the babe; but
someways to be strangely dumb. And I did be silent likewise, because of
all those things that did be between us forever and forever.

And presently, she kist me, and was herself again; and she went from me
to attend unto our food.

Now, that did be truly a lovely day; for I to have gat sufficient of
strength that I did be able to have interest, and talk with Mine Own
Maid; and she now to be well rest, and to have ease in her dear heart
concerning me.

And surely we oft to laugh, and did make jests utter glad and foolish.
And indeed, I do mind how that I askt Mine Own an olden puzzle, that did
come out of the vagueness of my Memory-dreams. And she to be like a
person that doth hear a strange familiar thing; and lo! sudden she to
say, as that she gat knowledge from beyond Eternity, that it did be when
that he was a little hoarse. And you to know the jest, and to have
troubled it oft at school; but, in verity, it did be a strange thing to
have from our Memories out of all the deep of Time. And we, in truth,
never in that Age to have seen or to have known that ever there did be
an Horse, or to mind the likeness of one. And this to be but a little
matter; yet of strange and peculiar interest, as you to agree. And,
indeed, we did both to look one at the other, when that we had ended,
and did wonder what an horse did be; yet in the same time did have a
vague inward knowing.

And so we to look ever backward through dim Ages; and surely we gat
presently from jests, unto solemnness; and the Maid to be nigh again
unto tears. And, in truth, I then to bring our thoughts and our speech
forward from the Abyss of the Years, and did cease from Memory-dreaming
for that time; and so to have the Maid again in joy; yet mayhap
something wistful odd whiles.

And presently, I to tell the Maid an hundred thousand things concerning
the Mighty Pyramid, of which I had so oft said somewhat; but never to
have gat so great a chance as this unto a plenty of time and so nice an
oneness in the way that our minds did go.

And surely, the Maid did be eager in a moment, and did be husht; and
again to ask constant concerning all matters.

And, in verity, there went a great while this way; and the Maid to have
an utter wonder and excitement of all that I to tell; for truly, it did
be as that a man of this age should come downward from a great star in
the heavens, and to tell of wonders and new things; and you to
understand how she did feel.

And of all things that did most have a happiness unto the Maid, I to
perceive that the great Life and Humanness of the Millions to dwell
within her imaginings as a cloud of warmth and quiet joy; for I did show
this thing to her, so well as I was able; and, in truth, you shall tell
me in honesty whether that I have made the same likewise clear-seen unto
you?

And she, as you shall mind, did be a maid that had grown all her life in
a Refuge that did be shaken with hauntings, because that it lackt the
power of the Earth-Current to protect; and with a People that did be
weak-conceived through great thousands of years; and where love did
bloom something faded, even in youth; and youth to have lack of the
life-blood of an utter joy, such as did be ours and likewise to many
that did be of the Mighty Pyramid.

Though, truly, there did go millions then, as now, that did never to
know love; though the name did be in their mouths, and they to have
belief that the sweet kernel did be in their hearts; but, in verity,
THIS to be love, that your life shall bound in you with abundance, and
joy dwell round you, and your spirit to live in a natural holiness with
the Beloved, and your bodies to be a sweet and natural delight that
shall never be lost of a lovely mystery that doth hold a perfect peace
each unto the need of the other; and all to be that there go round
about you a wonder and a splendour all the days and the nights that you
shall be--the Man with the Woman, the Woman with the Man. And Shame to
be unborn, and all things to go natural and wholesome, out of an utter
greatness of understanding; and the Man to be an Hero and a Child before
the Woman; and the Woman to be an Holy Light of the Spirit and an utter
Companion and in the same time a glad Possession unto the Man. And lo!
if one to die, then the soul of the other shall fail; and that one never
to have full life again, in that bitter parting. And this doth be the
true Human Love; and all else that be not like to this with the Man and
with the Woman, doth be but a borrowing of the name of Love for that
quiet desiring, which is but an Endurance beside Love, which doth be
between they that be not mated both in their souls and in their bodies.
And this telling to take no heed to those base joinings that be made for
purposes of wealth or Desire or other piteous ends; for, in verity,
these to have no more dealings with the thing that I do tell upon, than
hath the merchanting of goods, or the _need_ of a glutton. But the thing
that I do have upon my heart doth be that dear and uplifting Power of
Love, which I to set forth in this mine own story; for, in truth, I to
have known love, and to need death when that I be parted from Mine Own.

Now, surely, Mine Own did come twice and thrice unto weeping, as I did
tell of this thing and that, which did set her memory backward unto the
ways of the Lesser Redoubt. And presently, I did cease from my tellings,
because that she did so be gone into pain of her memories. But, indeed,
she then to beg me that I go forward again; for, truly, she to need in
the heart that she know, and to strive to be no more in grief for the
telling.

And I then to say on, and did tell upon the Might and Wonder and great
Olden Delight of the Underground Fields, that were below the Great
Redoubt, as you do know. And I told how that they went downward an
hundred strange miles, that did be dug of the labour of Millions and of
the years of Eternity.

And I set out unto Mine Own concerning that there did be wondrous
villages spread through that great and hidden Country that did be in the
underground; and how that great millions of the Peoples did live there,
and made a constant labour in those deep Lands and Countries, that did
be truly so monstrous in all as an huge Continent.

And I showed Mine Own how that there did be wondrous processes that did
be learned in the Ages; and how that water did be made in chemistry; and
truly she to nod to this, because that she did mind upon the powder that
we did use; but truly the powder to have to be made in the first, as you
shall think; and we but to advantage ourselves of that which did result,
and I to speak to her of the making of the powder, rather than of the
way that it afterward to make chemistry with the air, unto water.

And I told the Maid how that there did be mighty underground pipes that
went across the Night Land, and did be, mayhap, oft so much as twenty
great miles deep in the world, and did come upward into the seas of the
Land; and all to have been made secret and hid from the monsters of the
Land, as I to know from much readings of the Histories.

And Mine Own then to tell me that they did lack to have any such great
wonders below the Lesser Redoubt; but that there did be utter monstrous
caverns, where that there had been alway a strange and uncouth Country
of Husbandry, and lit from the Earth-Current; and they also there to
bury their Dead. And all had been a-lack through great thousands of
years, as she did know of their Records, and had grown dim-lit and
lonesome, and a Land of deepness to starve the spirit with an utter
strangeness and discomfort, where that the men went quietly as ghosts,
through many ages; and all a place in dire want of sound and laughter.

Yet this all to have been surely different a monstrous Age gone, when
that the Earth-Current did be a power in the Lesser Redoubt, and the
Humans to be in plenty, and of good and natural health and courage of
life. And, truly, to mind upon that Place, doth alway to set a fresh
wonder in me, that Mine Own did be so lovely and wholesome of spirit and
wise and in knowledge and good force of her being. But so it did be with
her; and she to have been surely alway That One that did be Mine Own.

And I then to tell Mine Own Maid concerning the lowest Field, which did
be the Country of Silence, and was the Place of Memory unto all the
great Millions, where did linger and bide the ghosts of an hundred
billion griefs and the drifted thoughts of sorrowful hearts; and there
to live a great hallowedness and a mystery of silence and an holiness
and a Greatness, as that it did be the Expressing of all that doth be
Noble and Everlasting that ever did come out of the heart of Man and all
the lost Dead of Eternity; so that the spirit of a man did seem to go on
great wings, unto lovely and splendid resolvings, if that he but to walk
lonely awhile in that Country, that surely did be never lonesome unto
the spirit.

And lo! the Maid did be all husht, as I did speak, and did look downward
unto me with her eyes very bright, and lovely with the thinkings and
tears that did stir within her.

And sudden she to ask whether that I did make my resolve to my journey,
whilst that I walkt in that place; and she to look very intent and
beautiful upon me, as she did question. And, indeed, I saw that she to
mean a lovely praise unto me, as you to perceive; and truly, I did feel
a little strange, as that I did be both glad and shy in the same moment.
And she then to ease me of any answer; for she gat upward upon her
knees, and she put her two hands to the sides of my face, and bid me to
look into her eyes and to know that she loved me with her soul and with
all that did make her to be.

And afterward, she kist me very gentle upon the forehead, and did be
then husht awhile, as that she to be in thought; yet oft she did look
downward at me, and did have a beauty of love and honour within her
eyes, so that they alway to shine, as she did look at me.

And presently, the Maid did sit again beside me, and slipt her two hands
into the one of mine, as did be ever my desire, and she to love that she
give me this delight, and likewise, she to have joy to herself in this
lovingness.

And we then again to have talk; and I did tell Mine Own somewhat of the
History of the Olden World! and she did have dim memories, as in dreams,
of the days of light; yet scarce that she could believe it of truth. But
she to have knowledge of the Olden Love Days within her spirit, and to
mind that there did be alway, as it did be, a lovely and golden light
upon the world; but she not to know truly whether this to be but the
holy glamour-light that Memory doth set about a past loveliness; and to
have no remembering of the Sun; but yet to be made ready by her memories
unto believing. And I to know of certainty; but yet even I that do tell
this My Tale, did but perceive the Days of the Light, as in a far and
vague dream; and to remember it but in the chief by the glory of lost
sunsets that had cast an holiness upon my heart, and of the hush of
Dawns that had made ready my spirit in the Gone Ages to look quietly
unto my death.

And surely you to go with me in all this thing, and to have felt within
your own spirit that uplifted wonder that doth shake the soul with the
lost Beginning and with the unknown End, when that you have lookt
through the sorrow of the Sunset, and stood silent before the Quiet
Voice that doth make promise in the Dawn.

But, in verity, we that had near lost our Memory of the surety of these
great wonders, did have memory of Love; and this to be most beautiful
unto my heart; for it but to show the more how that love doth live
forever, and doth make an holiness in all places; and doth give
Companionship and Satisfying; so that to have love, is to have all, and
to have escaped this Wonder is to have missed to have Lived.

And I to find then that Mine Own did have no knowledge of the way that
the World did be in that Future Age; and did lack to know that there
abode mightily above us in the everlasting night, the dead starkness of
the world, where did be--mayhap two hundred great miles above us--snow
and the eternal desolation of a lost world, that did be once the lovely
world of the olden days, which did be now given over unto Night and
Silence.

And mayhap there did wander upward there Memory, and did go companioned
by Grief. But, indeed, I to delight to think that Hope and Love did
build houses of joy about the Dead; and there to be no true death; but
only the dying of days. Yet, surely, this doth be sorrow enough unto the
heart and the soul, if that they did be days when love did make a
mystery of light about the spirit, and the Beloved to have been anigh to
make ever a sweet wonder unto the heart.

But I to cease from these thoughts; for we to face our life brave and
wise, and to take both the sorrow and the joy unto our developing, and
to hold up the face with courage when that Grief doth come anigh; and to
see that we grow not to bitterness, but unto sweet wholesomeness. And
there to be Joy again, and we then the better abled to have that delight
into our hearts; for how shall Joy ever to come truly again to that
heart which bitterness hath made a place for the abode of sorrow.

And truly, I to cease from these thinkings also; for my story to wait
upon me, and these things that I do say do be plain unto you, and to
have no need to the telling.

And so did I tell Mine Own Maid of the things that I did learn from the
little metal book; and she to be in a constant wonder and delight and
with an awe and newness upon her. And sudden, there did some olden
memory stir within her; for she askt me, in one instant, whether that I
did remember when that the Cities did move alway unto the Westward.

But truly I had no remembering of this thing, and did look at her
awhile, with somewhat of a trouble upon me; for, that there should be
aught lacking in my memory of those times that we did be together upon
this world, was a fear unto me, and a vague sorrow alway, if that I did
but to let my thought go that way; though, indeed, I did ever strive to
wiseness, and did have knowledge that there doth be an heart-wearing and
despair and needless trouble in vain regrets; but yet these to be
natural unto the spirit, if that you to know love; and do be but the
complement of the love-joy, and mayhap to have a use unto the sweetening
of the spirit, if that they be not let to over-ride the reason.

And whilst that I did look unto Mine Own, that she help me to remember,
she did strive with her Memory. But in the end, did fail to come unto
aught of clearness, save that she did see, as in a far dream, yet very
plain, a great metal roadway, set in two lines that went forever unto
the setting Sun; and she then sudden to say that she did see in her
memory the Sun, and she to have a strange and troubled amazement upon
her. And there did be Cities upon the great road; and the houses did be
strange-seeming, and did move forward eternally and at a constant speed;
and behind them the Night did march forever; and they to have an even
pace with the sun, that they live ever in the light, and so to escape
the night which pursued forever, as she did tell, and a dread and
terrible chill that did live in the night. And there did be cities far
forward in the morning Sunshine, that did have gone before at speed, and
set the husbandry of the world, and to be finished and gone forward
again ere that certain of the latter cities did come to that place to
the reaping; and the night to come presently to that place; but this not
to be for some part of a year after that the crops were taken. But how
long this might be, she not to remember.

And all this the Maid did say to me, as out of a strange dream, and I to
have set it down, and to have made it so clear to you as she to have
told it; and surely it doth be plain then that she to speak of a time
when that the day did be grown to a monstrous length, because that the
world did turn but slow and weary.

And it to be a sureness, as you shall perceive, that but to stand still
in that age of which Naani told, was to be left presently in an utter
night and chill, that should last mayhap a great and weary year. And, in
verity, it doth seem that all Humanity did travel forever in that
strange age, when that to stay was to die unprepared in the bitter
night, and to go forward, was to be forever in the sun. And truly, this
doth be so strange seeming to me, as to you.

And much I questioned the Maid, and did have an hurt within my heart,
and a pain of jealousy and sadness to grow in me; for surely she did
speak of some life that she did live, when that I did be elsewhere,
either in Life or Unknowing. And, in verity, what man then should have
taught Mine Own to love him? And she then mayhap to have had no
remembering of me.

And truly I questioned very desperate, and the more so because that I
was yet weak, and lacking my strength to be composed. But she neither to
remember me nor any other man of that time; and to have no memories,
save these bare things that she to have spoken out so strange, and which
did come sudden unto her out of all the deepness of the years and the
lost sorrows and joys and wonders of that which doth make a World of
Humans.

And surely my questionings brought a distress upon Mine Own, both
because that she did be troubled by the way that my love did bring me to
this strange anguish, and because that she also to have pain, and a
sudden fear that there did be ever a time when she not to have known me,
or to have permitted the arms of another.

And she did then strive that she be both wise and strong, and to give
help unto me, and to take reason unto her own easing. And truly she to
show how that she did be all unknowing of any love in that far backward
time; but it to be possible in reason that she to have gone to another,
in natural course, the while that her heart did yearn alway in vague
trouble unto Her Own, that her spirit did mayhap never to have
forgotten. And, truly, this doth be the way of Life, and a bitter thing
and a sorrow to Joyous Love to think upon; yet I here to be set to the
tellings of Truth, and to have heed to all that reason doth show to be.

But Mine Own did also have us both to remember that there did be equal
right to think that she had died Mine Own Maid in that life; for that it
did be not out of reason to think that she had been void-hearted unto
all men, because that she had known in her spirit that she did once to
meet Her Own, and did be thereafter untuned unto all other men that ever
did live. And this all to be in a mist, and we to go vainly. And of her
will, she did think that no man did ever to have possessed her, save I;
yet this to be mayhaps only the prompting of her love; and she then to
kiss me, and to say that there did be no surety in aught, but only that
we did have been together before, and have borne a love so great that it
did live through Eternity; and we to be now together, and maybe all else
to be but dreams.

And truly I did have a fierce hope that this be so; and the Maid
likewise so to hope, yet to be less bitter with rebellion than I, though
in pain upon the thought; for she did be so utter and dreadful glad and
in happy thankfulness that we did be now come together again in the end;
and did mean that she conquer all that should be like to set a greyness
upon our joy, and to be steadfast unto this end.

And I afterward to be likewise in wisdom, when that I was come the more
to strength, and to mind that I suffer vainly for that which did have no
surety, as I have shown; and moreover I did have no power upon the past,
either to learn aught or to mend aught; so that I did go the way of an
Human, and did shake free from these broodings, and strove unto
forgetfulness; which, in truth, doth be both a Terror and a
Mercifulness, as doth chance. And I kist Mine Own Maid, with somewhat
more of the years within my love; and she to kiss me very sober and
dear; and to desire only for my happiness, and to be utter mine own.

Now, we then to eat and to drink, and the Maid to see me unto comfort in
all things, and my bandages all right; and she then to make that she
have on her footgear and her hair to be bound; but indeed I bid her that
she to dare do this thing, when that she to know how I did delight that
her little feet be bare to mine eyes, and her hair most lovely upon her
shoulders; and she to be very happy that I so to have an utter pleasure
in her dear beauties, and did sit beside me again, and set her feet very
sly where they did be anigh to my hand; for she to know that she did be
Mine Own, and I to be her Master, and she to have joy that she to have
to render her beauty unto me; for she did be that true complement unto
me that the heart of a man doth ache for eternally.

And so, presently, did end that lovely day of quiet speech and
togetherness; and the Maid did prepare me for my slumber, and she then
to lie anigh to me, and her head to rest gentle beside me, so that her
pretty face did be near unto my breast upon the right side; and she to
give me at the first a loving and sober kiss that did be somewise to set
a guard upon her tenderness, and afterward did sleep content and gentle,
as that she did be in the same moment a child and a woman.

And I also to come unto slumbering; yet did know vaguely how that Mine
Own did rise a little upon her elbow, this time and that, and look very
loving into my face, that she have assurance of my comfort and
well-being; and once I did waken, proper, and lookt at her, and she then
to kiss me gentle upon mine eyelids, and bid me to sleep; and so did
come herself unto her sweet slumber. Now when that I did come to my
proper wakening, I to hear the fizzing of the water, and to know that
the Maid did be risen a good while, and had made her toilets, as I
perceived in a moment, when that she came unto me; for her hair did be
in a lovely cloud upon her shoulders, all combed and made ready against
my waking; and she to have bathed, as I supposed, in some warm pool that
did be among the bushes upon the island; and she now to slip her
foot-gear, that her feet be bare unto me, as I did love, and to stand a
moment, and her eyes to twinkle gently. And I lookt at her with love and
honour in mine eyes, as you shall know, and she to have dancing of sweet
pleasure in her heart, that I so to look upon her with holiness and with
natural love, and surely the last doth be unnatural if that it do lack
the first; but my love did burn upward out of my being, so that the
flame of my spirit did light the fires of my heart, and my Reason to add
coals unto that fire that hath lived for ever, and doth be as that it
shall be never quenched.

And Mine Own in a moment did kneel beside me, and, truly, someways in
her deep intenseness unto me; for our love did make all the world holy,
and she to be both uplifted and as that she must give all the humbleness
of her heart unto the greatness of my love; and this she to feel, and
her deep and utter love, to make it as that she did be all a passion of
humbleness unto me, so that in her soul I did rise in that moment upon
the wings of my love, and to seem that I did be all the world and all
time and all place and all that ever she did need unto her.

And she put out her arms to me, and her eyes did shine with those tears
that do never be shed; and lo! in a moment, she did be upon my heart,
and we two to be husht together in content; for our need did be in the
other. And truly, where there do be two together with love, there doth
be neither lack nor need; but eternal fulfilment.

And in verity this to be my Hope for that which doth come
Afterward--that all doth be leading unto so glad a joy as this, and that
all pain and grief and all that doth make the shaping of Life, doth be
but a process by which we be eternally perfected from living unto
living, unto each Fulfilment that doth be but the doorway unto greater
Fulfilment in the Beloved.

And, presently, Mine Own Maid did loose herself gentle from me, and
washt me and tended me; and very husht and tender, and something
down-ridded of her dear and lovely eyes.

And we then to eat and to drink together, and joy so great and quiet did
be upon us, that it did be as that we had gone into an eternity of peace
and an utter content. And surely, as the thought did stir in me, it did
be of beauty that we did be both of us true unto the other, in that
life, and I never to have kist a maid, until that I kist Mine Own, and
she to have been likewise, and to have fended all men from her, because
that they did be Strangers unto her inwardness, and so we two to be so
utter together, both in that our spirits did be knit, being each the
complement of the other, and because that we had no secret pains of
remembered things, to set any apartness between our hearts.

And in verity, I to think back then upon my jealousies, that I have
told, and to know that Mine Own did never to have given herself lightly
to any, neither to have taken lightly; and her spirit to have been alway
mine through all the Everlasting; and mayhap this to be how all Peoples
shall come to be in the length of time, only that to us had come the
great wonder that we did early meet; though this also to bring that
utter pain, which doth seem to slay, when that once you have known the
Beloved, and to be parted.

And so I to think, and did presently ponder with a great and strange
pity upon they that did not yet have met the Beloved, and they mayhap
not to have kept all for the Beloved; but to have been light with that
which doth be the Treasure, because that Love had not come to show them
that they did unknowingly squander the strange and holy glory which doth
be the possession of they that shall come to the Beloved and say, All
that is thine have I kept for thee. And the Beloved to know and to have
peace in the remembering. But what doth be the peculiar sorrow of they
that have gone over-lightly, when that they shall meet the Beloved; for
then shall there be a constant and inward regret, as a thorn in the
heart, that they not to have observed alway that holy care of all which
doth pertain unto love; and they nigh to moan in the spirit, _if they
had but known, if they had but known._ Yet, in the end, of their pain,
shall they grow unto all loveliness, if that now they have truly come
upon Love, and to live with Love; for this to be the especial glory of
love, that it doth make unto all Sweetness and Greatness, and doth be a
fire burning all Littleness, so that did all in this world to have met
The Beloved, then did Wantonness be dead, and there to grow Gladness and
Charity, dancing in the years.

And there to be yet one thing upon which, mayhap, I not to have thought
sufficient; for it doth be this, that they who did err, as I have shown,
shall be the greater for their _Pain_; and let this be to cheer you, if
that you have done foolishly, and thought not upon that day when the
Beloved shall come; for Pain is but the voice of Development or
Destruction; and truly you to suffer the first, if that Love doth work
in you; but truly, the more that you have lacked, the greater shall be
your pain; for the more change there doth need be in you.

And so would I have you now to think, and to know that the Beloved shall
come, and so shall you live in glad care of all your being, that you be
able to come unto the Beloved in that day, and to say with beauty and
human joy in your heart, even as I have said; and thus shall you miss
that bitter pain. But yet, truly, you to be like to heed not this, until
that Love doth come upon you; and I therefore to cease from this vain
setting of mine inward reasonings.

But truly, when that day be come, as I have told, you to know how that
there went alway with me in this mine own story which I tell, the
simplicity of Truth; and how that I did be minded only that you to know,
and thereby that you have gentle wisdom that you lay not up pain for
that day. Yet, if you do lack to go with me, you to need that developing
which shall then come upon you.

And so shall you perceive how my thoughts did go to and fro, as I did
eat with Mine Own; and so in the last I to find that I did think very
serious; and I then to cast from me this pondering, and to have that
utter joy which did be upon us, and to seem that it did fill all that
strange Country of Seas.

And lo! after we did be done of eating and drinking, which did be but a
little time, as you shall think, the Maid did ease me to an upward
sitting, and had my back very nice to an olden stump which did be light,
and she to push unto me.

And Mine Own did sit then beside me, so that mine arm did come most
natural about her; and she there to be nestled all gleeful and content,
so that my heart did be doubly tender unto her. And I took the abundance
of her hair, and set it about my neck, and upon my breast, so that it
did near to cover me in the upward part; and we both then to laugh as
that we did be two children, because that Love did make us so utter
young in the heart; and our hands to be hid under the beauty of the
Maid's hair, and I to have her then that she explain just how great she
did love me; and you that go with me, do know how that this doth be a
delight that is never done, neither to be set only into words.

And all that day we did be wondrous happy, save once when we saw that
there were Humpt Men upon the shore, about the Flat-Topt rock where did
be the fight; but what they did there, we not to be able to see, only
that presently they went away; and indeed seemed to have no thought unto
us, neither any knowledge; and so did be gone again into the forests;
and we saw no more of them, after that time. And afterward we to be lost
utter in happiness.

Now, upon the tenth day, I did be so come into health that I to walk a
little way to and fore upon the island; and Mine Own did go with me, and
so I to pace a good while, and afterward to rest again.

And Mine Own then to bring mine armour to me, which she had scoured very
nice; but truly, the Armour did be sore broke and bent, and did be
jagged inward this place and that, with the monstrous strength of the
Humpt Men, when that they did strike me with the great sharp stones.

And, in verity, how I should ever come again to wear this protection, I
to be in doubt. Yet, truly it had been a wondrous suit of strength that
had kept my life within me when that I had been so deadly beset; and I
to know that it to be yet like to save both our lives, if that we could
someway straighten it, and ease the broken jags from wounding me afresh.

And I thought a time, and the Maid with me; and afterward we gat that
stump upon which I had leant, and had this to be for an anvil; and we
found then smooth stones of different sizes, and these to be for
hammers; and we wrought all that day, with restings, upon the armour;
and surely, we beat it into a very good shape, from the inward, and the
broken parts we beat smooth, so that they should not wound, and in the
end to have mine armour fit to go upon me.

And I, by now, as you shall think, to be drest part in my garments; but
not all; for there did be yet some of the bandages upon my body, so that
for the main I did wear the cloak, that the bandages be easily come at.
And all that day did be utter happy, whilst that we workt; for we to be
together.

And on the morrow, as we do say, which was the eleventh wakening upon
the island, the Maid and I to talk long and oft, whilst that we yet
worked upon the armour; and we to ponder the best way that we continue
to our journeying; for, indeed, I was not come to my strength; yet was I
very earnest that we go forward early; but in the same time, I did fear,
lest that we meet with aught of Danger, and I to be a-lack, because that
I was yet weak.

And presently, the Maid and I both to think upon the same thing; for she
to cry out concerning the raft, and I to have the same word in my mouth.
And, in verity, this to be a great thought; for then should we be able
alway to be free of the Humpt Men, and to have frequent rest when that
we be weary, and to sleep with an ease in the mind; and, indeed, I to
hope that the labour of oars should be something less than to go upon
the feet.

And surely, we talkt upon this a good while, and afterward we left the
armour, and went over to the raft, and so to learn whether we should
have power to make it something more stable, and that we have some way
that we should put a solid matter between our bodies and any monster
that should chance to swim under us.

And we went then together over all the little island; for I did search
for some bush that should have a long tendril in plenty, and supple, and
so to suit for binding. But, truly, there did be no such bush in all the
island; and this to put me in trouble, as you shall suppose; yet was
there a sufficient plenty of small and upright trees, that did seem very
good for any purpose of structure.

And when we had gone all about the island, and found naught that should
bind, the Maid to say with a pretty jesting that we should cut her hair,
and plait it to be for cords. And, surely, even as the words did come
from her, they to set me upon the thing that should supply our need; for
I stoopt sudden to the grass that did grow oft and plenty in this place
and that, and was so tall as my thigh, and to my head in the middle of
the dumpings where it did sprout. And lo! it was wondrous tough.

And the Maid to have likewise perceived the thought, almost at that
moment; but I to have been the first this time, and so to tease her; for
truly, we had grown that we did nigh alway to discover all things in the
same instant, as you mayhap to have seen. But I did surely be first this
time, and must kiss her, as we do kiss little ones, that they be eased
in their dismays and disappointments; and she to see how I did mock her,
and she to pretend to weep; and surely how could she even to pretend,
when that she did not be able to keep her pretty mouth from searching
with laughter unto mine; but must be kissed full and plenty in our
constant joyfulness.

And we cut then a good arm-load of the grasses, using the knife, and had
those to our camp; for we did be homely now unto that place, as you
shall think. And the Maid then to show me plaiting, and how that we
could work in the grass piece by piece, so that we should plait unto any
length that we to need.

And all that day we workt, and did be very happy together; but when that
we came to the time of our slumber, the Maid had done twice and thrice
so much as I; and surely she came over to me, and kist me very grave,
that I should be not to fret, even as I did kiss her with gentle mocking
concerning the thought about the grass; and so did she make level with
me, by this impudence and quaint sweetness.

And on the next day, which did be the twelfth, I took the Diskos, and on
that day I cut down six of the trees; and alway the Maid did bring her
plaiting, that she be near me; and when I had cut the six trees, she had
me to cease, lest that I risk to open any wound. And truly they to have
healed very wonderful.

And afterward, we to plait all that day, and did also finish the armour;
and did be content and utter happy.

And on the thirteenth day, I counted the tablets, and found that we yet
to have sufficient, if that we came unto the Mighty Pyramid within any
reasonable time. But I insist that I should eat no more now than did be
my usual way; and though Mine Own did beg and to coax me, and even to
try whether that a naughty and loving anger should do aught to shift me,
I not to alter from my deciding, which was based upon my reason and upon
my intention that Mine Own should never to go in hunger-danger, whilst
that there did be life in my body. And when that the Maid did show this
dear and pretty anger, I to take her into mine arms, and to tell her how
I did reverence and love her, and that she did be all beauty unto me,
and I but to love her the more, because that I did know the reason for
her dear shaping of anger unto me.

And she then to kiss me, and yet to beg again that she have her way in
this thing; but presently I did show her that my reasoning was sound in
this matter; though I said not that my strongest thought did be unto her
own needs. And she to have to agree with me in her brain, even whilst
that her heart did ache to feed me. And truly, I to love her but the
more, as you shall think.

And this way shall you ever to manage a dear and sensible woman that
doth both love you and hath reason in her; for the wise man and he that
hath an heart unto bigness, doth be never hasty to command. But, indeed,
I speak not now of the way that you shall go with a woman that hath the
love-foolishness upon her; for this to be a different matter, as you do
know; and a woman then to require a double wit and tenderness in the
governing; but also to need to be commanded, mayhap with sternness; yet
with the more love.

Now, when that we wakened on our fourteenth day upon the Island, we gat
to work, so soon as we had washt and eat and drunk, and Mine Own to see
how my scars did go.

And I cut seven more trees that day, which made thirteen in all; and
afterward I trimmed the trees very nice. And when this was done, I cut
twelve good sapling-trees, and two more very thin, that I did mean to be
for paddling the raft upon the water. And Mine Own Maid did sit near me
alway, and never to be ceased from her plaiting.

And whilst that the Maid did plait, and make gentle and happy talk with
me, I presently to sit beside her, and had her belt-knife to my need;
and therewith, when I had cut bark from a tree, I made a foot-long
cross-piece of wood which I did fasten with pegs and some lashing unto
the end of one of the paddle-shafts.

And I took then a piece of the bark, so big, mayhap, as would cover my
thigh, and shaped broad one end and thence to a point; and when I had
made holes in the piece of bark, I lasht the broad end to the
crosspiece, and the end that did be narrowed, I lasht secure to the
shaft, and likewise made holes down the length of the bark, and lasht it
also thereby to the shaft, and thiswise I had a pretty good paddle,
that did be about ten feet long in the clear shaft, and the head to be
somewise two feet more, mayhap.

And when this was done, I shaped the handle so small as might come into
the grasp of the Maid, and did jest her very loving and gentle that she
give me so great a work, because that she have her hands so little. And
truly, she presently to stop me of my mocking; for she put her pretty
hands upon my mouth, and I then to have to mumble and to laugh, and so
she to go forward again with the plaiting.

And when I had made the one paddle, I made also the other; but something
more rough and heavy, and suited unto my strength; and so did be very
well pleased; for they did be made more of my Reason than of memory; yet
had I used somewhat of the kind upon the quiet lakes which did be in the
Country of Silence.

And we then to join in the plaiting, and thus with happy talk and our
times of eating, until that we did be come again to our slumber.

And on the fifteenth day, when that we had gotten up and washt and eat
and drank, the Maid did look unto my bandages; and did consider that I
be healed very good, if but that I not to overstrain my body. And we
then to dance, half in play and half in victory, but gentle; and
afterward she to come with me that she give me aid that we get the trees
unto the water.

And in six hours, we rolled the trees down to the shore, and did begin
then that I lash the saplings across the trees, and thiswise to hold
them secure into a raft. And the midmost tree I put something more
forward than the next; and so, until that which did be the front was
shaped somewise like to the bow of a ship. And the saplings to hold the
trees thiswise, when that I had set the lashings about every sapling and
every tree, where the saplings did go across.

And all that day I worked pretty constant and steady, until that Mine
Own had me to cease awhile, lest that I bend overmuch, and so to put
strain upon my scars. And I to be reasonable; but yet to go forward
again with the work; only that I did rest now, this time and that; and
so did all to prosper.

And on the morrow, which did be the sixteenth day upon the island, I
made an end of lashing the saplings across the raft; and I set up also,
two rests for the paddles, so that we might row if we stood upon the
raft; and afterward, being ready, we gat together our gear, and set all
upon the raft.

And I put the pole that the Maid had used, also upon the raft, and
loosed the straps from that first raft, and had the straps for our
requirement, as heretofore. And mine armour we made safe on the raft;
but the Diskos I had to my hip, as ever; and so did we be ready to leave
that little island of refuge, where we had been so near to sorrow, but
yet had come utterly upon joy.

And surely, Mine Own did take me by the arm, and she to stand a little,
and to look with me unto that bed of soft herbage where she had laid me,
when that I did be so nigh unto death; and she then to kiss me very
sweet and loving and gentle, and all a-tremble with the tears and love
that did stir in her; and I to set mine arms about her in love; and so
we to turn and to put off then in the Raft.




XV

PAST THE HOUSE OF SILENCE


Now it was in the tenth hour of that day, that we put off in the raft;
and surely we found the paddles to go very easy and with somewhat of
balance in the rests which I had set up, as you do mind; and the raft to
go forward with not overmuch of labour; so that we stood, the Maid to
the fore paddle and I did be to the hinder one, and we pusht very steady
upon the paddles, and had the raft presently to a speed something less
than we should walk over the rough way of the Land.

And about the twelfth hour we stopt and eat and drunk, and went on again
with our easy labouring; and truly, when that we gat set to the
movement, we scarce to wot that we did aught more than rock something
fore and back upon our feet; and so the hours to pass, and we to have a
constant gentle speech one with the other, and the Maid oft to look back
unto me with love, and to set her lips that she tempt me; but yet to
shake her head most dear, when that I would leave my paddle, that I go
forward unto her.

And when that the eighteenth hour of that day was come, we to draw
inward our paddles, and the Maid set the cloak very nice to be our bed,
and afterward we eat and drank, and so presently to our slumber, and did
have sleep, very sound and happy, all in a moment, as it to seem.

And eight good hours after, we did waken both of us, together; and lo!
we scarce to mind where we did be for a little moment; but afterward to
know and to perceive that we did be safe and naught to have come unto
us in our sleep. And surely we laught each in the face of the other; for
we did be so joyous to be wakened each unto the knowledge of the other.
And after that we had kist, we washt somewhat in the water of the sea,
and so to our food. And when we had eat and drunk, we made again to the
paddling; and went forward thus along the coast very peaceful and
content all that day.

Now, in all, that voyaging did talk four good days of four-and-twenty
hours each, for we made no great haste or labour, but went easy, that I
have time to gather my strength. And naught to happen in all that time,
save that once we did see a great beast to come upward lumbersome out of
the sea on to the shore, and there did eat and browse upon the herbage
in that part; or so it did seem to us; though, truly, we did be over far
off to have surety.

And this beast not to put us into any horror; but only to make us glad
that we be afar off from it; and by this saying, I to mean that it did
seem unto us a natural thing; and nowise to have an odour of aught
monstrous to trouble our spirits. And this way did be all the creatures
of that Country; and truly I do think the Early World did be somewise
like to it; and this to seem to make true that olden saying that extreme
things do meet, as doth be over-apparent; for thus doth it be somewise
to our knowings, as you shall perceive by your Reasonings Upon Olden
Days, and by the showings of this Mine Own Story, for that Deep World to
have put forth natural creatures that did be even as might be those that
did live in the Beginning; though I to make no point of this, but only
that it doth occur to my thought; and all to seem that it did be bred of
Circumstance and Condition; yet this to have no saying whether that
there to be a spiritual-force something deeper than the Circumstance;
for this to be outside of any surety, but not offensive unto my Reason.

But this thinking also neither to offend me, that although much--and
mayhap all--doth be modified and shapen diverse ways by the Circumstance
and the Condition, yet doth there be an inward force that doth be
peculiar each unto each; though, mayhap, to be mixt and made monstrous
or diverse by foul or foolish breeding--as you to have knowledge of in
the bodies of those dread Monsters that did be both Man and Beast. Yet,
also, I here to say that maybe all diverse breeding not to be monstrous;
but this to be beside my point. For I to be now set to tell, as I have
told, that it not to offend me to suppose that there to be this inward
force peculiar to each shaping of all bodies that do hold that wondrous
quality of Life. And if that you ask me that I give example to make
clear my thought, I to say that it doth be reasonable to suppose that
the Force or Spirit of the Human doth be peculiar to the Human, whether
that it to be a Cause of Life, or the Result of that which hath been
evolved out of a Condition. And whether it to be the one way or the
other, you to know that where this Force or Spirit be found untainted,
there is man; and I to be not opposed to think that Man doth be constant
alway in matters of fundament, and neither to have been ever truly
different; though something modified in the body and surely, in the
first, all undeveloped in the lovely things of the spirit, because that
there to be no call to these. Yet, presently, they likewise to come, and
to act upon the flesh with refinings; and likewise, mayhap, there to be
some act of the flesh upon the spirit; and so to the state of this Age
of this our day, and to that far Age of which I do tell. But development
never to make the Human other than the Human; for the development to
have limits peculiar to the Human. And surely, it doth appeal to me,
that the development of Man doth lie between two points, that be not
wondrous wide apart; and Man to have power that he arrive very speedy
from one unto the other, and likewise that he go back so quick, or even
the more hasty. Yet, even did it be ever proved that Man once to be a
fish, I to have no cause to abate the first part of mine argument; but
to have the more need of the thought, that I gain power to accept the
Fact; for I still then to have no occasion that I think Man to have been
truly a Fish, or aught truly different from a Man; but only that he did
be once Modified physically to his need, and to be still possessed of
the Man-Spirit, though all lackt of development. Yet, truly, I to be
less offend in my Reason, if that it be shown that Man did be ever
somewise in his present shape, though mayhap so brutish as the Humpt
Men; but yet I do be ready to consider all matters, and do build no
Walls about my Reason. Yet, neither I to have an over-ready acceptance
of aught, but to need that my Reason shall approve.

And you to perceive, surely, that I here not to speak of that which may
be Afterward, when that all This, our life, be done. For who shall say
how much or how little we then to go forward unto loveliness; and I at
this point to tell you that I do have a wondrous hope of beauteous
things, and of sweet and mighty Uplifting and Furtherance unto that Glad
World which we have beheld the shores of, when that we had stood in
holiness with the Beloved.

And, in verity, I now once more to my story; and to be glad that I am
done at this small setting forth of a matter which did need words,
because that it did have root in this Mine Own Story, and to be grown of
it and from it.

Now, there did be one other thing of note, beside the Sea Beast, whilst
that we did be upon the Seas; and this did be the strangeness of a great
Fire-Hill which did stand in the sea, and we to pass very nigh unto it.
And surely the sea did boil about it, yet not in all places; and there
did be a score great jets that did go upward a monstrous way, and did
roar very plain to us across the sea between; and there did come strange
gruntings from the sea about the base of the Fire-Hill, and these I to
conceive to be made by the upbursting of gases in this place and that;
and surely, it all to make us to know of the great energy that did be
wakeful in that deep Country; and we yet to stare backward upon that
Hill of Fire and Force, for a great while after that we had come past.

Now, beyond this, there to be naught, except that we had a certain care
as we did come to that place where the Great Sea did be broke to smaller
seas; but all to be knit with passages of water, which let us through
upon our way.

And surely, I did show Mine Own Maid those two places where I did sleep
when first I was come into that Country; and she to be sweet in
interest, and alway to have somewhat that she would learn of this and
that.

And so, when that we did be four good days upon the water, as I have
told, we to come to the land, upon a flat place of the shore, where the
Country did slope upward unto the mouth of the First Gorge, of which you
do mind. And this to be in the tenth hour of that day; and we likewise
to have begun that voyage in the tenth hour, as you do remember; and
surely it to have been a sweet and peaceful water-journey; and I to have
been happy, if that all that did be yet before us, to hold so much of
pleasantness and safe goings. But, indeed, there to be much danger yet
to come, as you do know; and we to have our hearts set in courage, and
to go forward to conquer; for surely, if that we to conquer, and to come
safe into our Mighty Home, there to be then that we have all our lives
together in loveliness; and this to be truly a worthy prize and a glory
of the heart, to end and to repay our Stress.

And surely, the Maid and I did presently strand the raft, so well as we
might, and did then to wonder whether any should evermore to behold it
through all Eternity. And we lookt a little, each at the other; and the
Maid then to cut free a small piece of the wood of the raft, to be for
an after remembrance.

And so we to have our gear upon the shore; and the Maid then to give me
aid that I get once more into mine armour; and so I presently to have
the Scrip and the Pouch again to my back, and the Diskos in my hand, and
all in readiness, and the Maid with her bundle (that was now grown
small), and her belt about her body, that she have her knife unto her
hand.

And surely, the Maid then to kneel and to kiss the raft; for memories
did gather upon her; and she there to have one more breaking from all
that did be the first part of her life; and you to give your
understanding, and so to have a quiet sympathy, and to perceive that her
heart did be like that it should stir with a strange trouble of
sorrowing in that moment.

And surely I stoopt then, very gentle and loving, and had Mine Own to
her feet; and I led her from the raft, and she to need that she be near
me; and so we to go forward, and to make upward unto the dark mouth of
the Great Gorge.

And there to be some miles unto our right, that grim and utter huge
Mountain, whereon afar upward in the monstrousness of the night did be
perched those four fire-hills of which I have told. And below them,
there to go upward the great hills of ash, that had been cast down
throughout Eternity. And this thing had the Maid lookt upon for a great
time, and did be never done of her wonder; neither I, nor any human that
ever should have sight of so great a wonder.

And so we to have come presently upward into the high mouth of the
Gorge, and did go onward then into the gloom, a little space, until that
we were come to the place where the Gorge did bend sharp unto the left,
into darkness.

And lo! we made pause here, and turned again unto the Country of Seas,
that we have a last outward look over all that Deep and living Land,
that did be hid so far downward in the everlasting night of the world.

And, in verity, it did be a solemn thing to know that we, mayhap, to be
the last of the olden Humans that should ever to look upon that Country;
and I to wonder, in that moment, whether that the Humpt Men should ever
to develop, in some far eternity, unto the full sweetness of the spirit
of Humanity which I did think to be inward of them. And this to be both
an odd and a natural thought to have then, as I do see. But at that
time, I only to think it, and not to wot or to trouble whether that it
did be odd or otherwise. And I to think that Country did be somewise as
the Olden Time renewed; but truly we to look upon early things with new
eyes.

And we yet to look awhile, and to be husht, and to hark in those last
moments unto the far mutter of the Great Fire-Mountains, and the
Fire-Hills, and the noise of life which did go over that Land; and we
even then to be but a few short pacings off from the silence of the
Great Gorge, which should lead us presently toward the Eternal
Strangeness which did be in the Night Land. And the Maid did hold mine
arm very close, as we lookt our last into the red light of that Deep and
Hid Country of the World, where, in verity, we had come so utter nigh to
our Death.

And presently, I turned, and the Maid slipt her hand into mine, and the
tears did go silent down her face, because of all that did be prest upon
her heart; but yet not to be all of sorrow, for there to be both sorrow
and happiness, and also there did be somewhat of vague emotion that she
never more to look upon that dear island where she had nurst her man
again unto life and well-being; and she to be in mind of all those
places where she to know that in after-life her memory to wander; and
she to have oft-told tales, mayhap, unto her children, of that Country
that they never to see; but only to be for a wonder to them for ever.

And we past then round the Mighty Corner-place of the Gorge, and went
forward, somewhat stumbling, into the gloom.

Now we went sixteen hours very steady, and with naught save the great
darkness to trouble us; and we by this to have been twenty and six hours
since last that we had sleep; and surely this did be a foolishness,
because that I to need that I come into my full strength, ere we reach
the Night Land; and it to be a folly that I should over-tire myself; and
the Maid to have said so much.

And, indeed, then, we came to a safe place for our slumber, and whilst
that we eat and drunk, we made count from my notings of the outward way,
and so did decide that we go no more than sixteen hours' journey each
day through the Gorge, and to sleep alway for eight good hours. And this
we to do, both then, and until that we did be come out of the Great
Gorge, which did take us in all, so much as five days thiswise.

And surely, when that we were come into the light places of the Gorge,
we to be more cheered, as you shall suppose; yet oft did we be half
smothered with the horrid gases that came upward in this part and that,
as you do mind.

And my strength did grow constant, as we journeyed; yet would the Maid
never suffer that I carry her; but went alway very light and clever, and
was grown, in truth, set unto this constant wander.

And at this place and that, I to make pause that I show Mine Own those
places where I did slumber, and she alway to need that she come unto the
very part, and that she stand for a little moment where I did lie so
lonesome, as I went outward unto that despairful searching. And alway
she then to be utter tender with me, and to be something lacking of
speech, because of the calling of her heart.

And surely, Mine Own did be alway now to ask me when that we should be
come unto the Night Land; and to require how far it should be, and to be
taken with a growing of excitement, very dear and natural; and, in
verity, I to be almost so much so as she; and to wonder what she to
think of the Mighty Redoubt, and of all that strange and monstrous Land.
And, above all these, I to be shaken unto my very heart, that I have the
Maid speedy unto safety; lest, after all, even though we to have come so
far, there somewhat to happen of woe. And all this did make it a hard
thing that we not to begin to race, and to exceed the hours that we did
set; but truly we had wisdom in this matter, and slumbered alway after
the sixteenth hour.

And we never to see aught of life in all that great and desolate Gorge;
for there did be only the gas-burnings, and the boulders and the stark
rocks, and oft the rank smellings of the gases. And alway an utter and
everlasting quiet; save when some lonesome gas-fire did oddly to moan
or to whistle, and the whistling to sound very dree across the great
waste of the Gorge, and likewise the moaning to be but a thing to make
the loneliness to be felt in the heart; and the Maid to feel thus with
me.

And alway, as I did know, she to think in her heart that I did come
through that place alone to make a searching for her into the unknown
lands of the world; and surely, I did be but a natural man if that I was
something happy in my heart that Mine Own so to ponder and to remember;
for thereby did her love seem ever to grow. And likewise, a man doth be
glad in his spirit and natural pride, that his Maid to know that he hath
done wholesomely of his best for her need. And you but to think upon the
love-days, and to hear the echoes of those dear proud thoughts that did
so to swell in you; and doth not all to go so strangely with familiar
pain in the old way?

Now it was upon the fifth day, in about the seventh hour, that I heard
oddwhiles a sound in this place and that of the Gorge, as that the rocks
made husht and strange sounds at us. And I to have the Maid instant very
nigh to me, and the Diskos to my hand, and we then to go onward with a
great caution.

And thrice we did pass places where gas-fires did burn and dance, and
made oft a low moaning, and somewhiles a little whistling; and the other
sounds yet to come oddly from the rocks, in this place and that, very
strange and unthought of, yet to be something familiar.

And sudden, it did come to me that there to be a far-away noise in these
sounds; though they to seem to come from this place and that almost to
mine elbow, as you should say. And lo! I knew then that I harked unto
little echoings, that did be caught by the near rocks, and to come from
some far and mighty sound. And this should be surely the monstrous
piping of the Great Gas Fountain, that you do well mind. And, in verity,
I told Mine Own in a moment; and she to be all eager with me, because
that this did be both a wondrous thing, and to be also a landmark to
show that we did be nigh to come out of the Gorge, and our journey to
come the more near unto an ending.

And surely we lookt ahead very earnest; and there to be so many strange
and leaping fires to our front, that we not to be very sure which did be
the far and monstrous dance of the Great Gas Fountain; for truly it to
be yet so distant that the near gas-fires did make more upon the eye up
all of a weary length of the Gorge, than did the great dance of the
far-off fire, that was now so small, by the distance.

And presently, when that we were gone onward something more, we to see
that there went a lightening and a darkening afar along the Gorge, so
that the background of the night was made to lose somewhat of the
intensity of its darkness, as with constant shudders of light; and this
to be surely the far away dance of the flame of the Great Gas Fountain.
And we then to watch alway as we journeyed, and to see how that the
vague shudderings of light did grow in the distance of the night, and
did merge and become known presently in a strange uplifting and falling
of a far away blue flame.

And the sound now to come more steady, and to grow in a long while into a
monstrous piping, very great and wonderful, and having a constant change
in the note.

And we to come past the last of the lesser fires, and to be in that part
of the Gorge which did be fireless, save for the great upward dance of
the Gas Fountain, which did now to be grown huge and plain-seen, and did
make a quaking light over all the Gorge.

And so in the end, we to be come very nigh to the dance of the monstrous
flame; and did be half stunned by the noise, which did be now an utter and
furious roaring, as you shall remember; and the Maid and I did stand as
but two lonesome strangers in the mouth-part of that deep and desolate
Gorge, and did stare voiceless unto the great flaw; and mine arm did be
about the Maid, and she to stand very nigh to me; and neither to speak;
and surely, how should we anywise; for the noise did be so huge.

And after that we had stared a great while, we turned that we look each
at the other; and we kist very sober, there in the light from the
monster flame. And afterward, we did stare again at the Flame, and soon
turned, and lookt all ways, and did marvel to see the great throw of the
light go blue and spreading and strange unto great distances.

And a while we did be watching the way that the far-off side of the
Gorge did come plain to sight, when that the Flame did leap; and, truly,
that did seem a far and lonesome Place, as that a lost and forgot world
of desolate mountains did be there.

And lo! we now to look that we should see somewhat of the way that our
journey to go; and surely naught to be clear shown save when the Flame
did rise oddwhiles to a monstrous height; and this to be because of the
huge rocks that did stand about the Flame. Yet something I was abled to
show the Maid of the bottom part of the Mighty and Utter Monster Slope
that did be the last way of our journey, ere we were come to the Night
Land.

And we then to go onward for about a good mile, that we be not so
deafened by the noise of the Gas Fountain; and it did be now beyond the
seventeenth hour; so that we eat and drunk, and made our rest in a
secure place among the great boulders.

And lo! when that we waked, we eat and drunk again, and did be something
silent, as we to gaze at the Flame dancing monstrous, and lonesome and
all set about with the stark and mighty Rocks, which did be like unto
giants of silence that did watch forever. And presently, we had our gear
upon us, and we went forward toward the utter dark of the Mighty Slope;
and we began that huge climb, that should last through days in an
eternity of night.

And oft in the first hours did we turn about from our blind stumblings,
and gaze downward out of the long height, unto the loom of the Flame,
that did shudder far below in the night, and made a quaking light in
that far darkness. And so did we leave it to dance forever through
Eternity in that deep and lost place of the world; and we bent all our
will and our strength unto the climb.

And this way went we stumbling for sixteen great hours; and by that time
had come to a pace proper for that task, and to be something numbed, and
seeming grown unreal, because of the affecting of the Darkness.

And lo! for eight days then did we go upward forever through that most
dreadful night. And after the first day, we crept alway upon our hands
and our knees, and I to go in the front, and had the Diskos ready upon
my hip. And I took two of the straps from the pouch and the scrip, and
so had a certain length; and I set them from the waist-belt of the Maid
unto mine own belt, and so did know ever that she came close after me.

And we made journeys sixteen hours long, and did eat and drink at the
sixth and the twelfth hours, and likewise we eat and drank ere we slept,
and again upon our wakings; and our slumber-time to go alway somewheres
about eight good hours; for thus did I be heedful that we have all our
strength for that dreadness of the journey, which did be yet before us,
across the fear and horrid terror of the Night Land.

And oft, at this time and that, I was utter sickened and a-wearied of
reaching forward and upward forever, and making blind fumblings that I
find a way about great boulders and the rocks and holes that did be in
our path in the dark; for it to seem that we went lost from all life and
knowing, in a blackness that should be never slackened from about us.

And I, these times, to make a pause, and to call softly unto Mine Own
that she creep up nigh unto me; and I then to take her into mine arms,
out of the utter blackness of that night. And so to give and to have
comfort.

And surely, Mine Own did whisper once unto me, that she did be stunned
with love and wonder in the heart; for she to never cease to know that I
did adventure through this great night, that I find her. And this thing
did make me very warm in my heart, as you shall think; but yet I to stop
her speech with a gentle kiss; and she then to know that she be dumb
concerning her thought in this matter; yet she never to cease from
remembering it, and did be the more stirred with the trouble of her
lovely secret worship; for, in verity, she to have me to be for her
hero; and this to make me in the same moment both something shamed and
greatly proud.

And so we to be together, and after such pause, to go forward again,
with a new courage.

And surely it did be a great comfort to me to think that, because we to
go upward and not downward, we be not like to fall over any hid cliff in
the night; for I to have now some little knowing of the Slope, from mine
outward journey; yet to remember upon that monstrous pit that I then to
escape, and so to go with care.

And, indeed, upon the second day, I had Mine Own to creep more nigh with
me, and I then to have but one strap between us, and the other I set a
stone into, and did cast the stone alway before us, as upon the outward
way. And you to mind you of this, if you but to think a little minute.

And oft in those weary days in the Darkness, did I make gentle
whisperings through the blackness, unto Mine Own, that I give cheer unto
her; and she alway to answer, very sweet and loving; yet ever husht, as
I did be; and in verity, it did be as that we could not set our voices
loud upon that Mighty Slope, lest some enchantment come upon us, as it
might be said. And, indeed, each time that I cast the stone, the noise
of the stone to make a little trouble and dismalness in mine ears; for
all did be so quiet and desolate and lost in night, that it to make us
to need to be likewise so quiet, and to desire that we might go upward
so silent as shadows.

Now, surely, I must tell here how that the Maid to have alway at waking
that same awaredness that I did have upon the Outward Way, that somewhat
did be nigh to us, and to seem to have been concerned with our waking;
and I likewise to have also the same knowledge, as before. And oft as we
did go, I to feel that somewhat did go near to us. And this to put
something of a fear upon me, because that I was ever anxious for Mine
Own; and I to have her to be alway the more nigh to me, and did set the
strap from her to me, even when that she slept; so that she not to be
touched, and I to lack to know. Yet she to have no fear concerning this
thing; but to feel in her spirit that it did be a force that had no evil
intent unto us; but more, neither she nor I to know; and I, in truth, to
come in the end used to it; save that I did be, as I have told, anxious
in all that did concern the life and well-being of My Beloved.

And so did we go onward through those eight days.

And it soon to be grown cold, so that we both to need the cloak over us
in our slumbers; but in the journey-hours to need naught; for the
upward-going did surely heat us very well.

And there also to be come presently a change and a seeming of thinness
into the air; and the Maid to remark upon this, and likewise that the
water-powder now to be that it not to fizz so plentiful.

And we went upward, as it did seem forever, and journeyed very husht
and steadfast; and likewise did halt at set times, that we eat and
drink; and did alway sit then very close and quiet and in love. And so
alway to go never beyond sixteen hours' journey each day, and very
weariful even so much; for it to be a sore and constant labour of
climbing.

And I to learn the hour alway, by a little shining of the Diskos upon my
time-dial, which I have told did be somewise as the watch of this our
present Age. Yet, truly, I also to learn that I made somewhat of a
constant number of forward-throws of the stone in an hour; and the Maid
to be the first to discover this, as she did creep behind me and harked
steadfast and quiet unto the clatter of the stone, each time that I cast
it. And she sometimes to call low to me that it now to be this time or
that time; and I to look at my Dial, as I have told, and oft to find
that she did be curiously right.

Yet otherwhiles, we to have no thought to count; but made a constant
husht talk one to the other; and did grow odd times, that it did seem to
us that we did be two spirits there in an Everlasting Darkness, that had
quiet speech one to the other, and to be seeming gone from our bodies.
And we then to need that we look each at the other, that we know truly
that we yet to live and to be indeed with the Beloved. And I then alway
to make the Diskos spin a little, yet something more than when I should
see the hour; and, in verity, our faces then to show pale and strange
seeming in that luminous glowing of the great weapon in the Darkness;
and we to look very eager and an hungered of love, each at the other;
and so to need that we be held loving by the Beloved, and so to have
comfort and assuredness; and afterward to have peace to go onward again.

And it did be one such time as these, that Mine Own to give me a love
name she had called me in those olden days of _this_ Age; and which
surely I had not heard since Mirdath died. And, in verity, you to have
dear understanding with me, how that I then to be all troubled with
vague troubles and ghostly love-aches in the heart; and likewise, I did
be all set about in a moment by the olden enchantment and speechless
glamour that did be so long hid and lost in the Spaces of Memory, where
surely the spirit doth wander such oddwhiles, husht unto a dumb
tearlessness and to know in the same moment both Agony and the voiceless
Glory and lost Delight of the Hath-Been; so that it doth be as that you
wandered in the spirit between the sorrowful pain of the Sunset, and the
Promise of the Dawn which doth be builded upon the Need and Hope of the
soul, and doth also to have an essence of pain within it; because that
these do be knit with Longing which doth be the essential pang of
Memory. And so, mayhap, you to have gone with me; for you to have also
strange thoughts that do come out of the years, and do hurt the heart,
even whilst that the heart doth hunger of that which doth so pain. Yet,
truly, Mine Own did be now with me, as you do know so that I had joy
all about my heart; yet did all the years of my lost delights and of my
pain, be in the spaces of my memory, and Mine Own now to have stirred
all; so that no words that did be ever shaped of man should help me to
have ease in speech.

And Mine Own Maid to know how it did be with me; and she to have said
the thing, scarce wotting, even as her spirit did set it through her
lips; and she before then to have forgot so utter as I; and now she to
be stirred likewise with me; so that, in verity, we to hold hands in the
great Darkness upon the Slope, and to wait till the pain and strange
trouble did go somewhat from our hearts; and we to have power again to
know truly that we did be again together in sweet verity, after a mighty
Eternity.

And thus did we go, and even in that strange Night to have an
everlasting coming together; so that surely our two spirits to be nigh
made one, somewise; and this to be that sweet and holy thing which I do
name Love; and it to be my glory and Astonishment that Love hath come
unto me. And with you that have love, I am as a Brother in holy delight;
but with all that have not known Love, or to have missed Love, I am a
Mourner, and my heart to pray that they to know this Wonder, ere they
die; for else shall they die so green and bitter as they be born, and to
have grown nowise unto Ripeness, which doth be Charity--the end of life
and the Crown of Humanity.

And surely I to go forward again now with my telling. And you to know
that on the eighth day upon the Slope, about the end of the ninth hour,
there to be an upward seeming of light, afar before us in the Darkness,
and did show as a dull and vague sheen above us in the night. And truly,
I to know that we did be come at last a-near unto the Night Land.

And we went upward then very eager through the dark; and the dim shine
did grow, ever; so that we soon to see it very plain, as a looming of
light afar upward. And we ever to climb and to go onward. And lo! in the
fourteenth hour of that day, we came up slowly out of the Night upon the
Slope, and stood at the ending of that strange road Where The Silent
Ones Walk.

And surely it did be as that I was come home, and to have set my feet
again upon familiar Lands; and this to bring to you how far off I did
seem to have gone; and now to be come again to a Known Place.

And we went upward upon the Road, until that we did truly have topt the
Slope, and at last to look out over all the wonder and mystery of that
Land. And I never to be rid of the utter gladness of knowing that I was
come there again, after so strange a journey, and that Mine Own had I
brought with me, out of all the unknown world. Yet, truly, I also never
to have forgetting that this familiar Land of Strangeness did be the
last test and the greatest dreadfulness of our journey; and anxiousness
did hang upon me; for I now to have to take the preciousness of Mine Own
among and beyond all that Danger of Horrid Forces and of Monstrous
Things and Beast Men, and the like.

And truly, I did be like to trouble.

And, in verity, I did stare with a fierce eagerness unto the far-off
place in the middle part of the Night Land, where did be the Mighty
Pyramid; and surely it there to shine in the midst of the land, and did
be mine Home, where never had I dared hope I should return. And I set
mine arm very swift and eager about the Maid, and pointed, so that she
see quickly the wonder and safe Mightiness of that which did be our
Refuge for all our life to come, if but that we to win unto it. And the
Maid to look with a great and earnest soberness and a lovely gladness
and utter soul and heart interest, unto that Place that bare me, and
where I to have come from, and now to take her.

And long and long she lookt; and sudden came round unto me, and set her
arms quick about my neck, and burst unto a strange and happy weeping.
And I to hold her gentle to me, and let her cry very natural, until that
she was something unpent.

And lo! when that she was eased, she to stand close beside me, and to
look again unto the Mighty Pyramid; and afterward, as she to steady, she
to ask an hundred questions, so utter eager and so to thrill with joy
and excitement, as that she did be a glad child. And an hundred
questions I answered, and showed her new things and Wonders uncounted.

And of all strangeness that she then to see, there did none so to shake
her in the spirit with terror as did that dreadful and Horrid House,
which did be the House of Silence. And it was as that her very being did
know and be repulsed of some Horror that did concern and be in that
House; so that she to want to hide in the bushes that did be anigh to
the Road; and truly, I to think this wise, and to remember and to be
ware suddenly that we did be indeed come now into the Power of
Monstrosity which did be utter and forever abroad in that Land.

And surely, we went then in among the bushes that did grow clumpt upon
the side of the Road, as you to remember; and afterward, I calmed this
new fear that had come so quick upon Mine Own; and she then to peer
forth with me from the bushes, and to have renewed sight over the Land.

And the House of Silence to stand upon that low hill of which you do
know; and did not be a very great way off, somewise toward the right.
Yet, as you shall have remembering, it did take me some long and bitter
hours upon mine outward way, ere I did be come from under the shadow of
it, as we do say, unto the top-part of the Mighty Slope.

But this to have been in the main, because of the utter care that I did
need to bring me safe past the House; for I to have gone long and weary
upon my hands and knees among the bushes, as you remember; and oft to
pause, and to be so still as Death, lest that the Power of the House to
have become aware of my passing. And truly, we to need again so utter a
care, when that we make to go past, unto our Mighty Home; and this to be
heavy upon my heart, and I to be in the same moment anxious that we have
haste to the trial, and yet very willing, if it might be, that we not
make it forever.

And, indeed, after that we had peered a good while from the bushes, I to
consider that we do well to eat now, and afterward to have a safe place
for our slumber, so that we go fresh to the horrid dangers and
dreadfulness that did be before us upon our way.

And we then to look about, and soon to find a great boulder that did be
set with the bushes. And we made our place for sleep against the
boulder, and the bushes went all around, so that we did be complete hid.

And, in verity, we to be very cold, as we had been those two past days,
whilst that we made toward the top of the Mighty Slope. And now we to
have the full chill of the Night Land, and did be very glad to have the
cloak, so that we eat and drank whilst that we sat together, and the
cloak round us. And afterward, the Maid set the cloak about us for our
sleep; and we then to kiss very sober, and I with anxiousness in the
heart; but she with less, because she to have rest in me.

And so we lay down to our sleep, and the Diskos ready in my hand; and my
spirit wakeful against any terror that should come anigh to us in our
slumber; and the Maid I warned to be likewise wary.

And surely we slept and waked, and there had gone eight good hours, and
naught was come anigh to us to harm us. And we eat and drank, and did
hark oft, and lookt out from among the bushes; but there did be naught
abroad to set dread upon our spirits; and so we did be more content, and
well rest and a-ready for the further journeying.

Now I had the Maid to wear the cloak, because of the chill of the Land;
but she in the first to refuse, save I also to have it in my turn; but
truly, I did feel that it should smother me, and that I need all my
freedom of my body, lest there come any thing sudden upon us; and all
this I showed Mine Own, and also that we should have weary work, and to
creep much, so that I should be warm by my labour of going, and she
likewise, mayhap. And she then to consent, because she saw that I did be
earnest and to burn with anxiousness; yet had me to promise that I take
the cloak, if that the chill of the Land gat me anywise bitter.

Now we made a pause, when that we have our gear upon us, and we lookt
well out over the Land; and surely alway our eyes did gaze in the ending
upon that far Wonder of Light and Safeness, which did be the Mighty
Pyramid; and I to be never ceased from telling Mine Own this thing and
that thing concerning the Great Refuge; and she to be constant stunned
unto silence and delight of wonder, and anon shaken unto a multitude of
questionings, so that truly we did be as that we never to have done
making known one unto the other.

Now, as you have knowledge, the House of Silence stood upon a low hill,
and the Road did bend about the bottom of the hill; and this way did I
come, when that I was on mine outward way.

Yet now there to be a new plan of journeying come into my mind; for, as
you do remember, I did take somewise of eleven great days from the
Pyramid unto the top-part of the Mighty Slope, because that I had gone
diversely and round about to the North-West of the Plain of Blue Fire.

And surely, as now I lookt, it did seem that we should try a short
passage, and thereby be come free out of all danger in but a space of
four or five days, if only we to succeed. And I stood a good while very
husht and anxious, and did consider this new way, and did presently
point it out to the Maid, how that we saw the Mighty Redoubt straight to
the back of the low hill where stood the House of Silence, and mayhap we
might chance to find a safe going that way, and that I did ponder
thatwise. For, indeed, as you do know, we must go _nigh_ past the House,
even did we return by the long journeying, and this to be because that
the bushes did make a cover only near to the Road, and all to be a
country of bare rock beyond the bushes on that side of the Road, which
did be to the North and West.

Now, presently, I had formed my intention regarding our way, and told
all to Mine Own, and how that we to have alway an utter caution; and the
danger I made so plain to her as I did know it, and she then to beware
in her heart the need there to be of care and wiseness forever, as we
did go. And we then to make forward into the Night Land, and to be gone
from the top-part of that great deep, in which there to be hid strange
lands, as you do know. And surely, it to be like that none should ever
to go that way again for an eternity, or maybe forever.

And so went we forward, with a new caution.

And we came out from among the bushes upon the North-West of the Road,
and crost unto the Eastward side; and here the bushes to grow very
plentiful, so that I led on with a cheerfulness of hope within my heart.
And alway I went so far to the South-East as the bushes would give us
their cover, and this way I made that we should scarce to pass within a
great mile of the dread and horrid House; though, in verity, this to be
most dreadful close.

And we walked then for six hours, and went sometimes creeping, and oft
stoopt, and ever with a great caution.

And in the sixth hour we made a rest, and eat and drank, and afterward
went forward again.

And in the tenth hour were we come something nigh unto the House; for
truly, we to be off from the Road Where The Silent Ones Walk, and so to
go more straightly, and alway to save distance. And we kept so far
outward from the House as we might; but could pass it not more than a
great mile off, because that the bushes did have their margin near upon
our left, as we went; and there to be barenness of rock beyond; and
fire-holes in this part and that amid the starkness of the rocky spaces,
that should be like to show us very plain, if that we came outward from
the bushes.

And moreover, there went upward into the everlasting night one of those
Towers of Silence, which did be in this part and that part of the land,
and were thought to hold Strange Watchers. And the Tower stood great and
monstrous afar off in the midst of the naked rocks, showing very grey
and dim, save when the flare of some great fire did beat upward in the
Land, and sent huge and monstrous lights upon it. And we to have need
alway now to remember this Tower, and to keep the more so to the
sheltered hiding of the bushes. Yet, in verity, we to have little
thought of aught, save of the grim and threatening terror and
monstrousness which did stand forever upon that low hill, and did be the
House of Silence.

And in the eleventh hour, we did go creeping from bush unto bush, and
did be as shadows that went in the mixt greyness and odd shinings of
that Land. And the grim and dreadful House did be now unto our right,
and did loom huge and utter silent above us in the night. And the lights
of the House did shine steadfast and deathless with a noiseless shining,
as that they shone out of the quiet of some drear and unnatural
Eternity. And there did a seeming of Unholiness to brood in the air, and
a sense of all and deathly Knowledge; so that, surely, our hiding did
seem but a futile thing unto our spirits; for it was to us as that we
did be watched quiet and alway by a Power, as we slipt gentle from bush
unto bush.

And when the twelfth hour did be nigh, we to begin to draw clear of the
House; and surely there to come somewhat of ease into my brain and
heart; for it did be as that we should come clear of all harm.

And I turned to the Maid, that I whisper gentle and loving encouragement
unto her. And lo! in that moment, Mine Own gave out a sudden low
sobbing, and was gone still upon the earth. And, truly, my heart did
seem to die in me; for I knew that there did be directed a Force out of
the House of Silence, which did be aimed unto the Spirit of Mine Own
Maid. And I caught the Maid instant into mine arms, and I set my body
between her body and the dreadness of the House; and surely, my spirit
to perceive that there beat out at her a dreadful Force, which did have
in it an utter Silence and a bleakness of Desolation. And lo! I saw in a
moment that the Force had no power to slay me; but did surely make to
slay the Maid. And I set my Spirit and my Will about her, for a shield,
if this might be, and I had her to mine arms as that she did be mine own
babe.

And I stood upright, for there did be no more use to hide; and I knew
that I must walk forever until that I have Mine Own to the Shelter of
the Mighty Refuge, or to walk until I die; for only with speed might I
save her from the dread and horrid Malice of that Force.

And I set free the Diskos from my hip, and had it in mine arms beside
the Maid, and I strode forward out of the bushes, and put forth my
strength that I journey with an utter speed. And ever my Spirit did know
of that monstrous Force which did be direct upon us, to the Destruction
of Mine Own Maid.

And odd whiles, as I walkt, I called Mine Own by her olden love name,
and by the new name of Naani; but never did she move or seem even that
she lived; and surely my heart sickened within me with a mighty despair,
so that a constant madness did begin to thrill in me and to make me
something monstrous in strength, with my fierce agony and intentness to
save. And one hope only had I, that I bring her yet living into the
Shelter of the Mighty Refuge; and so, swift, to the care of the Doctors.

And lo! I did strive to be wise in my despair; for I made a quick
halting soon, and I warmed a broth of the tablets and water upon a hot
rock, and strove that I set some of the broth between the closed lips of
Mine Own Maid; yet did it be useless, as I to have known before in my
heart. And alway I kept my body and my Will and my Spirit and my Love
between the Maid and the dreadfulness of the House. And I made some of
the water, and dasht it upon the face of Mine Own, and I chafed her
hands; but truly it to have no use; neither did I truly to think it
should be like to.

And I wiped her face then, and harked to her dear heart; and surely it
did beat, very slow and husht. And afterward, I wrapt her in the cloak.

And I forced myself then that I eat some of the tablets, and I drank a
great lot of the water, for a fever did seem to burn in me, and moreover
I to mean that I lack not for strength to my task.

And I set my gear upon me very speedy, and I lifted Mine Own Beloved,
that did be now so husht, that once had been so merry and dearly
naughty. And surely, I nigh choked as the thought uprase in me; but I
set it back, and did but go the more furious. And surely no man did ever
go so fast and constant upon his feet, through an eternity; for I was
come again to my strength, and there did be a madness of intention and
despair upon me; and I went on forever.

And at each sixth hour when I stopt very brief to eat and to drink, I
made to bring Mine Own to her senses; yet she never to come, and alway
her heart to grow the more feeble; so that in the end I did utter fear
to hark; and did but set food and drink into me, and onward again with
an utter fierceness.

And why there came not any Sweet Power of Goodness to help me in my
strait, I never to know; but did call desperate upon all Good things to
aid me, as I went, to save Mine Own. But there naught to come; so that I
had grown into cursings, but that I did not to lose my wisdom to any
useless foolishness. And alway, as I went, I to see the Land blindly,
and oft vague and grey as that I did look at naught real, and again with
strange flashings of light, and the glare of fires; and anon to see the
Land as it did be, and all odd whiles to have now to me the feel of a
dread and monstrous dreaming.

And surely I sped forever through the dreadful hours, and went neither
to the right nor to the left, neither did I strive to hide in the bushes
nor to evade aught, for I knew that the Maid died slowly in mine arms,
and there to be no more gain in life, save by speed, that I have her
swift to the Mighty Pyramid to the care of the Doctors. And a great and
despairing madness grew ever within me.

And thrice I to have a vague memory that there came creatures at me,
from the dark of the Land; but surely I slew them with the Diskos, and
have no remembering thereof, only that mine anger did boil in me, and I
to know once that the Diskos did run blood in my hand.

And lo! there to come sudden unto my spirit the knowledge that the
aether of the world did be stirred. And, indeed, I did be surely sighted
by the great Millions of the Mighty Pyramid. And they to have seen me
come forward into the sight of the spy-glasses, and that I did bring a
maid in mine arms out of all the night of the world.

And truly, as I did after learn, the dear Master Monstruwacan had
discovered me great hours before; for there had been a steadfast watch
kept in the Tower of Observation for my returning, if that ever I should
return; and the might of the Great Spy-Glass had shown me plain a good
while gone, and that I did carry somewhat, that was surely the maid that
I did go to find. Yet had the Master given an order that no word be set
abroad to the Peoples, of this discovering, lest that the emotions of
the Millions to tell overmuch unto the evil Powers of the Land. But now
had the Millions also come unto knowledge; for many had ceased not to
watch through their spy-glasses, and the news to travel very speedy
through the cities; and surely now there did be a constant spiritual
noise in the night, to be heard only of the Spirit, yet to suffice to
wake and to warn all that Land.

And truly, as I after to learn, the Master Monstruwacan did know by the
instruments that there came a force out of the House of Silence, and
this to trouble him greatly; so that he set the word through the
Pyramid, by the Hour-Slips, that all the Peoples strive to contain their
emotion, lest they bring an Harm and a Destruction upon me, by warning
the Land with the greatness of their feelings.

Yet, in verily, this did be useless; for the Peoples did be very human,
and could nowise check their gladness and great wonder and excitement;
for it was to them so great a wonder almost as we should suffer if that
a man in this Age should go beyond Death in search of his Beloved; and
afterward to come backward unto the Living; and, surely, in such case,
how mighty should be our amazement; and this to be somewise how they did
be; yet with it also a sweet and natural gladness and strong welcoming,
which doth be the true beat of the Human Heart unto the Wanderer.

And presently, and through all the time that I came forward across the
Land, there did be mayhaps an hundred million that did never cease to
watch me from the embrasures, from the View-Tables, and from all
vantages. Yet, for a long while, only they which possessed strong
spying-glasses did be abled to see me truly, for I was a great way off.

And millions did but stare vainly unto that part where I was said to be;
and the Hour-Slips to come out four times in the hour, and to tell aught
that did be known. And so shall you perceive that Humanity did but have
grown the more Human.

And, in verity, I went forward with all my strength, and did drive
heedless through the miles and the night, and scarce conscious of aught,
because of the aching madness of despair that did grow ever within me;
for I knew that Mine Own Maid died alway in mine arms, as I did carry
her.

And later, a monstrous space of hours it to seem, I knew that I was come
to that part of the Road, where it did bend somewhat unto the Vale Of
Red Fire; and this did be something anigh to that wilderness where the
Youths did fight with the giant-men.

And I came over the Road, and urged my body utter furious across the
Land. And, surely, in that moment when I cross the Road, great numbers
of the Millions did see me, that had not seen before. And there went a
shaking in the aether of the World, because of the sudden emotion of so
mighty a Multitude; and lo! it did be as that in that moment the Land
was at last waked; for there came from far away unto the Eastward, a
faint and dreadful laughter, as that a monstrous Being laught unto
Itself in some lost and dreadful country. And the Laughter passed over
the Land, and did echo strangely, as it did seem, in this part and that
part, and presently to go rolling round in the far and hid West Lands,
and to be as that it wandered awhile amid the far mountains of the Outer
Lands, and was presently lost from my hearing.

And my heart chilled a little maybe; but yet did I not care over-much;
for I to lack all if that I lackt Death, if that I not to be given power
to save Mine Own. Yet did I make a little pause, so that I gat the knife
from the belt of the Maid, and did also to bare the Capsule; for if that
there came a Destruction upon us, I to make instant sure that Mine Own
Maid be safe unto death, and I then to go quickly with the Capsule.

And afterward I again upon my way.

And ever upon each sixth hour I did stop that I eat and drink, and did
onward again, even as a machine; for I commanded myself to this duty of
victual, that I lack not my strength unto the saving of the Maid. Yet,
truly, I did seem to choke alway as I strove with the tablets.

And lo! ever as I went forward did the Land awake; and my spirit to know
that Great Forces did be abroad, restless. And the Monsters to begin
wild roamings, because that they also to know of the Unrest that did be
come into the Land. And there to go presently odd roarings across the
Land, from night unto night. And I to go forward the more desperate, and
to step neither to the right nor to the left; but to make direct unto my
Mighty Home.

And the Vale of Red Fire did be soon afar off unto my right, and the
bulk of the Watcher of the North-East to be somewise unto my left,
before me; and the great back to be toward me. And truly, I lookt at the
Brute-Force, and it did be as that I drew nigh unto a Mountain of
Watchfulness; and above it in the everlasting night did be the blue
shining of the luminous ring, and the ring shed a light downward over
the Monster-Force; and the shoulders did be huge and humpt, even as two
small hills, and it lookt forever from me through eternity unto the
Pyramid. And this to be plain, though I did be a great way off from it.

And sudden, as I went, there came Somewhat out of a bush unto my left,
and rose up at me, very long and tall; and surely it did be some kind of
a man, and came at me. And my fury and my despair came inward upon me in
a moment, so that I troubled not to set down the Maid, but leaped at the
thing, where it did be yet half hid in the dark. And lo! it died in
pieces, and the Diskos did roar to content my heart an instant. And I
then onward again the more savage, so that my heart did be a dreadful
thing within me.

And a great while I went then, and do have a vague remembering that this
time and that there came things at me from out of the dark; but surely
they to have died very speedy, that I not to remember more.

And the hours did pass in spaces of time that did be made of terror and
numbness and an utter and evergrowing fury of despair. And I did be at
last as that I did burn inward with a grim and dreadful energy, and to
seem to grow the less tired, and to come over the Land with a stronger
ease and somewhat as that I did desire things to come unto me, that I
have something to ease my heart; for lo! Mine Own Maid did be dying in
mine arms as I carried her; and I to be in a bleak and sickened dread,
so that I lacked all courage now to listen unto her heart, as I have
told; and went burning, and dry and hot in the eyes.

And ever there sounded the roarings across the Land; and there did be
added presently lower and more horrid and dread noises. And later I
heard a far thudding of the earth; and in a little there went past me a
great Man, running so heavy that he did make a shaking as he past me;
yet, in verity, by a sweet mercy, he saw me not, and was gone onward in
a moment and lost utter into the night. And the aether of the world to
be full of the trouble of the Peoples, as the Man past me; and afterward
there to be a stirring of glad thankfulness. And truly, alway my spirit
did know strangely as in a dream, that the Millions set their sympathy
and pity and help about me, and did girt me about with Human love and
with encouragement and with uplifted thoughts. Yet, in verity, did all
be as water beside the fierce wine of my love and despair, which did
urge me onward in a natural lacking of all dread, save for Mine Own. And
truly this doth be the way of Love, and shall make fearless the heart of
the weakest. And there to be prayers in the night, and all the aether to
be surged with the spiritual trouble and callings and cryings of the
Millions; so that, indeed, if that my spirit so to hear these things, it
to be conceived that these do pass outward into the Everlasting, and to
break upon the Shore of Eternity in an anguish, even as a visible foam
of supplication.

And surely the unity of love of the Millions did make a natural Force
about me; for, in verity, the Force that did come from the House to seem
to be somewhat eased from the Maid; yet there to be no surety in this;
for all did be desperation and turmoil in my heart, and I to have but
one thought in my brain, that I bring Mine Own swift across the Land
unto the Mighty Pyramid, and so unto the Doctors.

And lo! there stole presently from afar the deep and dreadful baying of
the Hounds; so that I knew we did be surely dead, save that a miracle
should happen. And I askt in my heart in a fierce and mad fashion why
that they did not to rig one of the olden shooting weapons, that they
shoot from the Pyramid, and so to give me some aid in mine extremity.

And behold, even as I did be so bitter, there went afar upward in the
everlasting night, where did shine the Last Light, the sharp flashings
of the Set Speech; and I did warm in my heart a little with hope; for
the Master Monstruwacan did see that I was now all discovered, and there
to be no more use for silence, and did speak straight and helpful unto
me. And I made to read the Set Speech, but mine eyes had been mad and
near blinded with lost hope. But in a moment I saw clear. And behold,
the dear Master Monstruwacan bid me to keep good my courage, for that
they did have made ready three of the olden weapons; and moreover, they
to save me, even if that they have to turn loose the Earth-Current over
the Land. And he commended me with Honour, and that I strive forward yet
a little while; for that an Hundred Thousand Men did be Prepared, and
did even then go downward in their armour by the Lifts.

And surely, as you shall think, my heart eased a little in me, and there
burned somewhat of a hope in my spirit that I yet to bring Mine Own
unto the Doctors, ere it be too late.

And the baying of the Hounds did grow nearer in the night; and there to
grow ever the roarings over the Land; and a sense of Evil and
monstrousness to be abroad in all the night.

And lo! I to have come by this so that the Watcher of the North-East did
be backward upon my left; and I lookt keen and fearful now at the
Monster-Force; and behold, the great bell-ear did quiver continually, so
that I saw the Monster made somewhat known unto all the Land. And the
Monster did look as ever, unto the Pyramid; and did be a great and
silent Hill of Life that did lean toward the Pyramid; and the light from
the Ring came downward upon the monstrous hide, which did be set in vast
folds and wrinkles upon it. And the Monster to know of me; yet never to
move, neither to show life, save that the ear did quiver so horridly.

And I knew that they made some great preparation in the Pyramid for our
defence; for all the night did begin now to shake and to quiver with the
mighty beat of the Earth-Current.




XVI

IN THE COUNTRY OF SILENCE


And lo! I did be come something nigh unto the Mighty Pyramid; and my
great Home went up vast into the everlasting night, as a very Mountain
of sweet Life and Safety, and had surely amazed me afresh with the utter
Bigness of it, only that despair and weariness did have too grim an hold
upon my heart for me to care of aught, save to have Mine Own Maid within
the safe wonder of the huge Refuge. And it did be still afar off from
me.

And I to go forward across the Land with a strong going; and lo! as I
past a hollow place where did burn a fire-hole, there came something out
of the hollow. And the thing gat upward from crawling, and did be a
great and haired Man. And the Man lookt at me, and afterward came unto
me, and did put his hands forward, very eager, as he came. And I did see
the hands plain in the light from the fire-hole, and the hands were
monstrous, and did be armed brutish with horrid claws, so that the Man
should have been able to rip aught, even as a wild beast.

And I put Mine Own very swift to the earth; and surely, I cared not for
life or aught; for this thing did make to delay me, and I to be fierce
with despair that aught should halt me. And lo! I leaped very furious
and with cold anger at the giant; and I smote at the monstrous brute;
but he unto the side in an instant of time, and so escaped the blow. And
he flung forth his monstrous arm out of the half-dark of a shadow that
did be cast by the dance of the fire-hole, and caught my head-piece and
pluckt it from me so strong and brutish that he cast me nigh a dozen
feet on to my back. Yet I was not harmed in the life, but only sore
shaked and bruised; and I to be up in a moment, and came in upon the
giant, and the Diskos did roar and blaze in my hands as I swung the
weapon. And I gat the giant above the middle part, and the Diskos did
glut itself, and went through the giant as that he did be naught, though
so huge and monstrous and girt with strength. And he to have surely
turned his shoulders as he died; for the upper part of the giant-man
went horrid to the earth, and the legs and the trunk stood plain in the
light of the fire-hole, and the blood went upward as a fountain in the
night.

And I made no pause, but leaped unto the Maid, and had her in a moment
to mine arms, and onward again past that dead thing, that did only then
to fall with an horrid sound. And surely the night did be full of an
astonishment and upliftedness of the Millions, so that their spiritual
cryings did go all about me, and did tell me that they had perceived
this thing, and did cast their love and delight unto me, and a vast
excitement to be upon them.

And lo! I scarce to have gone a great mile more, but there came two
vague things out of a dark place, where certain rocks did upstand; and I
smote them with the Diskos, and went onward; but what they did be, I
never to know.

And surely, after that, I did seem to go smiting forever; for there to
come, time and oft, strange things out from the bushes and the rocks, as
that all the Land did be a-crawl with foul and monstrous life, and I to
go smiting, as in a dream, and to speed forward ever with a more fierce
despair; for surely the end of our lives did be come, and I not to be
given power to save Mine Own Maid.

And all the Land did be full of grim and monstrous roarings, and
odd-wise lower sounds, very deadly. And once I did hear the noise of
giants running. And all the night to be Evil. And, in verity, how I did
not be slain by some dread Force, I not to know, unless that I did be
burned free of all weakness that an Evil Power should have chance to
harm me through; for, indeed, I had been dealt a bitter training a
monstrous time.

And lo! there to be again the deep and dreadful baying of the
Night-Hounds unto the South-East, and to be nearer; and I to know now
that no strength of mine should serve to protect Mine Own.

And lo! from the upwardness of the night, where did be the Last Light,
there sudden to come downward a strange blue flash, that smote downward
into the Land unto the South-East. And again the flash to come, and
mayhap a score times after; and there to come down out of the height a
peculiar crackling sound, that did be less than the thunder of this age,
yet more loud than any other sound that you ever to hear. And lo! I knew
that the Humans did begin to fight for me, that I bring Mine Own safe
unto Home.

And behold! it did be as that all the wakefulness of the Land that had
been, did be but as sleep, beside the wakefulness that now to come; for
surely the Night now to seem to rock with the roarings of the Monsters,
and with the be-stirring of Great Forces. And ever there to go over the
Land the yowling of that strange and dreadful Laughter, which did come
from that hid Country in the night of the lost East.

And lo! there arose constant now the hoarse and dreadful bayings of the
Hounds, and made known that a mighty pack did be out. And they to seem
to be no more, maybe, than a good mile unto the South-East; and I to be
all alone, save for the dying Maid that I held in mine arms. And I lookt
vainly and with despair for the Hundred Thousand that did be Prepared,
and had come downward, as you do know, unto mine aid. But truly, there
did be naught to see anywheres, save the strange lights and shadows of
the Land; and the movement of monstrous life in this place and that
place. And the Hounds to come nearer with every moment of time; so that
indeed, I knew that death did be very nigh.

And I ceased not from my stride; but went forward, and did begin to run;
for the Pyramid was not a huge way off in the night; and the shine of
the Circle about it, to be plain seen, save here and there, where it did
be hid strangely. And I to have a despairing hope that I come yet with
Mine Own into the safety of the Circle.

And the baying of the Hounds to come ever the more near; and surely it
did be a doubly hideous bitter thing that I lose My Dear One, so nigh
unto Home; and the great Mountain of my Home to go upward before me into
the night, and to seem so near that surely I did be almost there; but
yet, mayhap, two great miles off, even then. And, behold, I called out
in vain despair and to no end, why that none come to give me aid in this
extremity; for the Hounds did bay now but the half of a great mile, upon
my left, and did surely have scent of me, by the way of their dreadful
baying.

And, truly, the Millions to have an anguish of sympathy for me; for the
spiritual noise of their emotion did be plain unto my spirit; and they
surely to have seen and to have interpreted the way that I did look
about me and appear to call out in despair; for there came all about me
in a moment the companioning of a great and sweet spiritual force, which
did be bred of their quick going with me in their understanding and
love; and they to have perceived how that I did be unto the end of hope;
and the Hounds to be almost upon me.

And in this moment, there came afresh to my hearing the shaking beat of
the Earth-Current; so that I knew the Humans to take desperate means to
save. And there came to my view a vast pack of the Hounds unto my left,
and they came running at a great pace, and their heads did be low, and
they to be so great as horses; and seen plain, and again in shadow, all
in the same moment, as they did come.

And, in verity, I knew that we two to be dead indeed ere a minute be
gone, if that the Humans not to haste. And I stood where I did be; for
there was no more use to run; and I lookt from the Hounds unto the
Mighty Pyramid, and again to the Hounds. And again I lookt with my hope
gone, unto the Pyramid; for the Hounds did be scarce two hundred fathoms
off from me; and there did be hundreds of the mighty beasts. And lo!
even as I lookt that last time unto the Pyramid, there brake out a
monstrous bursting flame, that did rush downward from the Sealed lower
part of the Mighty Pyramid. And the flame smote downward upon the Land
where the Hounds did run, and all the Night to be lost from my sight in
the brightness and strangeness of that mighty flame; so that I saw no
more the Pyramid, or aught; but only the shining and dreadful glory of
that flame. And the Flame made a blast in the Night, and a hotness that
did seem to wither me, even where I did be from it. And I perceived that
the Humans had truly turned loose the Earth-Current upon the Hounds,
that I be saved. And there went a constant great thundering over the
Land, because that the Earth-Force did rend and split the air, and did
tear up the earth. And the roaring of the Monsters did be husht and lost
in that mighty sound; and I to see no place where the Hounds did be; but
only flames and broken lands where the Earth-Force did strike; and great
rocks did be hurled all whithers, with a vast noise; and truly it did be
a mercy that I was not slain an hundred times, if this might be, by the
failings and burstings of great rocks and boulders.

And lo! in a moment the Humans did cut off the Earth-Force, and had it
again to their control. And there to seem now a great silence upon the
Land, and an utter dark; save that flames and noise came from that part
where the Current did strike. And I very speedy to come free of the
dazedness that had me, and made again to my running; for, in truth, it
to seem now that I should yet be let to win unto safety with Mine Own.

And mine eyes did grow presently unto their accustomed using; and I to
look all ways about me, lest there come somewhat upon me even then to
work our deaths. And for a good time there to be naught that I did see
anywheres, neither there to be the wakeful sounds of the Land, save only
the grim and horrid Laughter from afar in the dead East.

And oft as I did run, I to stare hungry hearted upward at the Mighty
Pyramid; and surely it alway now to seem to be less bright than before.
And in the first, I to set this to the count that mine eyes did be yet
dazed by the great Flame of the Earth-Force; but soon I to perceive that
it did be otherwise; and that there did be truly a less brightness of
the light that did shine throughout all the Mighty Redoubt. And this
lack I conceived had owing to that great using of the force and power of
the Earth-Current that had been loosed to save us. And I to have this
new thing cold upon my heart; for, truly, if that the Force of the
Current to be made over low, there to be a danger for all the Humans
that did live, even for all the great Millions of the Mighty Refuge. And
this, did be surely known by the Masters; and they to have no more power
to aid me with the Current, until it flow strong again, lest that they
destroy all the Peoples of the Earth. And all this to be plain to me in
a moment, as I ran; and I to be but the more desperate to come unto
instant safety with the Maid.

And surely, I to be yet in expecting of the Hundred Thousand to come
unto me; but they not to come. And all about me the Land to begin again
to give out the noises of the Monsters; and to send forth new and
peculiar noises, as that there did be more awaked in the Land than did
be ever heard by me before. And presently, I saw that there went living
things, creeping, between me and the light of the Circle. And I to know
that I yet to have to fight bitter, if that I would bring the Maid safe.
And I swung the Diskos free, and ran on.

And sudden my Spirit to know that I did be warned of some new peril; and
I to look upward into the night, that the Master Monstruwacan should
mayhap to tell me the danger, by the Set Speech. But, in truth, there
came not the quick flashings of the Set Speech; but only an upward
stillness, and a dimness of the lights of the Mighty Pyramid. And
afterward, I to learn that the dear Master Monstruwacan made to warn me
of danger; but that all the instruments of the Tower of Observation to
fail to work, and likewise all the machinery of the Pyramid to cease,
even unto the moving of the great lifts, and the moan of the Air Pumps;
and all to have been this way for nigh a great hour, until that the
Earth-Current did flow again more full. And surely, this doth show that
Death did nigh to come unto all the Millions, because of the great trial
that did be made to save us.

But, truly, my spirit did be warned by the trouble of the Millions, and
because the Master Monstruwacan called vaguely with his brain-elements;
so that I went ever more warily, and did look all ways. And lo! sudden
I to stare above me into the night; and there to be a pale circle, very
quiet and steadfast that did go alway over the twain of us. And I saw
that this did be surely one of those sweet Powers of Holiness, that did
stand between our souls and some dread Power that came anigh to work our
Destruction. And I to have no over-fear; but did put my trust in the
Force of Holiness, and went forward, running warily.

And surely, I came mayhap so nigh as to within four hundred paces of the
Circle; and I to think that I yet to win Mine Own safe and undelayed
within the guarding of the Circle. And the light of the Circle did burn
dim; so that I had sudden fear whether that it be any more use for a
Guard, until that the Earth-Current to come more free. And all this as I
ran, swift and wary and utter anxious.

And lo! in that moment in a dim place there rose up three beast-men from
the earth, and came at me, growling. And the first did be so close that
I had no room to the Diskos; but beat in the head of the man with the
haft-part. And I leaped unto the side then, and swung the Diskos, and
did be utter mad, yet chill, with fury; so that the Maid did be no more
than a babe in the crook of mine arm. And I came in sudden to meet the
two beast-men as they ran at me; and I cut quick and light with the
great Weapon, and did have that anger upon me which doth make the heart
a place of cold and deadly intent; so that I had a wondrous and brutal
judgement to the slaying. And, truly, I slew them as that they had been
no more than mice; and I had no harm, neither so much as a touch from
them. And, behold! in that moment there came a great Shout of wonder and
of welcome from within the Circle. And I lookt swiftly, and began again
to run; for there did be men in grey armour all within the Circle; yet
came they not to mine aid.

And lo! in a moment I knew why that the Hundred Thousand did have held
off from me in mine extremity; for, behold! there did be monstrous Black
Mounds all along without of the Circle, and did rock and sway with a
force of strange life that did set an horror into my soul as I ran; for
truly they did be the visible signs of monstrous Forces of Evil. And did
any Human have ventured outward beyond the Circle, then had that man
been Destroyed in the Spirit, and lost utterly; so that none had dared
to come; neither had it been of use if any had made themselves to be a
sacrifice to aid me; for, truly, they to have been of no use, when dead,
as you shall say.

And there came a constant shouting from the Hundred Thousand to me, that
I haste, and indeed to haste. And truly I did haste with all my
strength. And I lookt unto the dear Circle of Holiness that did be above
us twain; and it to go steadfast over us; so that I saw we to be surely
saved.

And lo! I to be no more than an hundred paces now from the glowing of
the Circle. And behold! even in that instant, there must come brutal
things to destroy us; for there came an herd of squat and brutish men
all about me in a moment from the shadows, where they had been hid. And
they caught at me, and caught at the Maid to tear her from mine arm. And
truly, it did be as that they surely to have success; for I could nowise
in a moment free myself, and yet to guard the Maid and to use the
Diskos. And lo! I kickt with my metal boots, and gave from them, and
turned all ways in a moment, and wrenched free; and I leaped back; and
the herd of horrid brutes after me.

And now I to have space for the Diskos, and a grimness in my heart; and
I came round very sudden, and ran in among the men, smiting. And I hit
very swift both from the right and the left, and to and fro with a
constant quick circling. And the Diskos did spin and roar, and made a
strange light upon the faces of the men, and they to have tusks like to
the tusks of pigs. And surely I did rage through them, smiting. And they
to strike me a thousand times with great stones, so that mine armour
rang, and was all fresh burst, and I near to sicken under the blows and
new wounds; but they not to harm the Maid, for I carried her above their
squat and brutish reach.

And the brute-men to seem without end. But I made alway forward unto the
glowing of the Circle; and the night to be full in that place of the
fierce shoutings of the Hundred Thousand; and many--as I did learn--to
have tried to come unto me, but that their comrades held them from so
useless a dying.

And, in verity, I to be now scarce fifty paces from the glowing of the
Circle; and did be nigh to fall; for I did be so utter dazed and wounded
with the fight, and ill with a vast weariness and the despair and
madness of my journey, and moreover, as you do know, I not to have
slept, but to have carried the Maid forever through days and nights, and
to have fought oft.

And lo! the Hundred Thousand stood just within the Circle, and they that
were to the front did swing each man the Diskos; and they hurled each
the Diskos in among the herd of the tuskt men that did make to slay me.
And surely this to save me; for the herd did thin to my front; and I to
gather my strength, and to charge with despair, and to smite and never
be ceased of smiting; so that there did be dead creatures all about. And
behold! I brake through the herd, with Mine Own, and did be upon the
Circle. And lo! I stept over the Circle, that did scarce now to give out
a Resistance; and a thousand hands did come forward to give me help; yet
did none touch me, but gave back from me; for there did be that about me
which held them off, as with a little awe; for I to be strange unto
them.

And I stood there in a great silence, and the Diskos in my hand ran
blood to the haft. And maybe I rockt as I stood; for many again did put
out their hands, as to hold me, and again drew back, and were silent.

And I lookt unto them, and they lookt back at me; and I did gasp
awhile, and was strangely dazed, and did try to tell them that I had
need of the Doctors for the Life of Mine Own Maid, that did be dying in
mine arms. And behold, in that moment, there did be a sound of giants
running, out in the night. And some then to cry out different matters,
to aid me, and to beware of the giants, and to bring the Doctors to
attend me on the instant.

And other voices did call that the Holy Light was gone from above; and
likewise the Black Mounds from the outer part of the Circle. And there
did be a monstrous noise of roarings in the Land, and all to come
bewildered unto my brain, which did surely fail now with the grim and
utter stress which had been mine so long.

And there to be also a constant noise that came from near and from
upward; and truly I to know, as in a dream, that it did be made of the
shouting of the great Millions, that did make an eternal and vague
roaring-sound upward in the night, that did come down from the upper
heights, no more loud than a strange and continual murmuring out of the
lofty miles.

And surely, I to find my voice in a little minute, and did ask a near
man whether there be any Doctors with the men. And in that moment there
came forward a Master of the Diskos, which doth be as a Commander of
this age. And he made the Salute of Honour with the Diskos, and would
have eased the Maid from me; but I to ask again, very slow, whether that
there was a Doctor a-near. And he on the instant to give an order; and
the great thousands to begin to shape, and did make a mighty lane unto
the Great Gateway of the Mighty Pyramid.

And the Master of the Diskos made a sign to certain that did be near;
and they stood about me, as I to know dully, lest I fall; but they not
to touch me; for I did be as that I must not be laid hand upon; for I
did near to choke with despair lest I to have come Home too late; and
surely, also, the men to seem as that I did be strange unto them.

And there went orders swift and constant this way and that; and lo! in a
little while, there came two big men of the Upward Cities, running; and
they had a little man between them upon a sling. And the little man did
be a Master of the Doctors; and he aided me gentle to lay Mine Own Maid
upon the earth. And the Master of the Diskos made a sign, and the men
that did be near, turned each his back; and the Doctor to make
examination for the life of Mine Own.

And there to come about that time a seeming of silence in the land. And
truly the Hundred Thousand did be utter quiet; and a great quiet in the
Mighty Pyramid; for, in truth, all to know, by this, that there to be a
fear that the Maid I did bring out of the night, did be slain by the
Evil Forces.

And sudden the little man that did be the Master Doctor, lookt up quiet
and piteous at me; so that I knew in a moment that Mine Own Maid did be
dead. And he to see that I knew; and he covered the face of Mine Own,
and stood up very speedy; and he called softly to the men that did be to
my back, and he signed to them that some to support me, and some to lift
Mine Own Maid, and bear her unto the Great Gateway. And he lookt keen at
me; and I to fight a little that I breathe; and afterward did make with
my hands, that the men not to come near me, neither to touch Mine Own.
And the Master Doctor to understand that I did be truly strong until I
die, and did beckon the men from me, and from the Maid.

And I stoopt, in a little, and I lifted Mine Own Maid into mine arms for
that last journeying.

And I came down the mighty lane of the Hundred Thousand, all in their
grey armour. And they did make silent salute with the Diskos reversed,
each man as I passed him, and did be utter silent. And I scarce to wot
of aught, save that all the world did be quiet and emptied, and my task
to have failed, and Mine Own to lie dead in mine arms. Yet, truly, did
it to have failed utter? for I had surely saved Mine Own from the terror
of the Second Night Land, and she not to have come alone and with
madness unto her death; but to have died in mine arms; and she surely to
have been comforted within her spirit, because that my love did be so
utter about her. And I to think vaguely and terribly on an hundred sweet
love actions that she to have shown unto me; and sudden I did remember
with a dreadful pain how that I never to have waked to discover Mine Own
Maid kissing me in my sleep, as I to have meant. And a madness of
anguish did flash sudden through the numbness upon my brain; so that I
did be blinded a little, and surely went crooked in my walk; for I to
know, sudden, that the Master Doctor steadied mine elbow for a moment;
but afterward did leave me be, as I to have again control of my spirit.

And lo! as I drew nigh unto the Great Gateway, the lights of the Pyramid
to begin to glow again more strong, and the machinery of the Lifts and
the Air Pumps to work, because that now the Earth-Current did grow once
more to natural strength. And they to have power now to open the Great
Gate, which did be done by great machines.

And there to come forth to meet me a number of the Masters of the Mighty
Pyramid; and the dear Master Monstruwacan did come before them all, so
eager as that he did be mine own Father. And he to have heard somewhat,
vaguely, that there to have been a fear for the life of the maid that I
did bring.

And surely, he did be told by one near to the Gateway, that the Maid did
be dead in mine arms; for he and all the Masters did pause and stand
silent for me to go by, and did reverse each his Diskos; and this to
have been an Honour shown, than which there did be scarce any greater.

And there went a constant murmuring up in the night, which did be the
speech of the Millions, questioning. And the news that the Maid did be
dead, went upward through the miles. And my spirit to know, as in a
dream, of the spiritual noise which did go outward through all space,
and did be the grief of the Multitudes, as they did hear this thing.
Yet, truly, there did nothing comfort me anywise; neither I proper yet
to know the verity of my loss; for I did go stunned.

And I came in through the Great Gateway, and the Full Watch did stand
there silent in their armour; and they made the Salute of Honour. And I
went onward with the dead Maid that I did bring out of Eternity.

And presently, they that were around, did guide me, with the Maid in
mine arms, unto the Great Lift. And I took Mine Own Maid into the Great
Lift; and the Masters came with me, and did be in their armour; and none
did speak to me. And the Master Monstruwacan and the Master of the
Doctors stood silent to the side of me. And there did be everywhere
great Multitudes, that I did see vaguely; but my spirit not to wot of
them.

And lo! I stood very quiet and dumb as we did go upward through the
miles; and the Millions of the Cities stood about the Great Lift, and
there did be a great silence upward and downward through the strange
miles; save for the weeping of women in dear sympathy, that did sound
far and low and constant.

And presently I to know that the Master Monstruwacan and the Master of
the Doctors did look one to the other; and I to be aware sudden that I
stood in my blood; for I did be wounded in an hundred parts, and the
blood to go alway from me. Yet did the Master Doctor be slow to do aught
for me, because that he to perceive that I did be slain in the heart;
and there to be no pain so dreadful as that he should be like to wake me
unto, if that he went hastily.

Yet, presently, there did come whirlings into my head; and someone did
surely make to ease Mine Own Maid from mine arms. But I held her,
dumbly; and the blood to go the more from me; and they not to know what
should be done. And I to look at them. And the dear Master Monstruwacan
did be saying somewhat unto me, that I did have no power to hear; but
only to know that his face did be very human. And there went a strange
noise all about me; and the Master Monstruwacan to seem to hold me up,
and to beckon to some that did be to my back. And lo! there came a
blackness, and the gentleness of arms about mine armour....

And I to come presently to quietness and to half-dreams; and did alway
to seem that I carried Mine Own Maid in mine arms. But truly there did
pass three great days, whilst that I did be thus. And I all that while
to be laid quiet, and to be tended by the Master Doctor, and aided by
all knowledge that did be known of Humans.

And on the third day, as it might be called, I to come full unto my
senses; and the pain to take me in the breast; and the Master of the
Doctors did be with me, and they that nurst me; and the Master Doctor
watched me very keen and gentle.

And I did be in a bed of the Health Room of mine own city. And I gat
from the bed, and the Doctor to say naught; but only to watch me. And I
walkt to and fro a little, and he alway to watch me; and presently he
gave me somewhat to drink; and I drank. And I was gone soon from all
knowledge.

And I to come again unto a knowing that I yet to live; and there went a
certain strength in my body. And lo! the first that I did see, was the
Master of the Doctors; and I to perceive in a moment that he had wakened
me, and had nurst my strength for that moment, that I live through the
Burial. For he to be very wise, and to have known from that first seeing
of me, that I not to live after that Mine Own did die.

And there was brought to me a loose garment; but I to refuse the
garment, dumbly, and did look about me very troubled and forgetting. And
the Master Doctor lookt alway at me; and lo! in a moment he called one,
and gave an order. And there was brought in then my broken armour, and a
garment to wear below. And I then to know that I did be content in this
matter; and the Doctor alway to watch me. And they drest me in my broken
armour.

And surely, as they drest me, my spirit to hear the sorrow and sympathy
of the Multitudes, and did know that they went downward by millions,
unto the Country of Silence.

And lo! in that moment when I near to be in mine armour, I to mind
sudden again that I never to have waked to discover Mine Own Maid
kissing me in my sleep. And the Pain gat me in the breast, so that I had
surely ended then, but that the Master Doctor set somewhat to my breath,
that eased me, and gave something of dullness unto my senses for a
while.

And I did be carried then in a sling unto the Great Lift, and there did
be a bed in the lift, and the Doctor to have me to lie upon the bed; and
I to know that he also to know that I never to need a bed any more;
neither should I ever to come upward again in the Lift.

And truly the Mighty Pyramid did be an emptyness; for there did seem to
be left only the Stress Masters that did arrange the moving of the
Millions. And the Stress Masters did stand about the Lift, as we dropt
downward through the great miles unto the Underground Fields. And we
came downward in the last unto the Country of Silence, which did lie an
hundred miles deep in the world, and did be an hundred miles every way
of Silence unto the Dead.

And they that were with me, gat me from the Lift, and did mean to carry
me in the sling unto The Last Road. But I stood upon my feet, and made
that I should walk, and I held out my hand for the Diskos, which one did
carry. And the Master Doctor signed that they should obey me, as my
spirit to know. And I walkt very steadfast down the Way that did lead
unto The Last Road; and the Master Doctor walkt behind me, a little
space off.

And surely, there did be all the Peoples of the World in that great
Country; and the Peoples did be spread out forever, so far as my seeing
did go; and they to have sight of me; and all the aether did be stirred
with the humanness of their sorrow and their kind sympathy. And there
grew a murmur, which did be like to a low rolling thunder, and did be
the voices of the Peoples. And the rolling of that great husht Sound
went to and fro across that mighty Country of Quiet; and there to be
afterward an utter silence.

And I saw below me the place of the Last Rest, where did be the
beginning of The Last Road; and there did lie there a little figure,
covered with a white robe, that did glimmer with the beauteous work of
women that had stitcht love and honour into that Last Garment. And
surely, I to rock upon my feet, and to steady myself with the Diskos;
and the Master Doctor to be unto my side in a moment, and gave me again
something that I breathe-in. But, indeed, I to refuse, after that I had
taken one breath of the drug; for I to be able to bear my pain the
little time that I now to have to live; and I to mean that I have no
dimness of my senses for those short minutes that I should have yet near
unto Mine Own. And truly the Master Doctor did not press me anywise, but
had a perfect understanding, and went quiet again to the rearward.

And I came soon to that place where Mine Own Dead One did lie; and the
Master Monstruwacan stood to her feet, and did be clothed in grey
armour, and had the Diskos reversed; and this to be for an Honour unto
My Dead Maid.

And there kneeled two maids in white, one to the right and one to the
left of Mine Own, and they to be for Faithfulness, and did be maids,
because that they watched by a maid; and had likewise been matrons, if
that the Dead had been wife unto any.

And the place at the Head of the Last Rest did be empty, and did be for
me; and he that stood to the head, did be for Love; for it did be the
chief, and did hold dominion over and did make to live both Faithfulness
and Honour. And this to be the way of the Burial alway.

And lo! I took my courage into my heart; and I stood to the head of Mine
Own Maid; and I lookt down upon the wondrous white glory of the garment,
which did be white because that Mine Own did be a Maid; yet did be
worked with yellow Flowers of Weeping, as we did call them, because that
she had died in love. And I to know that no hand had toucht that
wonderful garment, save the hands of maidens.

And behold! as I stood there, from far away over the Land, there did
come a far and faint sound; and the sound did come more nigh, so that I
knew that afar off, beyond the Hills of the Babes, the Millions did
begin to sing the Calling Song, where Million did call husht unto
Million, and the sound did come onward toward where we did be, and did
go over us, and pass onward in a husht and wondrous breathing of sound,
as that all the Love that did be ever in this world, did call in a low
anguish unto a lost Beloved. And the sound to pass away and away over
that mighty Country in the deep Earth, and did hush and hush unto a
great and utter silence, save for a faint murmur of countless women
weeping, that did be in the air of that Land of Quiet.

And there to be a space of silence, and again the silence to be broken
by a far sound; and there to come again from beyond the far Hills of the
Babes a strange and low sound, and did be as of a wind wandering through
damp forests. And the sound grew, and came across the Hills of the
Babes, and did be breathed forth by Million after Million, so that in a
little I to hear the Song of Weeping sung very low and sorrowful by the
multitudes. And the Song came onward over all that great Country, and
past over us, and went onward into the far Land beyond the Dome, and did
be caught by the voices of Millions that did be hid in great distances,
and so to go onward forever, and to die at last unto a mighty silence.

And the Master Monstruwacan lookt at me from the feet of Mine Own Maid,
and I to know that the moment did be come when I to part from the Maid
Naani forever and forever, even though I to live in some strange future,
and to find her soul in some other sweet child. And I stoopt and laid
the Diskos beside Mine Own Maid there upon the Last Rest; and the two
maids drew back the light wonder of the Garment, and showed me the face
of Mine Own, and she to sleep there forever so sweet and husht as a
child, and as oft I to have seen her to sleep. And I lookt a little
while, and the pain of my heart did be sufficient, so that I knew I died
as I lookt. And once more I lookt, and I set my soul about Mine Own. And
I fought with myself, and stood upward, and the maids did cover the face
of Mine Own Maid.

And the Master Monstruwacan commended Naani unto Eternity. And he raised
the Diskos reversed; and lo! the Road did begin to move upward unto the
Dome, and Mine Own Maid did be upon the Road; and I to fight that I keep
breathing; so that I not to die before she be lost utter to my sight.

And there did rise now a sound from all that Country that had no order
in it; and did be like to a low moaning that did fill all the air of
the Land; and there to be also a constant sound, as of a little
whistling dree wind that did be in all that Country of Quiet; and truly
this to be more than any singing; for it to be the true weeping of
multitudes, that did sorrow from the heart, with the grief of this thing
that did be.

And I stood utter still, and did draw my breath very even, and lookt
unto that small form that did be now afar off where it did lie upon the
moving Roadway. And I gazed, as that my soul and all my being did have
no power else, even as a man that dies, doth set all his strength to a
last movement. And I not to wot that the Master Monstruwacan and the two
maids did hold me up, because they to perceive that I did be dying; for
I only to see Mine Own Little One lying afar off upon the moving of the
Last Road.

And the Maid in that moment to come to the place where the Road did pass
into the strange and luminous vapour of the Earth-Current, which did lie
all about the base of the Dome; and the vapour to be only as a faint
shining smoke, scarce seen, yet to be enough to give something of
uncertainty to the Dead, when that they did have past inward of it.

And I stared, with all that did be left of my strength; for Mine Own to
be gone utter and forever in but a little minute. And the uncertainty of
the luminous vapour did cling about her, and to make her to seem unreal
to my gaze; for the vapour did be in constant movement, and to give a
seeming of shifting to and fro of all that did be in it.

And behold! as I did stare, with my dreadful pain, there did be sudden a
strange hoarse noise from the nearer Millions. And lo! in an instant
there came a mighty Shout out of all that Country; and the shout did be
made again, and did grow into a mighty hoarse roaring from the Millions,
so that all that great Country did be filled with the monstrous sound.
And, in verity, I to have seen the thing, likewise; but to have set it
to the madness of longing of my heart and to that desperate and dreadful
pain which did make me to be crazed and lost from all sane thinking.

And the thing that I did see, had been that the Maid did seem to move,
there upon the Last Road, where she did lie; but indeed, this to have
appeared only to be the stirring of the luminous vapour of the
Earth-Current, which did seem to make things shift, as I have told.

And lo! I now to see truly that the Maid did move where she was laid
afar off upon the Road; and I now to know, and to believe that she did
indeed live. And my life came into me with a bounding; yet did my heart
seem to be a moment stilled in my breast. And the Master Monstruwacan to
have signed already that the Roadway be stopt, and brought backward; but
I to be now upon the Last Road, and did run as a madman, shouting vainly
upon the name of Mine Own. And I to learn afterward that there to have
been a dreadful peril that all the near Millions to rush toward the Last
Road, and so, mayhap, to have caused the death of many, and to have
been like to have crusht Mine Own. But this danger to have been eased,
because that the Watch Master did act very prompt, and set the great
regiments of his men to keep back the Millions, and did send a signal
abroad over all the Country, that there to be calmness, for that the
Maid should be succoured. And alway, whilst this to be, I did run
staggering most strangely upward of the Last Road; and surely that great
roof did ring and boom with the constant and mighty shoutings of the
Millions.

And there did run others also along the Road, to my back; but I to have
been the first, and to make a good speed, though I did stagger and rock
so strange upon my feet; and the Road alway to be moving backward under
me; and so I to be come wonderful soon unto where the Maid did be. And
she to be upon her back, and to have pusht the Garment from her face,
and did be lying with her eyes open, and a look of gentle wonderment
upon her dear face. And she then to see me, and her eyes did smile at
me, very glad and quiet; for there to be yet an utter weakness upon her.

And lo! I came with a falling beside her, and I gat upon my knees and
upon my hands, and my heart did shake my lips to dry whisperings. And
she to look weak and steadfast unto me, and I to look forever at her;
and I did alway try to say things unto her; but my mouth to refuse me.

And understanding did come into her, as a light; and she to know in that
instant that she to be truly come into the Mighty Pyramid, and I to have
gat her there somewise; and she to wake sudden in her body, and set her
hands forth all a-trembling from the Garment, and in dreadful trouble.
And I to see then that the blood did go from me, constant; and the Maid
to have perceived this thing, so that she was waked the more proper in a
moment from her death-swoon.

And surely, I did bleed very dreadful; for all my wounds did be opened
with my running. And I to have sudden power with my lips, and did say
unto her, very simple, that I loved her. And she to be all in an haze
from me; and I to know that she to have come likewise unto her knees,
and did have my head upon her breast; and there to be an utter shaking
of the air with some great sound, and a mighty spiritual stirring of the
aether of the world.

And there to be then the voice of the Master Monstruwacan very dull in
mine ears; and the low voice of the Master Doctor; but I never to hear
what they did be saying; and did know only that Mine Own Maid did live;
and I not to mean to die, but to fight unto living. And even whilst that
I made this resolving, I was gone into an utter blackness.




XVII

THE LOVE DAYS


Now, when that I gat back unto life, I to know that I went upward in the
Lift, and did be upon that same bed, where I to think I never to need a
bed any more, neither to come upward again from out of the Country of
Silence.

And I to know vague and strange, that there rose up from out of the
mighty depths of the world, the deep thunder of the Underground Organs,
and did sound as that they made a strange and utter distant music beyond
death; and there to go alway a rolling chaunting, as that multitudes did
sing beyond far mountains, and the sound to be somewhiles as a
far-blowing wind, low in the Deep; and again to come clear, and to be
that great olden melody of the Song of Honour. And I knew, as in a
dream, that the Millions in that deep Country made an Honour and a
Rejoicing over this Wonder of Joy which did be come. But yet all to be
faint and half hid from me, and mine eyes to be as that they had no
power to open, and I to seem to be lifting alway upon strange waters of
unrealness. And there to be sweet and lovely odours, and these to be of
reality, and to come from the great Fields, where the flowers did alway
to grow about the passage ways of the Lifts; for the Lift even then to
be going upward through the great miles.

And mayhap I moved a little; for there came the voice of the Master
Doctor low and gentle to me; and bid me rest; for that all did be well
with the Maid. And surely, afterward, I did be gone into an haze, and
there to be then a seeming of days in which I half to live and half to
sleep, and to wonder without trouble whether I did be dead.

And then there to come days when I lay very quiet, and had no thought of
aught; and the Master Doctor oft to bend over me in this hour and that
hour, and to look keen into my face. And in the end, after strange
spaces, there bent over me another, and there lookt down upon me the
dear and lovely face of Mine Own, and the eyes did speak love into my
soul; yet did she be calm and husht. And I to begin again to live in my
body, and I made, mayhap, a little fumbling with my hands; for she to
take and to hold them; and life to come from her to me; and she to be
ever wordless and gentle; and contentment to grow in me, and presently a
natural slumber.

And there came a day when I did be let rise, and they that tended me,
carried me to one of the Quiet Gardens of the Pyramid; and they set me
there, and did seem to leave me alone. And there came One then around a
bush, and lookt at me a moment, as with an half shyness; only that the
love that did shine in her eyes, made the shyness to be a little thing.
And, truly, I knew that it did be Mine Own Maid; but I never before to
have seen Naani drest pretty as a maid. And I lookt to her, and knew
that she did be more dainty than even I to have known. And sudden I made
that I rise to come unto her; but she to run quick to me, that she stop
me of this natural foolishness; and she then to sit beside me, and to
take my head against her breast, and she not to deny me her lips; but to
be both a maid and a mother to me in the same moment.

And afterward, she had me to be very still; and we to sit there in an
utter dumb happiness, until they that did attend me, were come again.
And the Master of the Doctors did be with them, and I to see that there
went something of satisfaction in his face.

And after that day I saw Mine Own Maid every day; and I gat better unto
health with a wondrous quickness; for Love did mend me. And soon I did
be let go downward unto the Fields; but yet to go by private ways,
because that the Multitudes should be like to follow me alway; and I to
need to be quiet.

And the Maid to be with me; for the Master Monstruwacan and the Master
of the Doctors did agree upon this matter, and had an Officer of
Marriage to wed us; and we to be married very quiet and simple; for I
yet to be over-weak for the Public Marriage, which we to have later;
when, truly, the Millions made us a Guard of Honour eight miles high,
from the top unto the bottom of the Mighty Pyramid. But this to have
been later, as I do tell, and did be a Ceremonial of the Peoples,
because that they not to be denied that they give me an Honour.

And surely the Maid to be with me alway, and did be now my wife, and my
strength to come alway upon me, and Mine Own to grow again unto a
perfect health. And, in verity, we did be now in the Love Days which do
be the most beauteous, if that the Love to be True.

And we did wander through the mighty Fields at our will, and walkt in
the Love Paths of the Fields, which did be alway anear to those places
where did be the villages. And I to hide our name, lest we to be beset
by any, out of natural curiousness and kindliness; for we to need to be
utter together and quiet.

And we to chose those places for our slumber where beauty of flowers did
be most wondrous; and we to carry somewhat of food with us; but also to
eat when we came unto the villages which did be here and there in the
Fields, which were truly so huge as Countries. And Mine Own did make
good her promise an hundred times, as you shall say, and did prepare me
a great and hearty meal; and did tease me utter that I did be a glutton,
as I did eat, and kist me, lest that I have ever a chance to say aught
in mine own defence. And truly, she did be all that my heart and my
spirit did desire; and she to have companioned me with Love, and to have
entered my spirit into Joy.

And once we to go downward unto the Country of Silence; but not to stay
very long at that time; because that my Memory did return upon me. Yet
in the after time, we to wander there oft with Memory, and Holiness of
great Thinkings, and with Love which doth hold all.

And as we to leave that Country, I to tell Mine Own how that when she
had been suspend of her life by the Horrid Force of the House, I to have
minded me with a dreadful pain that I never to have waked to discover
her kissing me when that I did sleep. And surely Mine Own Dear One did
blush most lovely, and had never known that I did be aware of her sweet
naughtiness; and she then to have all thought for mine agony, when that
she did be dead, ere the Vapour of life of the Earth-Force did set her
spirit free of the Silence.

And she to come unto me in dear understanding.

And she then to tell me that the Doctors to say that she had been, as it
were, stunned and froze of the Spirit, and all her Being and Life
suspend; and the great life-force of the Earth-Current to have waked her
spirit, and her body then to live and her blood to flow proper again.
And the Doctors had talkt much and searched much of late in the olden
Records of their Work; and they to have found somewhat of one such
happening in the olden time; but truly, naught such to have been ever
through a mighty age of years.

And whilst that we to wander and to rest in the Fields, I oft to tell
Mine Own of this matter and that matter; and I to know that she had
learned somewhat of odd things, ere I did be come to health; but not
overmuch; for she also to have been utter alack, as you shall think; and
to have come from her bed, when that I did lie so still; for the Master
Doctor to have ordained this, because he to fear that I to be going
truly to die, if that he not to do somewhat to awaken my spirit. And in
verity, you shall think upon the deepness of my Love as I to know that
she did have held my hands so brave and gentle, whilst that she to have
scarce power to her feet. And I to say a little holy praise of Mine Own.

And so do I come to mine ending; and have but one more thing that I
tell. And this to happen a while later; after that Mine Own and I had
gone through the second marriage which did be the Public Marriage. For
it did be, that one day My Wife, that did be Mine Own, did take me with
a sweet cunning unto the Hall of Honour. And surely, when I was come
there, I to see that many of the Peoples did be in that great Hall, and
did stand about in a silence; yet as that they had no meaning to do
aught; but yet to be that they did wait upon somewhat.

And My Wife did go forward with me unto the centre place of the Hall;
and sudden I saw why that she did bring me so cunning sweet; for there
did stand in the midst of the Hall of Honour, in the Place of Honour, a
Statue of a man in broken armour, that did carry a maid forever.

And I did be dumb; and how of this Age shall you to know the Honour that
this to mean in that; for it did be an Honour that was given only to the
Great Dead; and I to be but a young man, and did be so utter far off
from greatness; save that I to love with all my heart and with all my
spirit, and therefore death to be but a little thing before love. And
you to know how Love doth make sweet and brave the heart; and to have
understanding with me in my humbleness and my wonder and my natural
pride that there did any so think to honour me.

And Mine Own did be weeping with joy and honest pride of her man, beside
me. And there to be an utter silence of dear sympathy in all the great
Hall of Honour. And they that did be there, to let me go in quietness,
with Mine Own, which did be a lovely thing of understanding.

And I to go loving and thoughtful with Mine Own Wife; and she to be very
nigh to me.

And I to have gained Honour; yet to have learned that Honour doth be but
as the ash of Life, if that you not to have Love. And I to have Love.
And to have Love is to have all; for that which doth be _truly_ LOVE
doth mother Honour and Faithfulness; and they three to build the House
of Joy.
